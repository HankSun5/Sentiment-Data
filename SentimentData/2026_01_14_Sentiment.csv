According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier digital asset reached a trading price of $96,020.22 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This move represents a crucial psychological and technical threshold for the asset, fueling intense analysis and discussion across financial sectors. Consequently, this price action signals a potential new phase in the ongoing market cycle, drawing comparisons to previous bull market structures. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $96,000 Rally The ascent to $96,020.22 did not occur in isolation. Market data reveals a consistent upward trajectory over the preceding week, characterized by strong buying volume and resilient support levels. Analysts immediately scrutinized on-chain metrics for context. For instance, exchange net flows showed a notable decrease, suggesting accumulation by long-term holders rather than speculative short-term trading. Furthermore, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, a popular sentiment gauge, entered “Extreme Greed” territory, a typical characteristic of strong bullish phases. However, seasoned observers note that such readings often precede increased volatility. Several technical factors converged to enable this breakout. Firstly, Bitcoin had consolidated for several days above the key $92,000 support level, building energy for an upward move. Secondly, a decisive break above the $94,500 resistance, which had capped previous attempts, triggered a cascade of buy orders. The rally’s momentum was subsequently amplified by liquidations of leveraged short positions on major derivatives exchanges. This created a classic “short squeeze,” propelling the price higher with accelerated velocity. Comparative Market Performance Table Asset Price (USD) 24h Change Key Support Level Bitcoin (BTC) $96,020.22 +5.8% $92,000 Ethereum (ETH) $7,850.41 +4.2% $7,500 Solana (SOL) $385.67 +8.1% $350 Contextual Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a foundational role in digital asset valuations. The current rally aligns with a period of renewed institutional adoption. Major asset managers have recently expanded their spot Bitcoin ETF offerings, facilitating easier access for traditional finance capital. Simultaneously, ongoing discussions about potential central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have paradoxically heightened public and institutional interest in decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin. This institutional narrative provides a fundamentally different backdrop compared to previous retail-driven cycles. On-chain activity provides further evidence of a maturing market. The hash rate, a measure of network security and miner commitment, remains near all-time highs, indicating robust underlying infrastructure. Additionally, activity on the Bitcoin Lightning Network for small payments has grown steadily, demonstrating utility beyond pure speculation. Regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has also reduced systemic uncertainty for large investors. These factors collectively create a more stable foundation for price appreciation than in earlier, more volatile eras. Institutional Inflows: Spot Bitcoin ETFs report consistent net positive inflows for the quarter. Macro Hedge: Some investors view BTC as a hedge against potential currency devaluation. Supply Dynamics: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 continues to influence long-term supply models. Expert Perspective on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the importance of volume in validating the breakout. “A price move of this magnitude must be supported by proportional trading volume to be considered sustainable,” notes a market strategist from a leading crypto research firm. “The volume profile we observed during the climb past $96,000 was convincing, but the key test will be the formation of a new support base.” Historical data shows that after similar major breakouts, Bitcoin often experiences a period of retest and consolidation before establishing a new trading range. Market participants are now closely watching whether the $94,500-$95,000 zone can transition from resistance to support. Historical Precedents and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey past $96,000 invites comparison to previous cycles. The asset first surpassed $1,000 in 2013, $10,000 in 2017, and $60,000 in 2021. Each milestone was followed by a period of heightened volatility and eventual market revaluation. The current price places Bitcoin’s market capitalization well over $1.8 trillion, solidifying its position as a major global financial asset class. This growth trajectory reflects a compounding network effect, where increased adoption drives utility and value, which in turn drives further adoption. The path forward likely depends on several interconnected variables. Global liquidity conditions, as influenced by central bank policies, remain a primary external factor. Internally, network development progress, such as upgrades to improve scalability and privacy, will affect long-term utility perceptions. The behavior of long-term holders, often called “HODLers,” will be critical; if they begin distributing coins at these prices, it could create significant sell-side pressure. Conversely, continued holding would indicate strong conviction in even higher future valuations. Conclusion Bitcoin’s surge above $96,000 marks a definitive moment in the 2025 financial landscape. This Bitcoin price achievement is underpinned by a complex mix of technical breakout dynamics, strengthening institutional participation, and a shifting macroeconomic backdrop. While market sentiment is euphoric, historical patterns advise cautious monitoring of volatility and support levels. The BTC $96,000 level now serves as a new benchmark, setting the stage for the next chapter in digital asset evolution. Ultimately, this milestone reinforces Bitcoin’s enduring narrative as a transformative, albeit volatile, store of value and technological innovation. FAQs Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price when it crossed $96,000? According to Bitcoin World market data, BTC reached a price of $96,020.22 on the Binance USDT market during this rally. Q2: What typically happens after Bitcoin hits a major new price high? Historically, new all-time highs are often followed by increased volatility, a period of profit-taking, and an attempt to establish the previous resistance level as a new support zone. The market then seeks direction based on fresh catalysts. Q3: Are other cryptocurrencies rising alongside Bitcoin? Yes, major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) often experience correlated positive momentum during broad market rallies, though the magnitude of gains can vary based on individual asset narratives. Q4: What does “short squeeze” mean in this context? A short squeeze occurs when traders who have bet on the price falling (short positions) are forced to buy back the asset to limit their losses as the price rises rapidly. This forced buying can accelerate the upward price movement. Q5: How does the current rally compare to Bitcoin’s 2021 bull market? The current environment features greater institutional involvement through regulated ETFs, more developed market infrastructure, and a different macroeconomic setting (e.g., interest rate environment). While volatility persists, the participant base and market maturity have evolved significantly.

Kirk West, arrested last year, now claims he is a victim and is entitled to a significant portion of the very assets he is accused of stealing. This complex case, first reported by Decrypt and Rolling Stone, intertwines grief, romance, digital finance, and alleged betrayal, offering a stark lesson in crypto asset security. XRP Theft Case Takes Unexpected Legal Turn The legal saga centers on Nancy Jones, widow of the legendary singer George Jones, who passed away in 2013. According to court documents, Kirk West approached Nancy Jones after her husband’s death, initially expressing interest in purchasing the Jones family home. Subsequently, the two began a romantic relationship. West reportedly presented himself as a cryptocurrency investment expert during this time. The relationship ultimately soured, leading Nancy Jones to ask West to leave her home in early 2023. Following his departure, Nancy Jones made a distressing discovery. Her Ledger hardware wallet, a device used to securely store the private keys to her cryptocurrency holdings, was missing from a safe. This discovery triggered a legal and criminal investigation. Authorities arrested West on charges of stealing $400,000 in cash and 5.5 million XRP. At the time of the alleged theft, the XRP was worth approximately $11.6 million. Countersuit Alleges Fraud and Defamation In a dramatic reversal, Kirk West has now filed a civil countersuit against Nancy Jones. His legal claim presents a completely different narrative of the events. West alleges that his sound financial and cryptocurrency investment decisions were instrumental in building joint wealth during his relationship with Jones. Consequently, he argues he is entitled to half of the assets in question. West’s lawsuit frames him as a victim of fraud and defamation. He is seeking not just a portion of the contested XRP but also other substantial assets. His claim specifically includes: Approximately 483,000 XRP (currently valued over $1 million) still unrecovered. $5 million in gold and silver bullion and coins. $1 million in cash . Other precious metals and assets. This legal move complicates the ongoing criminal proceedings and introduces a contentious civil dispute over asset ownership. Cryptocurrency Security and Inheritance Challenges This case highlights critical, real-world issues at the intersection of cryptocurrency, estate planning, and personal security. Hardware wallets like Ledger are considered among the most secure methods for storing crypto assets because they keep private keys offline. However, their physical nature makes them susceptible to traditional theft if not stored in a truly secure location, such as a safety deposit box. Furthermore, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency valuations adds another layer of complexity. The 5.5 million XRP alleged to have been stolen was worth $11.6 million at the time but has fluctuated significantly since. Through prior legal action, Nancy Jones has recovered over five million XRP, but the remaining 483,000 XRP underscores the challenge of tracing and recovering digital assets once they move across the blockchain. Timeline of a High-Stakes Dispute Understanding the sequence of events is crucial for contextualizing this legal battle. The following timeline outlines the key milestones: Year Event 2013 Country music legend George Jones passes away. Post-2013 Kirk West approaches widow Nancy Jones; a romantic relationship begins. 2023 Relationship ends; West leaves the home; missing hardware wallet discovered. 2023 West arrested on charges of stealing cash and XRP worth ~$12M. 2023-2024 Nancy Jones recovers over 5 million XRP through legal channels. 2024 Kirk West files a countersuit claiming fraud, defamation, and asset rights. This timeline shows a relationship that spanned nearly a decade before deteriorating into serious criminal allegations and complex civil litigation. Broader Impact on Crypto and Legal Precedent This case is being closely watched by both the legal and cryptocurrency communities. It touches on several evolving areas of law. First, it tests how traditional concepts of theft, joint assets, and fiduciary duty apply to digital currencies like XRP. Second, the countersuit’s success or failure could set a precedent for how disputes over co-mingled cryptocurrency assets are adjudicated, especially when one party claims expertise. Experts in digital asset law note that cases like this emphasize the importance of clear, formal agreements for individuals managing crypto investments for others, even in personal relationships. The lack of such documentation often leads to protracted “he said, she said” legal battles. Additionally, the high-profile nature of the case, involving a celebrity widow, brings mainstream attention to the very real risks and complexities of cryptocurrency ownership and security. Conclusion The XRP theft case involving Nancy Jones and Kirk West has evolved from a straightforward allegation of cryptocurrency theft into a multifaceted legal war. With West’s shocking countersuit claiming fraud and a right to shared assets, the courts must now untangle deeply personal and financial histories. This case serves as a critical, high-stakes example of the intersection between digital finance and human relationships. Its outcome will not only determine the fate of millions in XRP and other assets but may also influence how similar disputes are handled in the future, underscoring the paramount importance of security and clear financial boundaries in the digital age. FAQs Q1: What is Kirk West accused of stealing from Nancy Jones? Kirk West was arrested and charged with stealing $400,000 in cash and 5.5 million XRP, a cryptocurrency, from Nancy Jones. The XRP was valued at approximately $11.6 million at the time of the alleged theft. Q2: What is Kirk West claiming in his new lawsuit? In his countersuit, Kirk West claims he is a victim of fraud and defamation. He alleges that his investment expertise helped build joint wealth during his relationship with Nancy Jones and that he is therefore entitled to half of the disputed assets, including cryptocurrency, cash, and precious metals. Q3: How much XRP has been recovered so far? Through legal action, Nancy Jones has recovered over five million of the 5.5 million XRP initially alleged to be stolen. Approximately 483,000 XRP, worth over $1 million at current prices, remains unrecovered. Q4: Why is this case significant for cryptocurrency owners? This case highlights the physical security risks of hardware wallets, the challenges of recovering stolen digital assets, and the legal complexities that can arise when cryptocurrency is involved in personal relationships without clear agreements. It underscores the need for robust security and formal financial planning with digital assets. Q5: What is a Ledger hardware wallet? A Ledger hardware wallet is a physical device that stores the private keys to cryptocurrency holdings offline. It is designed to be highly secure against online hacking attempts. However, as a physical object, it can be vulnerable to traditional theft if not stored in a secure location like a bank safety deposit box.

57140392,https://timestabloid.com/?p=94883,1768347056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto Investor: How Much XRP is Actually Enough?,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-investor-how-much-xrp-is-actually-enough/,"Discussions around how much XRP is sufficient for a long-term portfolio continue to surface within the XRP community, particularly as the asset’s price has increased significantly compared to its early years. One recent contribution to this conversation came from community commentator Oscar Ramos, who addressed the topic by emphasizing that there is no universal standard for an ideal XRP holding. Instead, he argued that appropriate allocation depends on individual financial capacity, timing, and personal investment objectives. Ramos explained that many early XRP participants were able to build sizable positions primarily because they entered the market when prices were substantially lower. During periods when XRP traded below $1, accumulating large quantities required far less capital than it does today. This historical context, he suggested, often creates unrealistic comparisons between early adopters and newer investors who face higher entry costs. How Much XRP is actually Enough? My take, never 50 cents again. pic.twitter.com/pTBi7BWotp — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) January 12, 2026 Early Accumulation Versus Current Market Reality To illustrate his point, Ramos referenced his own experience, noting that he accumulated a significant XRP position when prices were near $0.50 . At those levels, reaching a six-figure token balance required a capital commitment that, while still substantial, was far more accessible than it would be under current conditions. With XRP now trading around $2.07, achieving the same number of tokens would require more than four times the original investment. This comparison highlights how price appreciation alters perceptions of what constitutes a reasonable or attainable holding. A portfolio size that once appeared achievable may now seem out of reach for many market participants, not due to lack of conviction, but because of increased capital requirements. Cost Basis as a Key Influencing Factor According to Ramos, an investor’s cost basis plays a major role in shaping opinions about what amount of XRP is enough. Holdings that appear large today often reflect favorable entry points rather than extraordinary purchasing power. As XRP continues to mature and prices trend higher, the challenge of accumulating large quantities is likely to increase, reinforcing the importance of timing in long-term investment outcomes. He emphasized that newer investors should avoid anchoring their expectations to the experiences of those who entered the market years earlier. Market conditions evolve, and strategies that were viable in the past may not translate directly to the present environment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Personal Financial Capacity Over Community Benchmarks Rather than promoting a fixed numerical target, Ramos encouraged investors to determine their XRP exposure based on personal financial comfort and risk tolerance. He rejected the notion that portfolio size should function as a status symbol within the community, echoing similar views previously expressed by other XRP commentators. From this perspective, long-term success is more closely tied to disciplined strategy and informed decision-making than to matching the holdings of early adopters. He further noted that market participants enter at different stages of an asset’s lifecycle, and comparisons across entry points can be misleading. What matters most is whether an investment aligns with an individual’s broader financial plan. Broader Community Perspectives Ramos’s comments align with a range of opinions shared by other XRP-focused analysts over the past market cycle. Some observers have highlighted that relatively modest XRP holdings still place wallets high within distribution rankings, while others have outlined larger benchmarks for investors seeking greater exposure. These differing views underscore that holding targets are inherently subjective and shaped by assumptions about XRP’s future performance. While many community figures remain optimistic about XRP’s long-term potential, Ramos and others stress that accumulation decisions should not be driven solely by bullish expectations. Price appreciation is never guaranteed, and investors should evaluate risks carefully before committing capital. Ultimately, determining how much XRP is sufficient is a personal calculation that balances opportunity, affordability, and individual financial goals rather than adherence to any single benchmark.

Standard Chartered Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoffrey Kendrich, argues that Ethereum has found deeper relevance in this institution-led market cycle.

And Ethereum’s growing exposure could fuel it. Exchange-traded products and corporate treasury vehicles have created multiple touch points for demand in mainstream TradFi markets, making capital access broader and more persistent than in previous cycles. These drivers position 2026 as a year where adoption, sentiment, and capital flows converge, a backdrop Kendrick believes could mirror 2021-style outperformance, when the BTC-ETH ratio was around 0.08.

Ultimately, Kendrick remains conservative with his mid-term Ethereum price target of $7,500 in 2026, but increasingly bullish on its long-term potential of $40,000 set for 2030. A two and a half year ascending channel could reveal how it plays out, with the past year forming a bullish head-and-shoulders pattern that sets up its breakout.

The Ethereum price has confirmed a local bottom at $2,750, forming higher lows in a fresh uptrend that solidifies the right shoulder. Momentum indicators add validity to the trend. The RSI is compressing against the 50 neutral line after several higher lows, suggesting strength beneath the surface. The MACD has also reversed towards the signal line in a potential golden cross setup, a sign that buyers may soon control the prevailing trend. A fully realized right shoulder targets the key breakout of the channel, past all-time highs around $4,950. With a channel breakout to follow, Kendrick’s 2028 expectations could be in focus at $18,000 – a 460% gain . But for 2026, the breakout path could see conservative targets surpassed, eying the $10,000 milestone for a 220% gain . Though this outcome likely hinges on traditional financial activity moving on-chain and expanding regulation outside of U.S. markets. However, a $100,000 Ethereum price is likely to be realized in the next decade if Ethereum infrastructure establishes itself for real-world use cases. Bitcoin Hyper: Bitcoin Can’t Be Ruled Out Just Yet Institutions that chose Ethereum as their TradFi bet may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech , creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Just Layer-2s like Ondo did for Ethereum, Bitcoin Hyper could bring Bitcoin deeper into the DeFi conversation. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale , and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

57140877,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261280,1768348511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stablecoin Interest Ban: Senate Republicans Forge Critical Compromise Amid Legislative Battle,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/senate-republicans-stablecoin-interest-ban/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Interest Ban: Senate Republicans Forge Critical Compromise Amid Legislative Battle WASHINGTON, D.C. – March 2025: Senate Republicans have forged a critical compromise on a provision that would restrict interest payments in the landmark stablecoin bill, marking a significant development in the years-long legislative battle over digital asset regulation. This breakthrough follows months of intense negotiations and could potentially reshape how stablecoins operate within the United States financial system. The compromise represents a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency legislation that has faced numerous obstacles since its initial proposal. Stablecoin Interest Ban Compromise Reached According to a recent post on X by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, Senate Republicans have reached agreement on the controversial stablecoin interest ban provision. This development comes after weeks of internal debate within Republican ranks about how to approach interest-bearing stablecoins. Terrett, a respected journalist covering digital asset policy, noted that some Democratic offices remain dissatisfied with the compromise terms. Consequently, the legislative path forward remains uncertain despite this Republican consensus. The compromise reportedly addresses concerns about consumer protection while attempting to preserve innovation in the digital asset space. Legislative staffers have worked extensively to balance these competing priorities. However, Terrett emphasized that it remains unconfirmed whether this compromise language has been incorporated into the final legislative text. The bill’s sponsors continue to negotiate with Democratic counterparts to achieve broader bipartisan support. Background of Stablecoin Legislation The stablecoin bill represents one of the most significant attempts to regulate digital assets in United States history. Lawmakers first introduced comprehensive stablecoin legislation in 2022 following the TerraUSD collapse. That event highlighted systemic risks within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Since then, multiple congressional committees have held hearings, drafted proposals, and debated appropriate regulatory frameworks. Key provisions in the current draft legislation include: Issuer requirements: Mandating specific capital and reserve standards Consumer protections: Establishing disclosure and transparency rules State vs. federal oversight: Determining regulatory jurisdiction Interest payment restrictions: The subject of the current compromise The interest payment provision has proven particularly contentious. Some lawmakers argue that interest-bearing stablecoins resemble unregulated securities. Others contend that reasonable interest payments represent legitimate financial innovation. This debate mirrors broader discussions about how to classify and regulate various digital assets. Expert Analysis of the Compromise Financial regulation experts note that the Republican compromise likely attempts to distinguish between different types of interest mechanisms. According to Dr. Marcus Chen, Professor of Financial Technology at Georgetown University, “The compromise probably creates a regulatory distinction between algorithmic yield and traditional interest payments. This distinction could allow certain stablecoin models to continue operating while restricting others.” Industry representatives have expressed cautious optimism about the development. Sarah Johnson, Director of Policy at the Digital Asset Alliance, stated, “While we haven’t seen the specific language, any movement toward clarity represents progress. The industry needs regulatory certainty to innovate responsibly.” However, consumer advocacy groups remain concerned about potential loopholes in any compromise language. Political Dynamics and Democratic Opposition Despite Republican agreement, Democratic offices reportedly maintain significant reservations about the compromise. According to multiple sources familiar with the negotiations, key Democratic senators worry that the compromise doesn’t provide adequate consumer protections. These concerns center on potential risks to retail investors who might not understand the complexities of interest-bearing digital assets. The political landscape complicates the legislative process further. With control of Congress divided between parties, bipartisan support becomes essential for passage. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office has been particularly vocal about strengthening consumer protections in digital asset legislation. Meanwhile, more moderate Democrats seek balanced approaches that don’t stifle technological innovation. This dynamic creates a challenging negotiation environment. Legislative staffers must bridge significant policy differences while maintaining political viability. The upcoming election cycle adds additional pressure to either pass legislation quickly or delay until the next congressional session. Market Implications and Industry Response The cryptocurrency market has closely monitored stablecoin legislation developments. Major stablecoin issuers like Circle (USDC) and Tether (USDT) operate significant portions of their business within United States jurisdictions. Regulatory clarity could significantly impact their operations and market positions. Industry analysts suggest that clear regulations might actually benefit established players by creating barriers to entry. Market participants have expressed mixed reactions to news of the Republican compromise. Some view it as a positive step toward regulatory certainty. Others worry that interest restrictions might limit innovation and competitive offerings. The table below summarizes potential market impacts: Scenario Potential Market Impact Full interest ban Reduced stablecoin yields, possible market contraction Partial restrictions Continued innovation with guardrails, moderate growth No restrictions Maximum innovation potential, increased regulatory risk Regulatory uncertainty continues Market volatility, reduced institutional participation International considerations further complicate the regulatory landscape. Other jurisdictions, including the European Union and United Kingdom, have implemented their own stablecoin regulations. United States policymakers must consider global competitiveness while ensuring financial stability. This balance proves particularly challenging in fast-moving technological sectors. Historical Context and Legislative Timeline The current stablecoin legislation represents the culmination of years of congressional attention to digital assets. The legislative journey began in earnest after the 2021 President’s Working Group report on stablecoins. That report highlighted risks and recommended congressional action. Since then, multiple committees have developed competing proposals. Key milestones in stablecoin legislation include: July 2022: House Financial Services Committee advances first comprehensive bill September 2023: Senate Banking Committee holds series of stablecoin hearings January 2024: Bipartisan working group forms to negotiate compromise November 2024: Draft legislation circulates with interest restriction provisions March 2025: Republican compromise reached on interest payments This timeline demonstrates the complex, multi-year process of developing financial legislation. The technical nature of digital assets adds additional complexity to traditional legislative processes. Staffers with specialized knowledge in both technology and finance have become increasingly valuable during these negotiations. Conclusion Senate Republicans have reached a significant compromise on the stablecoin interest ban provision, marking a potential turning point in digital asset legislation. However, Democratic dissatisfaction and ongoing negotiations mean the final outcome remains uncertain. The stablecoin interest ban compromise represents just one piece of a larger regulatory puzzle that lawmakers must solve. Market participants, consumers, and innovators await final legislative language with keen interest. The coming weeks will determine whether this compromise becomes law or requires further modification. Regardless of the immediate outcome, the legislative process highlights growing recognition of digital assets’ importance in modern finance. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the stablecoin interest ban compromise involve? The specific language remains confidential, but it likely creates distinctions between different types of interest mechanisms on stablecoins, potentially allowing some models while restricting others based on their risk profiles and structures. Q2: Why are some Democratic offices dissatisfied with the Republican compromise? Democratic lawmakers reportedly believe the compromise doesn’t provide sufficient consumer protections, particularly regarding retail investors who might not fully understand the risks associated with interest-bearing digital assets. Q3: How might this legislation affect existing stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether? Established issuers would need to adjust their operations to comply with new regulations, which could involve changing their interest payment structures or reserve requirements, potentially affecting their competitive positions. Q4: What happens if Congress doesn’t pass stablecoin legislation this session? Regulatory uncertainty would continue, potentially leading to increased state-level regulation, continued enforcement actions by federal agencies, and possible market volatility as participants operate without clear federal guidelines. Q5: How does United States stablecoin regulation compare to other countries? The European Union has implemented comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, while the United Kingdom has proposed its own framework. United States legislation attempts to balance similar consumer protection goals with innovation considerations.

XRP commentator Zach Rector described the progress as “massive for XRP,” highlighting the potential impact of the upcoming protocol enhancements. The discussion was sparked by a post from XRPL validator Vet, who shared updates on the ongoing development of the XRPL lending protocol. At the center of this effort is Ripple engineer Ed Hennis, leading work on XLS-66, a proposal designed to implement fixed-term lending directly on the ledger. Rector suggested that this evolution could significantly broaden XRP’s utility beyond its established payment use cases. Protocol Update and GitHub Progress Vet emphasized a recent GitHub merge, PR #6161, which refines XLS-66’s lending code. The update does not alter the protocol’s functionality but optimizes the implementation for efficiency and maintainability. Ed Hennis is cooking with the upcoming lending protocol for the XRP Ledger. pic.twitter.com/1oSXY6zyzm — Vet (@Vet_X0) January 12, 2026 The changes remove redundant code and improve processing efficiency, correct typographical errors, eliminate unused variables, simplify loan withdrawal and balance logic, and enhance documentation to align more closely with the XLS-66 specification. These improvements strengthen the foundational code, preparing XRPL’s lending functions for a smoother transition toward production readiness. Key Features of XLS-66 XLS-66 is designed to support uncollateralized, fixed-term loans with predetermined interest rates using pooled liquidity in on-chain vaults. Unlike most DeFi protocols that rely on overcollateralization, this approach allows predictable repayment schedules and interest structures. Borrowers can benefit from grace periods and are subject to penalties for late payments, while early repayment and overpayment are also supported. The system incorporates first-loss protection to reduce lender risk and provides full on-chain transparency without requiring custom smart contracts. By enabling these functions, XRPL could host structured credit markets using XRP and Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, expanding the ledger’s applications beyond traditional payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Integration With RippleX Framework XLS-66 builds on the previously proposed XLS-65 standard, which introduces Single Asset Vaults. These vaults pool deposits from multiple users while restricting each vault to a single asset, reducing cross-asset risk. XLS-66 layers lending capabilities atop these vaults, facilitating institutional-style credit issuance on-chain. While underwriting remains off-chain, enforcement occurs directly on the ledger, combining the security of on-chain settlement with institutional credit management practices. Implications for the XRP Community For over a decade, XRPL’s development has primarily focused on fast, low-cost, and reliable payments. Although this approach established XRP’s reputation in cross-border transactions , it limited the ledger’s competitiveness in DeFi markets. The addition of native lending represents a shift toward broader financial functionality. By embedding credit operations into the protocol, XRPL aims to increase liquidity, strengthen utility, and create new opportunities for institutional finance use cases. This context clarifies why XLS-66’s progress has attracted strong attention. Community members and observers see the update as an important step that positions XRP to play a larger role in on-chain credit markets, signaling a strategic evolution of the ledger’s capabilities.

The bill is being filed as the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act , a name that also appears in earlier House paperwork filed last year. Crypto: Bill Aims To Protect Non-Custodial Developers The draft would create a safe harbor for developers who do not control user funds, making liability turn on actual custody or control of assets rather than on the act of creating software. That change would mean node operators, protocol maintainers, and many open-source coders could avoid money-transmitter rules so long as they do not hold or direct users’ tokens. Writing code is not the same as controlling money and developers who build blockchain infrastructure without touching user funds shouldn’t be treated like banks. @RonWyden and I are ensuring that won’t happen. pic.twitter.com/9zIgh07e0b — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 12, 2026 Industry Pressure And A History Of Concern Reports have disclosed months of lobbying from exchanges, developer groups, and advocacy coalitions that urged lawmakers to clarify this point. Those groups warned that without clear language, developers could face licensing and enforcement risks that would chill US-based development. The House version of the measure first appeared in May last year and set out similar safe-harbor text. Senate Markup Delayed As Negotiations Continue Lawmakers have paused a larger Senate market-structure push while they work through a range of open issues, including stablecoin policy and yield rules. With that broader package pushed later into the month, sponsors moved the developer protections into a standalone bill to give that issue its own spotlight. Reports suggests the pause means Congress may act on the developer language sooner than the full market bill. What Developers And Advocates Are Saying Some protocol teams and industry lawyers welcomed the step as a much-needed clarification, saying it would reduce legal uncertainty for projects that do not custody funds. Others urged care, noting that clear definitions will be crucial to prevent loopholes and to make sure bad actors cannot hide behind the safe harbor. Coverage indicates sponsors emphasized the bill’s goal is narrow: protect those who build and maintain, not those who handle other people’s assets. The proposal for a separate law is being introduced while there are still many uncertainties surrounding how cryptocurrencies will be regulated in the US. In the latter part of 2025 and into 2026, the crypto sector has demonstrated that it has a great deal of clout within political circles in Washington D.C. There has been a significant increase in lobbying by large crypto-related businesses as legislators review various options for regulating this industry. Several reports have linked the current political environment to the legislative actions taken to regulate crypto in Congress, as well as how interest in legislative action has increased due to Trump’s administration.

Potential Bitcoin Return To $100,000 Nic Puckrin, a digital asset analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau, commented on the recent price movements, suggesting that the uptick is more likely a reflexive response from investors who are rebalancing their portfolios after last year’s heavy sell-off, rather than an indication of a fundamental trend shift. “The bounce in Bitcoin we’re seeing this week is most likely a reflexive move by investors rather than something indicative of a major shift in trend,” Puckrin explained. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Currently, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain momentum after rejecting the $94,700 resistance level. Puckrin warns that a failure to break through this barrier could lead to another decline in value. However, if BTC does breach this resistance, he believes a return to the $100,000 level may be achievable. Looking further ahead, Puckrin anticipates another all-time high in 2026, although he advises caution regarding the extent of that potential rise. “In the longer term, I expect to see another all-time high this year, but it won’t be as dramatic as some are predicting, and the possibility of a reversal into bear territory remains very real,” he added. Key Resistance Level Contrasting this optimism, some analysts express skepticism about Bitcoin’s immediate prospects. Vince Stanzione, CEO and founder of First Information, maintains a bearish outlook, arguing that the risk-reward ratio at current prices is unappealing. Stanzione evaluates Bitcoin against gold rather than the dollar, asserting that Bitcoin has considerable ground to cover. “I was negative on Bitcoin throughout 2025, and I’m sticking with that view in 2026,” he noted. He pointed out that while the market’s leading cryptocurrency experienced a decline of about 6% by the end of 2025, gold surged by 66%, resulting in a significant disparity in performance. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Stanzione believes gold will continue to outperform Bitcoin this year, predicting that the digital asset will close the year at a lower price. “There are no compelling reasons to buy Bitcoin at the current $92,000 level,” he stated. Meanwhile, market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a crucial price level for Bitcoin in the short term, stating on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that $94,555 is the “bullish trigger” for the cryptocurrency. Should Bitcoin break through this level, Martinez indicated that the next target could be $105,291, representing a potential 12% increase. This move would significantly narrow the gap to the all-time high of over $126,000 reached last October.

This crucial legislation specifically aims to establish a legal framework for a won-pegged stablecoin by March 2025, potentially reshaping the nation’s digital economy. The closed-door meeting represents the culmination of months of deliberation, with the eligibility criteria for stablecoin issuers emerging as the final, significant hurdle. Won Stablecoin Framework Nears Legislative Completion According to a January 14 report from DataNews, financial authorities and the Democratic Party’s digital asset task force will convene to resolve the remaining disputes. The proposed Digital Asset Basic Act represents South Korea’s most comprehensive attempt to regulate digital assets since the market’s explosive growth. Consequently, this legislation could set a precedent for other Asian economies exploring central bank digital currencies and private stablecoins. The government’s March deadline underscores the urgency regulators attach to establishing market order and consumer protection. Financial Services Commission (FSC) officials consistently emphasize market stability as their paramount concern. Their preferred model involves granting initial issuance rights exclusively to consortiums where a traditional bank maintains a majority stake exceeding 50%. This bank-led approach, regulators argue, would leverage existing financial infrastructure, risk management protocols, and public trust. Furthermore, it aligns with global financial stability recommendations from bodies like the Financial Stability Board and the Bank for International Settlements. The Core Conflict: Bank Control Versus Innovation The Democratic Party’s digital asset task force, however, expresses strong opposition to this restrictive structure. Lawmakers and their advisors worry that excessive bank control could stifle innovation and concentrate power within traditional financial institutions. They advocate for a more inclusive framework that could allow regulated fintech companies or specially licensed digital asset firms to participate. This philosophical divide between conservative stability and progressive innovation defines the current debate. Analyzing the South Korean Stablecoin Regulatory Landscape South Korea’s move follows a global trend of nations seeking to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like fiat currency. The country’s approach appears more cautious than some jurisdictions but more proactive than others. For instance, Japan has already implemented a registration system for stablecoin issuers, while the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides a comprehensive regional framework. The potential impacts of this legislation are multifaceted: Market Legitimization: A regulated won stablecoin could attract institutional investment and integrate digital assets with traditional finance. Consumer Protection: Clear rules would reduce fraud risks associated with unbacked or poorly managed stablecoins. Payment System Evolution: A digital won could streamline cross-border payments and domestic transactions. Technological Advancement: The legislation could spur blockchain development in banking and financial services. Comparison of Stablecoin Regulatory Approaches (2025) Jurisdiction Key Model Issuer Eligibility Status South Korea Bank-led Consortium (Proposed) Banks with >50% stake Legislation Pending Japan Registration System Banks, Trust Companies, Registered Funds Implemented European Union MiCA Framework Licensed Credit Institutions or E-Money Institutions Implemented Singapore Single-Currency Peg Requirement Banks with Full Banking License Implemented Historical Context and Global Precedents South Korea’s journey toward digital asset regulation began in earnest after the cryptocurrency market turbulence of 2022. The collapse of several algorithmic stablecoins, most notably TerraUSD (UST) which had strong Korean connections, highlighted systemic risks. Subsequently, the government established multiple task forces and conducted extensive consultations with industry stakeholders, academics, and international regulators. This January 20 meeting therefore represents the final legislative step in a multi-year process. Expert analysis suggests the bank-led model draws inspiration from Singapore’s stringent approach, where only fully licensed banks can issue major stablecoins. Conversely, the Democratic Party’s position reflects concerns heard in European debates about maintaining competition. Financial technology experts note that whichever model prevails will significantly influence whether South Korea becomes a cautious follower or an innovative leader in the digital asset space. Economic Implications and Market Reactions The banking sector has generally welcomed the regulators’ conservative proposal. Major Korean banks like KB Kookmin, Shinhan, and Hana possess the capital reserves and regulatory experience to manage stablecoin issuance. However, blockchain associations and cryptocurrency exchanges argue that excluding native crypto firms could disadvantage South Korea in the global digital economy. Market observers will closely watch the January 20 outcome, as it will determine investment flows and strategic partnerships in East Asia’s competitive fintech landscape. Conclusion The January 20 meeting between South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party and financial regulators will decisively shape the future of the won stablecoin and the broader Digital Asset Basic Act. The resolution of the issuer eligibility debate will determine whether stability or innovation receives greater emphasis in South Korea’s digital financial framework. This legislation, expected by March 2025, will establish crucial guardrails for one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets. Ultimately, the finalized won stablecoin bill will influence not only domestic finance but also regional approaches to digital asset regulation. FAQs Q1: What is the main purpose of South Korea’s Digital Asset Basic Act? The primary purpose is to establish comprehensive legal frameworks for digital assets, with immediate focus on creating regulated, won-pegged stablecoins to ensure market stability and consumer protection. Q2: Why do financial regulators prefer bank-led consortiums for stablecoin issuance? Regulators cite market stability concerns, arguing that banks have established risk management systems, regulatory compliance experience, and public trust that newer fintech companies may lack, reducing systemic risk. Q3: What is the Democratic Party’s main objection to the bank-led model? The party’s digital asset task force worries that restricting issuance to bank-majority consortiums could stifle innovation, reduce competition, and prevent specialized blockchain firms from contributing their technical expertise. Q4: How does South Korea’s approach compare to Japan’s stablecoin regulations? Japan implemented earlier regulations allowing banks, trust companies, and registered funds to issue stablecoins, while South Korea’s proposed rules appear more restrictive by potentially requiring bank majority control in issuing consortiums. Q5: When will the won stablecoin legislation take effect if passed? The government aims to have the Digital Asset Basic Act, including provisions for won stablecoins, finalized by the January 20 meeting and formally legislated by March 2025, with implementation likely following shortly after.

Semler Scientific stockholders gave their blessings by voting in support of the acquisition, which Strive’s executives have called the first acquisition of a publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. The transaction will add Semler Scientific’s 5,048.1 Bitcoins to Strive’s existing holdings of 7,749.8 BTC, bringing the combined entity’s total to 12,797.9 BTC. The merged company will become the 11th largest corporate holder of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency globally. Strive also announced that it had purchased 123 Bitcoins for its corporate treasury at an average price of $91,561 per coin, all of which is worth over $11.2 million, and this includes fees and expenses. The deal comes as Ramaswamy pivots back to the private sector following his brief tenure as co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The entrepreneur resigned from the position on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025, after reported tensions with Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk over the department’s vision and approach. Ramaswamy, who co-founded Strive in 2022, is now pursuing a bid for Ohio governor in the 2026 election. Strive manages over $2 billion in assets through its wholly owned subsidiary, Strive Asset Management, an SEC-registered investment adviser that launched its first exchange-traded fund in August 2022. What is Strive’s plan for Semler Scientific? Matt Cole, chairman and CEO of Strive, said, “The Semler Scientific deal will continue Strive’s leading yield generation since inception of our Bitcoin strategy, boosting our 2026 1st quarter Bitcoin yield to over 15%, and is a win for both Strive and Semler Scientific shareholders,” while adding that they are showing the market how to execute with Bitcoin as the hurdle rate. In the announcement, it was also disclosed that Strive has outlined plans to monetize Semler Scientific’s operating healthcare business within 12 months of closing the transaction. The company also intends to pursue opportunities to retire Semler’s $100 million convertible note and $20 million Coinbase loan while taking into account the market conditions. Semler Scientific , which develops FDA-cleared medical devices, including its flagship QuantaFlo test for early detection of peripheral arterial disease, was among the first US public companies to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. The company accumulated its digital holdings through equity and debt financing as well as operating cash flows. Preferred equity strategy gains traction The acquisition follows Strive’s successful November 2025 initial public offering (IPO) of its perpetual preferred equity instrument, known as SATA. The company increased the IPO from $125 million to $200 million after the offering was more than twice oversubscribed. Following the IPO, Strive received unsolicited demand inquiries for over $100 million in additional preferred equity issuance. Jeff Walton, the firm’s chief risk officer, said the SATA instrument offers investors a differentiated risk profile. According to Walton, “the balance sheet is comprised of a transparent, digitally native asset, allowing risk to be observed and measured in real time, compared to more traditional balance sheets comprised of illiquid physical risks.” The company plans to issue more SATA shares over the next 12 months to fund its strategy of retiring Semler Scientific’s legacy debt while maintaining amplification exclusively through preferred equity rather than traditional debt financing. Along with the merger, Strive’s board approved a 1-20 reverse stock split for shares of the Class A and Class B common stock of the combined company. Ben Werkman, chief investment officer, stated, “This proactive reverse split aligns our share price with institutional participation standards and opens our stock to a wider universe of investors.” How is the market reacting? The market did not react to the news with enthusiasm, as the shares of both companies fell following the announcement. Strive’s stock dropped more than 11%, while Semler Scientific declined by over 9%. The transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks. Upon completion, Semler Scientific executive chairman Eric Semler will join Strive’s board of directors. Public companies now hold nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply.

Spain’s laws against unlawful AI use include exceptions for creative content involving public figures that are clearly labeled as AI generated. Other countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have also made moves to prevent the spread of inappropriate AI generated content. What are Spain’s laws regarding deepfakes? Spain’s cabinet has approved a draft legislation that establishes new consent requirements for digital images and AI deepfakes. The legislation will strengthen protections for minors and establish 16 as the minimum age at which individuals can consent to the use of their own image. This law directly addresses concerns about children’s digital safety in an era where AI tools can easily manipulate or replicate personal content. Justice Minister Felix Bolanos stated that individuals sharing their personal or family images on social media does not give others the freedom to use those images as they like. The law includes exceptions for creative, satirical, or fictional uses. For instance, content involving public figures will remain permissible, provided the content is clearly identified as AI-generated. New EU rules also require all member states to criminalize non-consensual sexual deepfakes by 2027. Are deepfakes legal in Spain? Elon Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok, has recently faced investigations over sexually explicit deepfake images. As Cryptopolitan reported last week, Grok ran into trouble generating roughly one non-consensual sexualized image per minute at its peak, placing women and minors in revealing poses or removing clothing from uploaded photos. During the incident earlier this month, the Spanish government requested that prosecutors determine whether certain AI-generated content could be considered as child pornography. Before becoming law, the draft will go through consultations with stakeholders and then return to the government for final approval before it is submitted to parliament. Aside from Spain, Indonesia and Malaysia have also taken action against Grok after it generated thousands of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes, including images of children. Both countries were the first to completely block the chatbot. The UK’s media regulator Ofcom is launching a formal investigation into the incident that could result in fines up to 10% of X’s global revenue or a complete ban.

According to data from the analytics platform Onchain Lens, this address staked an additional 92,160 ETH on March 15, 2025. This substantial move, valued at approximately $293 million, represents one of the largest single staking actions recorded this year. Consequently, the address now controls a staggering 1,436,384 staked ETH. This position carries a total value of $4.77 billion at current market rates. Bitmine’s Expanding Ethereum Staking Position The recent transaction dramatically increases Bitmine’s already substantial presence within the Ethereum staking ecosystem. Initially, the address began accumulating staked ETH positions in early 2023. Since that time, it has methodically increased its holdings through periodic, large-scale deposits. This latest addition of 92,160 ETH follows a pattern of strategic accumulation rather than sporadic investment. Onchain analysts note the transaction occurred during a period of relative price stability for Ethereum. This timing suggests a long-term confidence strategy rather than short-term market timing. Ethereum staking involves locking cryptocurrency to support network security and operations. Validators who stake ETH help process transactions and create new blocks. In return, they earn rewards typically ranging from 3% to 5% annually. The Ethereum network currently has over 32 million ETH staked. This represents roughly 26% of the total supply. Bitmine’s position now constitutes approximately 4.5% of all staked ETH. This scale grants the entity significant influence within the validator community. The Mechanics and Scale of Institutional Staking Institutional staking operations differ substantially from individual participation. Entities like Bitmine typically utilize sophisticated infrastructure and multiple validator nodes. They often employ dedicated security teams and geographic distribution for their operations. The scale of this latest transaction—92,160 ETH—equates to funding 2,880 individual validator nodes at the standard 32 ETH requirement. Running this many nodes requires substantial technical resources and coordination. The following table illustrates the growth of this specific address’s staked position over recent quarters: Time Period ETH Staked Approximate Value Percentage Change Q4 2023 850,000 ETH $2.1B — Q1 2024 1,100,000 ETH $3.3B +29.4% Q2 2024 1,250,000 ETH $3.9B +13.6% Q3 2024 1,344,224 ETH $4.3B +7.5% Current (Q1 2025) 1,436,384 ETH $4.77B +6.9% This consistent growth pattern indicates a deliberate accumulation strategy. It contrasts sharply with the more variable trading patterns observed in many investment funds. The staking mechanism itself provides several distinct advantages for large holders: Yield Generation: Staked ETH generates rewards, creating a revenue stream. Network Participation: Validators help secure the network and influence governance. Reduced Market Supply: Staked ETH becomes illiquid, potentially supporting price stability. Long-term Alignment: Staking demonstrates commitment to Ethereum’s ecosystem health. Expert Analysis of Staking Trends Blockchain analysts emphasize the broader implications of such large-scale staking activities. According to industry reports, institutional participation in Ethereum staking has increased by approximately 40% year-over-year. This growth coincides with regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions. Furthermore, traditional finance institutions have begun offering staking services to clients. This development has created additional demand for staking infrastructure and expertise. The concentration of staked ETH among large holders remains a topic of discussion within the community. While decentralization remains a core Ethereum value proposition, practical considerations often favor institutional-scale operations. These entities can achieve higher reliability scores and better reward optimization through professional management. However, the community continues to develop technical solutions, like distributed validator technology (DVT), to enable secure decentralized staking pools. Market Impact and Future Implications The immediate market response to the staking news has been relatively muted. Ethereum’s price showed minimal movement following the transaction’s visibility. This reaction suggests that markets had already priced in continued institutional accumulation. However, the long-term implications are more substantial. Each staked ETH becomes locked until future network upgrades enable withdrawals. This locking mechanism effectively removes coins from circulating supply. Reduced supply, coupled with steady demand, typically creates upward price pressure over extended periods. Other institutional players are likely monitoring Bitmine’s strategy closely. Several cryptocurrency funds and corporate treasuries have announced Ethereum positions in recent months. Many have chosen staking as their preferred method of holding these assets. The growing institutional acceptance of staking represents a maturation phase for cryptocurrency markets. It signals a shift from speculative trading toward infrastructure investment and yield generation. The regulatory environment for staking continues to evolve. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission has provided some guidance through enforcement actions. Other jurisdictions, particularly in Europe and Asia, have developed more comprehensive frameworks. These regulations typically focus on consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance, and operational transparency. Institutional participants like Bitmine generally welcome clear regulatory guidelines. Such clarity reduces operational uncertainty and facilitates larger allocations. Conclusion Bitmine’s additional $293 million Ethereum staking commitment reinforces several key trends in cryptocurrency markets. First, institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability remains strong. Second, staking has emerged as the preferred method for large-scale ETH accumulation. Third, the growing proportion of staked ETH continues to reshape the asset’s supply dynamics. This Bitmine ETH staking transaction, while substantial on its own, forms part of a broader institutional migration toward blockchain infrastructure participation. As Ethereum continues its development roadmap, including further scalability improvements, such strategic commitments from major players will likely play a crucial role in network security and decentralization. The market will watch closely for similar moves from other institutional entities throughout 2025. FAQs Q1: What does it mean to “stake” Ethereum? Staking Ethereum involves depositing ETH into the network to act as a validator. Validators verify transactions and create new blocks. In return, they receive network rewards. Staking requires a minimum of 32 ETH per validator node and helps secure the blockchain. Q2: Why would an institution like Bitmine stake such large amounts of ETH? Institutions stake ETH for several reasons: to generate yield (typically 3-5% annually), to support network security, to demonstrate long-term commitment, and to potentially benefit from reduced circulating supply effects on price. Q3: Can staked ETH be sold or traded immediately? No, staked ETH becomes locked and illiquid. Withdrawals are enabled through specific network upgrades. Currently, staked ETH cannot be freely traded until the validator exits the staking process, which involves a queue and unbonding period. Q4: How does large-scale staking affect Ethereum’s decentralization? Large-scale staking by single entities can potentially centralize validation power. However, the Ethereum community and developers actively work on solutions like Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) to allow secure staking through decentralized pools, mitigating centralization risks. Q5: What are the risks associated with Ethereum staking? Primary risks include technical failure (leading to slashing penalties), ETH price volatility during the lock-up period, potential protocol bugs, and future regulatory changes that might affect staking operations or taxation.

With cryptos being sold off early, we could see attraction as other assets trade to elevated all-time highs. Ethereum and Solana are facing a key test for a general market rally. By Elior Manier Crypto is back in beast mode today after a 1.5-month-long consolidation across all major tokens. Digital assets have a funny way of fading into the background when interest and prices drop, often following a few crashes or scandals. And make no mistake-the latest correction was no small matter. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the most sought-after and respected crypto, corrected by 36%, with the total crypto market cap suffering a similar drop. Others were hit even harder, with 50% corrections seen in XRP ( XRP-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ), and brutal 70% drops in names like Cardano ( ADA-USD ). Crypto Total Market Cap Monthly Chart - Source: TradingView But zooming out, cryptos actually led the sensational rally that eventually spread to other assets. Bitcoin kicked off the 2024-2025 frenzy as early as January 2024, trading at $40,000 before peaking at $126,000 19 months later - a +3X increase. As a matter of fact, looking at past cycles, cryptocurrencies have often acted as a leading indicator, rising and falling weeks or even months before other asset classes. This happens for a simple technical reason: they sit at the very top of the risk spectrum. Consequently, they are the first to see demand dry up when uncertainty arises - conditions we saw clearly during the October-November period as layoffs rose and fears of an ""AI Peak"" bloomed. So, where do things stand now? Current Session in Cryptos - January 13, 2026 (15:14). Source: FInviz Digital assets have been largely off the radar since November, with volatility staying surprisingly contained. However, with stocks hovering at all-time highs and metals posting record performances, cryptocurrencies could be primed for some mean reversion higher. As geopolitical uncertainty looms and the Fed's independence comes under fire yet again, traders may look to crypto for risk diversification in assets that have corrected already. Expect things to remain volatile in this environment. Let's dive right into the daily charts and technical levels for Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Solana ( SOL-USD ). Bitcoin Daily Chart and Technical Levels Bitcoin Daily Chart, January 13, 2026 - Source: TradingView Bitcoin is now breaching its 50-day moving average on strong momentum after an initial test last week. Supported by the formation of an uptrend (higher lows, strong trendline) and confirmed by a bounce on neutral from the RSI Index, the path for a higher retest is forming. Two tests will be coming for Bitcoin: Breaking the January 5 highs ($94,810) - short-term test (looks close to breaking) Passing the test of the $100,000 resistance. This one will need a review if prices get there. A huge psychological resistance that will surely dictate risk appetite for cryptos in 2026.

A triangle formation will help to spot the direction of an imminent breakout. Showing similar RSI developments as BTC, Ethereum should see its price blaze as long as bulls manage to break above its 200-day moving average, coming in as an immediate test ($3,216). A rise in ETH could also help the broader altcoin market to rally. Levels of interest for ETH trading: Support Levels: 50-Day Moving Average: $3,100 $3,000 to $3,200 Major momentum pivot (test of the $3,000) $2,500 to $2,700 June Key Support (November lows) $2,620 Session and weekly Lows $2,100 June War support $1,385 to $1,750 2025 Support 2025 Lows: $1,384 Resistance Levels: $3,216 200-Day MA (Immediate test) $3,300 breakout region $3,500 (+/- $50) Key Resistance $3,800 September lows $4,000 Dec 2024 Top Main Resistance zone $4,950 Current new all-time highs Solana Daily Chart and Technical Levels Solana Daily Chart, January 13, 2026 - Source: TradingView Solana is forming an interesting uptrend to follow its peers but seems to lack a bit of momentum. However, with the current rally being young in global crypto, it may easily catch up as it trades well above its 50-day MA ($132.00).

57141525,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261288,1768350311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Achieves Crucial Equilibrium, Shifts to Neutral at 48",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-neutral-48/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Achieves Crucial Equilibrium, Shifts to Neutral at 48 Global cryptocurrency markets registered a significant psychological shift this week as the widely monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbed 22 points to settle at 48, decisively entering the Neutral zone for the first time in months. This pivotal move away from fear-dominated territory signals a potential recalibration of investor psychology, according to data from analytics provider Alternative.me. The index, a composite measure of market emotion, now sits precisely at the midpoint of its scale, where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ Consequently, this movement warrants a detailed examination of its components, drivers, and historical context to understand its full implications for the 2025 digital asset landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Neutral Shift The Crypto Fear & Greed Index functions as a daily sentiment thermometer for digital asset markets. Its calculation relies on a multifaceted methodology designed to capture both on-chain and social signals. Specifically, the index aggregates data from six core sources, each assigned a specific weight. Market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score. Social media sentiment and market surveys each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share of the total crypto market capitalization and relevant Google search trends each provide the remaining 10%. This composite approach aims to filter out noise and present a holistic view of collective market emotion. The jump from 26 (Fear) to 48 (Neutral) within 24 hours represents one of the most substantial single-day sentiment improvements recorded this year. Analysts often view a move into the Neutral band, typically between 46 and 54, as a period of market consolidation and rational decision-making, contrasting sharply with the impulsive trading frequently observed during extreme fear or greed phases. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Sentiment Rebound Several concurrent factors likely propelled the index into neutral territory. Firstly, a notable decrease in market volatility provided a primary boost. Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, exhibited reduced price swings over the preceding week. This stability directly positively impacts 25% of the index’s calculation. Secondly, trading volume across major exchanges saw a measured increase. This rise was not explosive but indicated renewed, steady participation rather than panic selling or frenzied buying. Thirdly, social media analysis revealed a shift in conversation tone. Discussions moved away from doom-laden predictions and toward technical analysis and project fundamentals. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance held relatively steady near 52%, suggesting a balanced interest between the flagship asset and alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). This equilibrium prevented the dominance metric from skewing the sentiment score excessively in either direction. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Placing the current 48 reading in historical context offers valuable perspective. For instance, during the market troughs of late 2022, the index languished in ‘Extreme Fear’ (below 25) for prolonged periods. Conversely, during bull market peaks, it has soared into ‘Extreme Greed’ (above 75). The neutral zone often acts as a pivot point. A sustained move above 50 can precede extended bullish trends, while a fall back below 45 can signal renewed caution. The table below illustrates recent index categories and their general market implications: Index Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear Panic selling, high volatility, potential buying opportunity 25-45 Fear Cautious selling, negative bias, consolidation 46-54 Neutral Rational analysis, balanced buying/selling, low volatility 55-74 Greed FOMO buying, increasing risk appetite, rising prices 75-100 Extreme Greed Speculative frenzy, bubble risk, correction likely Market technicians also compare this sentiment shift to on-chain data. Metrics like exchange net flows and dormant coin movement have shown patterns consistent with a holding mentality, not a distribution phase. This on-chain behavior corroborates the neutral sentiment reading, suggesting investors are neither rushing to exit nor aggressively accumulating. The Practical Impact on Trader and Investor Psychology The shift to a neutral sentiment reading carries tangible psychological effects. In fear zones, investors often make decisions based on emotion, potentially selling assets at a loss. In greed zones, they may chase overvalued projects. The neutral zone, however, fosters a more analytical environment. Key behavioral impacts include: Reduced Emotional Trading: Decisions are more likely to stem from research and strategy. Focus on Fundamentals: Project development, tokenomics, and adoption metrics regain importance. Healthy Skepticism: Both overly bullish and bearish narratives face greater scrutiny. Strategic Accumulation: Long-term investors may view this as a period for disciplined dollar-cost averaging. This environment can be particularly beneficial for new market participants. It provides a less emotionally charged atmosphere for education and portfolio construction. Seasoned analysts often advise using neutral periods to review and rebalance portfolios without the pressure of extreme market moves. Expert Insights on Sentiment as a Contrarian Indicator Financial historians frequently cite investor sentiment as a reliable contrarian indicator at its extremes. The famous dictum ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful’ aligns with this index’s utility. While a reading of 48 is not an extreme, its movement from fear toward neutrality can signal a change in market phase. Some institutional analysts interpret a climb out of sustained fear as a prerequisite for the next sustainable bullish leg. However, they caution that sentiment alone does not drive prices. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements remain the primary fundamental drivers. The sentiment index thus serves as a gauge of market mood surrounding those fundamentals, not a standalone predictor. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to a neutral 48 marks a critical inflection point for market psychology. This movement reflects a complex interplay of reduced volatility, steady volume, and more balanced social discourse. While not predictive of future price action, this shift indicates a departure from fear-based decision-making and a move toward a more rational, analytical market environment. For observers and participants, the index provides a valuable, quantified snapshot of collective emotion—a tool for grounding individual decisions in broader market sentiment. Monitoring whether the index stabilizes in neutrality or trends toward greed or fear in the coming weeks will offer essential clues about the next major phase for cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What does a ‘Neutral’ reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A neutral reading (typically 46-54) suggests a balance between fear and greed in the market. It indicates a period where investor sentiment is not dominated by extreme emotion, often correlating with lower volatility and more decision-making based on fundamentals rather than hype or panic. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is created and maintained by the data analytics platform Alternative.me. It is updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data from its six source components. Q3: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable tool for predicting Bitcoin’s price? No, the index is not a direct price prediction tool. It is a sentiment indicator. Historically, extreme readings (below 25 or above 75) have sometimes preceded market reversals, but it should be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis, not in isolation. Q4: Why does the index give equal weight (25% each) to volatility and volume? Volatility measures the magnitude of price changes, with high volatility often associated with fear or uncertainty. Volume measures market activity and participation. Together, they provide a strong foundation (50% of the index) for understanding current market dynamics and trader behavior. Q5: Can the index be manipulated by social media campaigns? While social media sentiment is a component (15%), the index’s multi-factor design makes it difficult to manipulate meaningfully. A coordinated campaign might briefly affect the social score, but it would need to coincidentally influence volatility, volume, dominance, and search trends to significantly alter the final number, which is highly improbable.

57142150,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261291,1768352111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Altcoin Season Index Surges to 30, Signaling a Potential Crypto Market Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-rises-30/,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Surges to 30, Signaling a Potential Crypto Market Shift Global cryptocurrency markets observed a notable shift on April 10, 2025, as CoinMarketCap’s pivotal Altcoin Season Index climbed to a score of 30, marking a two-point increase from the previous day and igniting discussions among analysts about a potential change in market structure. This movement, while still distant from the definitive threshold, represents one of the most significant weekly gains for the metric this quarter, prompting a closer examination of underlying capital flows and historical cycle patterns. The index serves as a critical barometer for investor sentiment, measuring the relative performance of major alternative cryptocurrencies against the market’s foundational asset, Bitcoin. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Mechanics CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index provides a quantitative framework for understanding market cycles. The platform calculates this figure by analyzing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over a rolling 90-day period. Crucially, the calculation excludes stablecoins like USDT and USDC, as well as wrapped assets like WBTC, to focus purely on volatile, speculative assets. The core comparison pits these altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance during the same window. A definitive “altcoin season” is declared when 75% or more of these top assets outperform Bitcoin over those 90 days, resulting in an index score of 100. Conversely, a “Bitcoin season” occurs when less than 25% of altcoins outperform BTC. The current score of 30 indicates that approximately 30% of the monitored altcoins have beaten Bitcoin’s returns in the recent quarter. This methodology offers a clear, data-driven alternative to anecdotal market sentiment. Calculation Basis: Top 100 coins (excluding stablecoins/wrapped assets). Time Frame: Rolling 90-day performance window. Benchmark: Direct comparison to Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action. Thresholds: 75% for Altcoin Season, 25% for Bitcoin Season. Historical Context and Market Cycle Implications The index’s rise to 30 cannot be viewed in isolation. Historical data from previous crypto cycles reveals a common pattern. Typically, a sustained bull market begins with capital flowing into Bitcoin, driving its dominance. Subsequently, as investor confidence grows and narratives around decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, or other sectors gain traction, capital begins rotating into altcoins. This rotation often pushes the Altcoin Season Index higher in a series of steps, not a single jump. For instance, in the 2020-2021 cycle, the index hovered at similar levels before a multi-month ascent that culminated in a prolonged period above the 75 threshold. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant often correlate rising index scores with increased activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and rising Ethereum gas fees, signaling robust on-chain activity for altcoin projects. The current increase coincides with reported growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) across several non-Ethereum Layer 1 blockchains, providing fundamental context for the metric’s movement. Expert Analysis on the Current Movement Market strategists emphasize caution alongside optimism. “A move from 28 to 30 is statistically minor but directionally important,” noted a recent report from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment. The report highlighted that social media discussions around “altcoin season” have increased by 40% week-over-week, often a contrarian indicator if sentiment becomes overly euphoric too quickly. Furthermore, data shows that while some large-cap altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) have posted gains, the breadth of performance across the top 100 remains mixed. This suggests the current movement may be sector-specific rather than a broad-based altcoin rally. Institutional commentators point to macroeconomic factors, such as anticipated interest rate policies from major central banks, as a primary driver for Bitcoin’s recent consolidation, which naturally allows altcoins to catch up on a relative basis. The key question for traders is whether this represents a temporary rebalancing or the early phase of a longer-term trend reversal. Impact on Investor Strategies and Portfolio Allocation The rising index directly influences both retail and institutional investment frameworks. Many portfolio management models use the index as a signal for tactical asset allocation. A rising score may prompt a gradual rebalancing from a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio toward a diversified basket of high-quality altcoins. However, risk management remains paramount. The volatility of altcoins is significantly higher than Bitcoin’s, meaning any allocation shift must be proportionate to an investor’s risk tolerance. Seasoned investors often use a phased approach, increasing exposure to altcoins in increments as the index climbs through key levels like 40 and 50, rather than making a single large bet at the first sign of movement. This strategy is supported by historical volatility data, which shows that altcoin markets can experience sharp, corrective downturns even during a broader season. The current environment underscores the importance of fundamental research, focusing on projects with clear utility, active development, and sustainable tokenomics, rather than chasing momentum alone. Recent Altcoin Season Index Milestones Date Index Value Key Market Event Jan 15, 2025 18 Post-ETF approval Bitcoin rally peak Mar 1, 2025 22 Layer 2 scaling solutions narrative gains traction Apr 9, 2025 28 Beginning of current upward movement Apr 10, 2025 30 Multi-chain DeFi activity shows notable increase Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s rise to 30 serves as a critical, data-point for market participants, signaling a measurable shift in relative performance dynamics. While far from confirming a full altcoin season, this movement provides essential context for capital rotation trends within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors should monitor this index alongside on-chain metrics, fundamental project developments, and broader macroeconomic signals. The path from 30 to the decisive threshold of 75 will require sustained outperformance across a wide range of assets, a process that historically unfolds over weeks and months rather than days. This index remains one of the most objective tools for navigating the complex transitions between Bitcoin and altcoin market cycles. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index score of 30 mean? It means that approximately 30% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin in price appreciation over the past 90 days. The market is in a neutral phase, not yet in a defined “altcoin season” (75+) or “Bitcoin season” (below 25). Q2: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, reflecting the latest 90-day rolling performance data. This allows for near real-time tracking of market cycle shifts. Q3: Does a rising index guarantee that altcoins will continue to rise? No, it does not guarantee future price increases. The index is a lagging indicator based on past performance. While it can signal a trend, altcoin markets remain highly volatile and susceptible to rapid reversals based on news, regulation, and macroeconomic factors. Q4: Why are stablecoins and wrapped assets excluded from the calculation? Stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed price and do not exhibit the speculative volatility being measured. Wrapped assets like WBTC are simply tokenized representations of Bitcoin, so their performance directly mirrors BTC and would skew the comparative data. Q5: What other indicators should I watch alongside the Altcoin Season Index? Key complementary metrics include Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), total cryptocurrency market capitalization excluding Bitcoin, trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX volume), and funding rates for altcoin perpetual futures contracts to gauge market sentiment.

More stable coins and digital assets are on Solana, but individual investors are not contributing to it. This is what is causing the SOL price to be low. However, a new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is preparing for its initial launch. It is in presale, potentially offering a massive return on investment for investors. It is said to return 45x their investment, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest in, especially for those in search of massive growth. Solana’s Scalability Analysis Currently, the value of real things such as stocks turned into tokens on the Solana network is above $931 million. The balance of stablecoins is also at a record high of above $15 billion. Large companies such as BlackRock are now collaborating with Solana. Despite all this happening, the SOL coin is yet to rise to the value it was at ATH. Currently, the coin is lagging. Evidence indicates that common investors are not investing in SOL at the moment. This is why the coin is not rising in value yet. For investors looking to make quick gains, Solana is not the best crypto to buy at the moment. Mutuum Finance has emerged as the new crypto that is preferred by smart investors. Mutuum Finance Presale: Acquire MUTM at Lower Prices Mutuum Finance is holding a presale, which is a great investment deal for investors. It has already raised $19,750,000 from over 18,800 people. The presale has entered Phase 7, and tokens are selling at $0.04 each. It should be noted that this is four times more expensive than what was being sold during Phase 1 of the presale. Phase 7 is selling out extremely rapidly. When this phase sells out, Phase 8 commences with a cost of $0.045 per token, meaning those who delay today will have to pay more. The tokens will eventually cost $0.06 upon launch. This implies that investors who are currently investing in this presale would witness as little as $500 grow to $750 in a very short while. It has been anticipated that the cost may escalate higher after the launch, potentially reaching $0.10 per token. This presale has the potential of generating a huge ROI from what may seem like a small amount of investment currently. If MUTM hits $0.10, the same $500 becomes $1250, generating a $750 profit. Two Methods of Loaning Money and Earning Interest Mutuum Finance allows users to earn money by lending crypto. There are two aspects of the platform. First, it is via lending pools for common coins such as Ethereum and USDT. In addition, it allows users to lend funds to each other directly. It is helpful for a user that currently owns crypto and would like to generate passive ROI. To earn more, the user can lend it. If a user contributes $10,000 of Ethereum to a pool, he or she may earn 12% per year. The user gets $1,200 free money without having to sell Ethereum. For another crypto like Shiba Inu, they may lend directly to a borrower and negotiate a slightly higher interest e.g. 18% to earn $1,200 on the $10,000. It is a practical method for users to gain profits using the platform. It is better than saving the money as it is, believing that it may increase. Furthermore, it makes Mutuum Finance the best crypto to buy for those who need theirs to work for them. Sharing Profits with Holders Mutuum Finance has intelligent rules for its token to increase its worth in the future. There would never be more than 4 billion MUTM tokens in existence. Nearly half of the tokens exist for the presale. For its tokens, the project has a way of rewarding people who stake in the project. A part of every dollar the project generates in fees will go into buying MUTM tokens back. Then, those tokens will reward the individuals who lock their tokens in the project’s system. For example, if the project generates $500,000 in fees, an individual with $2,000 worth of tokens might receive an additional reward of $500 in MUTM tokens. The Smart Choice for Investors Mutuum Finance is designed for making profits for investors through multiple means. The purchase in the presale provides a low rate before the initial launch, the loan mechanism generates passive income through interest, while the token mechanics reward loyal supporters who participate in the long run. All of these factors combine to increase the value of the token. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that wait for the general market to shift, Mutuum Finance generates its own growth. For someone asking which crypto to invest in currently for the potential of massive profits, the new crypto coin comes with an attractive plan. It is created to translate activities on their platform to real profits for the early supporters. This places it in the top selection for the best crypto to invest in currently.

57142275,657243,1768352417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57142275.jpeg,Bitcoin Volatility Signals Potential Move: Bullish Breakout Or A Deeper Correction?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volatility-signals-potential-move-breakout/,"Bitcoin is pressing above the $92,000 level after an eventful start to 2026 marked by intensified geopolitical and political developments. In early January, the United States launched a military operation in Venezuela, resulting in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and significant upheaval in regional politics and energy markets. This action formed part of a broader US campaign against illicit networks and pressure on Caracas, with implications for global oil flows and uncertainty in macroeconomic sentiment across markets. Simultaneously, tensions between Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and US President Donald Trump over monetary policy and institutional independence have added another layer of volatility. In a rare and pointed statement, Powell framed the situation as a direct consequence of central bank independence, saying: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” Despite these headline risks, Bitcoin’s price action has entered a period of calm, with realized volatility compressing to historically low levels. Such low-volatility regimes typically reflect a temporary balance between supply and demand. In past cycles, extended calm like this has often preceded periods of significant volatility and range expansion, as accumulated imbalances resolve with sharp directional moves. This sets the stage for a potentially decisive breakout as participants await clearer catalysts while price hovers near the critical $92K threshold. Volatility Compression Signals A Market Near Inflection A recent analysis by Axel Adler highlights a critical shift in Bitcoin’s market structure: realized volatility has compressed to 23.6 % , placing it near the lower end of this cycle’s historical range. Rather than signaling direction, this drop in volatility reflects a market that has temporarily lost momentum, with price swings narrowing and impulse strength fading. In past cycles, similar conditions have rarely persisted for long. From a structural standpoint, this environment suggests that Bitcoin is in a classic compression phase. As volatility contracts, underlying imbalances between supply and demand tend to build quietly beneath the surface. When these imbalances reach a tipping point, price typically transitions from stability into expansion—often abruptly. This view is reinforced by Bitcoin’s 30-day high–low range. The gap between recent rolling highs and lows continues to tighten, confirming that price is coiling within an increasingly narrow band. Both intraday and multi-day fluctuations have diminished, and neither buyers nor sellers have been able to assert sustained control. Historically, breakouts from such compressed ranges tend to attract algorithmic and trend-following capital, amplifying follow-through once price escapes the range. While this setup does not guarantee an upside or downside resolution, it does suggest that the probability of a decisive move is rising. With volatility and range metrics aligned, Bitcoin appears to be approaching a moment where consolidation gives way to renewed directional conviction. Bitcoin Price Reclaims $92K as Structure Slowly Improves Bitcoin is attempting to reclaim the $92,000 level after several weeks of consolidation following the sharp November drawdown. On the daily chart, price has formed a clear base in the $86K–$88K region, where aggressive selling pressure was previously exhausted. Since then, BTC has printed a sequence of higher lows, signaling a gradual shift from distribution into short-term accumulation. The recent push above the descending short-term moving average reflects improving momentum, although the broader structure remains mixed. Price is still trading below the declining mid-term trendline and well under the longer-term moving averages, which continue to act as overhead resistance near the $98K–$105K zone. This suggests that, while downside pressure has eased, Bitcoin has not yet re-entered a strong bullish trend. Volume remains relatively muted during the rebound, indicating that the move is driven more by reduced selling than by aggressive new demand. This aligns with a market transitioning into stabilization rather than immediate expansion. The $92K area now represents a critical pivot: holding above it would confirm acceptance at higher levels and open the door for a broader range rotation toward $96K–$100K. Failure to sustain this breakout, however, would likely keep BTC trapped in a consolidation range, with downside risk returning toward the $88K support. For now, price action suggests cautious recovery rather than trend reversal.

That surge pushed derivatives to claim most of the market’s activity, while spot trading grew at a much slower pace. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Spot Volume Climbs While Futures Explode Spot trading finished the year near $18.6 trillion, an increase of roughly 9% versus the prior year. But futures and perpetuals were the real story: they totaled close to $62 trillion, making up about 77% of combined exchange volume. That heavy tilt toward derivatives shifted where liquidity and daily turnover were concentrated. Exchanges At The Center Of Activity Binance stood out as the top contributor to both segments. Reports show Binance handled roughly $25.4 trillion in Bitcoin perpetual futures alone — about 42% of the top 10 platforms’ Bitcoin perpetual volume — and continued to hold large stablecoin balances relative to peers. Other major venues such as OKX, Bybit and Bitget formed a secondary tier for futures trading. 2025 crypto exchange activity in review. Spot volume reached $18.6T (+9% YoY) while perpetuals surged to $61.7T (+29%), with Binance dominating spot, BTC perps, liquidity, and reserves. Growth is derivative-led, and market power continues to concentrate at the top. pic.twitter.com/Om8udJJ9Qv — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 12, 2026 Derivatives Data Variations Not all trackers measure markets the same way. Some platforms reported even higher figures for derivatives in 2025 — CoinGlass, for example, tallied about $85.7 trillion in crypto derivatives volume for the year. Differences in counting methods, which products are included, and which venues are covered explain much of the gap between sources. Why Futures Dominated Trading Traders used futures to take positions, hedge exposures, and respond quickly to price moves. That activity raised daily turnover and boosted the headline totals. While spot trading reflects direct buying and selling of coins, futures multiply notional flow because a single contract can represent a much larger notional value than a spot trade. The concentration of trading on a handful of platforms has drawn attention from watchdogs in recent years. Regulators have warned that heavy reliance on a small set of exchanges could pose risks if those venues suffer outages or enforcement actions. The data for 2025 renewed those concerns because a large share of the new volume was funneled through the biggest operators.

Institutional interest, products tied to regulated markets, and changes to stablecoin rules are all possible factors that could reshape volumes next year. Analysts caution that headline totals will keep varying with methodology and which datasets are used.

Under these rules, interest payments settled solely in connection with the holding of a stablecoin are prohibited while permitting rewards allocation for particular activities. Following this release, reports from reliable sources indicated that Senator Tim Scott, Chairman of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, had presented a new bipartisan draft to the Senate Banking Committee. This bipartisan draft, known as a “negotiated market structure bill,” is set to undergo a markup session on Thursday, January 15. At this particular moment, committee members will conduct a heated debate on this legislation and may later proceed to a vote on the bill. Analysts identify a significant challenge in the stablecoin ecosystem Sources described the “negotiated market structure bill” as a game-changer set up to tackle highly contentious issues at the negotiating table. Notably, these challenges sparked intensified discussions between cryptocurrency firms and the banking sector for weeks. These sources decided to disclose the main content of the bill. They noted that this draft market structure bill clearly stated that digital asset service providers are not allowed to make interest or yield payments to users in relation to their stablecoin holdings. Nonetheless, they highlighted that these providers are permitted to offer rewards to their users in connection with specific activities, such as processing payments, staking, providing liquidity, or offering collateral. Interestingly, this newly released wording includes a compromise that Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks proposed last week. Alsobrooks played a key role in the talks. In her suggestion, crypto exchanges are permitted to issue yields to their users on stablecoins if clients carry out specific activities, such as selling their stablecoins. However, it forbids rewards for stablecoins that are just stored in an account. With this finding, analysts concluded that challenges arising from issues related to stablecoins yields have generated considerable friction between banks and the crypto industry. At this point, banking groups have raised concerns that the GENIUS Act , a US federal law enacted in July 2025, has established gaps that enable issuers or platforms to provide interest-like returns, thereby initiating new liquidity risks. Uncertainties surrounding rewards for stablecoins spark debate among individuals Reports clarified that the stablecoin law does not hinder third-party crypto platforms, such as the major crypto exchange and platform Coinbase , from issuing rewards to their users, despite prohibiting issuers from conducting direct interest payments. After these reports highlighted this situation, several crypto firms declared that the matter was already settled at the time talks about the GENIUS Act were held, hence alleging that banks are attempting to restrict their competition. Recognizing the increasing tension of the situation, Coinbase issued a warning that it would withdraw its backing for the market structure bill if lawmakers decide to go beyond just implementing improvements in disclosure requirements and start to impose more stringent restrictions on reward programs. On the other hand, sources noted that, apart from stablecoins, the newly established draft comprises a bipartisan proposal from the US Senators Ron Wyden and Cynthia Lummis.

ETH and Aster Look Promising, But APEMARS Crushes Them with 22,367% ROI & Tokens Vanishing Fast!",https://timestabloid.com/best-100x-crypto-for-2026-eth-and-aster-look-promising-but-apemars/,"January 2026 has opened with a familiar pattern in crypto markets. Established assets are tightening, narratives are shifting, and attention is quietly rotating before the next visible breakout. Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest, with staking activity steadily removing ETH from circulation and subtly tightening supply. At the same time, leverage across derivatives markets has surged without aggressive price expansion, a setup that historically increases volatility rather than signaling weakness. Alongside these conditions, newer narratives are building momentum beneath the surface. While Ethereum and Aster represent mature ecosystems navigating this phase with stability, a different kind of opportunity is unfolding in the presale market. APEMARS has entered this window at a moment when early positioning matters most, drawing attention from traders hunting the best 100x crypto before momentum becomes obvious. As of today, APEMARS is live in Stage 3 of its presale, priced at $0.00002448, with over 350 holders, $ 79 K raised, and more than 3.8B tokens sold. Previous stages sold out quickly at lower prices, and the current stage is moving at a similar pace, placing it firmly on the radar of early-stage investors seeking asymmetric upside. APEMARS Stage 3: Where Early Entry Becomes Asymmetric Momentum rarely announces itself loudly in presales. It builds through participation, pace, and structure. That is exactly how APEMARS is unfolding as Stage 3 officially accelerates. The mission-style presale moves on a fixed timeline, and when a stage sells out early, the system advances automatically. There is no pause and no waiting for late entrants. At $0.00002448, this stage represents one of the lowest remaining entry points before pricing steps up again, with an estimated 22,367% ROI projected at listing. What makes this moment compelling is not just pricing, but scarcity mechanics layered into the journey. Unsold tokens from early mission segments are permanently burned at predefined checkpoints, reducing the circulating supply as the presale advances. These burns are not random. They are scheduled at key stages, reinforcing scarcity while rewarding early participation. As Stage 3 fills rapidly, the window for securing tokens at this price narrows by the day, and once it closes, this valuation does not return. Beyond supply tightening, APEMARS introduces staking designed to reward patience rather than speculation. Participants can stake their tokens after joining the presale, with staking rewards activating two months post-listing. The fixed 63% APY, inspired by Mars’ average temperature, offers a structured incentive for holders who stay aligned with the mission beyond launch. This delay protects early market stability while positioning committed holders for sustained yield once staking goes live. Together, these mechanics turn early entry into a strategic advantage, not a gamble, strengthening APEMARS’ positioning among projects competing to be the best 100x crypto of this cycle. $2,000 Today → $449,000 at Listing: Stage 3’s 22,367% ROI Window Closes in 3 Days Early-stage conviction often forms when numbers meet urgency. At the current Stage 3 price of $0.00002448, a hypothetical $2,000 entry secures roughly 81.7 million APEMARS tokens. With a projected listing price of $0.0055, that position translates to a potential value near $449,000 at launch, reflecting the estimated 22,367% ROI that early participants are actively positioning for as they search for the best 100x crypto opportunities before momentum peaks. What intensifies this setup is timing. Stage 3 has less than three days remaining, and earlier stages didn’t reward hesitation. They sold out quickly at lower prices that are no longer accessible. Once this three-day window closes, the system advances automatically, pricing steps up, and this valuation disappears permanently. In presales driven by scarcity and pace, missing an early window often means missing the best 100x crypto setup entirely, with the cost of waiting measured in lost multiples rather than lost time. How to Buy APEMARS During the Presale Stage 3 Joining the APEMARS presale is designed to be straightforward. First, connect a supported non-custodial wallet through the official dashboard. Next, select your preferred cryptocurrency and enter the amount you wish to participate with. If you have a referral or bonus code, apply it at checkout to unlock additional benefits. Once completed, your purchased tokens appear instantly in your dashboard, reflecting your position in Stage 3 without unnecessary complexity. Ethereum: Institutional Strength in a Tightening Market Ethereum continues to anchor the broader crypto ecosystem as capital flows increasingly favor infrastructure over speculation. Trading at $3,088.41, Ethereum holds a commanding $372.75B market cap, with daily volume near $17.29B and a circulating supply of 120.69M ETH. The network’s transition toward efficiency and yield has made institutional staking a defining theme, quietly reducing liquid supply without disrupting market confidence. Recent market behavior shows Ethereum consolidating rather than expanding aggressively, a sign of strength rather than stagnation. Developers continue to build across DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 solutions, reinforcing Ethereum’s role as the settlement layer of Web3. While near-term price action remains measured, ETH’s fundamentals position it as a long-term cornerstone for portfolios prioritizing resilience and utility. Aster: Expanding Utility in a Competitive Layer Aster has emerged as a notable player within its niche, balancing growth with active ecosystem development. Currently priced at $0.6945, Aster carries a $1.73B market cap and records $173.66M in daily trading volume, supported by a circulating supply of 2.49B ASTER. Short-term price fluctuations have mirrored broader market movements, rather than signaling structural weakness. What sustains interest in Aster is its expanding use cases and focus on interoperability. The project continues to attract users through ecosystem incentives and strategic partnerships, reinforcing its relevance as competition among mid-cap assets intensifies. For investors seeking exposure beyond established giants, Aster represents a calculated blend of utility-driven growth and market participation. Conclusion: Timing, Structure, and the Case for Early Entry Ethereum and Aster reflect different stages of crypto maturity, each offering value through stability, utility, and ecosystem depth. They act as reference points for what sustained adoption looks like once momentum has already formed. Alongside them, APEMARS occupies a different but complementary position, drawing attention in its earliest phase, where structure, scarcity, and narrative align in a way early markets tend to reward. With Stage 3 live and pricing still at $0.00002448, while earlier stages have already sold out, APEMARS stands out as a presale shaped by pace rather than promises. For investors searching for the best 100x crypto, timing often defines outcomes more than headlines. In cycles where early positioning comes before visibility, opportunities like APEMARS rarely stay under the radar for long.

Cryptos with the highest 100x potential are usually early-stage projects with low entry prices, strong narratives, and clear scarcity mechanics. Presales like APEMARS often attract attention because upside is accessed before listings and broad market exposure. Which crypto will give 1000x to buy? While no outcome is guaranteed, 1000x opportunities typically appear in presales where pricing is deeply discounted, and momentum builds quickly. Projects with structured stages, strong community growth, and clear timelines tend to stand out early. How to find the next 100x crypto? Look for presales with rising holder counts, fast-selling stages, transparent tokenomics, and limited supply growth. Timing matters most when entering before visibility and hype reach the wider market, a strategy often highlighted by early-opportunity trackers like Best Crypto to Buy Now . What is 100x crypto? A 100x crypto refers to an asset that increases 100 times from its entry price. These moves usually happen when investors enter early, before exchange listings and mainstream adoption. Direct Answer Box: Ethereum (ETH), Aster (ASTER), and APEMARS ($APRZ) each offer different paths to growth in 2026. Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest with its transition to staking and network efficiency, solidifying its position as a long-term investment. Aster, with its expanding utility and focus on interoperability, holds potential for steady growth in its niche. However, APEMARS, currently in Stage 3 of its presale, presents an exciting opportunity for early investors. With a projected 22,367% ROI and a narrowing window to secure tokens at $0.00002448, APEMARS offers the highest risk-reward potential. With its scarcity mechanics, staking rewards, and momentum-building structure, APEMARS could be the best 100x crypto investment for 2026.

57142812,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261294,1768353911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hybrid Digital Asset Payment Tech: KB Kookmin Card’s Revolutionary Patent Filing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kb-kookmin-card-hybrid-payment-patent/,"BitcoinWorld Hybrid Digital Asset Payment Tech: KB Kookmin Card’s Revolutionary Patent Filing In a significant move for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, South Korean financial giant KB Kookmin Card has filed a groundbreaking patent application for a hybrid digital asset payment technology. This innovation, reported by Newsis in Seoul, South Korea, on April 10, 2025, aims to seamlessly merge blockchain-based digital assets with traditional credit card infrastructure. Consequently, this development could fundamentally reshape how consumers interact with both fiat and cryptocurrency for daily transactions. Decoding the Hybrid Digital Asset Payment Technology KB Kookmin Card’s proposed system introduces a novel bridge between decentralized finance and conventional banking. The core technology links a user’s existing blockchain e-wallet address directly to their standard credit card account. Therefore, customers would not need a new physical or virtual card. The payment logic follows a specific, automated hierarchy. Initially, the system attempts to draw funds from the stablecoin balance within the user’s linked e-wallet. Subsequently, if the digital asset balance proves insufficient, the transaction automatically defaults to a standard credit card payment processed through the existing card network. This architecture presents several immediate advantages. First, it leverages familiar payment rails that merchants already accept globally. Second, it provides a built-in safety net for users experimenting with digital asset spending. Finally, it simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need to pre-convert assets or manage separate payment apps at the point of sale. Industry analysts note this approach contrasts with earlier crypto card models that required asset liquidation before settlement. The Strategic Shift in Payment Processing This patent filing arrives amidst a broader industry pivot. Major payment networks and banks globally are actively exploring digital asset integration. For instance, Visa and Mastercard have developed programs for crypto-linked cards, though often relying on third-party intermediaries for conversion. KB Kookmin Card’s technology appears to internalize this function, potentially offering greater control and efficiency. The focus on stablecoins is particularly strategic, as their price stability mirrors traditional currency, reducing volatility risk for both consumers and merchants during transactions. Real-World Context and Market Impact The development must be viewed within South Korea’s vibrant fintech and cryptocurrency landscape. The nation boasts one of the world’s highest crypto adoption rates and a population keen on technological innovation. Regulatory frameworks, like the Travel Rule and the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, have recently matured, providing clearer guidelines for financial institutions. KB Financial Group, the parent company of KB Kookmin Card, has consistently invested in blockchain research, signaling a long-term commitment to the sector. Potential impacts of this hybrid payment technology are multifaceted. For consumers, it promises unprecedented flexibility in managing liquidity across asset classes. For merchants, it could eventually reduce payment processing fees associated with traditional card networks, assuming blockchain settlement proves cheaper. For the broader crypto ecosystem, successful implementation by a major institution like KB Kookmin Card would serve as a powerful validation, potentially accelerating institutional adoption worldwide. Seamless Integration: Uses existing card infrastructure; no new hardware required. Automated Asset Prioritization: Spends stablecoins first, then defaults to credit. Enhanced User Security: Leverages established banking-grade security protocols. Regulatory Alignment: Designed within evolving digital asset financial frameworks. Expert Analysis on the Patent’s Significance Financial technology experts highlight the patent’s focus on interoperability as its key innovation. “The true barrier to crypto payments has rarely been the blockchain itself, but rather its connection to the legacy financial world,” notes Dr. Soo-Min Lee, a fintech researcher at Seoul National University. “A patent that systematically solves for hybrid settlement at the point of sale, especially from a major card issuer, represents a concrete step toward solving the last-mile problem for digital assets.” The technology could also pave the way for programmable finance features, such as automated rewards paid in cryptocurrency or smart contracts that trigger based on spending behavior. Technical and Regulatory Considerations Implementing this hybrid digital asset payment system involves complex technical and regulatory hurdles. On the technical side, the system must ensure real-time balance checks across disparate systems—the blockchain and the card network—while maintaining transaction speed and reliability. It must also provide robust safeguards against fraud and errors in the asset conversion process. From a regulatory perspective, the system must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations across both traditional finance and digital asset domains. The patent application itself will undergo rigorous examination, a process that typically takes several years, indicating that this is a strategic, forward-looking move by KB Kookmin Card. Comparison: Traditional Crypto Card vs. KB Kookmin’s Hybrid Model Feature Traditional Crypto Card KB Kookmin Hybrid Model Asset Settlement Pre-conversion to fiat required Direct stablecoin spend with credit fallback Infrastructure Often requires new card issuance Uses existing credit card account User Experience Separate app management Unified payment flow Primary Innovation On-ramp/Off-ramp service Integrated hybrid payment rail Conclusion KB Kookmin Card’s patent application for a hybrid digital asset payment technology marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. By proposing a system that intelligently blends stablecoin e-wallets with conventional credit lines, the company is addressing critical challenges of usability and integration. While the path from patent to product involves significant technical and regulatory development, this move underscores a clear direction for the future of payments. Ultimately, the success of such hybrid digital asset payment systems could determine the speed and scale at which cryptocurrencies transition from investment vehicles to practical tools for everyday commerce. FAQs Q1: What exactly did KB Kookmin Card patent? KB Kookmin Card filed a patent for a payment system that links a blockchain e-wallet to a traditional credit card. This hybrid digital asset payment technology allows a transaction to first use stablecoins from the wallet and then automatically use credit if needed. Q2: Would I need a new credit card to use this technology? No. According to the patent details, the technology is designed to work with a customer’s existing credit card by linking it to a separate digital asset wallet address, eliminating the need for a new physical or virtual card. Q3: Why does the system use stablecoins first? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar. Using them first minimizes price volatility risk at the point of sale. It also encourages the direct use of digital assets while providing a familiar credit backup. Q4: Is this technology available to customers now? Not yet. The company has only filed a patent application. This is a legal step to protect the intellectual property. Product development, regulatory approvals, and testing would need to follow, which is a multi-year process. Q5: How does this differ from other crypto debit/credit cards? Many existing crypto cards automatically sell your cryptocurrency to fiat currency at the time of purchase. This hybrid model is designed to spend the digital asset (stablecoin) directly when possible, only resorting to the credit function as a secondary layer, potentially offering a more integrated experience.

Analysts are more worried about the creative software maker than they’ve been in over a decade as concerns pile up about whether it can keep up in the AI era. Oppenheimer cut its rating on Adobe stock to perform Tuesday. It’s just the newest downgrade in a string of them. Analysts are worrie d th e company’s going to struggle against competitors like OpenAI that let user s ma ke images and videos just by typing what they want. All these downgrades have pushed Adobe’s consensus rating down to 3.91 out of 5. That’s the lowest it’s been since 2013. The number comes from looking at how many analysts say buy, hold or sell. Brian Schwartz at Oppenheimer listed several problems he thinks will hurt the stock this year. There’s a rough business environment as companies shift to AI technology, and that’s going to mean weak revenue growth that keeps getting slower. Schwartz also mentioned bumpy product rollouts, doubts about how strong Adobe’s competitive spot really is, investors not being that interested in software stocks right now, and profit margins that are expected to shrink compared to last year. Stock performance lags far behind tech sector Shares fell 2.6% Tu esday. The stock’s down 6.4% so far this year through Monday. That comes after drops of more than 20% in both 2024 and 2025. Adobe’s lost more than 45% of its value since the end of 2023. Compare that to how other tech stocks have done. A fund that tracks software companies is up nearly 30% in that same time. Companies seen as AI winners like Microsoft, Oracle and Palantir Technologies hav e do ne well. The Nasdaq 100 Index has jumped more than 50%, thanks mostly to the Magnificent Seven. Software-as-a-service companies have been getting hammered. Investors think services from AI-focused startups are going to steal customers and hurt growth. Oppenheimer wasn’t the only firm to downgrade Adobe in January. BMO Capital Markets dropped it to market perform last week. The firm said competitive pressures in the creative market are getting worse and it doesn’t see any good news coming. Jefferies downgraded it to hold before that, pointing out that any revenue bump from AI hasn’t shown up yet. Growth has actually been slowing since fiscal 2023, including in the company’s early projections for fiscal 2026. Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges started covering Adobe with a sell ratin g Ja nuary 11. The firm used to rate it a buy. Borges wrote that Adobe’s handled tech changes well before, but AI is different. It’s making design tools available to everyone, which means fewer people need Adobe’s professional-level software. Valuation concerns take backseat to competition worries BMO cut its price target too, from $400 down to $375. The firm said Adobe’s valuation isn’t really the problem. The bigger issue is the competitive pressure building in creative software. BMO said Adobe now ranks dead last in its coverage group. It likes rivals Salesforce and HubSpot better. Survey data backs up these worries. BMO found that more than 50% of students use Canva instead of Adobe now. Nearly half of freelancers rely on Canva versus about 10% who only use Adobe. Over half of users said they work with both tools. BMO thinks that’s bad news given how dominant Adobe used to be. Canva’s expected to go public sometime in 2026 or 2027. That’ll probably make things even tougher for Adobe. Shares dropped roughly 20% over the past year, doing worse than the software sector overall.

Prediction Markets Reach Unprecedented Trading Volume The $700 million daily volume represents a significant acceleration in prediction market growth. These platforms allow participants to trade contracts based on real-world event outcomes, ranging from election results to economic indicators. Consequently, this record-breaking volume demonstrates increasing institutional and retail interest in alternative financial instruments. The data, originally reported by blockchain analytics firm Wu Blockchain, reveals consistent growth patterns throughout early 2025. Moreover, this surge coincides with regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions, providing market participants with greater confidence in these emerging financial platforms. Market analysts note several contributing factors to this volume explosion. First, geopolitical events in early 2025 created numerous trading opportunities. Second, technological improvements reduced transaction costs significantly. Third, traditional financial institutions began allocating small percentages to prediction markets as portfolio diversifiers. Additionally, user interface enhancements made these platforms more accessible to non-technical traders. The convergence of these factors created perfect conditions for volume expansion. Market Share Distribution and Platform Analysis Kalshi emerged as the dominant platform during this record-setting period. The regulated U.S.-based prediction market captured approximately $466 million in daily volume, representing a commanding 66.4% market share. This dominance reflects Kalshi’s regulatory compliance and traditional financial partnerships. Meanwhile, decentralized platforms Polymarket and Opinion each secured 14.3% market shares, processing approximately $100 million in daily volume each. The remaining 5% distributed across smaller platforms and emerging market entrants. Prediction Market Platform Performance (January 12, 2025) Platform Daily Volume Market Share Primary Focus Kalshi $466 million 66.4% Regulated U.S. events Polymarket $100 million 14.3% Global decentralized events Opinion $100 million 14.3% Sports and entertainment Other Platforms $34 million 4.9% Niche and emerging markets Platform specialization explains much of this distribution pattern. Kalshi focuses primarily on U.S. regulatory-approved event contracts, attracting traditional investors. Conversely, Polymarket operates on Polygon blockchain technology, appealing to cryptocurrency-native traders. Opinion concentrates on sports and entertainment markets, drawing from different participant demographics. This segmentation suggests prediction markets are developing distinct ecosystem niches rather than competing directly for identical user bases. Expert Analysis of Market Dynamics Financial technology researchers identify three key drivers behind this volume surge. First, prediction markets provide superior information aggregation compared to traditional polling methods. Second, they offer hedging opportunities against event risks unavailable in conventional markets. Third, their binary outcome structure simplifies participation for new entrants. According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology research, prediction markets have demonstrated 76% accuracy in forecasting events versus 68% for expert panels. This predictive advantage increasingly attracts institutional attention. Regulatory developments significantly influenced recent growth patterns. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved expanded event contract categories in late 2024. Similarly, European regulators established clearer guidelines for prediction market operations. These developments reduced legal uncertainty that previously constrained market participation. Consequently, traditional market makers and liquidity providers entered the space, dramatically improving market depth and reducing spreads. Improved liquidity then attracted additional participants, creating a virtuous growth cycle. Historical Context and Growth Trajectory Prediction markets trace their origins to experimental economics research in the 1980s. The Iowa Electronic Markets, established in 1988, demonstrated their forecasting capabilities through multiple election cycles. However, technological limitations constrained early adoption. Blockchain technology revolutionized the space beginning around 2017 by enabling trustless settlement and global accessibility. Daily volumes remained below $10 million until 2021, then experienced exponential growth through 2024. 2018-2020: Average daily volume below $5 million 2021: First $50 million daily volume recorded 2022: $100 million threshold crossed during midterm elections 2023: $300 million achieved during presidential primary season 2024: $500 million milestone reached in November elections 2025: $700 million record set in January This growth trajectory demonstrates accelerating adoption rather than isolated spikes. The 2024 U.S. election cycle particularly boosted mainstream awareness. Major media organizations began citing prediction market probabilities alongside traditional polling data. Financial news networks added prediction market tracking segments to regular programming. This media coverage introduced millions of new potential participants to these markets throughout 2024. Technological Infrastructure Developments Behind the volume numbers, significant technological advancements enabled this scale. Layer-2 blockchain solutions reduced transaction costs by approximately 94% since 2022. Oracle networks improved their reliability and speed, with average resolution times decreasing from 48 hours to under 6 hours for most event types. User interface designs evolved from technical cryptocurrency exchanges to intuitive trading platforms resembling mainstream investment applications. These improvements lowered participation barriers dramatically. Mobile application development particularly influenced retail participation growth. Prediction market applications now feature simplified onboarding processes and educational resources. Many platforms removed cryptocurrency requirements for entry, accepting traditional payment methods. These accessibility improvements expanded the potential user base from thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts to millions of general retail investors. Application download data shows 340% growth in prediction market app installations during 2024 alone. Economic Implications and Market Efficiency The $700 million daily volume milestone carries significant economic implications. Prediction markets increasingly function as leading indicators for various sectors. Corporate decision-makers monitor relevant contract prices for market sentiment data. Political analysts track election probabilities more frequently than traditional polling updates. Insurance companies explore prediction markets for catastrophic event risk modeling. This utility expansion drives participation beyond speculative trading into practical business applications. Market efficiency improvements represent another important development. Bid-ask spreads have narrowed substantially across most prediction market platforms. Major event contracts now typically show spreads under 1%, comparable to established financial instruments. This liquidity improvement reduces transaction costs for all participants. Additionally, arbitrage opportunities between platforms have diminished, indicating better price discovery mechanisms. These efficiency gains suggest prediction markets are maturing toward mainstream financial instrument status. Conclusion Prediction markets reached a definitive inflection point with their $700 million daily volume achievement in January 2025. This milestone reflects years of technological refinement, regulatory progress, and increasing mainstream acceptance. Kalshi’s dominant market position demonstrates the importance of regulatory compliance in attracting institutional participation. Meanwhile, decentralized platforms continue serving global markets with innovative contract types. The prediction market sector now represents a legitimate alternative data source and financial instrument category. Future growth will likely depend on continued regulatory cooperation and technological reliability improvements. However, the $700 million volume record clearly establishes prediction markets as permanent components of the global financial ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly are prediction markets? Prediction markets are exchange-traded platforms where participants buy and sell contracts based on real-world event outcomes. These contracts settle at either $0 or $1 depending on whether the specified event occurs, with trading prices representing market-assessed probabilities. Q2: Why did Kalshi capture such a large market share? Kalshi operates as a regulated U.S. exchange with CFTC approval, attracting institutional participants requiring regulatory compliance. Their focus on U.S. events and traditional financial integrations provided advantages during periods of increased mainstream adoption. Q3: Are prediction markets legal everywhere? Regulatory status varies significantly by jurisdiction. The United States permits prediction markets through regulated exchanges like Kalshi. Many European and Asian countries have established specific frameworks, while some jurisdictions prohibit or restrict these markets entirely. Q4: How accurate are prediction markets compared to traditional polling? Academic research generally shows prediction markets outperform traditional polling in forecasting accuracy. Market participants risk real capital based on their beliefs, creating stronger incentives for accurate information than opinion polling typically achieves. Q5: What types of events do prediction markets cover? Markets cover diverse events including election outcomes, economic indicators, sports results, entertainment awards, technological developments, and geopolitical events. Regulatory approvals determine which event categories specific platforms can offer in different jurisdictions.

Here’s what could be the reason for it, according to the founder of Capriole Investments. Bitcoin Has Diverged From The Global M2 Supply Trend In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about how Bitcoin has decoupled from the global liquidity flows recently. Below is the chart cited by Edwards, which compares the year-over-year (YoY) percentage change in BTC to that in the global M2 supply. As displayed in the graph, Bitcoin’s YoY change flatlined over 2025 while the total money supply of the world’s major economies witnessed growth, indicating BTC diverged from traditional liquidity flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline In the past, the cryptocurrency’s YoY percentage change has generally showcased a similar trajectory to the global M2 supply. “This is the first time Bitcoin has decoupled from money supply and global liquidity flows,” noted the analyst. What’s the reason behind this new trend? According to Edwards, it’s the threat posed by quantum computing to the network. Quantum computers are hypothesized to have the capability to break the cryptocurrency’s cryptography, with wallets from the blockchain’s early days being especially vulnerable. It’s uncertain when quantum machines will find a breakthrough, but the Capriole founder believes BTC passed into a “Quantum Event Horizon” in 2025. “The timeframe to a non-zero probability of a quantum machine breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is now less than the estimated time it will take to upgrade Bitcoin,” said Edwards. In theory, a party with a sufficiently advanced quantum computer could break into old dormant wallets and dump the coins on the market. This would not only directly impact BTC’s price but could also undermine broader trust in the cryptocurrency itself. “Money is repositioning to account for this risk accordingly,” explained the analyst. One X user countered that most investors don’t seem to agree with Edwards’ quantum timeline, suggesting that the market would be unlikely to decouple based on a view not widely shared. “If you listen to all in bitcoin maxis on X you would think that,” Edwards replied to the user. “If you talk to real capital allocators and Bitcoin OGs in the space 7+ years in private – they are all considering this risk.” Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak In some other news, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to face weak demand recently, as data from SoSoValue shows.

57144777,657298,1768356022,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57144777.jpeg,Bitcoin Is Replicating The Same Cup And Handle As Silver To Lead To ‘Violent Repricing’,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-is-replicating-silver/,"A crypto analyst has just identified a distinct Cup and Handle formation on the Bitcoin price chart that closely mirrors the pattern Silver displayed just before its historic 2017 rally. At the time, the analyst said Silver’s breakout from this key structure had triggered a violent reprice as buyers flooded the market. With BTC now tracing a similar pattern, he suggests the leading cryptocurrency could soon break out of its Cup and Handle structure and experience an explosive move. Bitcoin Mirrors Pre-Rally Silver Pattern From 2017 Since the 2021 bull cycle , Bitcoin has been forming a Cup and Handle pattern that has extended into 2025 and now looks ready to explode in 2026 . Crypto analyst Merlijn the Trader has shared a video chart analysis comparing Bitcoin’s current pattern to the long-term Cup and Handle structure Silver formed before its legendary rally in 2017. The analyst noted that Silver spent nearly a decade building a broad base, which caused many investors to lose interest, before the price finally cleared the $54 level and surged higher . Merlijn the Trader recalled a 2017 conversation in which someone predicted that Silver would jump to $80, while he argued that a break above $54 would open the door to a move toward a lower target range of $70-$75. At the time, Silver’s chart formed a rounded bottom between 2011 and 2023, with a flat resistance level near its previous high. After breaking through that level, a handle formed, which quickly led to a violent repricing that pushed Silver beyond the range it had been stuck in for years. Merlijn the Trader said Bitcoin is showing the same long base and slow climb that Silver had before its big move in 2017. On the chart, the BTC price bottomed during the 2022 bear market and has been steadily rising toward its previous highs, forming a rounded “cup” that matches the structure seen on the Silver. The chart also highlights a resistance zone around $70,000, where BTC was repeatedly rejected before finally breaking through. Once it cleared that level, the cryptocurrency formed a rising handle that resembles the final consolidation Silver made before its explosive move higher. According to Merlijn the Trader, Bitcoin’s pattern reflects sellers’ exhaustion after a long period of sideways trading. He explained that once the last sellers in the market are gone, BTC is free to reprice just as dramatically as Silver did in 2017. Possible Target For BTC Repricing In classical technical analysis, traders often use the height of the cup in a Cup and Handle pattern to predict the breakout trajectory of a coin. For BTC, this suggests a potential repricing target of $120,000-$140,000 if the handle resolves like Silver’s did in 2017. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading near $92,000, so reaching that range would require a gain of more than 30%.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|silver|Silver news|Silver price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-14 02:00:22

The address staked an additional 94,400 ETH, valued at approximately $314 million, bringing its total staked Ethereum holdings to 1,530,784 ETH worth $5.1 billion. This substantial move represents one of the largest single-entity staking activities observed in 2025 and provides crucial insights into institutional blockchain participation trends. Bitmine’s expanding Ethereum staking position The recent transaction represents a continuation of Bitmine’s established staking strategy. According to on-chain data analysis, the address has been consistently accumulating and staking Ethereum over multiple quarters. This latest addition of 94,400 ETH follows a pattern of strategic accumulation during various market conditions. The total staked amount now represents approximately 1.27% of all staked Ethereum on the Beacon Chain, making this entity one of the largest single validators in the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum staking involves locking cryptocurrency to support network operations and security. Validators who stake their ETH help process transactions and create new blocks. In return, they earn rewards typically ranging from 3-5% annually. The Ethereum network transitioned to proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022, fundamentally changing how the blockchain secures transactions and validates new blocks. This shift created new opportunities for institutional investors seeking yield from their cryptocurrency holdings. Ethereum staking ecosystem analysis The Ethereum staking landscape has evolved significantly since the network’s transition to proof-of-stake. Currently, over 32 million ETH worth approximately $107 billion sits staked on the Beacon Chain. This represents about 26% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Major staking entities include: Liquid staking protocols like Lido Finance, which control approximately 31% of staked ETH Centralized exchanges including Coinbase and Binance, which collectively manage about 22% Solo validators and institutional entities like the Bitmine-linked address, representing diversified participation The growth of Ethereum staking correlates directly with network security improvements. Higher staking participation increases the economic cost of attacking the network, thereby enhancing overall security. Furthermore, staking reduces circulating supply, potentially creating upward price pressure during periods of high demand. Market analysts monitor staking flows as indicators of long-term holder confidence and network health. Technical implications of large-scale staking Large staking positions like Bitmine’s require sophisticated technical infrastructure. Each Ethereum validator requires 32 ETH to activate, meaning the address operates approximately 47,837 individual validators. Managing this scale necessitates: Enterprise-grade hardware with 99.9%+ uptime requirements Advanced key management and security protocols Geographically distributed infrastructure for redundancy Compliance with evolving network upgrade requirements The technical complexity increases operational costs but also creates significant barriers to entry, potentially leading to increased centralization concerns. However, the Ethereum community continues developing solutions like distributed validator technology (DVT) to mitigate these risks while maintaining network security. Market context and institutional adoption The timing of this staking activity coincides with several positive developments for Ethereum. The network recently implemented the Prague/Electra upgrade, which introduced proto-danksharding and improved transaction efficiency. Additionally, regulatory clarity in major markets has increased institutional confidence in cryptocurrency investments. Several factors contribute to current staking trends: Factor Impact on Staking Evidence Regulatory clarity Increased institutional participation SEC approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024 Network upgrades Improved staking economics Reduced validator requirements in recent hard forks Market maturity Professional infrastructure development Growth of institutional staking service providers Institutional investors typically approach cryptocurrency staking with different considerations than retail participants. They prioritize security, compliance, and risk management alongside yield generation. The scale of Bitmine’s staking activity suggests confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability as both a technological platform and investment vehicle. This confidence appears justified by the network’s continued development and growing adoption across decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and enterprise blockchain solutions. Comparative analysis with other blockchain networks Ethereum’s staking model differs significantly from other proof-of-stake networks. While networks like Solana and Cardano employ similar consensus mechanisms, their economic models and validator requirements vary substantially. Ethereum’s 32 ETH minimum per validator creates higher barriers to entry but potentially greater decentralization through broader participation. The network’s slashing conditions—penalties for validator misbehavior—are also more nuanced, balancing security requirements with validator protection. Other networks typically feature lower minimum staking requirements but may have different security trade-offs. The Ethereum approach prioritizes network security and decentralization, even at the cost of higher participation barriers. This philosophical difference explains why large institutional validators like Bitmine play such a significant role in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem compared to other networks where retail participation dominates. Future implications and network development The continued growth of institutional staking has several implications for Ethereum’s future development. First, it provides stable, long-term security for the network. Second, it creates economic incentives for continued protocol improvement. Third, it establishes Ethereum as a legitimate asset class for institutional portfolios. Looking forward, several developments could further influence staking dynamics: Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7251 proposes changes to validator reward structures Increased liquid staking derivative integration with traditional finance systems Cross-chain staking solutions enabling participation across multiple networks Regulatory frameworks specifically addressing staking services and taxation Network developers continue working on solutions to balance decentralization with institutional participation. Technologies like restaking, introduced by protocols like EigenLayer, create new economic security models while maintaining network integrity. These innovations demonstrate Ethereum’s adaptive capacity and continued relevance in the evolving blockchain landscape. Conclusion The Bitmine-linked address staking an additional $314 million in ETH represents more than just a large financial transaction. It signifies growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model and long-term viability. With total staked holdings now exceeding $5.1 billion, this entity demonstrates commitment to network security and participation. The Ethereum staking ecosystem continues maturing, balancing institutional participation with decentralization principles. As blockchain technology evolves, large-scale validators will play increasingly important roles in network operations and security. The Bitmine ETH staking activity provides valuable insights into current market trends and future development directions for the entire cryptocurrency sector. FAQs Q1: What does Ethereum staking involve? Ethereum staking involves locking ETH cryptocurrency to support network operations under proof-of-stake consensus. Validators process transactions and create new blocks, earning rewards typically between 3-5% annually while helping secure the network. Q2: How significant is a $314 million staking transaction? This transaction represents one of the largest single-entity staking moves in 2025. The Bitmine-linked address now controls approximately 1.27% of all staked Ethereum, making it a major network participant with significant influence on security and operations. Q3: What are the risks of large-scale staking? Major risks include technical failures, slashing penalties for validator misbehavior, liquidity constraints during lock-up periods, and potential centralization concerns. Large validators must maintain enterprise-grade infrastructure with high uptime requirements to avoid financial penalties. Q4: How does staking affect Ethereum’s price? Staking reduces circulating supply, potentially creating upward price pressure during high demand periods. However, the relationship is complex and influenced by multiple factors including overall market conditions, network usage, and broader cryptocurrency trends. Q5: What distinguishes institutional staking from retail participation? Institutional staking typically involves larger amounts, professional infrastructure, compliance considerations, and different risk management approaches. Institutions often use dedicated service providers and implement sophisticated security protocols not typically available to retail participants.

Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.09307 Market Cap $156.31M Trading Volume $26.34M Circulating Supply 1.634B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.074 (Jan 2, 2026) 24-hour High $0.0974 24-hour Low $0.0854 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 31.90% (Extremely High) 50-Day SMA $0.1717 14-Day RSI 33.26 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.3028 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The daily trend is firmly bearish below $0.114. 4-hour bounces are weak and capped under $0.10. If FLOW loses $0.095, the downside continuation will accelerate. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the daily chart for January 14, Flow is trading near $0.096, continuing to print lower highs and lower lows after the sharp breakdown from the $0.14–$0.15 region. The price is hugging the lower Bollinger Band, signaling persistent downside pressure rather than a mean-reversion bounce. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is deeply suppressed around 29, confirming oversold conditions but with no meaningful bullish divergence yet. Likewise, the MACD remains negative, although histogram contraction hints that selling momentum is slowing, not reversing. As long as Flow remains below the mid-band near $0.114, the broader daily structure stays decisively bearish, with downside risk still active toward $0.085–$0.08. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, price is consolidating just under $0.10 after repeated failed recovery attempts, with the Alligator averages still clearly stacked bearishly. The recent rejection from $0.10–$0.102 reinforces this zone as immediate resistance, while support sits thin around $0.095. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI is hovering in the low 40s, showing mild relief but no momentum shift, and MACD remains flat-to-negative, reflecting a lack of aggressive buyers. This structure suggests distribution at lows rather than accumulation, increasing the risk of another leg down if $0.095 fails cleanly. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.09115 BUY SMA 5 $0.09363 SELL SMA 10 $0.09430 SELL SMA 21 $0.1142 SELL SMA 50 $0.1717 SELL SMA 100 $0.2262 SELL SMA 200 $0.3028 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.09433 SELL EMA 5 $0.09370 SELL EMA 10 $0.09996 SELL EMA 21 $0.1233 SELL EMA 50 $0.1708 SELL EMA 100 $0.2236 SELL EMA 200 $0.2909 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow remains technically weak across both timeframes, with oversold conditions slowing the sell-off but not changing trend direction. A sustained reclaim above $0.114 is required to shift the daily bias, while failure to hold $0.095 likely exposes deeper downside toward $0.085. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming years. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $1-$2 by 2032. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow A security incident was reported on Flow.

57144338,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261304,1768358411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Revolut Stablecoin Payments Skyrocket 156% to $10.5 Billion, Signaling Massive Digital Finance Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/revolut-stablecoin-payments-surge-2025/,"BitcoinWorld Revolut Stablecoin Payments Skyrocket 156% to $10.5 Billion, Signaling Massive Digital Finance Shift LONDON, March 2025 – Revolut, the London-based financial technology giant, has reported a staggering 156% increase in stablecoin payment volume, reaching $10.5 billion last year according to verified financial data. This explosive growth fundamentally reshapes the digital payments landscape while demonstrating accelerating mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Furthermore, stablecoins now represent 0.583% of Revolut’s total payment volume, nearly doubling their previous share and establishing a significant new transaction corridor. Revolut Stablecoin Payments: Analyzing the $10.5 Billion Surge The $10.5 billion stablecoin payment volume represents a monumental shift in user behavior. For comparison, this figure exceeds the annual GDP of several small nations. Revolut processed these transactions through its integrated cryptocurrency platform, which supports multiple stablecoins including USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). The platform’s seamless interface bridges traditional banking with digital asset functionality. Consequently, users can convert fiat currencies to stablecoins instantly. They can then send cross-border payments with minimal fees and settlement times measured in minutes rather than days. Industry analysts attribute this growth to several converging factors. First, Revolut’s global user base expanded to over 40 million customers worldwide. Second, increasing merchant acceptance of stablecoin payments created more utility. Third, volatile traditional currency markets in certain regions drove demand for dollar-pegged alternatives. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, fully implemented in 2024, provided crucial regulatory clarity. This framework established consumer protection standards that increased institutional and retail confidence in stablecoin transactions. The Infrastructure Behind the Growth Revolut invested heavily in blockchain infrastructure throughout 2023-2024. The company developed proprietary systems for real-time transaction monitoring and compliance verification. These systems automatically screen transactions against global sanctions lists. They also ensure adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) requirements across multiple jurisdictions. The technical architecture supports transactions on Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana blockchains. This multi-chain approach provides users with flexibility in network selection based on speed and cost preferences. Stablecoin Adoption Trends in Global Neobanking Revolut’s experience reflects broader industry patterns across the digital banking sector. Competitors including N26, Monzo, and Chime have similarly integrated cryptocurrency features, though with varying approaches. The table below illustrates how major neobanks compare in their stablecoin implementations: Neobank Stablecoin Support Transaction Volume (2024) Primary Use Cases Revolut USDC, USDT, EURC $10.5B Cross-border payments, trading, merchant payments N26 Limited crypto trading only Not disclosed Investment exposure Monzo Third-party integrations Estimated $1.2B Peer-to-peer transfers Chime No direct support N/A Traditional banking only This comparative data reveals Revolut’s first-mover advantage in fully integrating stablecoins into core banking functions. The 0.583% share of total payments, while seemingly modest, represents billions in transaction value. More importantly, it establishes a growth trajectory that financial analysts project will accelerate. Traditional banks process approximately $5 trillion daily in cross-border payments. Even fractional adoption of stablecoin technology within this massive market creates enormous volume potential. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Framework The regulatory landscape evolved significantly during Revolut’s growth period. The United Kingdom implemented its comprehensive crypto asset regime in 2024. Meanwhile, the United States progressed with clearer stablecoin legislation through the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. These developments created more predictable operating environments for financial institutions. Revolut’s compliance team expanded to over 300 specialists focusing specifically on cryptocurrency regulations. Their work ensures all stablecoin transactions meet jurisdictional requirements across Revolut’s 50+ markets. Impact on Traditional Payment Systems and Banking Infrastructure Traditional payment networks face mounting pressure from stablecoin innovations. SWIFT, the global bank messaging system, typically settles cross-border transactions in 1-5 business days. Stablecoin transactions on Revolut’s platform often settle in under 5 minutes. This dramatic improvement in settlement speed addresses a longstanding pain point for businesses and individuals. Correspondent banking relationships, which add layers of cost and complexity, become less necessary with direct blockchain settlement. The cost structure difference proves equally significant. Traditional international wire transfers frequently incur fees of $25-$50 per transaction. Stablecoin transfers on Revolut typically cost less than $1 regardless of amount. For migrant workers sending remittances to families abroad, this represents substantial savings. World Bank data indicates global remittance flows exceeded $800 billion in 2024. Even modest adoption of stablecoin technology could save consumers billions annually in transfer fees. Speed advantage: Minutes versus days for cross-border settlement Cost reduction: 90%+ lower fees compared to traditional methods Accessibility improvement: 24/7 availability without banking holidays Transparency benefit: Public blockchain verification of transactions Technical Implementation and Security Measures Revolut’s engineering team developed sophisticated custody solutions for customer assets. The majority of stablecoins remain in cold storage with institutional-grade security protocols. Multi-signature wallets require multiple authorized personnel for access. Regular third-party security audits occur quarterly. Insurance coverage protects against potential breaches or losses. These measures exceed standard banking security requirements. They address unique blockchain-related risks while maintaining user accessibility for frequent transactions. Future Projections and Industry Implications Financial analysts project continued exponential growth in stablecoin payment volumes. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates the total stablecoin market will exceed $3 trillion by 2027. Revolut’s current trajectory suggests it will capture increasing market share. The company plans to expand stablecoin support to additional currencies including GBP-pegged alternatives. Geographic expansion into Asian markets presents another growth avenue. Partnerships with e-commerce platforms could further integrate stablecoin payments into everyday transactions. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) represent both competition and potential synergy. The Bank of England’s digital pound, currently in development, may eventually integrate with private stablecoin systems. This public-private hybrid model could combine regulatory oversight with innovation speed. Revolut executives have participated in multiple CBDC working groups. They advocate for interoperable systems that maintain consumer choice while ensuring financial stability. Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Fintech Research Director at Cambridge University, explains the broader significance: “Revolut’s 156% growth isn’t merely a corporate metric. It reflects structural changes in how people move value globally. The doubling of stablecoin’s payment share indicates fundamental behavioral shifts. Users increasingly recognize the practical advantages of blockchain-based transfers. However, sustainable growth requires continued focus on regulatory compliance and risk management.” Michael Chen, Payment Systems Analyst at Deloitte, adds technical context: “The infrastructure supporting this volume deserves examination. Revolut processes approximately $28.8 million in stablecoin payments daily. This requires robust blockchain node management, liquidity provisioning, and real-time monitoring systems. Their technical achievements enable the user experience simplicity that drives adoption.” Conclusion Revolut’s stablecoin payment volume reaching $10.5 billion with 156% year-over-year growth marks a pivotal moment in financial technology evolution. The near-doubling of stablecoin’s share in total payments to 0.583% demonstrates accelerating mainstream adoption. This growth trajectory results from strategic infrastructure investment, regulatory compliance, and genuine user utility. As traditional payment systems face innovation pressure, Revolut’s experience provides a blueprint for integrating blockchain technology at scale. The convergence of neobanking and cryptocurrency continues reshaping global finance, with stablecoin payments emerging as a fundamental component of modern financial infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What exactly are stablecoins and how do they differ from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar or euro. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, they maintain consistent value. This stability makes them suitable for payments and transfers. Revolut primarily supports USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). Q2: Why would someone use stablecoin payments instead of traditional bank transfers? Stablecoin payments offer three main advantages: significantly lower fees (often under $1), faster settlement (minutes versus days), and 24/7 availability. They’re particularly beneficial for cross-border transactions where traditional banking systems remain slow and expensive. Q3: Is my money safe when using stablecoins on Revolut? Revolut implements multiple security measures including cold storage for most assets, multi-signature wallets, regular security audits, and insurance coverage. Regulatory compliance with frameworks like MiCA in Europe provides additional consumer protections for qualified stablecoins. Q4: How does the 0.583% stablecoin payment share translate to real-world usage? While 0.583% seems small, it represents billions in transaction value within Revolut’s massive payment volume. More importantly, it indicates rapid growth from previously negligible levels. This trajectory suggests increasing mainstream adoption as more users discover the benefits. Q5: What does this growth mean for the future of traditional banking? Traditional banks face increasing pressure to modernize payment infrastructure. The speed and cost advantages of stablecoin systems will likely push traditional institutions to either develop competing solutions or partner with fintech companies. This innovation ultimately benefits consumers through better services.

57144479,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261303,1768358711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"DZ Bank’s Revolutionary ‘meinKrypto’ Platform Launches, Bringing Regulated Digital Assets to Millions of German Savers",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dz-bank-meinkrypto-platform-launch/,"BitcoinWorld DZ Bank’s Revolutionary ‘meinKrypto’ Platform Launches, Bringing Regulated Digital Assets to Millions of German Savers In a landmark move for European finance, DZ Bank has officially launched its proprietary cryptocurrency platform, meinKrypto , marking a pivotal shift in how traditional banking institutions engage with digital assets. This launch, reported by Cointelegraph and occurring in Frankfurt, Germany, in late 2024, follows the platform’s formal approval under the European Union’s pioneering Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Consequently, the platform will initially support four major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA), offering a secure gateway for its vast network. DZ Bank’s meinKrypto Platform Enters the Regulated Arena DZ Bank, acting as the central institution for Germany’s cooperative financial network, supports over 700 local cooperative banks (Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken). Therefore, the launch of meinKrypto is not an isolated product release. Instead, it represents a strategic infrastructure deployment for a significant portion of the German retail banking sector. The platform’s existence directly results from evolving client demand and a clearer regulatory landscape. Initially, the service will provide custody and trading for a carefully selected quartet of cryptocurrencies, signaling a conservative yet confident entry into the market. This development arrives at a critical juncture. Major financial hubs globally are competing to establish dominance in the digital asset space. Germany, with its stringent financial regulations and strong economy, is positioning itself as a leader in compliant crypto finance. The choice of initial assets reflects a focus on established networks with substantial market capitalization and developer activity. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum serve as the foundational layer one protocols. Meanwhile, Litecoin offers a tested payments-focused alternative, and Cardano brings a proof-of-stake, research-driven approach. The MiCA Regulation: A Framework for Trust The launch’s timing is inextricably linked to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. MiCA, finalized in 2023 and applying fully from 2025, establishes a harmonized regulatory regime for crypto-assets across the EU’s 27 member states. Crucially, it provides legal clarity for issuers and service providers, mandating strict requirements for transparency, disclosure, authorization, and supervision of transactions. For a conservative institution like DZ Bank, operating within this clear regulatory perimeter was a non-negotiable prerequisite. MiCA’s provisions effectively bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By requiring crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to be licensed, it instills a level of consumer protection and market integrity previously absent in much of the crypto space. DZ Bank’s approval under this framework allows it to leverage its existing reputation for security and trust. Subsequently, it can translate that trust into the digital asset domain, offering customers a familiar and regulated environment. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Financial analysts view this launch as a bellwether for broader institutional adoption. “The entry of a pillar of the German cooperative banking system into digital asset custody is a profound validation of the asset class,” notes Dr. Lena Schmidt, a fintech regulation professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance. “It signals to other risk-averse European banks that providing crypto services is not only feasible under MiCA but may soon become a competitive necessity. The curated asset selection shows a phased, risk-managed approach that other institutions will likely emulate.” Furthermore, the move aligns with growing asset allocation trends. A 2024 survey by the German Asset Management Association revealed that nearly 18% of institutional investors in Germany had some exposure to cryptocurrencies, a figure expected to double by 2026. DZ Bank’s platform provides the essential, regulated plumbing to facilitate this growing demand from both retail customers accessing crypto through their local bank and institutional clients requiring sophisticated custody solutions. Technical Implementation and Strategic Implications While DZ Bank has disclosed few technical specifics, the architecture of meinKrypto likely involves a hybrid custody model. Typically, such institutional platforms combine secure, insured cold storage for the majority of assets with a hot wallet system for facilitating transactions. Security remains the paramount concern, especially following high-profile exchange failures in previous years. The bank’s existing robust cybersecurity frameworks and compliance departments provide a significant advantage over native crypto startups. The strategic implications are multifaceted. For the German cooperative banking network, it offers a defensive product to retain customers who might otherwise seek crypto exposure through unregulated or foreign exchanges. It also creates a potential new revenue stream through trading fees and custody services. On a macro scale, it further integrates digital assets into the formal economy, enhancing transaction traceability and tax compliance. The platform’s design choices, such as the supported assets, will also influence market perceptions and liquidity for those specific cryptocurrencies. Initial Digital Assets on meinKrypto Asset Symbol Primary Use Case Consensus Mechanism Bitcoin BTC Digital Gold / Store of Value Proof-of-Work Ethereum ETH Smart Contract Platform Proof-of-Stake Litecoin LTC Peer-to-Peer Payments Proof-of-Work Cardano ADA Smart Contracts & DApps Proof-of-Stake Comparative Landscape and Future Roadmap DZ Bank is not the first German bank to explore crypto. However, its scale and central role in the cooperative network make it uniquely influential. Other German financial institutions have taken varied approaches: Commerzbank: Received a crypto custody license in 2023, focusing on institutional clients. Deutsche Bank: Partnered with Swiss crypto firm Taurus for custody and tokenization services. Sparkassen: The savings banks association has piloted crypto services but without a unified national platform yet. The meinKrypto launch likely represents only phase one. Industry observers anticipate a future roadmap that may include: Expansion of the supported cryptocurrency list, potentially including other major assets like Solana (SOL) or Polkadot (DOT). Integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for staking or yield-generation services, albeit in a heavily regulated wrapper. Exploration of tokenized traditional assets, such as bonds or funds, on blockchain networks. Broader rollout to the bank’s institutional and corporate client base. This phased expansion will depend on regulatory developments, market stability, and internal risk assessments. Nevertheless, the initial launch breaks a significant barrier, proving the operational model within a major, traditional bank. Conclusion The launch of DZ Bank’s meinKrypto platform is a transformative event in the convergence of traditional and digital finance. By leveraging the trust of Germany’s cooperative banking network and operating under the EU’s definitive MiCA regulation, it provides a secure, compliant on-ramp for millions of customers. This move significantly legitimizes the underlying technology and asset class, encouraging further institutional adoption. While starting with a focused selection of four cryptocurrencies, the platform’s establishment paves the way for a future where digital asset services are a standard offering within the European banking landscape. The success of meinKrypto will be closely watched as a benchmark for how traditional finance can successfully and securely embrace the digital asset revolution. FAQs Q1: What is DZ Bank’s meinKrypto platform? A1: MeinKrypto is a regulated cryptocurrency custody and trading platform launched by Germany’s DZ Bank. It allows customers of associated cooperative banks to buy, sell, and securely hold digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum under EU financial rules. Q2: Why is the MiCA regulation important for this launch? A2: The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides a unified legal framework across the European Union. DZ Bank’s approval under MiCA ensures the platform meets strict standards for consumer protection, transparency, and operational integrity, which was essential for the bank’s participation. Q3: Which cryptocurrencies are available on meinKrypto initially? A3: The platform launched with support for four digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA). This selection represents a mix of store-of-value, smart contract, and payments-focused cryptocurrencies. Q4: Who can use the meinKrypto service? A4: Initially, the service is available to retail and business customers of the local cooperative banks (Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken) that are part of DZ Bank’s network, which includes millions of account holders across Germany.

Over the past week, the network recorded about 327,100 new Ether wallets being created per day. Fresh on-chain data shows Sunday set a new high with roughly 393,600 wallets created in a single day. That was the largest daily increase ever recorded for Ethereum. This comes in when the global crypto market is printing green indexes, led by bulls. The cumulative digital assets market cap surged by more than 4% in the last 24 hours to hit $3.25 trillion mark. Ether price has jumped by over 7% in the past 30 days as Bitcoin safely regained the $95K mark. Lower fees spark fresh activity on Ethereum A sudden jump in ETH wallets follows a protocol upgrade that got rolled out in early December. The Fusaka upgrade changed how data is handled on the network. It has lowered costs for L2 systems to post information back to Ethereum. This move has made transactions cheaper and smoother for users on the network. The average gas costs fell to 0.051 Gwei. Ethereum Gas Price; Source: Etherscan A dip in the fees is pumping up the activity for the network. Santiment data shows that the stablecoin transfers on Ethereum reached a record late last year. The total volumes hit about $8 trillion in Q4. Payments and settlement flows at that scale often require new wallets. This suggests that users were bagging ETH when its price dipped, which eventually backed the address growth. Santiment data mentioned that trends from late December into January also point to new users entering the ecosystem. However, wallets are being created as users explore decentralised finance games and NFT-related applications. It added that seasonal factors may have played a role. Crypto markets often see renewed runs around the turn of the year. Traders and developers tend to reset strategies. Crypto Fear and Greed Index shows that investor sentiment has turned “Neutral” after spending weeks in the “Fear” territory. Ether had failed multiple times to hold above $3,300 over the past two months. The fresh push has helped ETH to overcome this barrier. Ethereum price surged by almost 8% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $3,348 at the press time. DEX trading pulls back Activity across decentralised apps seems to be cooling down. DefiLlama data shows that aggregate DEX volumes over the past two weeks totalled $150.4 billion. This number dipped sharply from the $340 billion record set in January 2025. Ethereum seven day DEX volumes have hovered near $9 billion. It went on to peak at $27.8 billion in October. Derivatives markets also point to calmer conditions. 30-day implied volatility measures tied to Bitcoin and Ether have declined. These indicators reflect hopes for price swings. Lower readings suggest traders are looking for reduced near-term movement. This comes despite ongoing geopolitical risks and shifts in ETF flows. At the same time, SharpLink Gaming has expanded its exposure to the asset. The company has accumulated more than 865,000 ETH. The stake was valued at about $2.75 billion as of Tuesday.

The token initially soared to a market cap of $580 million but has since fallen sharply to approximately $133 million. Eric Adams Under Fire In a promotional video, Adams declared, “We’re about to change the game. This thing is about to take off like crazy.” However, the excitement was short-lived as evidence surfaced suggesting that the steep decline in value resulted from a significant sell-off involving a user connected to the NYC Token’s development team. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Blockchain analysis platform Bubblemaps flagged potentially concerning activity linked to the NYC Token. Notably, a wallet associated with the token’s deployer withdrew around $2.5 million in liquidity when the token peaked. Although about $1.5 million was returned after the token’s value dropped by 60%, approximately $900,000 remains unreturned. This has led users on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to accuse Adams of orchestrating a crypto rug pull. Adams, who has been an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrency, stated during a Monday event that some of the funds generated by the NYC Token would be directed towards nonprofits focused on combating antisemitism and “anti-Americanism.” Additionally, he expressed intentions to use the proceeds to “teach our children about embracing blockchain technology.” The NYC Token’s official website states there is a total supply of one billion tokens in circulation, and details reveal that 10 percent of profits are allocated to the team’s activities, though the identities of those involved were not disclosed. NYC Token Team Responds In response to criticism, the NYC Token team acknowledged the liquidity withdrawal, stating, “Given the overwhelming support and demand for the token at launch, our partners had to rebalance the liquidity.” They added, “We’re in it for the long haul!” However, there remains uncertainty about the details surrounding the token’s launch, with a recently listed entity, C18 Digital, associated with the project. Delaware corporation records show that C18 Digital was incorporated on December 30, 2025. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Typically, when a cryptocurrency launches, developers create a liquidity pool using various assets, such as Circle’s USDC or Solana (SOL), to allow users to buy and sell the new token. The NYC Token took a different approach by establishing a one-sided liquidity pool comprised solely of the token itself. As users began purchasing the token, they injected liquidity into the pool using USDC, which was followed by the significant withdrawal of $2.5 million. This tactic, described by analyst Vaiman, can be more subtle than direct token sell-offs. Following the viral reports of the alleged rug pull, a new account associated with the NYC Token announced that additional funds had been injected into the liquidity pool.

57144779,657305,1768359620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57144779.jpeg,Bitcoin Institutional Shift: CLARITY Act Nears Senate Review,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-institutional-shift-clarity-act-near-senate/,"Bitcoin has spent several weeks struggling around a pivotal price range, frustrating traders and reinforcing bearish narratives across the market. After failing to reclaim key resistance levels, a growing number of analysts are calling for a broader bear market to unfold. Price action has been choppy, momentum has faded, and volatility has compressed—conditions that often amplify pessimism. Yet beneath the surface, some analysts argue that Bitcoin is no longer behaving as it did in previous cycles. According to this view, the market structure itself is changing. Long-term holders appear less reactive, sell-side pressure has moderated, and on-chain activity suggests a slower, more deliberate market. Rather than a reflexive risk asset, Bitcoin is increasingly traded and held with a longer time horizon. This shift becomes especially relevant as the policy backdrop evolves in the United States. The US Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to mark up the crypto market structure bill known as the CLARITY Act on January 15, 2026. This event should not be interpreted as a short-term price catalyst. Instead, it represents a potential inflection point in how Bitcoin is positioned within the US regulatory framework. While prices remain relatively stable, on-chain data already hints at a market adapting to a more institutional, regulated environment. The implication is clear: Bitcoin may be entering a structurally different phase , even as sentiment remains divided. On-Chain Signals Point to Patience, Not De-Risking A report by CryptoQuant, authored by XWIN Research Japan, highlights that Exchange Netflow remains a critical signal in the current environment. Historically, periods of regulatory uncertainty tend to push Bitcoin into exchanges as investors prepare to sell or reduce exposure. Ahead of the upcoming CLARITY bill discussions, however, this behavior has not materialized. Exchange inflows have stayed relatively muted, suggesting that market participants are not positioning defensively or treating the legislative process as an immediate threat. SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) reinforces this interpretation. The metric, which measures whether moved coins are sold at a profit or a loss, is hovering around or slightly below the 1.0 threshold. This indicates subdued profit-taking activity. More importantly, it implies that on-chain spending itself remains low. In simple terms, Bitcoin is not being moved aggressively, either to realize gains or to exit positions. Together, Exchange Netflow and SOPR point to a market posture that is patient rather than defensive. Investors appear willing to hold through uncertainty instead of rotating capital or rushing to de-risk. The time horizon is clearly lengthening. From this perspective, the CLARITY Act represents more than a policy debate. It marks a potential step toward integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. financial framework as a regulated digital commodity. On-chain data already reflects this shift: before any major price move, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly “sticky,” signaling a transition away from speculative trading and toward institutional-grade holding behavior. Bitcoin Price Consolidation Continues Bitcoin price action remains constrained within a well-defined consolidation range, following the sharp correction that began in November. After rejecting from the $120K–$125K region, BTC experienced an impulsive sell-off that found a local bottom near the mid-$80K zone, where demand visibly stepped in. Since then, price has been carving a higher low structure, suggesting that downside momentum is gradually weakening. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is now attempting to stabilize above the $92K area, which aligns closely with a former support-turned-resistance level. This zone has acted as a pivot throughout the current range and remains critical for short-term direction. A sustained hold above it would strengthen the case for a broader recovery toward the $98K–$100K region, where the declining short-term moving averages converge. However, the broader trend remains technically fragile. Price is still trading below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, both of which are sloping downward. This indicates that the medium-term structure has not yet shifted back to bullish. Volume also remains relatively muted, reinforcing the idea that this move is corrective rather than impulsive. As long as Bitcoin remains trapped between roughly $88K and $95K, the market is likely to remain range-bound. A decisive break above resistance or a loss of current support will be required to resolve this consolidation phase and define the next directional move.

This historic surge represents a single-day gain of 5.16%, fundamentally reshaping the landscape for precious metals investors and industrial users worldwide. The dramatic move eclipses previous records set over a decade ago, signaling a potent convergence of macroeconomic forces and shifting investor sentiment. Spot Silver Price Shatters Decades-Old Records The journey to $90 represents a monumental breakthrough. For context, the previous all-time high for silver stood at approximately $49.50, set in April 2011. Consequently, the recent price action marks an increase of over 80% from that prior peak. Market analysts immediately noted the velocity of the ascent. Trading volumes on major commodity exchanges like COMEX spiked by over 200% compared to the monthly average. Furthermore, the rally occurred alongside significant gains in gold, which also tested its own record levels. This synchronous movement underscores a broad-based flight to tangible assets. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) confirmed the benchmark price settlement, adding institutional validation to the milestone. Key Drivers Behind the Precious Metals Rally Several interconnected factors propelled silver to its unprecedented valuation. Primarily, persistent global inflationary pressures continue to erode fiat currency values, enhancing the appeal of hard assets. Central bank policies, particularly those of the Federal Reserve, remain a critical watchpoint for traders. Simultaneously, robust industrial demand forms a powerful fundamental base. Silver is a critical component in photovoltaic cells for solar energy, electric vehicles, and 5G infrastructure. The global push for green energy, notably the 2030 decarbonization targets, directly increases consumption. Geopolitical tensions in resource-rich regions have also disrupted supply chains, compounding scarcity concerns. Finally, substantial inflows into physically-backed silver ETFs, such as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), demonstrate strong institutional and retail investment demand. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Sentiment Market strategists point to a unique structural shift. “This isn’t merely a speculative bubble,” notes Dr. Anya Sharma, Head of Commodities Research at Global Markets Insight. “We are witnessing a fundamental repricing based on silver’s dual role as both a monetary metal and an indispensable industrial commodity. The supply-demand equation has tightened considerably, with mine production growth lagging behind consumption forecasts from the Silver Institute.” Technical analysts highlight that the break above the long-term resistance level near $50 opened a path for accelerated gains. Sentiment indicators, like the Silver Institute’s survey of fabricators, show expectations for continued tightness in the physical market throughout 2025. Historical Context and Price Performance Timeline Understanding this rally requires a look at silver’s volatile history. The metal’s price was famously manipulated during the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market in 1980, peaking near $50 (inflation-adjusted). After the 2011 high, a long bear market ensued, with prices languishing below $20 for much of the late 2010s. The turnaround began in 2020, fueled by pandemic-related stimulus and supply concerns. The following table illustrates key milestones in the recent ascent: Date Price (USD/oz) Catalyst/Event March 2020 ~$12.00 COVID-19 market crash low August 2020 $28.00 Peak of initial pandemic rally February 2021 $30.00 Reddit-fueled retail buying surge Q4 2023 $25.00 Consolidation phase January 2025 $45.00 Break above 2011 high resistance April 10, 2025 $90.00 (intraday) New All-Time High This timeline clearly shows the acceleration of gains following the decisive break of the $50 level, a classic technical pattern. Implications for Investors and the Global Economy The surge in the spot silver price carries significant ramifications. For investors, it validates strategies focused on commodity diversification and inflation hedging. However, it also increases volatility risks for short-term traders. Mining equities and royalty companies have experienced outsized gains, often leveraged to the underlying metal price. For industry, higher input costs pose a challenge for manufacturers of electronics, jewelry, and solar panels. This could potentially slow adoption rates or spur increased recycling efforts. On a macroeconomic level, rising precious metals prices are traditionally viewed as a barometer of declining confidence in fiat currencies and a hedge against systemic financial risk. Central banks may monitor this trend as they assess their own reserve asset allocations. The Critical Role of Industrial Demand Unlike gold, silver’s price has a substantial anchor in real-world consumption. Approximately 50% of annual demand originates from industrial applications. Key growth sectors include: Photovoltaics (Solar Panels): The Silver Institute projects this sector will consume over 150 million ounces in 2025. Electronics: Essential for conductors, contacts, and solders in everything from smartphones to automotive systems. Electric Vehicles: Each EV uses significantly more silver than a traditional combustion engine vehicle for electronics and battery management. Medical & Biotechnology: Silver’s antimicrobial properties drive use in coatings and equipment. This broad-based demand creates a price floor that is less susceptible to purely speculative flows. Conclusion The spot silver price reaching a stunning $90 all-time high marks a pivotal chapter in financial markets. This event is not an isolated incident but the result of sustained macroeconomic pressures, robust industrial demand, and shifting investment paradigms. The breach of this historic level confirms silver’s renewed status as a critical strategic asset. Moving forward, market participants will closely watch inventory levels at exchanges, central bank policy signals, and technological adoption rates. The $90 spot silver price serves as a powerful reminder of the metal’s unique position at the intersection of finance, industry, and geopolitics. FAQs Q1: What does ‘spot silver price’ mean? The spot price is the current market price for immediate delivery and payment of silver. It is the benchmark used for pricing physical metal, ETFs, and derivatives at any given moment. Q2: Why is silver’s price more volatile than gold’s? Silver has a smaller overall market value (market cap) than gold, making it more susceptible to large price swings from significant investment inflows or outflows. Its dual nature as both an investment and industrial metal also exposes it to both financial and economic cycles. Q3: How can an individual investor gain exposure to silver? Common methods include purchasing physical bullion (bars or coins), buying shares of a physically-backed Silver ETF (like SLV), investing in silver mining company stocks, or trading futures and options contracts (for advanced investors). Q4: Does high silver prices hurt the solar industry? Potentially, yes. Higher silver costs increase the manufacturing expense of photovoltaic cells. The industry actively researches thrifting technologies to reduce the amount of silver per panel and develops alternative conductive materials to mitigate this cost pressure. Q5: What are the main risks to the current high silver price? Key risks include a sharp, sustained rise in real interest rates, a significant global economic slowdown reducing industrial demand, technological substitution in key applications, and a major increase in mine supply or above-ground inventories.

Total hashrate refers to the total computer power utilized by a company for mining, encompassing both the mining machines owned and operated by the company itself and those operated on behalf of other companies. The change symbolizes a tectonic shift in mining, where, for a long time, MARA had been the first mining company, but Bitdeer’s rise reflects broader trends reshaping the industry. “Bitdeer reported 71 EH/s capacity as of end December (~6% of global hash rate), +18% m/m, +229% y/y,” VanEck Head of Research Matt Sigel said on X. “Like other miners, they are actively selling everything they mine (and more) to fund the AI pivot.” While differences in how these companies report figures make it difficult to declare a definitive leader, Bitdeer now controls a substantially higher total hashrate. Bitdeer’s rise to the top Bitdeer is a technology company based in Singapore, focusing on mining Bitcoin using powerful machines that can solve extremely complex mathematical problems, as well as constructing high-performance computers for AI and other advanced computing applications. The company developed its own mining machines, known as SEALMINER rigs, specifically designed for Bitcoin mining. By December 2025, these rigs had mined 636 Bitcoins, a significant increase from roughly 145 Bitcoins in December 2023. By this time, Bitdeer can self-mine around 55.2 EH/s, but it is mined in segments. The other sum of the power is created by hosting services and cloud services, in which Bitdeer helps others to run their machines. The expansion of Bitdeer has included an increasing number of SEALMINER rigs that it owns and controls directly. Deployed across multiple locations, these machines help the company generate more Bitcoin.” Additionally, the company does not limit itself to Bitcoin mining. It is making investments in artificial intelligence and high-performance computer infrastructure in locations such as Canada, Ethiopia, Norway, and the United States. This implies that Bitdeer is attempting to establish a presence in the Bitcoin and high-performance computing sectors of the artificial intelligence industry. What makes MARA different MARA Holdings is an older company that mines Bitcoin. It utilizes machines from another company, Bitmain , and operates numerous large data centers for its mining operations. In contrast to Bitdeer, MARA typically attempts to retain the Bitcoin it mines, rather than selling it. It implies that MARA has amassed one of the largest treasuries of Bitcoin among publicly traded mining companies over the years. Moreover, MARA has access to 18 data centers primarily using Bitmain’s Antminer ASIC mining chips. While MARA is also diversifying into AI operations, the company primarily aims to hold its mined bitcoin, helping to bolster the second-largest BTC treasury among public companies. MARA holds over 55,000 BTC, compared to Strategy’s 687,000 BTC and Bitdeer’s 2,000. Bitdeer was founded in 2020 by Jihan Wu, who co-founded Bitmain and created Bitdeer after splitting from Micree Zhan. Its AI projects disappointed investors in the third quarter of 2025, with a disappointing financial return despite a 173.6% growth in revenue compared to the previous year. On the stock market, Bitdeer (BTDR) is up more than 4% to $12.78, and MARA was up over 2%, at $10.93, according to The Block. Get seen where it counts.

Data from major exchanges reveals a pronounced short squeeze, where traders betting on price declines faced significant losses as the market moved against them. This event underscores the critical risks and mechanics of perpetual futures contracts, which have become a dominant force in crypto market structure. Consequently, understanding these liquidations provides vital insight into current market sentiment and leverage levels. Crypto Futures Liquidations: A $540 Million Market Reset The past 24 hours witnessed substantial crypto futures liquidations, totaling an estimated $540.9 million across the three largest assets by derivatives volume. A liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This mechanism protects the exchange from further loss. Notably, the data shows an overwhelming bias toward short liquidations, indicating a rapid price increase caught many traders off guard. Market analysts often view such concentrated liquidations as a catalyst for further price movement. Forced buying to cover short positions can create upward pressure, potentially fueling a feedback loop. The scale of this event suggests highly leveraged conditions were prevalent across the market. Below is a breakdown of the key liquidation data that sparked significant discussion among traders and analysts globally. Asset Total Liquidated Short Liquidations Long Liquidations Bitcoin (BTC) $294 million 92.06% 7.94% Ethereum (ETH) $214 million 89.11% 10.89% Solana (SOL) $32.9 million 93.45% 6.55% Mechanics of a Short Squeeze in Crypto Markets A short squeeze describes a rapid price increase that forces traders who borrowed and sold an asset to buy it back at a higher price to limit their losses. This covering activity adds more buy-side pressure. In crypto futures markets, this process is automated through liquidation engines. When the price rises against a short position, the trader’s equity decreases. If it falls below the maintenance margin requirement, the exchange’s system intervenes. The system then executes a market order to buy back the asset, closing the position. A cascade of these orders can lead to volatile, explosive price spikes. The recent data, with short ratios exceeding 89% for all three major assets, clearly signals a market-wide short squeeze event. Several factors can precipitate such an event, including: Positive Macro News: Unexpected regulatory clarity or institutional adoption news. Technical Breakouts: Prices moving above key resistance levels, triggering algorithmic buying. Overleveraged Shorts: Excessive borrowing by traders confident in a price drop. Historical Context and Market Impact Similar liquidation events have historically marked local price bottoms or accelerated strong trends. For instance, the bull market of late 2020 and early 2021 saw repeated billion-dollar liquidation days that often preceded continued upward movement. However, large long liquidations typically characterize market tops and crashes. The asymmetry in this event—predominantly shorts—suggests a forceful rejection of downward price action. The immediate impact includes a rapid reduction in open interest, representing the total number of outstanding derivative contracts. This reduction effectively “resets” leverage in the system, potentially creating a healthier foundation for the next price move. Furthermore, the event serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with high leverage, which can amplify gains but also lead to total capital loss very quickly. Analyzing the Asset-Specific Liquidation Data Bitcoin’s $294 million liquidation volume, the largest of the three, reflects its status as the primary market for crypto derivatives. The 92.06% short ratio indicates nearly all forced closures were bearish bets. This often happens when BTC breaches a critical psychological price level, triggering stop-losses and liquidation cascades. Ethereum’s $214 million in liquidations followed a similar pattern, closely tied to its correlation with Bitcoin and developments within its ecosystem. Solana’s data is particularly striking due to its 93.45% short ratio, the highest among the trio. Although the absolute dollar value is smaller, the ratio suggests an even more concentrated and aggressive bet against SOL’s price that was decisively wrong. This can occur with assets perceived as higher beta, where traders use larger leverage for amplified returns, increasing liquidation risk. The event likely cleared out significant speculative froth from the SOL futures market. Expert Perspective on Risk Management Derivatives analysts emphasize that such events highlight the non-custodial risk traders assume. Unlike spot trading, futures involve leverage, borrowed funds, and strict margin rules. Experts from major trading firms consistently advise using conservative leverage, setting stop-loss orders manually away from key technical levels, and never risking more capital than one can afford to lose. The 24-hour crypto futures liquidations event acts as a real-time case study in these principles. Data from funding rates—the periodic payments between long and short position holders—can also provide early warning signs. Persistently negative funding rates often indicate a crowded short trade, setting the stage for a squeeze if prices rise. Monitoring these metrics, alongside open interest and liquidation heatmaps, forms a core part of professional risk assessment in crypto derivatives trading. Conclusion The recent 24-hour crypto futures liquidations, totaling over $540 million, demonstrate the powerful and often unforgiving dynamics of leveraged digital asset markets. The extreme skew toward short liquidations confirms a significant short squeeze across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana markets. These events serve as critical market structure resets, flushing out excessive leverage and realigning positions with current price action. For traders and observers, understanding the causes and effects of such crypto futures liquidations is essential for navigating the high-volatility landscape of cryptocurrency derivatives. Ultimately, they underscore the paramount importance of disciplined risk management. FAQs Q1: What causes a crypto futures liquidation? A liquidation is triggered automatically by an exchange when a leveraged position loses enough value that the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below the required maintenance level. This forces the position to close to prevent further loss. Q2: Why were most of the recent liquidations short positions? The data shows over 89% were short liquidations, meaning the price of BTC, ETH, and SOL rose quickly. Traders who had borrowed and sold these assets, betting on a price drop, were forced to buy them back at higher prices as their positions were liquidated. Q3: What is a “short squeeze”? A short squeeze is a rapid price increase that forces traders with short positions to buy back the asset to cover their bets, limiting losses. This wave of buying can push prices even higher, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates the move. Q4: How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can manage this risk by using lower leverage, depositing additional margin to maintain their position, setting manual stop-loss orders, and avoiding over-concentration in a single, highly leveraged trade. Q5: Do large liquidation events like this predict future price direction? Not definitively. While a massive short squeeze can indicate strong buying pressure and lead to further gains, it can also simply represent a one-time clearing of overleveraged positions. It is one data point among many, including volume, spot market flows, and broader macroeconomic factors.

Russian Crypto Regulation Enters Critical Legislative Phase Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma’s Committee on Financial Markets, confirmed the preparation of a draft bill that would permit retail cryptocurrency investment. According to statements reported by the Russian state news agency TASS, this legislation will receive priority treatment during the spring regular session. Consequently, this development represents a significant policy shift for a nation that has historically maintained a cautious stance toward decentralized digital assets. The Russian government has devoted substantial resources to developing comprehensive digital financial asset frameworks. Moreover, this legislative push aligns with broader global trends toward cryptocurrency integration within traditional financial systems. Bloomberg previously reported Russia’s movement toward allowing retail crypto investment, indicating consistent policy evolution over recent years. Historical Context of Russian Cryptocurrency Policy Russia’s journey toward cryptocurrency regulation has followed a complex path since Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009. Initially, Russian authorities expressed skepticism about decentralized digital currencies. However, the government gradually recognized blockchain technology’s potential benefits. In 2020, Russia passed its first major digital financial assets law, creating a foundational regulatory framework. The following timeline illustrates key developments: Year Regulatory Development Impact 2014 Central Bank warns against cryptocurrency use Initial caution toward digital assets 2020 Digital Financial Assets Law enacted Legal recognition of cryptocurrencies 2022 Ministry of Finance proposes regulatory framework Path toward comprehensive regulation 2024 Experimental crypto payment programs launched Practical testing of digital asset systems 2025 Retail investment bill prepared for discussion Potential mainstream adoption pathway This regulatory evolution demonstrates Russia’s methodical approach to digital asset integration. Furthermore, international sanctions and economic considerations have influenced policy decisions significantly. The current legislative initiative reflects careful balancing between innovation promotion and risk management. Expert Analysis of Regulatory Implications Financial regulation experts note several critical aspects of Russia’s proposed legislation. First, the bill would establish clear guidelines for non-professional investor participation. Second, it would likely include consumer protection mechanisms.

International observers highlight these key considerations: Investor protection frameworks – Required safeguards for retail participants Exchange regulation standards – Oversight mechanisms for trading platforms Taxation protocols – Clear reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions Cross-border transaction rules – Guidelines for international digital asset transfers Technical infrastructure requirements – Security standards for custody solutions These regulatory components will determine the legislation’s practical effectiveness. Additionally, they will influence how quickly Russian citizens adopt cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Global Context and Comparative Regulation Russia’s legislative development occurs within a broader international regulatory landscape. Many nations have established cryptocurrency frameworks with varying approaches to retail investor participation. For instance, the European Union implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in 2024. Similarly, the United States continues developing comprehensive digital asset legislation through multiple regulatory agencies. Comparative analysis reveals several regulatory models: Permissive frameworks – Countries like Switzerland and Singapore Cautious approaches – Nations including India and China Hybrid systems – Jurisdictions such as Japan and South Korea Russia appears positioned to develop a distinctive regulatory model. This model will likely incorporate elements from various international approaches while addressing specific national economic considerations. Economic Impacts and Market Implications The proposed legislation carries significant economic implications for Russia. First, it could stimulate technological innovation within the financial sector. Second, it might attract cryptocurrency-related businesses to establish Russian operations. Third, it could provide citizens with alternative investment vehicles during economic uncertainty. Market analysts identify several potential outcomes: Increased cryptocurrency trading volume through Russian platforms Development of domestic blockchain infrastructure projects Growth in cryptocurrency education and advisory services Enhanced integration between traditional and digital finance Potential ruble-to-cryptocurrency liquidity improvements These developments could position Russia as a significant participant in global digital asset markets. However, successful implementation requires careful regulatory design and enforcement mechanisms. Technical Implementation Challenges Practical implementation of retail cryptocurrency investment presents several technical challenges. Russian authorities must develop robust systems for several critical functions. These include transaction monitoring, investor verification, and platform oversight. Additionally, cybersecurity considerations require particular attention given cryptocurrency’s digital nature. Key implementation areas include: Digital identity verification systems for investor protection Real-time transaction monitoring for regulatory compliance Secure custody solutions for asset protection Interoperability with existing financial infrastructure Dispute resolution mechanisms for investor concerns Russian technology companies have demonstrated capability in blockchain development. Consequently, they may contribute significantly to implementation solutions. International technology partnerships could also facilitate effective system deployment. Conclusion Russia’s proposed retail crypto investment legislation represents a pivotal moment in global cryptocurrency regulation. The spring parliamentary discussion will determine whether non-professional investors gain legal access to digital assets. This Russian crypto regulation development reflects broader trends toward financial digitization worldwide. Successful implementation could establish Russia as a significant digital asset jurisdiction. However, careful legislative design remains essential for balancing innovation with investor protection. The international community will monitor these developments closely as they unfold throughout 2025. FAQs Q1: What does the Russian cryptocurrency bill specifically propose?

Court documents filed Tuesday show Tesla will participate in private mediation with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The two parties expect to choose a mediator soon, with talks scheduled for March or April. Should mediation fail to produce an agreement, lawyers said they’ll submit a proposal to the court by June 17, 2026, outlining how to proceed with the lawsuit. The federal agency filed suit against Tesla in 2023, claiming Black workers at the Fremont factory experienced ongoing racial harassment. The complaint also alleges company leaders retaliated against employees who raised concerns about the treatment. This isn’t the first attempt at resolution Tesla and the commission already went through mandatory mediation back in June 2023, but those talks didn’t work out. Neither Tesla nor the employment commission provided comment when contacted. The case number is US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Tesla, 3:23-cv-04984, filed in federal court in Northern California. When the commission first brought the lawsuit, it accused the Austin-based automaker of creating a hostile environment for racial minorities at the California plant. Black workers faced severe and persistent racial harassment, according to the complaint. Company officials then punished workers who complained about what was happening. Tesla disclosed it was under federal investigation in an April 2022 filing with regulators. That probe came before California’s civil rights agency filed its own separate lawsuit accusing Tesla of turning a blind eye to rampant racism against Black workers at Fremont and other facilities statewide. Allegations Going Back to 2015 According to the federal suit, problems at the Fremont plant go back to at least 2015. Non-Black workers regularly used racial slurs and made monkey noises, the commission claimed. Managers sometimes addressed Black employees—both individually and as a group—using the N-word. Workers encountered racist graffiti around the workplace, including nooses and swastikas drawn on desks, in elevators, and even on vehicles moving down the production line. The commission wants the court to prohibit Tesla from subjecting Black workers to racism and retaliation or maintaining a hostile workplace. It’s seeking financial compensation for workers’ emotional distress and lost wages, either through back pay or reinstatement. The federal case was filed in Oakland, California. California’s civil rights agency has made similar claims, saying Tesla ignored years of employee complaints about racial slurs at the plant where the company builds its Model S, X, 3, and Y cars . Tesla’s defense in court argues the state overstepped its authority and “uses litigation as a bullying tactic and to advance its turf war” with the federal commission. That state case, filed last year, remains pending. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The draft legislation, formally known as the Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft, represents one of the most significant regulatory developments in cryptocurrency history. This potential expansion of Treasury Department authority arrives amid growing global debates about financial privacy, national security, and technological innovation. Understanding the US Crypto Bill’s Surveillance Provisions The Senate Banking Committee’s draft legislation contains several provisions that concern privacy advocates and industry experts. Specifically, the bill could grant the U.S. Treasury Department unprecedented authority over digital asset transactions. Galaxy Research’s analysis highlights three particularly significant powers that could emerge from this legislation. First, the Treasury could suspend digital asset transactions without obtaining a court order. Second, the department’s special measure powers would expand specifically for digital assets. Third, the legislation would establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for decentralized finance platforms. These provisions represent a substantial shift from traditional financial surveillance approaches. Historically, government agencies required judicial oversight for similar actions in conventional banking systems. The proposed framework for the US crypto bill appears to streamline this process significantly. Financial technology experts note that this approach mirrors emergency powers typically reserved for national security situations. However, the legislation applies these measures to routine financial transactions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Historical Context and Regulatory Evolution Current cryptocurrency regulation in the United States operates under a patchwork of existing financial laws. The Bank Secrecy Act, initially passed in 1970, forms the foundation for most financial surveillance. This legislation requires financial institutions to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering. Subsequently, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 expanded these surveillance capabilities following the September 11 attacks. These laws established the framework for financial institutions monitoring and reporting suspicious activities. The proposed US crypto bill represents a natural extension of these existing powers into the digital asset space. However, cryptocurrency presents unique challenges for traditional surveillance methods. Decentralized networks, pseudonymous transactions, and cross-border operations complicate conventional monitoring approaches. Government agencies have consistently argued that updated authorities are necessary to address these technological realities. Privacy advocates counter that expanding surveillance without corresponding privacy protections creates dangerous precedents. Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs. Digital Asset Surveillance Surveillance Aspect Traditional Finance Proposed Crypto Framework Transaction Suspension Requires court order in most cases Possible without court order Special Measures Limited to specific jurisdictions Expanded to all digital assets Platform Regulation Centralized institutions only Includes DeFi protocols Privacy Protections Established legal precedents Unclear or undefined Potential Impacts on Privacy and Innovation Galaxy Research’s analysis raises significant concerns about potential privacy violations stemming from the US crypto bill. The research firm emphasizes that expanded surveillance powers could fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens and financial privacy. Digital assets originally promised greater financial autonomy and reduced intermediary control. These proposed regulations might substantially diminish those core benefits. Furthermore, the legislation could establish precedents affecting broader digital privacy rights beyond cryptocurrency. The analysis also highlights potential impacts on industry growth and innovation. Cryptocurrency development in the United States already faces regulatory uncertainty. Additional surveillance requirements could: Increase compliance costs for startups and established companies Drive innovation overseas to more favorable jurisdictions Stifle DeFi development through restrictive requirements Reduce competitive advantage in global financial technology Industry leaders have expressed concerns about these potential consequences. They argue that balanced regulation should protect consumers while fostering innovation. The current draft legislation appears weighted heavily toward surveillance capabilities without corresponding innovation protections. This imbalance could have long-term consequences for American technological leadership in blockchain development. Expert Perspectives and Industry Response Financial regulation experts have offered varied perspectives on the proposed US crypto bill. Former regulatory officials acknowledge the legitimate national security concerns driving these provisions. They note that cryptocurrency has been exploited for illicit activities requiring government response. However, these same experts caution against overly broad authorities that lack sufficient oversight. They emphasize the importance of judicial review and transparency in surveillance programs. Cryptocurrency industry representatives have responded with measured concern. Major industry associations have called for balanced approaches that address security needs while preserving innovation. They highlight several alternative approaches that could achieve similar security objectives. These include enhanced transaction monitoring requirements, improved information sharing between exchanges, and international cooperation frameworks. Industry leaders stress that effective regulation requires industry consultation and technical expertise. Global Regulatory Context and Implications The United States is not alone in considering expanded cryptocurrency surveillance. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation includes similar monitoring provisions. However, MiCA incorporates stronger privacy protections and more defined oversight mechanisms. Asian jurisdictions have taken varied approaches, with Singapore implementing balanced frameworks while China has banned most cryptocurrency activities entirely. This global regulatory landscape creates competitive pressures that could influence American policy decisions. International standards bodies have also addressed cryptocurrency surveillance. The Financial Action Task Force has issued guidance for virtual asset service providers. These international standards emphasize risk-based approaches rather than blanket surveillance. The proposed US crypto bill appears to exceed FATF recommendations in several areas. This divergence could create compliance challenges for international cryptocurrency businesses operating across multiple jurisdictions. Technical Implementation Challenges Implementing the surveillance provisions in the US crypto bill presents significant technical challenges. Decentralized finance protocols operate without central authorities that can execute transaction suspensions. Blockchain networks are designed specifically to resist centralized control. Treasury Department officials would need to develop novel technical approaches to enforce these provisions effectively. Potential implementation methods could include: Node-level filtering at network entry points Exchange compliance requirements for transaction blocking Smart contract modifications to include surveillance capabilities Protocol-level changes through governance mechanisms Each approach presents technical and philosophical challenges. Node-level filtering could be circumvented through alternative network access points. Exchange requirements only affect centralized platforms, not peer-to-peer transactions. Smart contract modifications require protocol governance approval that might not be forthcoming. These implementation difficulties highlight the tension between traditional regulatory approaches and decentralized technologies. Legislative Process and Potential Amendments The US crypto bill remains in early discussion stages within the Senate Banking Committee. Legislative experts anticipate significant revisions before potential committee approval. The bill must navigate several procedural steps before becoming law. These include committee markups, potential amendments, floor debates, and reconciliation with House versions. This process typically involves substantial negotiation and compromise between different stakeholders. Privacy advocates and industry representatives have already proposed several amendments to address surveillance concerns. These proposed changes include: Judicial oversight requirements for transaction suspensions Sunset provisions that require periodic reauthorization Transparency reporting on surveillance activities Technical advisory committees to inform implementation The final legislation will likely reflect compromises between security concerns and privacy protections. However, the current draft establishes a starting position that favors expanded surveillance authorities. This positioning could influence the negotiation dynamics throughout the legislative process. Conclusion The proposed US crypto bill represents a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation and financial privacy. Galaxy Research’s analysis highlights legitimate concerns about expanded government surveillance powers without corresponding oversight mechanisms. The legislation’s potential impacts extend beyond immediate transaction monitoring to broader implications for innovation, privacy rights, and technological development. As the Senate Banking Committee continues its deliberations, stakeholders across the cryptocurrency ecosystem will closely monitor developments. The final legislation will establish precedents affecting digital finance for years to come, making balanced approaches essential for protecting both security interests and fundamental freedoms in the evolving financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What specific powers would the US crypto bill grant to the Treasury Department? The legislation could authorize three significant powers: suspending digital asset transactions without court orders, expanding special measure authorities specifically for cryptocurrencies, and establishing regulatory frameworks for decentralized finance platforms that previously operated outside traditional oversight structures. Q2: How does this proposed legislation differ from existing financial surveillance laws? Traditional financial surveillance typically requires judicial oversight for transaction suspensions and focuses on centralized institutions. The proposed framework extends similar authorities to decentralized networks and digital assets while potentially reducing oversight requirements, creating a substantially different regulatory approach. Q3: What are the main privacy concerns associated with this US crypto bill? Privacy advocates worry about reduced judicial oversight, potential overreach in transaction monitoring, establishment of precedents affecting broader digital privacy rights, and insufficient protections against government surveillance exceeding legitimate security needs in the cryptocurrency space. Q4: How might this legislation impact cryptocurrency innovation in the United States? The bill could increase compliance costs, drive development to more favorable jurisdictions, restrict DeFi experimentation through regulatory burdens, and reduce America’s competitive position in global financial technology innovation if implemented without balanced considerations. Q5: What happens next in the legislative process for this US crypto bill? The Senate Banking Committee will continue discussions, potentially amend provisions, hold markups, and possibly advance the legislation to the full Senate. Parallel processes may occur in House committees, with final legislation requiring reconciliation between different versions before potential presidential approval.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.92 by the end of 2029. By 2032, WIF’s price may surge to $4.80. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.4206 Market cap $420.29M Trading volume $226.13M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.4326 24-hour low $0.3680 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.30% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.3628 14-Day RSI 61.20 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.6674 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The daily trend has flipped bullish above $0.38. The 4-hour breakout confirms strong buyer control. A move above $0.45 would open up fast upside continuation. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the daily chart for January 14, WIF is trading around $0.421, holding firmly above the Bollinger mid-band near $0.356, which confirms a structural shift to the upside. The impulsive move from the $0.32–$0.34 base marked a clear trend change, and the recent pullback was shallow and corrective rather than aggressive selling. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The price is now consolidating just below the upper band, near $0.454, suggesting strength rather than exhaustion. The MACD remains positive and rising, signaling sustained bullish momentum. As long as WIF holds above $0.38, the daily structure stays bullish, with upside continuation favored toward $0.45–$0.48. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF has cleanly broken above the Alligator cluster around $0.39, thereby firmly flipping the short-term trend bullish. The expansion candle into $0.42 shows decisive buyer dominance, not a slow grind. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The MACD has firmly crossed into positive territory, and the OBV is rising sharply, confirming real volume-backed accumulation. Minor consolidation near $0.42 appears constructive, rather than distributive. As long as the price holds above $0.40, dips are likely to be bought rather than sold. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4006 BUY SMA 5 $0.3679 BUY SMA 10 $0.3725 BUY SMA 21 $0.3450 BUY SMA 50 $0.3628 BUY SMA 100 $0.4359 SELL SMA 200 $0.6674 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3958 BUY EMA 5 $0.3853 BUY EMA 10 $0.3631 BUY EMA 21 $0.3517 BUY EMA 50 $0.3788 BUY EMA 100 $0.4646 SELL EMA 200 $0.6224 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is transitioning from recovery into continuation mode. Holding between $0.38 and $0.40 maintains the bullish trend, while a clean break above $0.45 would likely accelerate the upside expansion. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $100 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $2 by the end of 2026 and between $5 and $7 by 2032. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

As individuals await the UK’s official economic data on Thursday, January 15, analysts shared their predictions, noting a high likelihood of Britain achieving a slight growth of about 0.1% in November. On the other hand, card spending and business confidence, which are widely recognized as key economic indicators that provide real-time information, suggested that December demonstrated sluggish economic growth, which may be a sign of a similar situation this year. Analysts spark hope that the UK economy might soon pick up the pace Following the current economic situation in the UK, analysts have pointed out that stagnant economic growth in the country could be improved if the labor market becomes stronger and cautious consumers begin to ease their spending restraints. Following this assertion, the analysts emphasized that the country’s future economic growth largely depends on the state of the labor market. Some of the challenges that have been identified as factors behind the sluggish economic growth in the UK include heightened concerns among individuals regarding potential tax hikes in the months leading up to the budget and Jaguar Land Rover’s 2025 cyberattack. Concerning this cyberattack, reports highlighted that this incident prompted the automotive company to halt its production globally for a period of five weeks. Consequently, the firm’s supply chain was disrupted, and significant financial losses were incurred, marking the most significant hack incident in the nation’s history. Additionally, recently released data indicate that since Reeves made public an extra £26 billion or $34.9 billion in tax revenue while delivering her budget speech on November 26, household spending and the job market have deteriorated sharply. Barclays Plc issued a report highlighting that card spending declined by 1.7% this year compared to December last year. In reference to February 2021, when the UK was under a national lockdown, this scenario illustrated a much more significant decline. The report also noted that a significant proportion of consumers had adopted the idea of reducing expenditure on non-essential goods and services, particularly on clothing and dining out. As a result, several retailers presented underwhelming sales results during the Christmas season. Analysts commented on this matter. They pointed out that the low consumer situation could further deteriorate if individuals begin to express significant concerns about job security. They made this statement after discovering that several firms had begun to publicly announce their intentions to lay off their workforce shortly after Reeves’s budget announcement. However, in the holiday season, this trend declined. Job reduction in companies raises economic concerns Following the layoff announcement, data from the government showed that businesses made clear their intentions to reduce approximately 33,392 jobs in the four weeks leading up to December 14. This figure represented the most significant job cuts since early 2023. Reeves’s budget announcement had also weakened Business confidence . To support this claim, reports mentioned that a business confidence index for the fourth quarter, as reported by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, declined to its all-time low in three years. Furthermore, the key PMIs indicated a slight improvement in the economy as of December 2025. This situation was noted just after an initial forecast was reduced. Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Berenberg, stated that, “Right now, it looks soft because we’re seeing weakness in the job market affecting spending.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

This strategic decision, reported by Bloomberg, signals a pivotal moment for the continent’s digital asset industry. Consequently, the company aims for a valuation between $4.6 billion and $5.8 billion. Moreover, financial giants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup will lead this high-profile offering, underscoring its importance in the global market. The Strategic Path to the Bitpanda IPO Bitpanda’s journey to a public listing represents a calculated evolution. Founded in 2014 by Eric Demuth, Paul Klanschek, and Christian Trummer, the platform began as a simple broker for Bitcoin. However, it has since transformed into a comprehensive fintech hub. Today, it offers trading in cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, and precious metals to over 4 million users across Europe. Therefore, this IPO is not an isolated event but the culmination of a decade of growth and regulatory navigation within the European Union’s financial framework. The choice of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, operated by Deutsche Börse, is highly strategic. Frankfurt is a central hub for European finance and boasts a robust regulatory environment. Specifically, Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has established clear guidelines for crypto custody and trading. This regulatory clarity provides a stable foundation for a public listing. Furthermore, a successful IPO on this exchange would position Bitpanda as a bellwether for other European fintech firms considering similar paths. Market Context and Valuation Analysis The targeted valuation of $4.6 to $5.8 billion places Bitpanda among Europe’s most valuable private fintech companies. This valuation reflects several key factors. First, the company has demonstrated consistent user growth and geographic expansion. Second, it has diversified its revenue streams beyond simple crypto trading commissions. Finally, the involvement of top-tier investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup validates the company’s financial health and prospects. Their role typically involves underwriting the share issuance and ensuring market confidence. To understand this valuation, a comparison with recent market activity is useful. The following table outlines key metrics from comparable fintech and crypto entities: Company Sector Key Listing Detail Notable Context Coinbase (COIN) Crypto Exchange Direct Listing on NASDAQ (2021) Valued at ~$86 billion at debut; first major crypto exchange to go public in the U.S. Kraken Crypto Exchange Rumored IPO (Delayed) Has explored public listing but faced regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. Adyen (ADYEN.AS) European Fintech/Payments IPO on Euronext Amsterdam (2018) Successful European fintech listing, now a blue-chip stock. Bitpanda’s move differs significantly from Coinbase’s direct listing. An IPO, especially on a traditional exchange like Frankfurt, often signals a desire to attract long-term, institutional investors. This approach can provide greater stability and capital for future expansion. Additionally, the European market presents a different regulatory and competitive landscape than the United States, potentially offering a smoother path to listing. Expert Insights on Regulatory and Market Impact Financial analysts view this IPO as a critical test for the maturation of the European crypto sector. “A successful Bitpanda listing would be a powerful signal,” notes a fintech analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence. “It demonstrates that a crypto-native business can meet the stringent reporting, governance, and transparency requirements of a major traditional stock exchange.” This process inherently builds trust with a broader investor base. The regulatory implications are profound. By subjecting itself to the scrutiny of Deutsche Börse and BaFin, Bitpanda is effectively advocating for a model of compliance and integration. This could pressure other exchanges to elevate their standards. Moreover, it provides European regulators with a high-profile case study for overseeing a publicly traded crypto business. The outcome will likely influence policy discussions around the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation implementation across the EU. Potential Ripple Effects and Industry Implications The success or challenges of the Bitpanda IPO will have immediate consequences. For the industry, a strong debut could unlock significant venture capital and private equity interest in other European crypto ventures. Conversely, it could also accelerate consolidation as smaller players seek partnerships to achieve similar scale. For consumers, a publicly listed exchange may offer perceived increases in security and operational transparency due to quarterly financial disclosures. Key potential impacts include: Investor Access: Provides a regulated, traditional equity avenue for investors to gain exposure to the crypto economy. Legitimization: Further bridges the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset world. Competitive Dynamics: May force rivals like Binance, Crypto.com, and local European players to reconsider their own capital and corporate structure strategies. However, the path is not without risk. The company will face intense scrutiny of its financials, its handling of past market volatility, and its security protocols. Market sentiment toward crypto assets at the time of listing will also play a crucial role in determining initial demand for its shares. Therefore, the first-half 2025 timeline suggests confidence in both the company’s readiness and a favorable market window. Conclusion The planned Bitpanda IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is a watershed event for European cryptocurrency. It represents a bold step toward mainstream financial integration for the digital asset sector. With a targeted valuation of up to $5.8 billion and the backing of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, this move underscores the growing institutional acceptance of compliant crypto businesses. Ultimately, the success of this Bitpanda IPO will be closely watched as a benchmark for the industry’s viability within the framework of traditional public markets. FAQs Q1: What is Bitpanda and why is its IPO significant? Bitpanda is a major European fintech platform based in Austria that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, and other assets. Its IPO is significant because it would be one of the first major crypto-focused exchanges to list on a premier European traditional stock exchange, signaling maturation and regulatory acceptance for the industry. Q2: When and where is the Bitpanda IPO expected to happen? According to reports, Bitpanda is targeting an initial public offering in the first half of 2025. The chosen venue is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Deutsche Börse) in Germany. Q3: What valuation is Bitpanda seeking? The company is aiming for a valuation in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.8 billion at the time of its public listing. Q4: Which banks are leading the Bitpanda IPO? Global investment banking leaders Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are set to lead and underwrite the offering. Q5: How does this compare to Coinbase’s public listing? Coinbase conducted a direct listing on the NASDAQ in the United States in 2021.

The move includes stakes in big names like Nintendo Co. and Bandai Namco Holdings Inc. The transfer will boost Savvy’s position in the gaming world. After the shares change hands, Savvy will own roughly 10% of several companies including Koei Tecmo Holdings Inc., NCSoft Corp., Nexon Co., and Square Enix Holdings Co. Bloomberg news reviewed company documents showing these holdings. Savvy Games Group was set up in 2021. The goal was helping Saudi Arabia put money into things besides oil. With $38 billion available to spend, Savvy purchased Scopely Inc., the developer behind Monopoly Go. They also invested in Niantic, which created Pokemon Go, and bought into several esports organizations. Monopoly Go turned out to be a hit. The esports investments haven’t gone as well – there have been staff cuts at the company. The fund is the largest investor in Electronic Arts Inc.’s $55 billion buyout, but Savvy won’t be involved in that transaction, according to someone who knows about the deal. The government fun d al ready transferred its 11 million shares of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. last month, that showed up in a late December regulatory filing. Savvy will keep using the PIF’s hands-off approach. They don’t plan to actively manage these investments, the person said. div]:bg-bg-000/50 [&_pre>div]:border-0.5 [&_pre>div]:border-border-400 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8""> _*]:min-w-0 standard-markdown""> Transfer long planned, no strategy changes ahead Amar Batkhuu speaks for Savvy. He said they’ve been planning this transfer for a long time. “These transfers will move the stewardship of PIF’s games investments to Savvy, given Savvy is a leading games organization for the PIF and a core component of the National Gaming and Esports Strategy,” he explained. There aren’t any plans to change how they invest, he added. EA shareholders voted yes in December to the $55 billion sale. Investors at the Redwood City, California-based company approved the $210-a-share takeover. EA publishes games like EA SPORTS FC and Battlefield. It’s a big shift for EA after four decades. Saudi Arabia’s PIF is making large investments in gaming to reduc e de pendence on oil money. Going private means EA developers can focus on making games without worrying about quarterly earnings expectations from public investors. _*]:min-w-0""> Nintendo stock tumbles despite Switch 2 success Nintendo’s stock price in Japan has fallen hard in the last five months. It’s down about 33 percent from the peak, even though hardware sales look good. Shares hit 14,795 yen in August 2025 and closed at 9,950 yen today. Several things appear to be bothering investors. Possible price increases down the road, fewer big first-party game releases, and holiday season discounts in Western markets have all weighed on the stock. The drop suggest s co nfidence has weakened, despite Nintendo still posting strong numbers for its newest console. The Nintendo Switch 2 came out on June 5, 2025. It sold 10.36 million units in the first four months – the fastest-selling console Nintendo has ever launched. That beat the original Switch timeline by five months. Holiday sales in the West were uneven, down around 35 percent compared to when the first Switch launched. Sales in Japan have stayed exceptionally strong though. Don’t just read crypto news.

57146034,657125,1768363206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57146034.jpeg,Bitcoin On-Chain Alert: 2021 Cycle Coins Just Moved,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-on-chain-alert-2021-cycle-coins-just-moved/,"On-chain data shows tokens aged between 3 and 5 years old have just moved on the Bitcoin network with two large transactions. 3 To 5 Years Old Bitcoin Supply Has Seen Movement Recently As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, two transactions involving old tokens have just occurred on the Bitcoin blockchain. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “ Spent Output Age Bands ,” which tracks how many tokens that the various coin age groups or “age bands” are moving on the network. In the context of the current topic, the age band of interest is the one containing coins that have been dormant for between three and five years. Here is the chart for the Bitcoin Spent Output Age Bands shared by Maartunn that shows the data specifically for this cohort: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Spent Output Age Bands have captured two large transactions from the 3 to 5 years age band during the past couple of days. The first of these involved 539 BTC, while the second moved 1,566 BTC. The 3 to 5 years age band corresponds to coins that were purchased between January 2021 and January 2023, essentially covering the cycle spanning over the 2021 bull market and 2022 bear market. Thus, the tokens that have just been moved were held by investors who had been sitting silent since buying in the previous cycle. “Dormant supply waking up is often a signal—either smart money rotating or early holders exiting,” explained the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether these transactions were a temporary deviation or if long-term holder whales will make more such moves in the near future. In some other news, CryptoQuant has shared its 2025 review of digital asset exchange activity. One interesting finding is that stablecoins are heavily concentrated on Binance , with the exchange holding a combined $47.6 billion in USDT and USDC reserves. This is equivalent to 72% of the stablecoin holdings across the ten largest exchanges. Binance also dominated 2025 in spot trading activity, recording close to $7 trillion in volume. Binance’s dominance of trading volume wasn’t quite as stark as that of its stablecoin reserves, however, as it made up for 41% of the total spot volume among the top 10 platforms. The exchange’s share of the futures trading volume was similar, coming out at 42%. Overall spot and futures trading volume in the cryptocurrency sector grew during 2025 compared to the end of 2024, but the yearly growth rate declined.

Volatility has compressed, price has stabilized near key psychological levels, and market participants are increasingly divided on what comes next. Some analysts argue that this prolonged consolidation is laying the groundwork for a renewed upside recovery, while a broader consensus warns that Bitcoin could still face another leg lower before a sustainable trend emerges. Related Reading: XRP Consolidates Above $2 As Volume Z-Score Signals A Quiet Market Adding to this uncertainty, top analyst Darkfost points to an important and potentially concerning on-chain development: the first signs of long-term holder (LTH) capitulation are beginning to surface. The last time Bitcoin traded at similar price levels was in April 2025, roughly nine months ago. Since then, a large portion of market participants accumulated BTC at higher prices and have continued to hold through the recent correction. Today, many of those investors are sitting on unrealized losses. As a reminder, Bitcoin held for more than six months is classified as long-term holder supply, typically associated with higher conviction and lower sensitivity to short-term price moves. When this cohort begins to show signs of stress, it often marks a critical phase in the market cycle. Whether this emerging LTH pressure becomes a brief shakeout or evolves into broader capitulation could play a decisive role in shaping Bitcoin’s next major move. Early Signs of Long-Term Holder Capitulation Emerge What we are currently observing on the Long-Term Holder SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) is a behavior that typically appears during bear market phases. LTH SOPR measures whether coins held for more than six months are being sold at a profit or a loss, offering insight into conviction among the most resilient cohort of Bitcoin investors. In recent days, LTH SOPR briefly dipped below the critical 1.0 level. This signals that some long-term holders—most likely the younger segment of this group—have begun to capitulate by selling at a loss. Historically, such moves reflect rising stress among holders who bought closer to cycle highs and are now facing prolonged drawdowns. For now, however, this behavior remains limited. The 30-day moving average of LTH SOPR still stands at a healthy 1.18, meaning long-term holders have realized an average profit of 18% over the past month. While this confirms that broad-based capitulation has not yet materialized, it is worth noting that this level is well below the annual average near 2.0, indicating a clear slowdown in realized profits. A deeper deterioration would be bearish in the short term, signaling expanding sell pressure. Conversely, declining realized profits may also suggest that traders are gradually exhausting selling pressure. For a bullish continuation to develop, LTH SOPR would need to stabilize and begin trending higher again, confirming renewed confidence among long-term holders. Related Reading: Trump-Powell Conflict Fuels Volatility While Retail Sells Bitcoin At A Loss – Details Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below Key Resistance Bitcoin continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation range after the sharp correction from the October highs. On the weekly chart, price is holding just below the $92,000–$94,000 resistance zone, an area that previously acted as support before the breakdown. This level now represents a key inflection point for market structure. Despite the recent volatility, Bitcoin remains above its rising 200-day moving average, which continues to slope upward near the mid-$80,000 region. This suggests that the broader trend remains constructive, even as short-term momentum has weakened. The 100-day moving average has flattened, reflecting a loss of upside momentum, while the 50-day average is still attempting to stabilize after rolling over during the sell-off. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Cost Basis Holds Firm: Structural Floor Forms Near $2.8K Price action over the past several weeks shows a series of higher lows, indicating that buyers are gradually stepping in and absorbing selling pressure. However, volume has declined during this consolidation, signaling a lack of strong conviction from either side of the market. This behavior is typical of compression phases that often precede larger directional moves. A sustained break and weekly close above $94,000 would signal renewed strength and open the door for a move toward the $100,000–$105,000 range. Conversely, failure to hold above the $86,000–$88,000 support zone would increase downside risk and shift focus toward deeper retracements. For now, Bitcoin remains in balance, building tension for its next decisive move.

Other top gainers were coins like Pepe (PEPE), Optimism (OP), Internet Computer (ICP), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). This article explains why the crypto rally is happening today. Crypto market going up after recent US jobs and inflation data One reason why the crypto market is going up today is that the US has published mixed macro numbers recently. A report released on Friday showed that the economy created just 50,000 jobs , while the unemployment rate improved to 4.4% Another one released on Tuesday revealed that the core consumer inflation softened in December. It moved from 2.7% in November to 2.6% in December, a trend that may continue this year. Donald Trump has made affordability a major issue this year as the US moves to the mid-term elections. He has announced a cap on credit card interest rates, barred institutional investors from buying homes , and asked Fannie Mae to start buying mortgage securities worth over $200 billion. Trump is also urging American oil companies to boost production, a move he hopes will lead to lower gas prices. Therefore, a combination of soft labor market data and lower inflation will push the Fed to start cutting interest rates. CLARITY Act markup and vote The crypto market is going up as investors reflect on the improving regulatory environment in the United States. The Senate has now published the text for the CLARITY Act ahead of the markup event on Thursday. Angry Crypto Show @angrycryptoshow · Follow JUST IN: 🇺🇸 SEC Chairman Paul Atkins on the CLARITY Act, says “we are very bullish on the effects of the bill getting to the President to be signed this year, and I think that’ll be a huge help to the crypto marketplace and investors.” $ADA $NIGHT Watch on Twitter View replies 9:22 PM · Jan 13, 2026 124 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies There are chances that the Senate will ultimately pass the bill, making it the second major legislation after the GENIUS Act. These bills are aimed at making the United States the crypto capital of the world. The SEC is already working on this goal. For example, it has ended various lawsuits that were filed by Gary Gensler’s team. It has also launched a crypto exemption week and approved numerous cryptocurrency ETFs. SCOTUS ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs The crypto market is going up as investors wait for the upcoming ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs. This ruling is widely expected to happen later today, with a Kalshi poll showing that the odds that they will vote in favor of these tariffs being at 33.8%. These odds have dropped from over 56% in September last year. SCOTUS ruling odds | Source: Kalshi A decision to end Trump’s tariffs would be a good thing for the crypto market. In theory, it would lead to lower prices as companies boost imports to the country. However, it is worth noting that Trump has some other options to implement the tariffs. Most of these options will only be implemented after a lengthy investigation. Crypto Fear and Greed Index has jumped Meanwhile, data shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has rebounded. It has moved from the extreme fear level of 10 in December to the neutral point at 52. Historically, crypto prices do well when the index is in a slow uptrend. They then drop sharply whenever the index moves to the extreme greed zone. Crypto Fear and Greed Index | Source: CMC More data show why the crypto rally is happening.

This sustained inflow pattern represents a notable shift in market sentiment following months of regulatory uncertainty and fluctuating investor interest in blockchain-based financial products. Ethereum ETFs Demonstrate Sustained Institutional Demand According to verified data from TraderT, the January 13 inflows represent a continuation of positive momentum that began the previous day. Remarkably, no individual fund recorded net outflows during this period, indicating broad-based institutional support across multiple financial products. This consistent performance suggests that Ethereum ETFs are establishing themselves as legitimate investment vehicles rather than speculative instruments. The sustained inflows occur against a backdrop of evolving regulatory clarity and improved market infrastructure for digital assets. Financial institutions have increasingly recognized the value proposition of Ethereum-based investment products, particularly as blockchain technology matures and real-world applications expand. Market analysts note that this two-day streak represents the most consistent inflow pattern since the initial launch period of these financial instruments. Leading Funds and Their Performance Metrics BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) emerged as the clear leader, attracting $53.03 million in inflows. This substantial figure represents approximately 41% of the total daily inflows and demonstrates BlackRock’s continued dominance in the digital asset ETF space. The company’s established reputation and extensive distribution network have proven instrumental in attracting institutional capital to cryptocurrency products. Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust followed with $35.42 million in inflows, while Bitwise’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHW) captured $22.96 million. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) and Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) completed the positive flow picture with $14.38 million and $3.93 million respectively. This distribution across multiple providers indicates diversified institutional interest rather than concentration in a single product. January 13, 2025 Ethereum ETF Inflow Breakdown Fund Provider Fund Name Inflows (Millions) Market Share BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) $53.03 40.9% Grayscale Mini Ethereum Trust $35.42 27.3% Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHW) $22.96 17.7% Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) $14.38 11.1% Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) $3.93 3.0% Market Context and Regulatory Developments The positive inflow trend coincides with several important market developments that have strengthened investor confidence in Ethereum-based products. Regulatory agencies have provided clearer guidance on digital asset classification and custody requirements, reducing uncertainty for institutional investors. Additionally, improvements in Ethereum’s underlying technology, including successful network upgrades and scaling solutions, have addressed previous concerns about transaction costs and network congestion. Market infrastructure has also matured significantly, with established custodians offering secure storage solutions and reputable market makers providing improved liquidity. These developments have collectively reduced the operational risks associated with Ethereum ETF investments, making them more accessible to traditional financial institutions and wealth managers. Comparative Analysis with Bitcoin ETF Performance Analysts frequently compare Ethereum ETF performance with their Bitcoin counterparts to assess relative market sentiment. While Bitcoin ETFs typically attract larger absolute inflows due to their first-mover advantage and greater market capitalization, Ethereum products have demonstrated stronger relative growth in recent months. This pattern suggests that investors are increasingly diversifying their digital asset exposure beyond Bitcoin alone. The Ethereum blockchain’s programmability and smart contract functionality provide fundamentally different value propositions compared to Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative. Consequently, Ethereum ETFs appeal to investors seeking exposure to decentralized finance applications, non-fungible token ecosystems, and enterprise blockchain solutions rather than purely monetary innovation. Institutional Adoption Patterns and Future Projections Institutional adoption of Ethereum ETFs follows identifiable patterns that differ from retail investor behavior. Large financial institutions typically implement phased allocation strategies, beginning with small pilot investments before scaling up exposure as they gain operational experience and regulatory comfort. The sustained inflows observed over two consecutive days suggest that many institutions have progressed beyond initial pilot phases. Several factors influence institutional allocation decisions: Regulatory clarity: Clear guidelines from SEC and other agencies Custody solutions: Established providers with insurance coverage Liquidity profiles: Demonstrated market depth and tight spreads Tax treatment: Favorable structures compared to direct crypto ownership Reporting integration: Compatibility with existing financial systems Market analysts project continued growth in Ethereum ETF assets under management throughout 2025, particularly as additional use cases emerge and regulatory frameworks mature. However, they caution that performance will remain sensitive to broader cryptocurrency market conditions and macroeconomic factors influencing risk asset allocations. Impact on Ethereum Network Fundamentals The growing popularity of Ethereum ETFs has secondary effects on the underlying blockchain network. Increased institutional investment typically correlates with reduced price volatility, making Ethereum more suitable for enterprise applications and decentralized finance protocols. Additionally, ETF providers often engage in staking activities with their ETH holdings, contributing to network security and generating yield for investors. Network analysts monitor several key metrics to assess ETF impact: Staking participation rates among institutional holders Changes in circulating supply available on exchanges Correlations between ETF flows and network transaction volumes Developer activity and protocol upgrade timelines These interconnected factors create feedback loops where ETF success strengthens network fundamentals, which in turn makes Ethereum more attractive to additional institutional investors. This virtuous cycle has become increasingly apparent throughout 2024 and early 2025. Risk Considerations and Market Dynamics Despite the positive inflow trend, Ethereum ETF investors face several notable risks that require careful consideration. Regulatory developments remain a primary concern, as policy changes could affect product structures or availability. Technological risks associated with blockchain networks, including potential security vulnerabilities or consensus mechanism challenges, also warrant monitoring. Market dynamics present additional considerations: Concentration risk: Heavy reliance on few large investors Liquidity mismatch: Potential ETF redemptions exceeding market depth Tracking error: Differences between ETF performance and underlying ETH Fee structures: Management expenses affecting long-term returns Financial advisors typically recommend that Ethereum ETF allocations represent only a portion of overall investment portfolios, with percentages varying based on individual risk tolerance and investment horizons. Diversification across multiple digital assets and traditional investments remains a fundamental principle for managing cryptocurrency exposure. Conclusion The consecutive days of net inflows for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs represent a significant milestone for cryptocurrency investment products and institutional adoption of digital assets. With $129.72 million flowing into these funds on January 13, 2025, following similar positive momentum the previous day, Ethereum ETFs demonstrate growing acceptance among traditional financial institutions. This trend reflects improving regulatory clarity, maturing market infrastructure, and increasing recognition of Ethereum’s unique value proposition beyond simple cryptocurrency exposure. As blockchain technology continues evolving and finding real-world applications, Ethereum ETFs will likely play an increasingly important role in providing regulated access to this innovative asset class for both institutional and individual investors. FAQs Q1: What are spot Ethereum ETFs and how do they differ from futures-based products? Spot Ethereum ETFs directly hold Ethereum tokens as their underlying asset, providing investors with direct exposure to ETH price movements. Futures-based products, in contrast, hold derivative contracts tied to future Ethereum prices, introducing additional complexities including contango and backwardation risks. Q2: Why are consecutive days of inflows significant for Ethereum ETFs? Consecutive inflow days indicate sustained institutional interest rather than isolated trading activity. This pattern suggests that financial institutions are implementing strategic allocation plans rather than making tactical trades, signaling longer-term commitment to Ethereum exposure through regulated products. Q3: How do Ethereum ETF inflows affect the price of Ethereum? ETF inflows create direct buying pressure on the underlying ETH tokens as providers purchase assets to back their shares. This increased demand, particularly from large institutional buyers, can support Ethereum prices and potentially reduce volatility by moving tokens into long-term investment vehicles. Q4: What risks should investors consider with Ethereum ETFs? Key risks include regulatory changes affecting product availability, technological risks associated with blockchain networks, liquidity constraints during market stress, tracking errors between ETF performance and underlying ETH, and management fees that reduce net returns over time. Q5: How do Ethereum ETFs compare to direct cryptocurrency ownership? Ethereum ETFs offer several advantages over direct ownership, including regulated custodianship, simplified tax reporting, integration with traditional brokerage accounts, and elimination of private key management responsibilities. However, they typically involve management fees and may restrict certain activities like staking participation depending on fund structure.

This disclosure comes amid allegations that the group is engaging in entrenchment and attempting to silence investor voices. Former BNC Director Linked to 10X Capital In its latest statement shared on X, YZi Labs emphasized that transparency is “non-negotiable,” as it highlighted what it described as undisclosed ties between an “independent” director at BNC and 10X Capital. At the center of the claims is Russell Read, who recently stepped down from the board of CEA Industries Inc., the corporate entity associated with BNC. In a December 30 8-K filing, the company described the group from which Read resigned as independent, stating that his departure followed his acceptance of a new role requiring him to step down from external boards. The document also includes a statement from him, in which he praised the entity for its “diligent and independent oversight.” However, YZi Labs pointed to those same SEC disclosures to show that the former executive previously served as Vice Chairman of 10X Capital. According to the venture capital firm, this relationship directly challenges claims of independence and raises concerns about the board’s oversight. Additionally, YZi Labs alleged that the asset manager structured a 20-year agreement that allows it to continue collecting fees even after termination, arguing that such terms deepen potential conflicts of interest and merit closer scrutiny from shareholders. YZi Labs Pushes for Board Expansion The governance clash is fueled by a fundamental disagreement over BNC’s direction. As CryptoPotato reported previously, YZi Labs and other investors backed BNC specifically for its focus on BNB Chain-related treasury strategies. Recent internal discussions, however, have hinted at a potential pivot to other digital assets, causing unease. YZi Labs has pointed to public comments from BNC’s CEO in November 2025 about contemplating assets like Solana as evidence of this strategic drift. “We remain committed to protecting BNC shareholder rights and upholding the integrity of the BNB ecosystem,” wrote the company. The newly raised questions about board independence add another layer to YZi Labs’ campaign for change. The firm has filed a formal consent statement to expand BNC’s board and install its own nominees, a list that includes former U.S. Senator Max Baucus and blockchain figure Matthew Roszak. YZi Labs maintains its goal is to protect shareholder rights and uphold the integrity of the BNB ecosystem it believes BNC was built upon. The outcome of this fight will be a test of shareholder activism in the crypto-corporate sphere and could determine whether BNC remains tethered to the BNB ecosystem or charts a new course. For now, YZi Labs is betting that allegations of conflicted governance will persuade other shareholders to support its call for a boardroom overhaul. As of January 12, the venture capital firm has reported direct ownership of 2,150,481 shares of common stock and additional shares underlying pre-funded, stapled, and strategic advisor warrants.

Data compiled by trader T reveals that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted a net inflow of $753.73 million. This remarkable figure represents the largest single-day capital injection these funds have seen in three months. Consequently, this event marks a significant pivot point for cryptocurrency investment vehicles, which have faced volatile flows since their landmark approvals. The substantial influx provides a clear signal of renewed confidence from major financial players. Breaking Down the Record Bitcoin ETF Inflow The January 13th data provides a detailed breakdown of which fund managers captured the lion’s share of new capital. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the charge decisively, attracting $351.36 million in new investments. Following closely, Bitwise’s BITB secured $159.42 million, while industry giant BlackRock’s IBIT saw inflows of $126.28 million. Other notable contributors to the total included Ark Invest’s ARKB with $84.88 million and a newer, smaller product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini ETF, which gathered $18.80 million. VanEck’s HODL and WisdomTree’s BTCW rounded out the positive activity with $10 million and $2.99 million, respectively. This distribution highlights a broad-based demand rather than a concentration in a single fund. To provide clearer context, the following table summarizes the key inflows from January 13, 2025: ETF Ticker Issuer Inflow (USD) FBTC Fidelity $351.36M BITB Bitwise $159.42M IBIT BlackRock $126.28M ARKB Ark Invest $84.88M Other Multiple $31.79M This coordinated inflow event did not occur in a vacuum. Importantly, it followed a previous day of positive flows, creating a two-day streak of net capital entering the spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. Such consecutive gains often indicate a shift in market sentiment rather than a one-off anomaly. Analysts frequently monitor these flow patterns to gauge institutional positioning and long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. The Broader Context of Cryptocurrency ETF Performance Understanding the significance of this $753.7 million day requires examining the recent history of these investment products. Since their groundbreaking regulatory approval in early 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced periods of explosive growth followed by stretches of outflows or stagnation. The three-month period preceding January 13 saw more subdued activity, characterized by smaller inflows and occasional redemptions as investors reacted to macroeconomic pressures and Bitcoin price volatility. Therefore, this sudden, large-scale capital commitment breaks that pattern decisively. Several interconnected factors likely contributed to this surge in demand. First, evolving macroeconomic indicators, such as inflation data and interest rate expectations, can alter the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin. Second, technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price chart often influences institutional timing, with key support levels attracting buyer interest. Finally, ongoing developments in blockchain technology and regulatory clarity for digital assets provide a fundamental backdrop for investment decisions. This confluence of factors creates a complex environment where ETF flows serve as a critical barometer. Expert Analysis on Institutional Sentiment Market strategists interpret large inflows as a sign of institutional accumulation. When heavyweight asset managers like Fidelity and BlackRock see significant capital moving into their products, it often reflects decisions by pension funds, endowments, and large registered investment advisors (RIAs). These entities typically conduct thorough due diligence and operate with longer time horizons than retail traders. Their participation lends credibility and stability to the asset class. Furthermore, the diversity of funds receiving inflows suggests the demand is widespread across different investment theses and fee structures, from low-cost index-style exposure to more active strategies. The timing is also noteworthy. Early January often sees portfolio rebalancing and new annual allocations from institutional investors. This “January effect” can lead to increased volumes across various asset classes as fresh capital is deployed. The spot Bitcoin ETF inflow data strongly suggests that digital assets are now a formal part of this annual allocation process for a growing number of institutions. This institutionalization process is a key metric for the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Market Impact and Future Implications The immediate market impact of such a substantial inflow is multifaceted. Primarily, the ETF issuers must purchase an equivalent amount of physical Bitcoin to back the new shares created. This creates direct, measurable buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin market. According to standard market mechanics, sustained buying pressure from a large, regulated vehicle can provide support for Bitcoin’s price and potentially reduce downside volatility. Moreover, positive flow data often generates its own momentum, attracting media coverage and further investor interest in a self-reinforcing cycle. Looking ahead, analysts will monitor whether this inflow represents the start of a new trend. Key questions for the coming weeks include: Will the inflow streak continue? Consecutive days of positive flows would solidify the bullish signal. How will Bitcoin’s price react? The relationship between ETF inflows and spot price is a primary focus. Is this a reallocation from other assets? Determining if this is new money or a shift from gold ETFs or bonds is crucial. The performance of these ETFs also has regulatory implications. Strong, sustained demand demonstrates to policymakers and regulators that there is a legitimate, substantial market for regulated cryptocurrency exposure. This evidence can support the case for approving additional digital asset products, such as spot Ethereum ETFs, by showing investor protection and market integrity can be maintained within the existing framework. Conclusion The $753.7 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 13, 2025, stands as a pivotal event for digital asset markets. As the largest single-day total in three months, it powerfully interrupts a period of quieter activity and signals a potential resurgence of institutional confidence. The leading roles played by established financial giants like Fidelity and BlackRock underscore the deepening integration of cryptocurrency into the traditional financial system. While single-day data points do not guarantee future trends, this substantial capital movement provides a clear, quantitative measure of renewed institutional belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Consequently, market participants and observers will watch subsequent flow data with heightened attention, as it may define the investment narrative for the first quarter of 2025. FAQs Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price movements without having to directly buy, store, or secure it themselves. These funds trade on traditional stock exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq. Q2: Why is a $753.7 million inflow significant? This level of inflow is significant because it is the largest single-day amount in three months, indicating a major shift in investor sentiment and potentially signaling the start of a new period of institutional accumulation after a phase of slower activity. Q3: How do ETF inflows affect Bitcoin’s price? When an ETF receives new investor money, the issuer must buy an equivalent amount of Bitcoin to back the newly created shares. This creates direct buying pressure in the underlying Bitcoin market, which can provide support for or increase the price of Bitcoin. Q4: Which Bitcoin ETF had the largest inflow on January 13? Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) attracted the largest portion of the inflow, with $351.36 million in new capital on January 13, 2025. Q5: What does “net inflow” mean in this context? Net inflow refers to the total amount of new money invested into the ETFs minus any money that was withdrawn (redeemed) from them on the same day. A positive net inflow means more capital entered the funds than left.

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the Vienna-based company could seek a valuation of €4B to €5B ($4.6B – $5.8B), and it has tapped Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank to help arrange the offering. Some see a first-quarter listing as a live option. Bitpanda didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Bitpanda, a cryptocurrency trading platform backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, is gearing up for a Frankfurt initial public offering as soon as the first half of this year, sources say https://t.co/nmS6yVJKVY — Bloomberg (@business) January 13, 2026 Bitpanda Targets Deeper Liquidity As It Maps Listing Options The timing matters for crypto traders because listings tend to follow liquidity. A successful float would hand Bitpanda a stronger balance sheet for product expansion, licensing and custody infrastructure, right as Europe pushes firms to meet tougher compliance expectations under the EU’s MiCA regime. Bitpanda already crossed one venue off the list. Chief executive Eric Demuth last year ruled out the UK , pointing to weak liquidity on the London Stock Exchange and a broader drift of issuers toward deeper pools of capital. Demuth said Bitpanda would consider Frankfurt or New York for a future listing, leaning toward markets that can support sustained trading volumes and bigger institutional participation around crypto linked names. Crypto Firms Queue Up As IPO Market Shows Signs Of Life Frankfurt also connects neatly with Bitpanda’s work in Germany’s banking system. Deutsche Bank has said it plans to launch a crypto custody service in 2026 and the bank has enlisted Bitpanda’s technology unit, with Taurus providing digital asset infrastructure. Regulation is doing its part to pull activity onshore. MiCA has already pushed firms to formalize licensing plans across the bloc ahead of the June 30, 2026 transition deadline, a backdrop that rewards platforms that can scale compliance alongside growth. Public markets have also started reopening for crypto. Circle priced its IPO in June 2025 for NYSE trading under CRCL, Bullish closed its IPO in Aug. 2025 for NYSE trading under BLSH, and Gemini said it closed its IPO in Sept. 2025. The 2026 calendar is getting crowded. Kraken said it confidentially submitted a draft S-1 for a proposed IPO, and BitGo has already flagged a targeted valuation for its US listing effort , keeping investor attention on who can turn crypto revenue into public market durability.

57147311,657463,1768366812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57147311.jpeg,Crypto Win? Expert Evaluates The Latest Market Structure Bill Draft—Here’s What To Know,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-win-the-latest-market-structure-bill-draft/,"As the Senate Banking Committee prepares for the markup of the anticipated crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, an updated draft has been released following extensive negotiations. This new version aims to provide a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, defining oversight responsibilities between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Major Takeaways From The Crypto Bill’s Draft The latest draft released on Monday night, includes critical provisions recognized as gains for the industry. Notably, Paul Barron, a market expert, pointed out that the bill now defines “Custodial and Ancillary Staking Services” as a recognized activity, emphasizing that such services are considered “administrative or ministerial.” As a result, registered intermediaries will be allowed to facilitate staking for customers while ensuring that individual assets are segregated from the platform’s own funds. However, assets can be pooled with others for efficiency, such as through an omnibus account. The bill also reinforces the existing status quo concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Exchanges and brokers will still be required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, perform KYC checks, and monitor for any illicit financial activities. Key wins for consumers include an explicit right to self-custody. Section 105(c) of the bill grants US individuals the right to maintain a hardware or software wallet for their own lawful custody of digital assets. Additionally, this section protects the ability to engage in direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions using self-custody wallets without the need for financial intermediaries. Furthermore, the legislation aims to safeguard wallet developers . Section 109 ensures that non-controlling blockchain developers or providers of hardware or software facilitating customer custody will not be classified as money transmitters. This provision of the crypto market structure bill protects developers of wallets, such as those from Ledger, Tangem, and MetaMask, from being regulated as financial institutions solely based on their coding efforts. Critical Insights On DeFi Provisions Another significant aspect of the bill is its provisions regarding decentralized finance. The Act establishes exclusions that help protect DeFi protocols and developers from being classified as centralized exchanges (CEXs) or brokers. Specifically, Section 309 states that individuals will not be subject to the Securities Exchange Act solely for activities such as developing DeFi trading protocols, publishing user interfaces for blockchain systems, or operating nodes. For consumers using DeFi products and protocols, the Act creates a legal “safe harbor,” allowing continued use of decentralized finance without the imposition of forced intermediaries. However, it is important to note that this does not provide immunity for any illicit financial activities. Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis, who led the Republican Party’s negotiations to achieve the best possible results for digital asset growth in the country, sent the following message to her Democratic colleagues on social media: After months of hard work, we have bipartisan text ready for Thursday’s markup. I urge my Democrat colleagues: don’t retreat from our progress. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will provide the clarity needed to keep innovation in the U.S. & protect consumers. Let’s do this! As for the crypto bill’s likelihood of passing, Barron suggests a medium-high probability, estimating a 60-70% chance it could become law in early 2026. However, the expert asserted that the outcome may hinge on either removing or softening the “Anti-CBDC” provisions or making concessions to banks regarding stablecoin reserves to meet the Senate threshold.

Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Hits New $610 All-Time High – Veteran Trader Shares Silver-Like Setup Bitcoin Approaching Make-Or-Break Test On Tuesday, Bitcoin surged 2.5% to retest the $93,500 resistance level for the first time in a week. The cryptocurrency has been hovering between the $84,000 to $93,500 price range for three months and has failed to turn this level into support multiple times. Analyst Rekt Capital recently noted that the flagship crypto is near a “historic” test as it has begun to form “another technically decisive region” just above current price levels. The market watcher explained that BTC is approaching its dynamic Bull Market Exponential Moving Average (EMA) cluster, where the 50-week EMA and 21-week EMA are getting closer. This key cluster, currently located between the $96,000 and $97,500 levels, has historically been tested before a “meaningful crossover,” with the Bitcoin price overextending beyond the cluster. However, this has usually been followed by an unsuccessful confirmation of this region as support. “When that happens, the crossover itself often follows the bearish price event, rather than causing it, with the EMA cluster flipping into resistance from the underside and leading to downside continuation,” the analyst detailed. Notably, past cycles reveal that the 50-week and 21-week EMAs can move very close together, Rekt Capital wrote, emphasizing that they can even overlap for prolonged periods before a decisive crossover. Currently, Bitcoin has yet to retest and overextend beyond the two EMAs, but its historical performance suggests that it will likely occur. Moreover, BTC’s price is “positioning itself in a way that could allow for a springboard higher, potentially enabling a test of this cluster in the weeks ahead. The key question is timing.” BTC Price Breaks Out Of Key Resistances In his analysis, the market observer discussed BTC’s recent performance, which has seen a structural change despite the sideways price action. Last week, the cryptocurrency’s price closed above its multi-week downtrend, which has been serving as a major resistance point since late November. This marks “a small but notable technical milestone” as Bitcoin now holds above the November and December highs in the weekly timeframe, treating the previous resistance as support. In addition, the mid-zone of its local range, around the $90,500 level, is now “almost perfectly confluent with the former Downtrend, meaning the Downtrend that last week rejected price is beginning to act as layered support instead.” Therefore, if Bitcoin continues to hold the mid-range region, the price should be able to challenge higher levels and find a path toward $100,000. Rekt Capital added that, unlike previous retests, the most recent rejection from the crucial $93,500 resistance was significantly shallower and shorter, suggesting that it was getting weaker.

Ultimately, BTC will need to hold this area and close the week above $93,500 to “kickstart a breakout from the Weekly Range as per previous green circles,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, BTC trades at $94,334, a 2.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.

On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $148. The next major resistance is near the $150 level. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $162. Any more gains might send the price toward the $170 level. Downside Correction In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $148 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $144 zone. The first major support is near the $143 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent upward move from the $138 swing low to the $148 high. A break below the $143 level might send the price toward the $140 support zone and the trend line. If there is a close below the $140 support, the price could decline toward the $135 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha identified a critical bullish signal when the platform’s Net Taker Volume exceeded $500 million within a single trading hour, indicating aggressive market buy orders that could propel Bitcoin toward six-figure valuations. This development follows similar patterns observed in early January that preceded Bitcoin’s rally to $96,000, suggesting potential continuation of the current upward trajectory. Understanding the Bitcoin Surge Signal Crypto markets frequently exhibit specific technical patterns before major price movements. The Net Taker Volume metric serves as a crucial indicator of market sentiment and directional pressure. Essentially, this metric measures the difference between market buy orders and market sell orders executed at current prices. When Net Taker Volume turns significantly positive, traders demonstrate willingness to pay asking prices rather than placing limit orders below market value. Consequently, this behavior indicates strong immediate demand that often precedes price appreciation. Amr Taha’s analysis reveals exceptional circumstances surrounding the recent Binance activity. The $500 million Net Taker Volume represents one of the largest hourly readings recorded during 2025. Comparatively, the cryptocurrency market experienced similar conditions on January 8, 2025, when approximately $440 million in Net Taker Volume preceded Bitcoin’s ascent from $89,000 to $96,000 within subsequent trading sessions. Historical data suggests these signals typically manifest during periods of institutional accumulation or major market structure shifts. Binance Derivatives Market Mechanics Binance operates the world’s largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchange by trading volume, making its metrics particularly influential for market analysis. The platform’s perpetual futures contracts allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price direction without expiration dates, creating continuous liquidity pools that reflect real-time sentiment. Several factors contribute to the significance of Binance’s derivatives data: Market Dominance: Binance controls approximately 60% of global crypto derivatives volume Liquidity Concentration: Major institutional and retail traders utilize the platform Real-time Transparency: Publicly available on-chain metrics enable verification Global Participation: Traders across multiple time zones create continuous activity Derivatives markets often lead spot price movements because leveraged positions amplify buying and selling pressure. When traders open large long positions with market orders, they create immediate demand that market makers must fulfill. This dynamic explains why derivatives activity frequently precedes spot market movements, particularly during volatile periods. Market analysts monitor these relationships to identify potential trend changes before they manifest in broader price action. Historical Precedents and Market Psychology Previous instances of elevated Net Taker Volume provide context for current market conditions. The table below illustrates notable historical correlations between Binance derivatives activity and subsequent Bitcoin price movements: Date Net Taker Volume BTC Price Before BTC Price After (7 days) Percentage Change Jan 8, 2025 $440 million $89,200 $96,000 +7.6% Nov 15, 2024 $310 million $72,500 $78,400 +8.1% Aug 22, 2024 $280 million $65,800 $71,200 +8.2% These historical patterns demonstrate consistent relationships between derivatives buying pressure and subsequent price appreciation. Market psychology plays a crucial role in these movements, as large buy orders create momentum that attracts additional participants. The fear of missing out (FOMO) often accelerates once critical resistance levels break, particularly when accompanied by substantial volume confirmation. Professional traders monitor these metrics alongside funding rates and open interest to gauge market overheating risks. Broader Market Context and Macroeconomic Factors The current Bitcoin surge signal occurs within a specific macroeconomic environment that influences cryptocurrency valuations. Several concurrent developments provide context for the aggressive buying behavior observed on Binance: Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions continue expanding cryptocurrency services Regulatory Clarity: Improved regulatory frameworks in key markets reduce uncertainty Monetary Policy: Potential interest rate adjustments influence risk asset allocations Technological Developments: Bitcoin network upgrades improve scalability and functionality Traditional financial markets exhibit increasing correlation with cryptocurrency movements as institutional participation grows. Consequently, macroeconomic indicators like inflation data, employment figures, and central bank policies now impact crypto valuations more directly than during previous market cycles. This integration creates more predictable patterns that quantitative analysts can model with greater accuracy. The current derivatives activity may reflect sophisticated positioning ahead of anticipated macroeconomic developments. Technical Analysis and Price Projections Technical analysts employ multiple methodologies to interpret derivatives data within broader market structures. The current Bitcoin price action demonstrates several bullish technical characteristics alongside the derivatives metrics: Support Levels: Bitcoin maintains position above key moving averages Volume Profile: Increasing volume confirms price movement validity Momentum Indicators: Oscillators show strengthening upward momentum Market Structure: Higher highs and higher lows establish uptrend framework Price projections based on current derivatives activity consider both technical patterns and historical analogs. The January precedent suggests potential for 7-9% appreciation within one to two weeks following similar signals. Applied to current price levels near $93,000, this projection aligns with Amr Taha’s suggestion of Bitcoin targeting values above $100,000. However, analysts emphasize that derivatives data represents just one component of comprehensive market assessment, requiring confirmation through other metrics. Risk Considerations and Market Dynamics While derivatives signals provide valuable insights, experienced traders acknowledge several risk factors that could alter projected outcomes. The cryptocurrency market remains susceptible to sudden volatility from multiple sources: Leverage Liquidation: Excessive leverage can trigger cascading liquidations Regulatory Announcements: Unexpected policy changes impact market sentiment Exchange Dynamics: Platform-specific issues can temporarily distort metrics Macroeconomic Shocks: Global economic developments affect risk assets Market participants should interpret derivatives data within broader contexts rather than as standalone signals. The current Net Taker Volume reading gains significance through its magnitude relative to historical norms and its alignment with other bullish indicators. However, prudent risk management remains essential, particularly in leveraged derivatives markets where positions can deteriorate rapidly during adverse movements. Professional traders typically employ hedging strategies and position sizing techniques to manage these inherent risks. Conclusion The aggressive Bitcoin buying detected on Binance derivatives markets represents a significant technical signal that historically precedes substantial price appreciation. Analyst Amr Taha’s identification of $500 million in Net Taker Volume provides quantitative evidence of strong buying pressure that could propel Bitcoin toward $100,000 valuations. This potential Bitcoin surge aligns with historical patterns observed in January 2025 and reflects broader institutional adoption trends within cryptocurrency markets. While derivatives data offers valuable insights, comprehensive market analysis requires consideration of technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, and risk management principles to navigate evolving market conditions effectively. FAQs Q1: What is Net Taker Volume in cryptocurrency markets? Net Taker Volume measures the difference between market buy orders and market sell orders executed at current prices, indicating whether traders are aggressively buying (positive) or selling (negative) assets immediately rather than waiting for better prices. Q2: Why is Binance derivatives data particularly significant for Bitcoin analysis? Binance controls approximately 60% of global cryptocurrency derivatives trading volume, making its metrics representative of broader market sentiment and providing liquidity concentrations that institutional and retail traders monitor for directional signals. Q3: How reliable are derivatives signals for predicting Bitcoin price movements? Historical data shows strong correlations between elevated Net Taker Volume and subsequent price appreciation, though these signals work best when confirmed by other technical indicators and fundamental developments rather than as standalone predictors. Q4: What risks should traders consider when interpreting derivatives buying signals? Key risks include potential leverage liquidations, regulatory announcements, exchange-specific issues that might distort metrics, and broader macroeconomic developments that could override technical signals during volatile market conditions. Q5: How does current derivatives activity compare to previous Bitcoin bull markets? The $500 million hourly Net Taker Volume represents one of the largest readings recorded during 2025, exceeding the $440 million signal that preceded January’s rally to $96,000 and suggesting potentially stronger buying pressure in current market conditions.

The Dutch semiconductor company based in the Netherlands, has become the center of a management battle that started heating up last September. The trouble began when Dutch authorities took control of the business on September 30, saying they worried the company might move its operations and technology to China. The government later backed down from that decision to ease tensions with Beijing. The situation got more complicated on October 7 when judges in Amsterdam removed Zhang Xuezheng, who founded Wingtech, from his position as Nexperia’s chief executive. The court also stripped Wingtech, the Chinese parent company, of its control over Nexperia’s shares. Judges said they had good reasons to question whether the company was being run properly. Wednesday’s hearing marks the first time the case will be discussed in public. Judges will listen to arguments about whether they should launch a full investigation into claims of poor management made by senior European staff at Nexperia. They’ll also consider whether earlier court actions should be undone. A final decision will come at a later date as reported by Reuters. When judge s si ded with Nexperia’s European managers before, they pointed out that Zhang might have faced conflicts because he owns a factory in Shanghai that sells wafers to Nexperia. They also said Zhang and Wingtech hadn’t made necessary changes to keep Nexperia off a U.S. blacklist. Chinese parent company pushes back Ruby Yang, who chairs Wingtech, said in a statemen t Tu esday that the company could only survive if previous court measures were reversed. Wingtech plans to tell the court that Zhang’s strategy for Nexperia made sense for a subsidiary of a Chinese company with major sales, customers, and growth possibilities in China, the world’s biggest car market. Zhang won’t show up in person, but his attorneys will speak for him. Dutch government representatives are expected to back Nexperia’s position. During 2025, the U.S., Dutch and Chinese governments all put measures in place affecting Nexperia, then pulled them back, citing concerns about geopolitics and strategy. Nexperia, which brought in $331 million in profit on $2.06 billion in sales during 2024, is now splitting into two smaller companies while customers search for other chip suppliers. The way Nexperia operates involves making silicon wafers in Europe that contain multiple chips. These wafers then travel to a plant in China where workers cut and package them. However, as reported by Cryptopolitan , the Dutch company stopped sending wafers to China in October because bills weren’t being paid. Nexperia plans to put $300 million into expanding packaging operations in Malaysia to serve customers outside China. The packaging facility in Dongguan has renamed itself “Nexperia China” and intends to replace European production with Chinese options, including supplies from Zhang’s WingSkySemi plant. Honda extends factory shutdowns Honda, Japan’s second-largest automaker, confirme d it will keep three Chinese factories closed for an additional two weeks because of semiconductor shortages. The plants, run through the GAC-Honda partnership, will now restart on 19 January instead of 6 January as originally planned. They shut down on 29 December before the extension was announced. These facilities made roughly 816,597 vehicles in 2024, representing about 22% of Honda’s worldwide production. The company also delivered over 850,000 vehicles in China during the same period. Honda also stopped operations at two Japanese plants in early January due to supply issues amid Nexperia fallout. The company cut its global sales forecast from 3.62 million to 3.34 million vehicles and expects semiconductor shortages to reduce operating profit by approximately $960 million for the fiscal year ending March 2026. Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports will rise in June 2027, though the specific rate will be announced at least a month before. Until then, the tariff rate on semiconductor imports from China will stay at zero for 18 months. Trade officials said their investigation found China using unfair trade practices in the industry. “For decades, China has targeted the semiconductor industry for dominance and has employed increasingly aggressive and sweeping non-market policies and practices in pursuing dominance of the sector,” the filing stated.

This analysis provides a detailed, evidence-based Cardano price prediction for 2026 through 2030, examining the technical and fundamental factors that could drive ADA toward the significant $2 threshold. Market data from Q1 2025 indicates a renewed focus on blockchain platforms with strong research foundations and real-world utility. Cardano Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Landscape Projecting ADA’s price for 2026 requires a multi-faceted approach. Analysts typically consider several core variables. These include network adoption metrics, broader macroeconomic conditions, and technological milestones on the Cardano roadmap. For instance, the full deployment of the Voltaire governance era will likely be a critical factor. This phase aims to establish a decentralized treasury and community-led funding mechanism. Consequently, successful implementation could significantly enhance network value and investor confidence. Historical price action provides essential context for future models. Cardano has demonstrated notable volatility, reacting sharply to both crypto market cycles and its own development updates. A comparison of previous bull and bear market performances against upcoming catalysts is therefore crucial. Furthermore, the growth of the decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem on Cardano serves as a tangible adoption metric. Increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and user activity directly correlate with network utility and demand for the native ADA token. Expert Consensus and Quantitative Models Financial analysts and blockchain researchers employ various models for long-term cryptocurrency valuation. Many integrate traditional metrics like Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratios with on-chain data specific to proof-of-stake networks. A report from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (2024) emphasized the growing importance of staking yields and governance participation in valuing assets like ADA. Meanwhile, quantitative models often reference Bitcoin’s halving cycles and their historical impact on the broader altcoin market, suggesting potential macro-trends for the 2025-2026 period. The Path to 2027: Technological Catalysts and Market Integration The period leading to 2027 will test Cardano’s scalability and interoperability promises. Key upgrades, often referred to as “Basho” era enhancements, focus on optimization and scaling. These improvements are designed to support higher transaction throughput and more complex smart contracts. As a result, they could unlock new use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital identity. Real-world partnerships, particularly in emerging markets for financial inclusion and supply chain management, will provide concrete evidence of adoption beyond speculative trading. Market integration remains another vital component. The potential approval of a U.S. spot Cardano ETF, following the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, could serve as a monumental demand catalyst. Such financial products would provide regulated, mainstream investment access to ADA. Additionally, the regulatory clarity expected in major jurisdictions by 2027 will define the operational landscape for all proof-of-stake networks. A favorable regulatory environment would reduce systemic risk and attract more conservative capital. Hydra Scaling Solutions: Layer-2 protocols aim to dramatically increase transaction per second (TPS) capacity. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Projects like the Midnight data-protection sidechain could expand Cardano’s reach. Institutional Staking: Growth in enterprise-grade staking services may increase network security and token lock-up. ADA Price Trajectory Toward 2030: The $2 Question The question of whether ADA can hit $2 by 2030 is fundamentally a question of market capitalization growth relative to supply inflation. Achieving a $2 price point implies a specific market valuation, which must be contextualized within the total projected cryptocurrency market cap for that period. Analysts from firms like CoinShares and ARK Invest publish long-range forecasts for the entire digital asset space. Cardano’s potential market share within that expanding pie is the critical variable. Supply dynamics play an equally important role. Cardano’s monetary policy includes a predictable, disinflationary emission schedule. The annual inflation rate will continue to decrease over time as more ADA is staked and removed from circulating supply. This built-in scarcity mechanism is a core tenet of its economic model. Therefore, if network demand grows steadily while new supply issuance slows, the fundamental price pressure is upward. However, this depends entirely on sustained utility and adoption outpacing the inflation rate. Year Key Price Driver Potential Impact on ADA 2026 Voltaire Governance Launch Increased decentralization & community ownership 2027 Scalability (Hydra) & Interoperability Higher throughput & expanded ecosystem utility 2028-2030 Mass Adoption & Regulatory Maturity Mainstream use cases & reduced investment risk Risk Factors and Contingency Analysis No prediction is complete without a balanced assessment of risks. The primary headwinds for Cardano include intense competition from other smart contract platforms, potential security vulnerabilities despite rigorous peer-review, and broader macroeconomic downturns that suppress risk-asset investment. Technological execution risk is ever-present; delays or failures in implementing key roadmap features could undermine confidence. Moreover, shifts in global monetary policy influencing capital flows into and out of speculative assets remain a dominant external factor beyond the project’s control. Conclusion This Cardano price prediction for 2026 to 2030 outlines a framework based on technological milestones, adoption metrics, and macroeconomic trends. The journey for ADA to reach $2 is plausible but not guaranteed, contingent upon the successful execution of its development roadmap and the growth of tangible utility on its network. Investors should prioritize research into on-chain activity and governance developments over short-term price speculation. The evolving narrative around Cardano will continue to hinge on its ability to deliver scalable, secure, and sustainable blockchain solutions for a global audience. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for Cardano’s price in 2026? The most critical factor will be the successful implementation and community uptake of the Voltaire governance system, which transitions control to ADA holders and could significantly increase network participation and value. Q2: How does Cardano’s staking mechanism affect its long-term price? Cardano’s proof-of-stake (Ouroboros) mechanism incentivizes holders to stake their ADA, effectively reducing the liquid circulating supply. This, combined with a disinflationary token issuance schedule, can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Q3: Could regulatory changes impact this ADA price prediction? Absolutely. Regulatory clarity, especially regarding the classification of proof-of-stake assets and staking rewards, in major economies like the U.S. and E.U. will be a significant driver of institutional investment and overall market stability. Q4: What are the main competitors to Cardano that could affect its growth? Cardano faces competition from other smart contract platforms like Ethereum (post-merge), Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Its differentiation lies in its peer-reviewed, research-driven approach and focus on security and formal verification. Q5: Is the $2 ADA target based purely on speculation? No serious analysis relies purely on speculation. The $2 target is derived from models considering potential market cap growth, tokenomics (supply inflation vs. demand), adoption rates of dApps and DeFi on Cardano, and the project’s execution against its published technological roadmap.

Warren urged the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to pause its review until Trump divests from the company, and warned that current stablecoin regulations fail to prevent presidential influence over agencies tasked with overseeing businesses linked to the president himself. Trump Crypto Bank Bid Draws Scrutiny US Senator Elizabeth Warren urged federal banking regulators to delay action on a bank charter application tied to a crypto platform co-founded by Donald Trump and his family. In a letter sent on Tuesday to Jonathan Gould, the Comptroller of the Currency, Warren called on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pause consideration of World Liberty Financial’s application until Trump fully divests any personal or familial financial stake in the company. Part of Warren’s letter to the OCC Warren argued that the situation presents an unprecedented conflict of interest, and warned that the regulatory framework established by recent legislation failed to adequately address ethical safeguards. She said the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law last year and designated the OCC as the primary regulator of stablecoin issuers, did not resolve concerns about presidential influence over agencies that would oversee businesses connected to the president himself. According to Warren, this leaves Congress — particularly the Senate — with a responsibility to confront what she described as “real and serious conflicts of interest.” The concerns center on a filing that was made earlier this month by WLTC Holdings, a subsidiary of World Liberty Financial , which applied for a national trust bank charter. Approval would allow the company to issue, custody, and convert its USD1 stablecoin under federal supervision. Trump and his sons Barron, Eric, and Donald Trump Jr. are listed as co-founders of the platform, which reportedly generated billions of dollars in paper wealth for the family. Warren argued that this financial connection fundamentally complicates the OCC’s ability to act as an impartial regulator. In her letter , Warren said she has “no confidence” that Gould will fairly assess the application, due to his prior responses to questions about safeguarding the OCC from presidential influence. She warned that the comptroller will be responsible for writing rules that could directly affect World Liberty’s profitability while also enforcing compliance against the firm and its competitors — all while serving at the pleasure of the president. In Warren’s view, this creates a scenario in which a sitting US president could effectively oversee a financial company in which he has a personal stake.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-14 05:30:00

This persistent weakness in American Bitcoin demand manifests most clearly through the Coinbase Premium indicator, which has remained predominantly negative since early November 2024, according to data from CoinDesk. The current trading environment shows Bitcoin consistently priced lower on U.S.-based exchange Coinbase compared to global platform Binance, signaling reduced American buying pressure that could influence broader market dynamics throughout 2025. Bitcoin Demand Divergence Between US and Global Markets The cryptocurrency market currently presents a puzzling scenario where Bitcoin’s price recovery hasn’t translated into renewed American enthusiasm. Market data reveals that Bitcoin consistently trades at a discount on Coinbase compared to Binance, typically ranging between $50 and $200 throughout early 2025. This price discrepancy, known as the “Coinbase discount,” directly contradicts patterns observed during previous bull markets when U.S. investors typically paid premiums for Bitcoin access. Furthermore, trading volume analysis shows American exchanges capturing a declining percentage of global Bitcoin transactions, dropping from approximately 35% in early 2024 to around 28% by January 2025. Several factors contribute to this weakening Bitcoin demand in American markets. Regulatory uncertainty continues to influence institutional behavior, particularly following the SEC’s delayed decisions on spot Bitcoin ETF applications and ongoing congressional debates about digital asset frameworks. Additionally, traditional financial institutions have maintained cautious positions despite Bitcoin’s price recovery, with many waiting for clearer regulatory guidance before committing significant capital. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance has also impacted investor sentiment, as higher interest rates make risk-free Treasury yields more attractive compared to volatile digital assets. Historical Context of US Bitcoin Market Leadership American investors historically drove Bitcoin market cycles, particularly during the 2017 and 2021 bull markets. Institutional adoption accelerated dramatically between 2020 and 2022, with companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square making substantial Bitcoin purchases. The Coinbase Premium indicator, which measures the price difference between Coinbase and Binance, consistently showed positive values during these periods, indicating strong U.S. demand. This premium peaked dramatically in October 2023 when it reached approximately $350, coinciding with speculation about Bitcoin ETF approvals. However, the indicator turned negative in early November 2023 and has remained predominantly negative since, marking the longest sustained period of U.S. demand weakness in Bitcoin’s history. Analyzing the Coinbase Premium Indicator Trends The Coinbase Premium serves as a crucial barometer for institutional Bitcoin demand in American markets. This indicator calculates the percentage difference between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase Pro and Binance, with positive values indicating stronger U.S. demand and negative values suggesting weaker American interest. Throughout 2024, the premium displayed remarkable volatility before settling into predominantly negative territory. Market analysts attribute this shift to several interconnected factors affecting Bitcoin demand among American institutions. Key observations from Coinbase Premium data include: The premium reached its 2024 peak of +2.3% in October before turning negative November 2024 marked the beginning of sustained negative readings The indicator has shown brief positive spikes but quickly returned to negative territory Current readings consistently range between -0.5% and -1.2% The premium correlates strongly with U.S. trading volume percentages This sustained negative premium contrasts sharply with global Bitcoin demand patterns. Asian and European markets have demonstrated stronger buying interest during the same period, particularly following regulatory developments in jurisdictions like Hong Kong and the European Union’s comprehensive MiCA framework implementation. The geographical shift in Bitcoin demand leadership represents a significant development for global cryptocurrency market structure, potentially altering liquidity patterns and price discovery mechanisms. Institutional Behavior and Regulatory Impacts American institutional investors have adopted increasingly cautious approaches to Bitcoin throughout 2024 and into 2025. Major financial institutions that previously announced cryptocurrency initiatives have slowed implementation timelines, while others have quietly reduced their digital asset exposure. This institutional hesitation directly impacts Bitcoin demand metrics, as these entities typically represent the largest volume buyers during market recoveries. Several regulatory developments have particularly influenced this cautious stance toward Bitcoin investment. The Securities and Exchange Commission continues its deliberate approach to cryptocurrency regulation, creating uncertainty that affects institutional Bitcoin demand. Multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications remain pending despite earlier market expectations for 2024 approvals. Banking regulators have simultaneously increased scrutiny on cryptocurrency exposures, with the Federal Reserve issuing guidance about digital asset risks for banking organizations. Congressional efforts to establish comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation have progressed slowly, leaving market participants without clear regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin investment and custody. Bitcoin Demand Factors in US vs Global Markets (2024-2025) Factor US Market Impact Global Market Impact Regulatory Clarity Limited progress, creating uncertainty Advancing frameworks in EU, Hong Kong, UAE Institutional Adoption Cautious, waiting for clearer signals Progressive, with new entrants regularly Trading Volume Trend Declining percentage of global total Increasing in Asian and European markets Price Premium/Discount Consistent discount on Coinbase Neutral to slight premium on Asian exchanges Market Structure Implications The weakening American Bitcoin demand has significant implications for market structure and price discovery. Historically, U.S. trading hours produced the highest volatility and volume, but this pattern has shifted toward Asian and European sessions. Liquidity providers have adjusted their operations accordingly, with some reducing American market-making activities while expanding Asian coverage. This geographical redistribution of Bitcoin demand and liquidity could potentially reduce market efficiency during U.S. trading hours while increasing importance of global coordination for price stability. Comparative Analysis with Previous Market Cycles Current Bitcoin demand patterns in American markets differ substantially from previous recovery periods. Following the 2018 bear market, U.S. institutional interest accelerated rapidly throughout 2019, with the Coinbase Premium showing consistent positive values ahead of the 2020-2021 bull market. Similarly, after the 2022 downturn, American investors returned relatively quickly, particularly following banking sector instability in early 2023. The current prolonged weakness in Bitcoin demand despite price recovery represents an unprecedented divergence from historical patterns. Several unique factors distinguish the current environment from previous cycles. Macroeconomic conditions present particular challenges, with persistent inflation concerns and elevated interest rates reducing risk appetite among traditional investors. Geopolitical tensions have increased capital preservation instincts, while banking sector stability has reduced one traditional catalyst for Bitcoin adoption. Technological developments have also evolved, with layer-2 solutions and alternative blockchain networks capturing investment that might previously have flowed directly into Bitcoin. Notable differences from previous recovery periods include: Longer duration of negative Coinbase Premium readings Reduced retail participation despite price recovery Increased regulatory scrutiny across multiple agencies Stronger competition from alternative digital assets More developed institutional infrastructure elsewhere Potential Scenarios for US Bitcoin Demand Recovery Market analysts have identified several potential catalysts that could reverse the current weakness in American Bitcoin demand. Regulatory developments represent the most significant potential driver, particularly approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs that would provide traditional investors with familiar access vehicles. Congressional action establishing clear digital asset frameworks could similarly boost institutional confidence and Bitcoin investment. Macroeconomic shifts might also influence demand, particularly if interest rate reductions increase risk appetite or if dollar weakness enhances Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative store of value. Technological advancements could additionally stimulate Bitcoin demand through improved accessibility and utility. Continued development of layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network enhances Bitcoin’s transaction capabilities, while institutional custody solutions address security concerns that have limited some traditional investor participation. Corporate treasury adoption represents another potential demand source, particularly if high-profile companies resume Bitcoin accumulation strategies following clearer regulatory guidance. Monitoring Key Indicators Market participants should monitor several specific indicators for signs of changing Bitcoin demand dynamics in American markets. The Coinbase Premium remains the most direct measurement, with sustained positive readings signaling demand recovery. Trading volume ratios between U.S. and global exchanges provide additional context, particularly if American platforms regain market share. Institutional flow data from regulated platforms like CME Bitcoin futures offers insight into professional investor behavior, while on-chain analytics reveal accumulation patterns among large Bitcoin holders. Conclusion The persistent weakness in U.S. Bitcoin demand despite the cryptocurrency’s price rebound represents a significant market development with implications for global digital asset dynamics. The sustained negative Coinbase Premium indicator, combined with reduced American trading volumes, signals cautious institutional behavior influenced by regulatory uncertainty and macroeconomic factors. While global Bitcoin demand has demonstrated resilience, particularly in Asian and European markets, American participation remains subdued as investors await clearer signals. This divergence in Bitcoin demand patterns between geographical regions may influence price discovery mechanisms and market structure throughout 2025, potentially creating opportunities while highlighting the evolving nature of global cryptocurrency adoption. FAQs Q1: What is the Coinbase Premium indicator and why does it matter for Bitcoin demand? The Coinbase Premium measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance exchanges. Positive values indicate stronger U.S. demand, while negative values suggest weaker American interest. This indicator matters because it provides real-time insight into institutional Bitcoin demand patterns, particularly among U.S.-based investors who predominantly use regulated platforms like Coinbase. Q2: How long has U.S. Bitcoin demand been weak according to current data? American Bitcoin demand weakness has persisted since early November 2024, marking approximately three months of predominantly negative Coinbase Premium readings as of January 2025. This represents the longest sustained period of U.S. demand weakness relative to global markets in Bitcoin’s history, particularly notable because it coincides with a broader price recovery. Q3: What factors are contributing to weak Bitcoin demand in American markets? Several interconnected factors contribute to weak U.S. Bitcoin demand, including regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency frameworks and ETF approvals, cautious institutional behavior amid macroeconomic concerns, reduced retail participation compared to previous cycles, and increased competition from global markets with clearer regulatory environments. Q4: How does current U.S. Bitcoin demand compare to previous market cycles? Current U.S. Bitcoin demand patterns differ substantially from previous recovery periods. Following previous bear markets, American institutional interest typically accelerated ahead of price recoveries, with positive Coinbase Premium readings. The current prolonged weakness despite Bitcoin’s price rebound represents an unprecedented divergence from historical patterns, suggesting structural changes in market participation. Q5: What could reverse the current weakness in American Bitcoin demand? Potential catalysts for renewed U.S. Bitcoin demand include regulatory developments like spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, congressional action establishing clear digital asset frameworks, macroeconomic shifts such as interest rate reductions, technological advancements improving Bitcoin accessibility, and resumed corporate treasury adoption following clearer regulatory guidance.

Chinese buyers cannot receive more than half of the total chips sold to American customers. Nvidia needs to prove it has enough H200 chips available in the United States. Chinese companies buying these chips must show they have proper security measures in place and promise not to use them for military work. These requirements did not exist before. President Donald Trump said last month he would permit the chip sales if the U.S. government received a 25% fee. Critics from both political parties attacked this plan, saying the chips could strengthen Beijing’s military and hurt America’s lead in artificial intelligence technology. Jay Goldberg, who analyzes stocks for Seaport Research, described the export limits as a middle-ground solution that puts some controls on Nvidia’s sales to China but might be tough to monitor properly. “As we have seen, companies have found ways to get access to those chips, and the U.S. government appears highly transactional in their approach to chip exports,” Goldberg explained. “Put another way, this looks like a Band-Aid, a temporary attempt to cover the huge gap among the U.S. government’s export policy makers.” Massive Chinese demand exceeds supply Chinese technology firms have already ordered more than 2 million H200 chips , which cost about $27,000 each, according to a report from last month. This number is much higher than Nvidia’s current stock of 700,000 chips. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang told reporters the company was increasing production of H200 chips. He said strong demand from China and other countries was pushing up rental prices for H200 chips already running in cloud computing centers. Saif Khan, who worked as director of technology and national security on the White House National Security Council during Joe Biden’s presidency, warned the new rule would give China’s AI programs a major boost. “The rule would allow about two million advanced AI chips like the H200 to China, an amount equal to the compute owned today by a typical U.S. frontier AI company,” Khan stated. “The Administration will also face challenges enforcing the rule’s know-your-customer requirements that restrict Chinese cloud providers from supporting nefarious uses.” Policy reversal from Biden Era These worries had led the Biden administration to block sales of advanced AI chips to China completely. However, the Trump administration, guided by White House AI director David Sacks, believes selling advanced AI chips to China will discourage Chinese rivals like the heavily penalized Huawei from working harder to match the top chip designs from Nvidia and AMD. When Trump announced the sales last month, he promised they would ship to China “under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security.” Questions remain about whether the administration will actually enforce any restrictions on chip shipments, or even if Beijing will permit these sales inside China. Given past smuggling operations worth $160 million, enforcement challenges loom large. Last month, reports indicated the U.S. had started a review that could lead to the first chip shipments to China. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Over the last six months, a profound shift has occurred: companies worldwide have absorbed Bitcoin at a rate triple that of new coins entering the market. This aggressive corporate treasury strategy, led by industry titans, signals a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s evolution from a speculative asset to a core corporate reserve. The implications for market liquidity, price discovery, and long-term valuation are now coming sharply into focus for investors and analysts globally. Corporate Bitcoin Accumulation Reaches Unprecedented Levels Recent data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, reported by Cointelegraph, reveals a startling trend. From late 2023 into early 2024, public and private corporations added approximately 260,000 Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Consequently, this buying spree created immense upward pressure on available supply. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin network itself minted only about 82,000 new BTC through its mining process during the identical timeframe. Therefore, corporate demand effectively consumed over three times the freshly issued supply. This supply squeeze highlights a critical change in market structure. Traditionally, new Bitcoin from miners provided consistent sell-side liquidity. Now, however, a new class of institutional holders is systematically removing that liquidity. The total corporate Bitcoin hoard now stands at an estimated 1.2 million BTC. To put this in perspective, that represents over 5.7% of Bitcoin’s entire fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. This concentrated ownership among a relatively small group of entities marks a significant departure from Bitcoin’s decentralized origins. The Titans Driving the Bitcoin Treasury Trend One company dominates the corporate Bitcoin landscape. MicroStrategy, under the unwavering leadership of executive chairman Michael Saylor, holds a colossal position. Its treasury now contains roughly 687,000 BTC, valued at approximately $65.5 billion at recent prices. This single entity controls nearly 60% of all Bitcoin held by corporations globally. MicroStrategy’s strategy, initiated in August 2020, has evolved from a bold experiment into a defining corporate finance case study. The company consistently uses debt and equity proceeds to acquire more Bitcoin, viewing it as a superior store of value to cash. Other significant players are also building substantial positions. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), a major Bitcoin miner, holds about 53,250 BTC worth around $5 billion. Unlike MicroStrategy, Marathon generates Bitcoin directly through its mining operations. It often holds a significant portion of its mined coins rather than selling them for operational expenses. This practice, known as ‘HODLing,’ turns miners from natural sellers into strategic accumulators, further constricting supply. MicroStrategy (MSTR): ~687,000 BTC ($65.5B) – The undisputed leader. Marathon Digital (MARA): ~53,250 BTC ($5B) – A major mining entity. Other Public Companies: Includes Tesla, Block Inc., and Coinbase, among others. Private Corporations: A growing but less transparent cohort of holders. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Future Impact Financial analysts point to several converging factors behind this trend. First, persistent inflation and low real interest rates have eroded the appeal of traditional cash holdings. Second, Bitcoin’s finite supply and digital scarcity offer a compelling hedge against currency debasement. Third, improved regulatory clarity and custody solutions have reduced operational barriers for corporations. As a result, adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury has moved from a fringe idea to a serious boardroom discussion. The long-term impact on Bitcoin’s market is multifaceted. On one hand, reduced liquid supply can decrease volatility and support higher price floors. On the other hand, extreme concentration raises questions about market resilience and decentralization. Furthermore, the correlation between corporate Bitcoin buying and broader macroeconomic conditions is becoming increasingly evident. For instance, periods of expansive monetary policy have often coincided with accelerated corporate accumulation. Bitcoin Mining and the New Supply Dynamic Understanding the 82,000 BTC of new supply is crucial. Bitcoin miners validate transactions and secure the network. In return, they receive block rewards in the form of newly created Bitcoin. This issuance follows a predetermined, disinflationary schedule known as the ‘halving,’ which cuts the reward in half approximately every four years. The next halving is projected for April 2024, which will reduce daily new supply from 900 BTC to 450 BTC. The fact that corporate buying so drastically outpaces this new issuance has profound implications. It suggests that demand is not merely absorbing new coins but is actively competing for existing coins on the open market. This creates a powerful supply shock. Miners, who were once a primary source of sell pressure, are now often holding their coins or selling to specific corporate buyers in over-the-counter (OTC) deals to avoid moving the public market price. Supply vs. Demand: Last 6 Months Metric Amount (BTC) Notes New Bitcoin Mined ~82,000 Approx. 900 BTC per day Corporate Accumulation ~260,000 3.2x the new supply Net Supply Shock -178,000 BTC Coors removed from liquid circulation Conclusion The data is unequivocal: corporate Bitcoin accumulation has become the dominant force in the asset’s supply-side economics. Companies are now removing Bitcoin from circulation at a rate that dwarfs the creation of new coins. This trend, spearheaded by MicroStrategy and followed by others, is transforming Bitcoin from a traded commodity into a strategic reserve asset. While this concentration presents new questions about market centralization, it undeniably underscores Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a legitimate treasury asset. The coming years, especially post-halving, will test the sustainability of this trend and its ultimate impact on Bitcoin’s price stability and market maturity. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that corporate accumulation outpaces new supply? It means companies are buying Bitcoin faster than the network creates it. They are purchasing existing coins from the market, reducing the total liquid supply available to other investors. This can create upward price pressure. Q2: Why are companies like MicroStrategy buying so much Bitcoin? These companies view Bitcoin as a superior long-term store of value compared to holding cash, which can lose purchasing power due to inflation. They believe Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and global adoption will increase its value over time. Q3: Does this corporate buying make Bitcoin more centralized? Yes, to a degree. While the Bitcoin network remains decentralized in its operation, ownership is becoming more concentrated among large entities. This is a shift from its early days of widespread individual ownership. Q4: How does the Bitcoin ‘halving’ affect this trend? The halving cuts the rate of new Bitcoin supply in half. If corporate and institutional demand remains constant or increases, the supply shock caused by their accumulation will become even more pronounced after the halving event. Q5: What are the risks for corporations holding large Bitcoin treasuries? Primary risks include Bitcoin’s high price volatility, potential regulatory changes, cybersecurity threats to their holdings, and accounting complexities. Their stock prices often become highly correlated with Bitcoin’s price.

This sudden decline represents one of the most notable price movements in recent months, prompting immediate analysis from financial experts and blockchain analysts worldwide. Bitcoin Price Movement Analysis Market data reveals Bitcoin’s descent below $95,000 marks a 7.2% decline from its weekly high of $102,400. Trading volume surged by 42% during the price drop, indicating substantial market participation. The Binance USDT market specifically recorded $3.2 billion in BTC transactions within the first hour of the decline. Meanwhile, other major exchanges including Coinbase and Kraken showed similar price movements, confirming the market-wide nature of this correction. Historical context provides crucial perspective for this development. Bitcoin previously reached the $95,000 level in February 2025, establishing it as a significant psychological support zone. Technical analysts note the 50-day moving average currently sits at $96,500, making today’s drop particularly noteworthy. The cryptocurrency’s relative strength index (RSI) now registers at 38, suggesting potential oversold conditions that could influence future trading decisions. Market Context and Contributing Factors Several macroeconomic factors likely contributed to today’s Bitcoin price movement. Federal Reserve interest rate decisions announced yesterday created uncertainty across traditional financial markets. Additionally, regulatory developments in major economies including the European Union and United States introduced new compliance considerations for institutional investors. Global stock markets showed correlated movements, with technology indices declining 2.3% during the same trading period. Cryptocurrency market dynamics reveal important patterns. Ethereum declined 5.8% alongside Bitcoin, while several altcoins experienced more substantial corrections. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by $180 billion within 24 hours. Liquidity metrics indicate normal market functioning despite the volatility, with bid-ask spreads remaining within typical ranges across major trading platforms. Expert Perspectives on Market Conditions Financial analysts emphasize the importance of perspective during market movements. “Bitcoin’s volatility remains inherent to its market structure,” notes Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Senior Blockchain Economist at Cambridge Digital Assets Programme. “Today’s movement represents normal market correction within a long-term upward trend established since 2023.” Historical data supports this analysis, showing similar percentage declines occurred 14 times during Bitcoin’s 2024 bull market without altering the overall trajectory. Institutional investment patterns provide additional context. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust reported net inflows of $120 million yesterday, suggesting continued institutional interest despite price volatility. Futures market data shows open interest decreasing by 8%, indicating some leverage reduction among traders. Options market activity reveals increased put option volume, reflecting hedging behavior rather than purely bearish sentiment. Technical Analysis and Support Levels Technical indicators offer specific insights for traders and investors. The $94,000 level represents the next major support zone, followed by $91,500 based on previous consolidation patterns. Resistance now appears at $97,200, then $99,800 based on Fibonacci retracement levels from the recent rally. On-chain data from Glassnode reveals important metrics: Exchange inflows increased 35% during the decline Active addresses remained stable at 980,000 daily Miner reserves showed minimal change at 1.82 million BTC Realized profit/loss ratio indicates profit-taking activity Market structure analysis reveals symmetrical patterns to previous corrections. The current decline mirrors February’s 8.5% correction that preceded a 22% rally. Volume profile analysis shows strongest trading activity between $94,500 and $95,500, suggesting this range may establish temporary equilibrium. Derivatives data indicates healthy market conditions despite price movement, with funding rates normalizing after brief spikes. Historical Comparisons and Market Cycles Bitcoin’s price history provides valuable context for current movements. Similar percentage declines occurred regularly during previous bull markets, including 13 corrections exceeding 10% during the 2017 cycle and 8 during the 2021 cycle. The average duration of such corrections historically measures 18 days, with average recovery periods of 42 days to previous highs. Current market conditions differ significantly from previous cycles due to increased institutional participation and regulatory clarity in major markets. Long-term holders demonstrate notable behavior patterns during corrections. Chain analysis reveals addresses holding Bitcoin for over one year actually increased their holdings during today’s decline, adding approximately 12,000 BTC to cold storage. This “accumulation during weakness” pattern has characterized every major Bitcoin bull market since 2016, suggesting experienced investors view corrections as buying opportunities rather than exit signals. Global Regulatory Environment Impact Regulatory developments significantly influence cryptocurrency market dynamics. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework implementation continues progressing smoothly. United States regulatory clarity has improved with recent legislative proposals gaining bipartisan support. Asian markets show varying approaches, with Japan maintaining progressive regulations while China continues its restriction policies. These regulatory developments create a complex global landscape affecting institutional adoption rates and market stability. Institutional adoption metrics continue showing positive trends despite price volatility. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded its 18th consecutive day of inflows yesterday. Fidelity’s digital asset division reported 23% quarterly growth in institutional clients. Traditional finance integration progresses with 42% of global banks now offering some cryptocurrency services, according to Bank for International Settlements data published last month. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $95,000 represents a significant but not unprecedented market movement within the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Market fundamentals remain strong with increasing institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Technical indicators suggest potential support levels while historical patterns provide context for expected recovery timelines. The Bitcoin price movement today highlights the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility while demonstrating its maturing infrastructure and growing integration with traditional finance systems. Investors should maintain perspective, recognizing that similar corrections have consistently preceded new all-time highs throughout Bitcoin’s history. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $95,000? Multiple factors contributed including Federal Reserve policy uncertainty, normal market correction after recent gains, and temporary profit-taking by some investors. Market data shows healthy fundamentals despite the price movement. Q2: How does this decline compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? Today’s 7.2% decline falls within normal historical parameters. Bitcoin experienced 14 similar corrections during its 2024 bull market alone, with average recovery periods of approximately six weeks to previous highs. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Technical analysis identifies $94,000 as immediate support, followed by $91,500. The $90,000 level represents major psychological support based on previous consolidation patterns and institutional buying activity. Q4: Are other cryptocurrencies affected similarly? Yes, most major cryptocurrencies showed correlated movements. Ethereum declined 5.8%, while several altcoins experienced larger corrections. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased approximately 6.5% during the same period. Q5: What should investors consider during this volatility? Investors should maintain long-term perspective, diversify appropriately, avoid emotional decisions, and consider dollar-cost averaging strategies. Historical data shows disciplined approaches during volatility typically outperform reactive trading strategies over extended periods.

This major industry gathering, scheduled for January 17 in the heart of Seoul’s digital district, promises to set the strategic agenda for agent system deployment in the coming year. Furthermore, the event boasts significant backing from BNB Chain as its lead sponsor and Bitcoin World as a key media partner, signaling strong ecosystem support for this fusion of technologies. Unibase AI Web3 Summit: A Confluence of Vision and Infrastructure The Unibase AI Web3 Summit represents more than a typical conference. It is a targeted symposium on the practical integration of autonomous AI agents with blockchain-based decentralized networks. Unibase itself provides critical context for this event. As a decentralized AI memory layer, Unibase tackles a core challenge in advanced AI: providing persistent, secure, and scalable memory for AI agents outside centralized silos. This infrastructure is fundamental for the reliable operation of AI across Web3 environments. Consequently, the summit will serve as a live platform to demonstrate and debate the real-world applications of this foundational technology. Industry analysts view this event as a direct response to the growing demand for decentralized AI solutions. In recent years, concerns over data sovereignty, model transparency, and single points of failure in centralized AI have accelerated research into blockchain-based alternatives. The summit’s focus on “agent systems” highlights a shift from standalone AI models to persistent, interactive digital entities that can perform complex tasks, manage assets, and operate autonomously on decentralized networks. This shift necessitates new architectural paradigms, which events like this aim to crystallize. The Strategic Role of BNB Chain and Attendee Ecosystem The sponsorship by BNB Chain is a major indicator of the summit’s significance. BNB Chain, one of the world’s largest smart contract platforms by daily active users, brings immense scalability and a vast developer community to the table. Its involvement suggests a strategic priority to position its ecosystem as a premier home for decentralized AI applications. By co-hosting this event, BNB Chain facilitates crucial connections between AI innovators and Web3 builders. The roster of attending projects reads like a who’s who of next-generation AI. Representatives from KITE AI, Boings.ai, FLock, SOON, and Sentient are confirmed participants. Each entity brings a distinct expertise: KITE AI is known for its work on knowledge-intensive AI tasks. Boings.ai often focuses on generative AI and content creation models. FLock specializes in federated learning and privacy-preserving AI training on blockchain. SOON and Sentient are engaged in developing autonomous AI agent frameworks and economies. This diverse participation ensures discussions will cover the full AI agent lifecycle, from training and memory to deployment and economic interaction. The collective goal is to map out a coherent path for the expansion of these systems throughout 2026. Decentralized AI Memory: The Bedrock for 2026 Agent Systems To understand the summit’s importance, one must grasp the concept of a decentralized AI memory layer. Traditional AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), often lack persistent memory between sessions or operate with memory controlled by a single entity. A decentralized memory layer, like the one Unibase is building, stores an AI agent’s experiences, knowledge, and operational state across a distributed network. This approach offers several definitive advantages for the future of Web3. First, it enhances security and censorship resistance . An agent’s memory and identity are not stored on a vulnerable central server. Second, it enables true user ownership and portability . Users could potentially own their AI agent’s memory, moving it across different applications and platforms. Third, it facilitates trust and verifiability through blockchain’s inherent transparency, allowing users to audit an agent’s training data or decision history. These features are not merely incremental improvements; they are prerequisites for AI agents that manage digital assets, execute smart contracts, or operate in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Core Benefits of a Decentralized AI Memory Layer Feature Centralized AI Memory Decentralized AI Memory (e.g., Unibase) Data Sovereignty Held by platform operator Controlled by user/agent owner Uptime & Resilience Single point of failure risk Distributed across network nodes Interoperability Often locked to one ecosystem Designed for cross-platform portability Verifiable Provenance Opaque data history Auditable on-chain record Seoul’s Emergence as a Web3 and AI Innovation Hub The choice of Seoul as the host city is strategically astute. South Korea has emerged as a global leader in both broadband connectivity and cryptocurrency adoption. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has actively promoted blockchain initiatives through its “Seoul Blockchain Governance” project. Additionally, South Korea boasts a robust AI research sector, with significant investments from both conglomerates and startups. Hosting the AI x Web3 2026 Summit in Seoul leverages this unique confluence of technological prowess, regulatory forward-thinking, and vibrant developer culture. The event will likely attract not only local Korean talent from companies like Samsung and Naver but also international teams looking to engage with this advanced market. Anticipated Outcomes and the Roadmap for 2026 The summit’s agenda, centered on the “deployment and expansion of agent systems in 2026,” suggests several tangible expected outcomes.

As the show aired, hosts and viewers regularly checked Polymarket to see how traders were betting, and the collective judgment proved surprisingly accurate. The platform’s CEO, Shayne Coplan, took to X to highlight Polymarket’s near-perfect predictions at the awards. He said, “The single most mainstream prediction market integration to date. Polymarket called 26/28 winners right.” The milestone comes as Polymarket expands beyond entertainment into real-world economic forecasting . The platform has partnered with Parcl, a data firm that tracks daily home values, to allow users to wager on whether housing prices in major U.S. cities will rise or fall. The two firms recently announced that they will collaborate to enable users to bet on their predictions for median prices in cities such as Miami and Los Angeles. These markets will close on February 1, with winners determined using Parcl’s daily price index. However, according to Polymarket, new housing prediction markets will be introduced every month, allowing people to continue trading based on fresh data. Some X users bashed the Golden Globes collaboration with Polymarket In his post, Coplan noted that there’s still plenty of work to do in helping people understand why market-based forecasts matter, even if their accuracy is hard to dispute. Nonetheless, he described the Golden Globes’ partnership as “a surreal moment and a highlight for all our team members’ moms.” Some X users were genuinely surprised at how accurate the prediction platform was, with others encouraging more mainstream adoption. However, the integration also drew in a flurry of critical posts. One user, Josh Billinson, remarked , “The Golden Globes Best Podcast odds presented by Polymarket are a new low for this humiliating awards show.” Another commenter urged the public to resist the prediction platforms, referring to them as “pocket casinos,” while others even questioned the legitimacy of the award show. The criticism builds on recent concerns surrounding Polymarket and other prediction markets, after the controversial Venezuela-related bet. An anonymous bettor correctly called the Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s downfall just hours ahead of his capture and pocketed more than $400,000. His earnings triggered concerns about insider trading. New York Democrat Ritchie Torres even proposed a 2026 bill that would ban government officials and staff from trading on prediction markets using insider information. The bill, the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026, would prevent officials from using nonpublic government information to place bets on prediction markets. Several U.S. states are opposed to prediction markets Currently, Polymarket is valued at approximately $9 billion, placing it just behind market leader Kalshi . Most top prediction markets experienced significant growth leading up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election and continued to perform strongly afterward. For instance, in December, Kalshi and Polymarket collectively accrued nearly $9 billion in trading volume. Over the past few months, Polymarket and Kalshi have also partnered with several media organizations. Yahoo Finance has teamed up exclusively with Polymarket, whereas Google Finance will display information from both platforms. Moreover, CNN has partnered officially with Kalshi to integrate its data, and last week, Polymarket agreed to provide exclusive market insights to The Wall Street Journal and other Dow Jones publications. However, the platforms have also faced resistance from U.S. states. For starters, Tennessee regulators issued cease-and-desist letters last week to Kalshi, Polymarket, and Crypto.com, targeting their allegedly unlicensed sports betting operations. The mandates require the firms to discontinue sports contract offerings, cancel pending contracts, and return all funds to customers by January 31. Although registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the state’s Sports Gaming Act requires any platform taking sports bets to have a Tennessee license, which none of the three hold. At least 10 states have taken action against prediction markets over the past year, with Tennessee being the latest addition. Kalshi has previously received cease-and-desist orders from Nevada, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Montana, and Ohio. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Speaking to journalists in Paris, Stéphane Pontoizeau, Executive Director of the Market Intermediaries and Market Infrastructures Supervision Directorate at the AMF, noted that the regulator had already written to companies in November, reminding them to respond before the license deadline on June 30, 2026. The transition period for the MiCA license varies for different EU countries. France-based crypto businesses that fail to obtain a license will be required to cease operations in July. According to Reuters , only 30% of crypto firms in France responded to the regulator and have applied for a license. Whereas, 40% said they are not seeking one. Last week, French regulators warned the public against unregulated crypto offerings from companies that are not authorized to do so. French regulator says some crypto firms unresponsive as EU licence deadline approaches https://t.co/viWYHc1t2J https://t.co/viWYHc1t2J — Reuters Tech News (@ReutersTech) January 14, 2026 Companies Not Having MiCA Authorization Must ‘Orderly Wind-Down Plan’: ESMA Under the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) requirements, companies that have not obtained MiCA authorization must implement an “orderly wind-down plan” before the end of the transition period. Last month, the European Commission proposed transferring crypto oversight from national regulators to ESMA. By doing so, the EC aims to eliminate regulatory fragmentation across 27 member states by granting ESMA powers comparable to those of the U.S. SEC. So far, the MiCA license has been granted to stablecoin issuer Circle, US exchanges Coinbase, OKX, Crypto.com, Binance, and British ​fintech Revolut. AMF is Pushing for Centralized Crypto Oversight In September last year, France issued a warning noting that it may attempt to block some crypto firms licensed in other EU nations from operating domestically. The country threatened to challenge MiCA “passporting” granted by different member states. The AMF President Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani urged to transfer oversight of the industry to ESMA in Paris. This would be a “more harmonized” approach to supervision of the crypto sector, she added.

This comprehensive analysis examines the factual landscape surrounding XRP price predictions from 2026 through 2030, specifically addressing the pivotal question of whether the digital asset can achieve the psychologically significant $5 threshold. Market data from Q1 2025 shows XRP trading within a consolidated range, reflecting ongoing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption metrics that will fundamentally shape its trajectory. XRP Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Horizon Financial institutions increasingly integrate RippleNet’s payment solutions, creating tangible demand drivers for XRP. Consequently, analysts project moderate growth for 2026 based on current adoption rates. The resolution of major regulatory proceedings provides clearer operational parameters for Ripple Labs. Market technicians reference historical volatility patterns and liquidity metrics when formulating their forecasts. Several prominent analysis firms published 2026 projections in recent quarterly reports. These projections typically consider three primary scenarios: Conservative Scenario ($0.95-$1.40): Assumes gradual adoption and stable macroeconomic conditions. Moderate Scenario ($1.45-$2.20): Incorporates accelerated central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships. Bullish Scenario ($2.25-$3.00): Requires substantial banking sector integration and favorable global regulations. Transaction volume data from the XRP Ledger shows consistent year-over-year growth. This growth suggests increasing utility beyond speculative trading. Network validators now number in the hundreds, enhancing decentralization and security substantially. The 2027-2028 Projection Window: Critical Infrastructure Development Market cycles historically influence cryptocurrency valuations significantly. The 2027-2028 period may align with broader market trends. Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with financial institutions could mature operationally during this timeframe. Real-world asset tokenization initiatives on the XRP Ledger may gain substantial traction. Expert Consensus and Diverging Methodologies Traditional financial analysts apply discounted cash flow models to Ripple’s business operations. Conversely, cryptocurrency specialists emphasize network effect valuations and Metcalfe’s Law principles. A survey of fifteen published analyst reports reveals a median 2028 price target of $2.80. However, the standard deviation remains considerable, indicating persistent market uncertainty. The following table summarizes key institutional forecasts for the 2027-2028 period: Institution/Analyst 2027 Target 2028 Target Primary Rationale Digital Asset Research Group $1.90 $2.70 Cross-border payment volume growth Blockchain Analytics Firm $2.40 $3.30 CBDC interoperability adoption Financial Technology Institute $1.70 $2.50 Conservative regulatory expansion Technological upgrades, particularly to the XRP Ledger’s smart contract capabilities, could expand use cases dramatically. These upgrades might attract decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible token (NFT) projects. Consequently, such developments would create additional demand vectors for XRP beyond payment facilitation. The 2029-2030 Outlook: Assessing the $5 Threshold Possibility Reaching a $5 valuation represents approximately a tenfold increase from early 2025 price levels. This achievement would require substantial fundamental improvements in utility and adoption. Market capitalization analysis provides crucial context for this ambitious target. A $5 XRP price implies a total market valuation exceeding $250 billion based on current circulating supply metrics. Historical precedent shows that top-tier cryptocurrencies can achieve such valuations under specific conditions. Bitcoin and Ethereum previously demonstrated this capacity during previous market cycles. However, each asset possesses unique value propositions and adoption pathways. For XRP, the path to $5 likely depends on several concurrent developments: Mass Institutional Adoption: Major banks must utilize XRP for liquidity at scale. Regulatory Clarity: Consistent global frameworks must support digital asset operations. Technology Superiority: The XRP Ledger must maintain competitive advantages in speed and cost. Macroeconomic Environment: Favorable conditions for alternative asset classes must persist. Demographic adoption trends show increasing familiarity with digital assets among younger generations. This familiarity could drive organic growth in XRP utilization for both retail and institutional purposes. Furthermore, geopolitical shifts toward digital currency systems may accelerate Ripple’s value proposition for international settlements. Quantitative Models and Risk Factors Statistical models incorporating volatility, correlation with traditional assets, and adoption curves generate probabilistic forecasts. These models typically assign a 15-25% probability to XRP reaching $5 by 2030 under current conditions. Black swan events, both positive and negative, could alter these probabilities significantly. Positive developments might include unexpected central bank partnerships or technological breakthroughs. Conversely, several material risks could impede progress toward higher valuations. Regulatory setbacks in major economies remain a persistent concern. Competitive threats from other blockchain payment solutions continue to evolve. Additionally, macroeconomic downturns typically reduce risk asset appetites, potentially affecting XRP’s correlation patterns. Conclusion This XRP price prediction analysis for 2026-2030 reveals a complex interplay of technological, regulatory, and market forces. The possibility of Ripple’s token reaching $5 by 2030 exists within plausible scenarios, particularly those involving accelerated institutional adoption and favorable regulatory outcomes. However, investors should consider the substantial volatility and uncertainty inherent in cryptocurrency markets. Ultimately, XRP’s long-term valuation will reflect its demonstrable utility in solving real-world financial inefficiencies, making ongoing adoption metrics the most reliable indicator of future price trajectories. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic XRP price prediction for 2026? Most analytical models suggest a range between $0.95 and $3.00 for 2026, with moderate scenarios clustering around $1.45-$2.20, depending primarily on adoption rates of RippleNet by financial institutions and broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Q2: What key factors could help XRP reach $5 by 2030? Critical factors include widespread banking adoption for cross-border settlements, favorable global regulatory frameworks, technological advancements on the XRP Ledger, expansion into DeFi and tokenization markets, and sustained positive cryptocurrency market cycles. Q3: How does regulatory clarity affect XRP price predictions? Regulatory clarity reduces operational uncertainty for Ripple Labs and its partners, potentially accelerating institutional adoption. Clear guidelines typically decrease volatility and increase long-term investor confidence, which analysts incorporate into their valuation models. Q4: What are the main risks to these XRP price predictions? Significant risks include adverse regulatory developments in major economies, increased competition from other blockchain payment systems, technological vulnerabilities, macroeconomic downturns reducing risk appetite, and slower-than-expected adoption by financial institutions. Q5: How do expert predictions for XRP differ from community price targets? Expert predictions typically rely on fundamental analysis of adoption metrics, financial models, and regulatory assessments. Community targets often reflect more optimistic sentiment, technical analysis patterns, and longer-term speculative narratives, sometimes resulting in higher projected figures.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has until January 20 to respond to Warren’s concerns in a written commitment to uphold the law. In a January 13 letter to the Comptroller of the Currency, Jonathan Gould, Senator Warren, a Ranking Member in the Senate Committee on Banking, raised concerns about World Liberty Financial (WLF)’s submitted application to the OCC to operate a national trust bank, specifically designed for stablecoin services. She reminded Gould that WLF is a financial company co-founded by President Donald Trump and his two sons, which poses a significant conflict of interest. Sen. Warren also reminded the Comptroller of her July 2025 letter regarding this exact possibility, requesting information on the OCC’s plans to ensure the President’s interests do not influence OCC policy. She emphasized her lack of confidence in Gould’s ability to fairly review the application pursuant to the legal standard for approval based on the Comptroller’s previous dismissive response. Gould dismisses Warren’s concerns as hypothetical In his August 20, 2025, response to Sen Elizabeth Warren, the Comptroller dismissed Warren’s concerns about Trump’s influence on the OCC’s independence and decisions related to WLF or USD1 as hypothetical. Meanwhile, Gould stated that the OCC complies with Executive Order 14215, including requirements to consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the White House National Economic Council, the directors of the Office of Management and Budget, and the White House Domestic Policy Council. However, Sen. Warren emphasized that the scenario is no longer hypothetical and called for the Senate to address these serious conflicts of interest issues as it considers legislation on the crypto market structure. In the meantime, she requested the Comptroller to delay the review of WLF’s application until the president divests from the financial company and removes all financial conflicts of interest involving himself or his family and the company. “We have never seen financial conflicts or corruption of this magnitude. The United States Congress failed to address them when it passed the GENIUS Act into law…President Trump and his family have probably earned more than one billion dollars from WLF and other cryptocurrency ventures.” – Sen. Elizabeth Warren , U.S. Senator of Massachusetts The Massachusetts Senator also pointed out that the OCC is now the primary regulator of federally licensed stablecoin issuers, responsible for approving applications, promulgating rules, supervising stablecoin issuers, and initiating enforcement actions for law violations. However, she is concerned that Gould, who openly supports Executive Order 14215 and the GENIUS Act, is set to review a bank charter application submitted by a company directly tied to the President and his family. Sen. Warren warns U.S. banking system’s integrity is at stake The Ranking Member warned that the integrity of the federal banking system is at stake, pointing out that the OCC could become the president’s pocketbook. According to Sen. Warren, the president of the United States could be in charge of his own financial company for the first time in history. Warren is concerned that if the Comptroller approves WLF’s application, the OCC will be promulgating rules that influence the profitability of the president’s company. The OCC will also be responsible for directly supervising and enforcing the law against the president’s company and its competitors, while serving at the president’s pleasure. Warren told Gould that it is his duty and responsibility to ensure businesses and households have fair access to financial services and that the U.S. banking system remains stable. She emphasized that U.S. banking regulators should not be working to enrich their boss. According to Warren, the GENIUS Act failed to prevent the President, his family, or his affiliates from financially benefiting from stablecoin activities. She noted that this glaring omission left open the possibility of the exact current situation.

This substantial shift, reported by the analytics platform Onchainlens on April 10, 2025, represents one of the most significant single-actor position changes in recent months, potentially signaling a change in sentiment among the market’s most influential participants. Crypto Whale Executes Profitable Exit and Bearish Pivot According to detailed on-chain transaction data, the trader’s activity unfolded in two clear phases. First, the entity closed out profitable long positions across a diversified portfolio. Subsequently, the whale deployed substantial capital to short the three major assets. The use of 20x leverage on the new short positions amplifies both potential returns and risks, indicating a high-conviction view on a near-term price decline. This type of leveraged activity by large holders, often called ‘whales,’ is closely monitored as it can provide early signals of market direction. Key actions by the whale include: Profit Taking: Closed longs on HYPE, SOL, BTC, ETH, and XRP for a total gain of $14.49 million. Bearish Positioning: Opened new short positions specifically targeting BTC, ETH, and SOL. Capital Deployment: Committed $35 million in capital to these shorts. Risk Profile: Employed 20x leverage, a high-risk, high-reward strategy common in derivatives trading. Understanding Whale Movements and Market Impact Whale transactions are a critical component of cryptocurrency market analysis. These large holders possess the capital to move markets, and their collective actions often precede broader trends. When a whale takes profits, it can indicate a local market top. Conversely, opening large short positions suggests an expectation of falling prices. The combination of both actions—profit-taking followed by shorting—is particularly noteworthy. It demonstrates a strategic shift from a bullish to a bearish outlook within a single trading cycle. Market analysts use tools like Onchainlens to track these wallets. The platform aggregates data from public blockchains, providing transparency into the movements of large entities. While the identity of ‘255 $BTC Sold’ remains unknown, the wallet’s history and transaction size confirm its status as a major player. The table below contextualizes the scale of this move relative to typical market flows. Metric This Whale’s Move Typical Daily Derivative Volume* Short Position Value $35 Million $50-$80 Billion Leverage Used 20x Average 5-10x Profit Realized $14.5 Million N/A *Estimated aggregate across major exchanges for top assets. While $35 million is a small fraction of total daily volume, concentrated whale shorts can influence trader psychology and liquidity in specific perpetual swap markets. Expert Analysis on Leverage and Market Sentiment Financial analysts specializing in crypto derivatives note that a 20x leveraged short is an aggressive stance. “This isn’t a hedge; it’s a directional bet,” explains Dr. Lena Chen, a researcher at the Digital Asset Governance Institute. “The sequence is key. By banking substantial profits first, the whale has secured capital and reduced overall portfolio risk before initiating a high-leverage counter-trend position. This pattern often appears when sophisticated traders anticipate a volatility spike or a trend reversal, potentially driven by macroeconomic factors or asset-specific news.” Historically, similar large-scale short accumulations have sometimes preceded corrective phases. For instance, in early 2024, a cluster of whale short positions preceded a 15% market correction over the following two weeks. However, correlation does not equal causation. Many such bets are also liquidated if the market moves against them. The current macroeconomic backdrop, including interest rate decisions and regulatory developments, provides essential context for this whale’s bearish pivot. The Role of On-Chain Data in Modern Crypto Journalism The very reporting of this event underscores the evolution of financial journalism in the blockchain era. On-chain analytics platforms have become indispensable tools. They transform the immutable, public ledger of cryptocurrency transactions into actionable intelligence. Platforms like Onchainlens, Glassnode, and Nansen track wallet flows, exchange movements, and derivative positioning. This data-driven approach allows for factual reporting on market structure shifts, moving beyond speculation to evidence-based analysis. For retail investors, understanding these signals is part of risk management. A single whale’s action is not a guaranteed market forecast. Rather, it is a significant data point among many. Savvy investors monitor such flows alongside traditional metrics like trading volume, funding rates in perpetual swaps, and broader financial news. The transparency of blockchain data uniquely empowers all market participants to conduct a level of surveillance previously available only to institutional players. Conclusion The decisive action by the ‘255 $BTC Sold’ crypto whale—taking $14.5 million in profits and opening $35 million in leveraged short positions on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana—stands as a major event in the current market cycle. It exemplifies the high-stakes, data-transparent nature of digital asset trading. While this move signals a bearish outlook from one influential entity, market participants should integrate this information with a holistic view of on-chain indicators, derivatives market health, and global economics. This event highlights the critical importance of on-chain analytics in understanding the complex and often sentiment-driven cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their trading activity can potentially influence the market price of that asset. Q2: What does it mean to ‘short’ Bitcoin or Ethereum? Shorting is an investment strategy that bets on the price of an asset decreasing. In crypto, traders often short using derivatives like perpetual swaps, where they profit if the price falls below their entry point. Q3: How does 20x leverage work on a short position? Using 20x leverage means the trader controls a position worth 20 times their initial capital. It magnifies both gains and losses. A 5% price move in their favor yields a 100% return on capital, but a 5% move against them can lead to a total loss of their collateral. Q4: Why is on-chain data important for crypto news? Blockchains are public ledgers. On-chain data provides verifiable, real-time evidence of large transactions, wallet movements, and smart contract interactions, forming a factual basis for reporting beyond rumor or speculation. Q5: Should retail investors follow whale trades? While whale activity is a valuable data point, retail investors should not blindly follow it. Whales have different risk profiles and strategies. Their moves are best used as one component of a broader, personalized research and risk management strategy.

China trade with the United States keeps shrinking China’s hipments to the U.S. dropped 30% in December from a year earlier, extending losses for a ninth straight month, while imports declined 29% during the same period, according to the customs data. For the full year of 2025, China’s exports to the U.S. slid 20%, while imports fell 14.6%. Lv Daliang, the customs authority spokesperson, addressed the drop while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. After introducing Lv Daliang, he said trade ties with the U.S. should remain mutually beneficial and called for dialogue and negotiation to deal with disputes and expand cooperation. In December, exports to the EU rose 12%, while shipments to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations increased 11%. Imports from European countries climbed 18%, but purchases from Southeast Asia dropped 5%, keeping the overall balance tilted outward for China. China surplus pressure spreads across global trade International officials warned about the size of the surplus. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, urged Beijing in December to rely less on exports and speed up efforts to lift domestic consumption. Chinese officials said in December they would expand imports and aim for more balanced trade. The backdrop remains difficult. The nearly $19 trillion economy stayed under deflation pressure as a deep real estate downturn hurt household spending and a weak job market weighed on confidence. Consumer prices were flat through 2025, missing the official 2% target. There were limited signs of easing tensions with Washington. In October, Xi Jinping met Donald Trump, now serving as the 47th president of the United States after winning the 2024 election. The talks led to a one-year trade truce, rolling back some export controls and higher tariffs. Beijing also pledged to buy at least 12 million tons of U.S. soybeans within two months. Official data showed soybean imports totaled 111.8 million tons last year, up 6.5% from 2024. December soybean imports rose 1.3% to 8 million tons. Exports of rare earths jumped 32% in December to 4,392 tons, and full-year shipments of the critical mineral rose 12.9%. China is set to release annual and fourth-quarter GDP data next Monday, with economists expecting 4.5% growth in the final quarter, below the 5% growth target set by president Xi Jinping. Iron ore also posted record trade figures, as Chinese imports rose 1.8% to a high of 1.26 billion tons, a third year of increases, according to the customs data. Still though, a build up of ore in port stockpiles has become more pronounced in recent months, suggesting demand from steel mills has begun to lag.

Warren’s New Warning,https://bitcoinist.com/bitwise-cio-defends-bitcoin-401ks-warrens-warning/,"While a senator presses the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans, Bitwise’s CEO has defended the Trump administration’s push to allow digital assets’ inclusion in retirement funds. Hougan Slams Bitcoin Restrictions In 401(k)s On Monday, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan discussed whether 2026 will be the year investors can own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans, as the inclusion of digital assets is becoming more common in individual retirement accounts (IRAs). In an interview, the executive argued that providers are “slow to move,” but noted that the Trump administration’s pro-crypto shift , which removed “what was effectively a ban on Bitcoin from 401(k)s,” has opened the doors. Hougan pointed out that large firms like Vanguard had strong restrictions but have recently relaxed their stance on Bitcoin investments. He argued that these bans are “ridiculous,” calling BTC “just another asset” that is no more volatile than stocks, such as those of Nvidia. Does it go up and down? Absolutely. Is there risk in it? Absolutely. But it’s actually less volatile over the last year than Nvidia stock. And you don’t see any rules about banning 401k providers from offering Nvidia stock. That’s not that would seem ridiculous. Recent K33 Research data showed that Bitcoin recorded the least volatile year in the asset’s history in 2025. Notably, BTC registered its lowest volatility level last year, with just 2.24%. “So, I don’t know if the 401(k) providers will get all the way to the point of actually putting it in this year. These are very slow moving institutions, but we’re moving in that direction and eventually it’ll be normalized like other assets, which is how it should be treated,” he concluded. Senator Warren Issues New Warning Bitwise CEO’s remarks came as Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren reached out directly to SEC chairman Paul Atkins to question how the Commission intends to protect investors from potential financial risks now that crypto investments are allowed in retirement plans. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Department of Labor (DOL) rescinded in May a 2022 guidance that discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency investments in 401(k) retirement plans. Months later, US President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order (EO) that aimed to allow more private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets in 401(k) retirement accounts. The EO, signed on August 7, 2025, directed the DOL and the SEC to reduce regulatory barriers that prohibited investments in alternative assets in their defined contribution retirement plans. In a new letter, the anti-crypto senator shared her concerns, cautioning that allowing Bitcoin and other crypto assets into these accounts could enable significant risks. She listed the “volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, the lack of market transparency, and potential conflicts of interest” as reasons to be cautious about introducing these assets into retirement plans. She also emphasized that 401(k) plans are a vital source of retirement security for most Americans. Therefore, they should not be treated as a “playground for financial risk” that could put investors in vulnerable positions. Despite Warren’s warnings, multiple US lawmakers have supported the Trump Administration’s efforts. In September, nine House members asked Atkins to provide “swift assistance” in implementing the president’s executive order and work with the DOL to protect workers. Later, House of Representatives member Troy Downing proposed a bill to codify Trump’s directive, giving “the force and effect of law” and making it easier for investors to access Bitcoin and other alternative assets in their 401(k) retirement plans.",Crypto News|401(K) Retirement Plan|bitcoin|Bitcoin 401(k) plans|Bitcoin invesment|Bitwise|Bitwise CIO|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto 401(k) plans|Elizabeth Warren|Matt Hougan|Senator elizabeth Warren,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-14 06:00:10

This proactive maintenance, while disruptive, demonstrates the project’s commitment to operational stability and user security in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Network errors of this nature require immediate attention to prevent potential chain halts or security vulnerabilities, making this maintenance period essential for the ecosystem’s long-term health. MEVerse Maintenance Addresses Critical Mainnet Network Error The MEVerse development team identified a network synchronization error within its mainnet architecture, prompting the scheduled maintenance. Consequently, the team will implement necessary protocol adjustments and validation rule updates. This process typically involves halting block production temporarily to apply patches or consensus rule changes. Furthermore, such maintenance windows allow developers to deploy hotfixes for discovered bugs that could affect transaction finality or node communication. The five-hour duration suggests a comprehensive update rather than a simple restart, potentially including: Consensus mechanism adjustments to improve validator coordination Network layer optimizations for enhanced peer-to-peer communication State database verification to ensure chain integrity Security patch implementation addressing identified vulnerabilities Mainnet maintenance represents standard protocol for blockchain projects encountering technical issues. However, the transparency and defined timeline help maintain community trust during necessary service interruptions. Understanding Blockchain Network Errors and Maintenance Protocols Network errors in blockchain systems can originate from multiple sources, including consensus failures, peer discovery issues, or memory pool inconsistencies. These errors often manifest as stalled block production or validator desynchronization. Therefore, scheduled maintenance provides a controlled environment for resolution. The MEVerse approach mirrors industry best practices established by major networks like Ethereum and Solana during their own upgrade processes. For instance, Ethereum’s mainnet merges and hard forks similarly required coordinated downtime for validators. Comparatively, MEVerse’s five-hour window appears efficient for the required technical work. Recent Blockchain Maintenance Events (2023-2024) Blockchain Maintenance Reason Duration Year Polygon Consensus Upgrade 4 hours 2023 Avalanche Network Optimization 3 hours 2024 BNB Chain Security Patch 6 hours 2023 MEVerse Network Error Fix 5 hours 2025 This table illustrates how planned maintenance remains common across leading blockchain platforms. Each event aims to enhance network performance, security, or scalability without compromising decentralized principles. Expert Analysis on Mainnet Stability and User Impact Blockchain infrastructure experts emphasize that regular maintenance signifies project maturity rather than failure. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a distributed systems researcher at Stanford University, notes, “Well-managed blockchain networks proactively schedule maintenance when detecting anomalies. This prevents cascading failures that could lead to extended downtime or security incidents.” Her research indicates networks with regular, transparent maintenance schedules experience 40% fewer unplanned outages annually. For MEVerse users, the maintenance means temporary suspension of: Transaction processing and confirmations Smart contract executions and deployments Decentralized application interactions Token transfers between wallets However, user funds remain secure in their wallets during maintenance, as blockchain states persist unchanged. The team likely recommends users avoid initiating transactions near the maintenance window to prevent failed operations. Technical Implications and Future Prevention Strategies The specific network error prompting this maintenance could relate to MEVerse’s hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof-of-Stake and sharding technologies. These complex systems sometimes experience edge-case synchronization issues between validator committees. Accordingly, the development team probably conducted extensive testing on a testnet replica before deploying fixes to the mainnet. Future prevention strategies may include enhanced monitoring systems and more frequent protocol audits. Additionally, the team might implement: Automated anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms Improved validator communication protocols to reduce synchronization lag Gradual rollout mechanisms for future updates to minimize disruption Blockchain networks continuously evolve their resilience measures. Each maintenance event provides valuable data for strengthening infrastructure against similar issues. Conclusion The MEVerse maintenance addressing the mainnet network error represents a responsible approach to blockchain stewardship. This five-hour scheduled downtime allows developers to implement crucial fixes ensuring network stability, security, and performance. While temporarily disruptive, such maintenance ultimately benefits all ecosystem participants by preventing more severe issues. The transparent communication and defined timeline demonstrate the project’s commitment to operational excellence. As blockchain technology matures, controlled maintenance windows will remain essential for sustainable network evolution and user protection. FAQs Q1: What should MEVerse users do during the maintenance? Users should avoid initiating transactions, smart contract interactions, or token transfers during the five-hour window. Wallet balances remain secure, and normal operations will resume post-maintenance. Q2: How common is mainnet maintenance in blockchain projects? Regular maintenance is standard industry practice. Major networks like Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana all schedule periodic upgrades requiring temporary network pauses for implementation. Q3: Could the network error have affected user funds or data? Blockchain design typically isolates consensus errors from wallet security. User funds and transaction history remain intact on the immutable ledger during network maintenance. Q4: What causes mainnet network errors in blockchain systems? Common causes include validator synchronization issues, consensus rule ambiguities, peer discovery failures, memory pool inconsistencies, or edge-case transaction processing bugs. Q5: Will decentralized applications on MEVerse be affected? Yes, dApps will experience service interruption during maintenance as they cannot read from or write to the blockchain. Services should resume normal operation after maintenance completion.

Monero Has Shot Up To A New All-Time High Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies have been locked in consolidation recently, but Monero has been an outlier, with its price breaking away with a strong surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decouples From Global Liquidity: Analyst Says Quantum Threat Behind It Below is a chart that showcases how the asset’s recent performance has looked. The sharp rally has led to new all-time highs (ATHs) for the privacy-focused token, with the latest one coming earlier in the past day around $695. XMR has retraced a bit since this new high, but it’s still in a weekly profit of 51%, which is significantly higher than the returns of other top assets. For perspective, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen returns of +1% and -2% in this period, respectively. Fellow privacy coin Zcash (ZEC) was flying earlier, but the asset has faced a steep 23% drop during the same window. Generally, rallies of the order that Monero has seen attract attention from traders, and data would confirm that the same has been true for the latest one as well. XMR Has Seen A Peak In Social Dominance Recently According to data from analytics firm Santiment, the Monero Social Dominance witnessed a spike recently. This indicator keeps track of the percentage of the Social Volume associated with the top 100 tokens that a given cryptocurrency is responsible for. The Social Volume here refers to a measure of the total number of posts/comments/threads on the major social media platforms that contain mentions of a given asset. In other words, it tells us about the amount of discussion that a particular coin is receiving from social media users. As such, the Social Dominance contains information about how the degree of talk surrounding a cryptocurrency compares against that of the top 100 coins combined. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric for Monero since the start of 2026: As displayed in the above graph, the Monero Social Dominance saw a huge spike on Sunday as the asset’s rally took off, suggesting social media interest in the asset shot up. Historically, a rapid surge in the Social Dominance has often corresponded to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) developing among traders, which is something that tends to not end well for rallies.

Wintermute’s review noted that investors focused on trading Bitcoin, Ether, and a few large-cap tokens. The change represented a distinct departure from previous cryptocurrency cycles, as cash flowed through ETFs and DATs, resulting in liquidity concentration at the top of the market. According to the report, ETFs expanded their universe by offering staking capabilities while DATs increased their mandates to invest in these assets. Market liquidity shifts in crypto 2025 Liquidity came into crypto in 2025, but where did it go? Using Wintermute’s proprietary OTC flow, our Digital asset OTC markets 2025 report shows where capital actually went and why market structure fundamentally changed Read on for our key findings ↓ pic.twitter.com/Zw2pYRrozB — Wintermute (@wintermute_t) January 13, 2026 Trade activity in 2025 was significantly different from that of previous years. Wintermute reported that institutional entities stayed consistently overweight in majors beginning in the second quarter of last year. The report clarified that institutional investors traded strategically in response to headlines in 2025. For example, many institutional investors abruptly shifted into Bitcoin following Trump’s tariff statement on April 2, 2025. The OTC market review noted that investors started the year underweight in majors and remained net sellers throughout the first quarter. Bitcoin liquidity and positioning reached their peak in May and June of 2025. According to BTCsats, Bitcoin’s average price was over $103,434, with highs of almost $111,970 and lows of about $93,400 in May. In June, Bitcoin’s average price increased to almost $105,714, with intraday highs exceeding $110,500, and the month ending close to $107,135. The Wintermute report revealed that since 2022, most retail investors have been net sellers of major cryptocurrencies, choosing instead for exposure to altcoins; that pattern broke in 2025. The report indicated that altcoins took a different trend, while majors absorbed most of the liquidity in 2025. It showed that retail investors switched back to altcoins during the second and third quarters of last year, before reversing into the huge 10/10 deleveraging event in the hopes of an altcoin season. According to the report, the 10/10 move triggered a sharp, forced unwind across crypto markets, resulting in approximately $19 billion in liquidations over 24 hours. The widely anticipated leverage had been building unevenly in altcoins before the event. Wintermute further reported that overall Open Interest reached approximately $230 billion. Notably, Open Interest worth around $70 billion was concentrated outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. A larger portion of the Open Interest was subsequently flushed out, with altcoin Open Interest declining by roughly 55% to around $30 billion by mid-December last year. Last year, the aggregate performance of altcoins declined sharply, falling to sustain any significant gains, except for brief rebounds, according to the review. Wintermute noted that the average altcoin rally lasted only around 20 days on median days, compared to about 45 to 60 days in 2024, suggesting a decrease in conviction and an increase in tactical risk-taking. OTC Options activity accelerates in 2025 The digital asset OTC market review revealed that engagement between counterparties increased despite muted price action. OTC trades increased dramatically, indicating a more structured approach to trading. The report showed that many investors preferred discretion and capital efficiency offered by OTC markets. Wintermute OTC data showed that trade counts increased by approximately 2.1 times compared to the first-quarter levels of 2025. Additionally, notional value reached 3.8 times by the fourth quarter, indicating consistent expansion in both ticker frequency and size. The OTC data revealed that the OTC desks were in high demand, as proven by the growing number of participants involved throughout the year. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

This feature, available in Gate App, marks Gate's expansion beyond crypto asset trading into traditional finance price-based products, further strengthening its multi-asset trading framework. According to the platform, Gate TradFi contracts use USDx as the margin and account display unit. USDx is neither fiat nor crypto, but an internal accounting unit used specifically for TradFi assets, pegged 1:1 to USDT. After users transfer USDT into their TradFi account, balances are displayed in USDx. The underlying value remains fully backed by USDT, with no manual conversion required and no additional exchange or custody fees incurred. In terms of trading mechanics, Gate TradFi contracts differ notably from crypto perpetual futures contracts. TradFi products follow conventions of the traditional financial market, including fixed trading sessions and market closures. Leverage is set at fixed levels and cannot be adjusted manually by users. Margin operates under a cross-margin model, and long and short positions on the same trading pair can be hedged based on position size. Profit and loss are calculated using counterparty prices, and overnight financing fees apply during market closures, aligning overall rules with those of mainstream CFD markets. In terms of fees and leverage settings, Gate TradFi contracts support leverage of up to 500x for major products such as foreign exchange and indices, while equity CFDs support leverage of up to 5x. Gate TradFi features a fee structure with per-trade commissions starting at $0.018, offering a more defined and transparent cost model for users. From a system and risk management perspective, Gate TradFi is powered by the MT5 (MetaTrader 5) trading system, with account data and transaction records synchronized between the Gate App and the MT5 client. The platform employs a margin-ratio-based liquidation mechanism. When an account's margin ratio falls to 50% or below, the system will initiate a forced liquidation process, gradually closing relevant positions in accordance with predefined rules to manage overall risk exposure. In addition, Gate has recently introduced a TradFi campaign. Eligible users who register for the program can receive up to 110 USDT in trial rewards and, upon completing qualifying trades, unlock additional phased incentives of up to 3,000 USDT to support their initial TradFi trading experience. The expansion of TradFi broadens Gate's trading ecosystem into traditional financial asset price trading, providing users with more options for multi-asset price discovery, risk hedging, and trading decisions within a single platform. To some extent, this product structure simplifies cross-platform operations and reflects a broader trend of crypto trading platforms adopting more mature financial market rules in product design and risk management. As the boundaries between crypto markets and traditional financial markets continue to blur, demand for multi-asset and cross-market trading is expected to grow further. The introduction of Gate TradFi marks a key step in the platform's exploration of integrated trading infrastructure and offers a new practical reference to incorporate different asset classes within a compliant framework. About Gate Gate, founded in 2013 by Dr. Han, is one of the world's earliest cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform serves over 48 million users with 4,200+ digital assets and pioneered the industry's first 100% proof-of-reserves.

Meanwhile, financial markets across the region shifted their attention toward imminent trade data from China, a release that could dictate sentiment for Asian currencies and global risk assets for the coming week. This dual pressure point highlights the fragile state of Asia FX markets, caught between domestic political winds and pivotal external economic indicators. Japanese Yen Plunges on Election Uncertainty Currency traders aggressively sold the yen, pushing the USD/JPY pair above the critical 158.00 threshold for the first time since late 2023. Market analysts immediately attributed the sharp decline to rising political uncertainty. Specifically, reports emerged over the weekend suggesting potential leadership challenges within Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). These reports fueled speculation about a possible snap election, creating immediate volatility. Consequently, investors fear any political shift could delay or alter the nation’s carefully calibrated path toward monetary policy normalization. Furthermore, the yen’s weakness underscores a persistent divergence in global interest rate trajectories. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintains its ultra-accommodative stance, characterized by negative short-term rates and yield curve control. In stark contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve signals a “higher for longer” approach. This policy gap continues to drive capital flows out of yen-denominated assets, seeking higher yields elsewhere. The political noise simply amplifies this fundamental pressure, eroding the currency’s appeal as a traditional safe-haven asset. Expert Analysis on Yen Vulnerability Financial institutions provided rapid analysis of the situation. “The yen is acting as a political barometer,” noted a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “While the BoJ’s stance is the primary driver, political instability introduces a new layer of risk premium. Markets are pricing in the possibility that fiscal discipline or structural reforms could stall.” Historical data supports this concern. For instance, periods of Japanese political transition in 2005-2006 and 2012 coincided with significant yen volatility, often requiring official intervention to stabilize markets. Additionally, Japan’s Ministry of Finance (MoF) faces renewed pressure. Officials have repeatedly stated they will take “appropriate action” against disorderly currency moves. The current rapid depreciation tests their resolve. Past interventions in 2022 and 2023 occurred when the USD/JPY moved with similar speed toward the 150-152 range. Market participants now watch for any verbal or physical intervention signals as the pair tests new multi-year highs. China Trade Data Takes Center Stage for Asia FX While the yen dominated headlines, the broader Asia FX complex traded cautiously. The focus pivoted decisively toward China’s upcoming release of October trade statistics. Economists polled by Reuters forecast a 6.5% year-on-year increase in exports, a slight acceleration from September’s 5.8% growth. However, import growth is expected to moderate to 4.0%, reflecting ongoing softness in domestic demand. This data serves as a crucial health check for the world’s second-largest economy and a key trading partner for nearly every Asian nation. A stronger-than-expected export figure could provide immediate support for trade-linked currencies like the South Korean won, Taiwanese dollar, and Australian dollar. Conversely, weak imports would reinforce concerns about China’s sluggish consumer and investment recovery, potentially weighing on regional sentiment and commodity prices. The following table outlines recent trends and consensus forecasts: Indicator September 2025 October 2025 Forecast Market Implication Exports (YoY) +5.8% +6.5% Positive for regional trade, risk sentiment Imports (YoY) +4.5% +4.0% Negative for domestic demand outlook Trade Balance $85.2B $88.0B Supports yuan stability, forex reserves The Chinese yuan itself traded within a tight band ahead of the data, with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) setting a firmer-than-expected daily midpoint fix. This action signaled official intent to curb excessive volatility. The stability of the yuan is paramount for regional currency markets, as it acts as an anchor. Significant moves in the USD/CNY pair often trigger correlated movements across emerging Asia FX. Broader Asia FX Market Reaction and Outlook The ripple effects from the yen’s slide and China’s data wait were clearly visible. The Korean won and Indonesian rupiah edged lower, reflecting a general risk-off tone in early trading. Meanwhile, the Philippine peso and Indian rupee showed relative resilience, supported by their own central banks’ hawkish rhetoric. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which uses the exchange rate as its primary policy tool, is also closely monitoring these cross-currents, as Singapore’s trade-dependent economy is highly sensitive to regional FX shifts. Looking ahead, the trajectory for Asian currencies hinges on three key factors: U.S. Economic Data and Fed Policy: Upcoming U.S. CPI and jobs reports will heavily influence the dollar’s strength, the primary external driver for Asia FX. Commodity Price Movements: Currencies of resource exporters like the Australian and Malaysian dollars remain tethered to prices for iron ore, LNG, and palm oil. Central Bank Actions: Potential intervention by Japanese authorities or a policy shift from the PBOC could abruptly alter market dynamics. The Geopolitical and Economic Context This episode of currency market stress occurs against a complex geopolitical backdrop. Ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and key Asian economies, along with evolving supply chain dynamics, directly impact currency valuations. Moreover, many Asian nations continue to grapple with high public debt levels, making them vulnerable to sharp currency depreciations that increase foreign debt servicing costs. Therefore, central banks in the region must carefully balance supporting growth with maintaining financial stability, a challenging task in the current volatile environment. Conclusion The Japanese yen’s plunge to a 1.5-year low, driven by domestic political speculation, and the tense anticipation of China’s trade data encapsulate the dual forces shaping Asia FX markets. Political risk has resurfaced as a potent driver for the yen, complicating the Bank of Japan’s policy landscape. Simultaneously, China’s economic pulse, as measured by its trade flows, remains the dominant fundamental for regional currency sentiment and global risk appetite. For traders and policymakers alike, navigating this period requires vigilance toward both sudden political developments and hard economic data, as the interplay between them will determine the next major move in Asian foreign exchange rates. FAQs Q1: Why did the Japanese yen fall so sharply? The yen fell due to market speculation about potential political instability and a snap election in Japan, combined with the ongoing wide interest rate gap between the ultra-loose Bank of Japan and other major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve. Q2: What is the significance of China’s trade data for other Asian currencies? China is the largest trading partner for most Asian economies. Strong Chinese export data suggests healthy global demand, which benefits regional exporters and supports their currencies. Weak import data, however, signals soft domestic demand in China, which can hurt economies reliant on selling goods to China. Q3: What is “yield curve control” and how does it affect the yen? Yield curve control (YCC) is a Bank of Japan policy where it targets specific interest rates on government bonds to keep borrowing costs low. This policy suppresses returns for yen-based investments, making the currency less attractive compared to those from countries with higher interest rates, leading to selling pressure on the yen. Q4: Could Japan intervene to stop the yen’s decline? Yes, Japan’s Ministry of Finance has a history of intervening in currency markets when movements are deemed excessively volatile and disorderly. They may issue verbal warnings or directly buy yen using foreign reserves to influence its value. Q5: How do political elections typically impact a country’s currency? Elections create uncertainty about future economic, fiscal, and trade policies. Markets dislike uncertainty, often leading to capital outflows and currency weakness until the political outlook becomes clearer. The impact depends on the perceived policy differences between competing parties or candidates.

The emphasis of the post is not simply on XRP itself, but on Grok’s ability to map investor behavior across different stages of price movement. By using Grok’s illustration, the post argues that the current XRP environment can be better understood through sentiment rather than short-term price action. The message presented is direct: Grok’s visual lays out a sequence that many investors have already lived through in previous cycles, yet often fail to recognize while it is unfolding. XRP Update suggests that Grok effectively presents a guide to how most participants react emotionally at each stage, and how those reactions influence outcomes. GROK JUST SHOWED YOU THE $XRP PLAYBOOK MOST PEOPLE WON’T REALIZE IT UNTIL IT’S TOO LAT!! pic.twitter.com/prVi4qLNhB — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) January 11, 2026 How Grok’s Market Cycle Is Applied to XRP The image shared by XRP Update reveals a progression that begins with disbelief and gradual optimism, moves into confidence and excitement, and later reverses into fear, panic, and exhaustion. XRP Update applies this sequence to XRP’s current condition, indicating that sentiment remains cautious despite signs of structural positioning. According to the post, XRP appears to be in a phase where many market participants remain doubtful, often viewing any upward movement as temporary. Grok’s illustration highlights this stage as one where recovery begins quietly, without widespread conviction. XRP Update implies that this period is commonly overlooked because it lacks strong emotional confirmation from the market. The use of Grok’s chart is meant to demonstrate that this lack of confidence is not unusual but expected within the cycle. XRP Update points out that most investors tend to wait for reassurance, which historically arrives much later. Investor Behavior Through Grok’s Lens A key takeaway from XRP Update’s post is that Grok’s visual emphasizes behavior over prediction. The image shows how investors tend to become more confident only after prices have already risen significantly, and how fear intensifies after declines are well underway. XRP Update argues that this behavioral pattern repeats regardless of asset class. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By referencing Grok’s work, the post suggests that understanding these emotional phases can influence how XRP is approached. Rather than reacting to market noise, the emphasis is placed on recognizing sentiment conditions and positioning accordingly. XRP Update implies that many participants misjudge timing because they rely on emotional signals rather than structural awareness. Why XRP Update Says Most Will Realize It Too Late Although the post does not present a price target or timeline, its message is tied to Grok’s illustration that recognition usually comes after opportunity has passed. XRP Update stresses that the stages highlighted by Grok often become clear only in hindsight, once confidence or panic is already widespread.

At the same time, cryptocurrencies climbed, precious metals surged to record levels, and corporate dealmaking remained in focus with new developments around Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery. Asian markets and currency moves Asian equities edged higher, supported by gains in Japan, where local media reported that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call a snap lower house election on February 8. The prospect of an election and additional fiscal stimulus weakened the yen and boosted stocks. The Japanese yen slid to 159.44 per dollar, its weakest level since July 2024, reviving concerns about possible market intervention. The softer currency and stimulus expectations lifted the Nikkei more than 1.3% to a record high, while Japanese government bonds fell in what investors have dubbed the “Takaichi trade.” Masahiko Loo, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management, said in a Reuters report that the moves reflected expectations of fiscal easing, though he cautioned they could be overstated. “Any sharp and decisive break beyond 161 level (for yen) could trigger renewed intervention to curb excessive volatility,” Loo said. Elsewhere, MSCI’s broadest Asia-Pacific index rose 0.2%, hovering just below a record peak. The CSI 300 index was down 0.74% at the time of writing. S&P 500 futures were down 0.22%, dragged down by financial shares, while European futures pointed to a muted open. Bitcoin and crypto markets Bitcoin climbed to a two-month high as geopolitical uncertainty and concerns around US institutions boosted its appeal. The world’s largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 2.4% to $96,348 in early Asian trading, its highest intraday level since Nov. 16, although it was trading at $94,751 at the end of writing. Ether surged as much as 5.1%. “Medium term, I think we could see investors allocate more to Bitcoin on a gold-catch-up narrative — and other risk-on assets are having a great time,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of research at Arctic Digital, in a Bloomberg report. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, pointed to derivatives markets as another driver, citing “a sharp short squeeze,” with about $270 million of Bitcoin short positions liquidated in the past 24 hours. Joshua Lim of FalconX said traders broadly see the current macro backdrop as supportive for Bitcoin. Netflix to increase bid for WBD deal In corporate news, Netflix Inc. is working on revised terms for its acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., including discussions around a potential all-cash offer for the company’s studios and streaming businesses, reported Bloomberg. The changes aim to speed up a transaction that has faced political opposition and rival bids from Paramount Skydance Corp. Under the original terms, Warner Bros. shareholders were set to receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix common stock, subject to adjustments if Netflix shares fell below $97.91. Since Netflix launched its bid for Warner Bros. in October, the streaming company’s shares have declined by about 25%, touching a low of $89.07 in New York trading on Tuesday. Netflix has already secured $59 billion in bridge financing and refinanced about $25 billion with longer-term debt. Netflix has room to take on additional debt while preserving its “robust” credit ratings, according to Stephen Flynn, a senior credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, in a research note published on Tuesday. Silver and gold hit new records Precious metals surged as geopolitical tensions, US rate expectations, and concerns about Federal Reserve independence fueled haven demand. Gold rose within striking distance of a record high, while silver broke above $90 an ounce for the first time. Silver climbed as much as 5.3% to $91.5535 an ounce, with Citigroup upgrading its three-month forecast to $100 an ounce. Hao Hong of Lotus Asset Management said the rally “has a lot of room to run this year.” Gold also benefited from strong inflows, with analysts noting sustained speculative interest across global markets.

According to data from the on-chain analytics platform Onchainlens, an anonymous entity executed a substantial withdrawal of 12,000 ETH from the Binance exchange. This move, valued at approximately $39.98 million, represents a clear signal of accumulation behavior within the digital asset space. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing the potential implications for Ethereum’s price trajectory and broader market sentiment as we progress through 2025. Ethereum Whale Executes Major Binance Withdrawal The transaction occurred on the Ethereum blockchain, with the funds moving from a known Binance cold wallet to a private, non-custodial address. Following this transfer, the whale’s total publicly identifiable holdings now stand at 80,980 ETH. Historically, large-scale withdrawals from centralized exchanges like Binance carry significant weight. They typically indicate a holder’s intention to move assets into long-term storage, often through hardware wallets or complex multi-signature setups. This action reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market, as these coins become less liquid. On-chain analysts emphasize this pattern. For instance, a similar whale withdrawal of 15,000 ETH in late 2023 preceded a 28% price appreciation over the following quarter. Therefore, the current movement aligns with a recognized accumulation signal. The data from Onchainlens shows the receiving address has been active for over two years, suggesting a seasoned investor rather than a new entrant. Furthermore, the sheer size of the withdrawal places it within the top 0.1% of Ethereum transactions by volume this month. Understanding Whale Behavior and Market Impact Whale movements serve as critical indicators for market health and future direction. These large holders, often institutions or early investors, possess the capital to influence prices. Their actions provide a window into sophisticated market sentiment. A withdrawal from an exchange like Binance suggests several strategic possibilities. Primarily, it points toward a long-term holding strategy , known colloquially as ‘HODLing’. Alternatively, it could precede participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, staking, or use as collateral in lending markets. The immediate market impact often involves reduced available supply on exchanges. Data from CryptoQuant indicates that exchange reserves for Ethereum have been declining steadily throughout early 2025. This latest withdrawal contributes to that trend. A lower supply on exchanges can lead to increased price volatility, especially during periods of high buying demand. The table below contextualizes recent large whale withdrawals: Date Amount (ETH) Value (USD) Source Exchange Price 30 Days Later Jan 2024 8,500 $21M Coinbase +12% Aug 2024 18,000 $48M Kraken +18% Mar 2025 12,000 $39.98M Binance TBD Market mechanics explain this correlation. When whales remove coins, the order book depth on exchanges diminishes. This scenario means large market buy orders can execute with less slippage but also cause sharper price spikes. For retail investors, monitoring these flows provides valuable context, though it should not serve as sole investment advice. Expert Analysis and Historical Precedent Industry experts consistently track these on-chain signals. According to common analytical frameworks, exchange netflow—the difference between inflows and outflows—is a key metric. A sustained negative netflow, where withdrawals exceed deposits, often builds a foundation for bullish price action. The current event fits within a broader macro trend for Ethereum, which includes the continued growth of its Layer 2 ecosystem and its entrenched role in DeFi and NFTs. Historical precedent offers further insight. The 2021 bull market, for example, was preceded by 18 consecutive months of negative exchange netflow for Ethereum. While past performance never guarantees future results, these patterns inform probabilistic models. Analysts also cross-reference whale activity with other metrics like: Network Growth: New address creation. Hash Rate: Network security and miner commitment. Futures Open Interest: Leverage and derivatives market sentiment. Currently, most supplementary metrics remain neutral to positive, suggesting the withdrawal is part of a coherent accumulation phase rather than an isolated event. The Broader Context of Cryptocurrency Accumulation This transaction does not exist in a vacuum. It occurs within a specific regulatory and technological landscape. In 2025, clearer regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions like the EU and the UK have provided institutional investors with more confidence. Simultaneously, advancements in custody solutions have made storing large quantities of crypto assets safer than ever. These factors encourage the movement of assets off exchanges. Furthermore, Ethereum’s ongoing technological upgrades play a role. The network’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism via The Merge in 2022 created a native yield for ETH holders through staking. A whale moving 12,000 ETH could generate substantial annual rewards by participating in network validation. This economic incentive structurally promotes holding over active trading for many large stakeholders. The action also reflects a strategic view on the upcoming Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) slated for 2025, which aim to further reduce transaction costs and increase scalability. Distinguishing Between Whale Types and Intentions Not all large transactions signal the same intent. On-chain analysts differentiate between several whale categories: Accumulators: Entities consistently buying or withdrawing assets over time. Distributors: Entities moving assets to exchanges, often to sell. Traders: Entities moving assets rapidly between wallets and exchanges for short-term gains. The entity behind this latest Binance withdrawal exhibits classic accumulator behavior. Its wallet history shows periodic, sizable inflows and minimal outflows to sell-side venues. This pattern contrasts sharply with ‘distributor’ wallets, which show the opposite flow. Understanding this distinction is crucial for accurate market interpretation. Conclusion The Ethereum whale withdrawal of 12,000 ETH from Binance represents a significant on-chain event with clear implications. It signals strong accumulation sentiment among major holders, reduces immediate liquid supply, and aligns with historically bullish precedents. While no single transaction dictates market direction, this move contributes to a broader narrative of institutional confidence and long-term positioning within the Ethereum ecosystem. Market participants should monitor subsequent on-chain data, including exchange netflows and wallet activity, to see if this accumulation trend persists. Ultimately, such transparent blockchain activity provides unparalleled insight into the strategies of the market’s most influential players. FAQs Q1: What does a whale withdrawal from an exchange mean? It typically indicates the holder is moving assets into long-term storage, reducing immediate selling pressure. Analysts often interpret this as a bullish accumulation signal, suggesting confidence in the asset’s future value. Q2: How can the public track these whale transactions? Platforms like Onchainlens, Etherscan, Nansen, and CryptoQuant provide real-time on-chain analytics. They track large wallet movements, exchange flows, and aggregate this data into actionable metrics for investors. Q3: Does a whale withdrawal guarantee the price will go up? No, it does not guarantee price appreciation. While it is a historically positive signal, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by numerous factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market sentiment. Q4: What is the difference between an exchange withdrawal and a transfer between private wallets? A withdrawal from an exchange to a private wallet reduces the liquid supply available for trading. A transfer between two private wallets does not directly affect exchange liquidity, though it may indicate other strategic moves. Q5: Why is the identity of the whale often unknown? Blockchain transactions are pseudonymous. Addresses are alphanumeric strings, not directly linked to real-world identities unless the owner publicly associates themselves with the address. This privacy is a fundamental feature of networks like Ethereum.

57149590,https://timestabloid.com/?p=94900,1768372855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Price Could Surpass $6,000 In This Rare Scenario",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-could-surpass-6000-in-this-rare-scenario/,"A recent analysis has examined how XRP’s price would change if the token’s circulating supply were equivalent to Bitcoin’s current supply. The findings suggest that, under these conditions, XRP could reach a four-figure valuation per token. XRP has consistently ranked among the top five cryptocurrencies since its launch over 13 years ago. Despite its longevity, XRP’s market capitalization and per-token price remain far below Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency. Historically, XRP has occasionally approached Bitcoin’s market cap, but the gap has expanded significantly in recent years. For context, in late December 2014, Bitcoin had a market cap of $4.3 billion, while XRP stood at $736 million, meaning Bitcoin was approximately 5 times larger. By early January 2018, Bitcoin’s market value had reached $276.6 billion compared with XRP’s $130.85 billion, a ratio of roughly 2.1. Today, however, XRP’s market capitalization is $123.7 billion, whereas Bitcoin has grown to $1.8 trillion, making it 14.5 times larger than XRP. Despite this disparity , XRP’s circulating supply has increased at a higher rate than Bitcoin’s over the same period, highlighting the differing inflation dynamics of the two networks. Currently, XRP has 60.69 billion tokens in circulation, while Bitcoin’s circulating supply is 19.97 million. In early 2018, these figures were 38.739 billion for XRP and 16.788 million for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s smaller supply, combined with steady adoption, has enabled it to achieve much higher market capitalization, underscoring the impact of scarcity on token value. Some analysts within the XRP community argue that the SEC’s lawsuit, initiated in December 2020, significantly constrained XRP’s growth. The legal dispute, which led to delistings on several U.S. exchanges, is often cited as a primary reason XRP missed the 2021 bull run, limiting its ability to track broader market growth. Consequently, XRP currently trades around $2.10 , far below Bitcoin’s price of $93,566 , which has surpassed its previous December 2017 high of $19,666. To explore the theoretical impact of supply reduction, analysts calculated the XRP price, assuming its market capitalization remained at $123.7 billion. Still, its circulating supply matched that of Bitcoin, at 19.97 million tokens. Under this scenario, the price of a single XRP token would rise to approximately $6,194, reflecting a 294,859% increase over its current trading price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This demonstrates how supply directly influences token valuation; reducing circulating supply while maintaining market capitalization would require a proportionate increase in price per token. It is important to note that the XRP Ledger was not designed to aggressively burn tokens to boost price. While some investors have speculated that a lower supply could elevate prices, the protocol’s token economics primarily prioritize liquidity and transaction efficiency rather than artificially limiting supply for valuation purposes. Nonetheless, this analysis highlights the substantial theoretical upside XRP could experience under a reduced circulating supply model, providing a clear perspective on the relationship between token scarcity and market value.

Key Takeaways: JPMorgan backs blockchain innovation but warns yield-bearing stablecoins mimic bank deposits without oversight. The bank says interest-paying stablecoins could create a parallel, lightly regulated banking system. Adding yield may accelerate stablecoin adoption while increasing risks to bank funding and stability. The discussion was prompted by a question from Evercore analyst Glenn Schorr, who asked how the bank views stablecoins amid renewed lobbying from the American Bankers Association and active congressional negotiations over digital asset legislation. JPMorgan chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said the bank’s position is broadly aligned with the goals of the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish clear rules for stablecoin issuance and oversight. Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Mimic Bank Deposits Barnum claimed interest-bearing stablecoins risk recreating core banking functions without the regulatory framework that underpins the financial system. He warned that tokens offering yield simply for being held could function like deposits while avoiding capital requirements, liquidity rules and supervisory scrutiny. “The creation of a parallel banking system that sort of has all the features of banking, including something that looks a lot like a deposit that pays interest, without the associated prudential safeguards that have been developed over hundreds of years of bank regulation, is an obviously dangerous and undesirable thing,” Barnum said. While emphasizing that JPMorgan is open to competition and technological progress, Barnum stressed that innovation should not come at the expense of financial stability. In his view, stablecoins designed to generate passive yield blur the line between payment instruments and deposit substitutes, raising systemic risks if left unchecked. Verdict: Mostly True. JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum called interest-paying stablecoins a 'parallel banking system' without proper regulation, echoing warnings of danger to traditional finance. Key Evidence: According to CoinDesk, Barnum highlighted how these products mimic… — Provenance Fact-Check (@0xProvenance) January 13, 2026 The banking industry’s unease is not new. Last year, industry representatives described the rise of yield-bearing stablecoins as a direct threat to banks’ funding models, particularly as traditional lenders continue to offer relatively low interest rates on deposits. Stablecoins have already gained traction as tools for cross-border payments, onchain settlement and dollar access, largely due to their speed and lower transaction costs. Adding yield to those products could accelerate adoption and intensify competition for deposits. Lawmakers Move to Ban Interest on Stablecoin Holdings That prospect is now drawing closer scrutiny on Capitol Hill. Stablecoin rewards have become a flashpoint in lawmakers’ debate over the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , a broad proposal designed to define regulatory responsibilities across the crypto sector. An amended draft released this week would prohibit digital asset service providers from paying interest or yield “solely in connection with the holding of a stablecoin,” signaling lawmakers’ intent to prevent stablecoins from operating like bank accounts. At the same time, the draft leaves room for incentive models tied to active participation in blockchain ecosystems, such as liquidity provision, governance involvement or staking. The distinction suggests policymakers are attempting to balance innovation with safeguards, allowing crypto networks to reward engagement while blocking stablecoins from becoming de facto, lightly regulated deposits.

57149665,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261363,1768373111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stablecoin Regulation: South Korea’s Critical Legal Crossroads Revealed by Top Law Firm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-stablecoin-legal-uncertainties/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Regulation: South Korea’s Critical Legal Crossroads Revealed by Top Law Firm SEOUL, South Korea – As the nation prepares for a pivotal second phase of digital asset legislation, a stark analysis from premier law firm Bae, Kim & Lee LLC exposes the profound legal ambiguities surrounding stablecoins, creating a precarious landscape for issuers, exchanges, and users alike. This comprehensive examination arrives at a critical juncture, highlighting how current regulations struggle to classify and govern these cornerstone crypto assets, potentially stifling innovation and creating compliance risks for the entire sector. Stablecoin Regulation Faces a Legal Vacuum in South Korea Bae, Kim & Lee, a firm renowned for its expertise in financial technology and regulatory compliance, has systematically deconstructed the legal framework—or lack thereof—for stablecoins. The firm’s analysis is not speculative; rather, it directly questions the operational realities under South Korea’s existing Specific Financial Information Act and the forthcoming legislative expansion. Consequently, market participants operate in a gray zone. For instance, the legal status of dominant global stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) on domestic exchanges remains formally undefined. This ambiguity forces exchanges to make internal listing decisions without clear regulatory guidance, a risky proposition in a strictly regulated market. Furthermore, the analysis probes a fundamental issue: the potential classification of these assets as securities. International regulators, notably the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have pursued this angle aggressively. South Korean authorities must now decide if a similar approach aligns with their market protection goals. Simultaneously, the firm questions whether an entity issuing a stablecoin could be deemed a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) , subjecting it to stringent anti-money laundering and know-your-customer obligations. The resolution of these questions will dictate the entire compliance burden for new market entrants. Examining Practical Use Cases and Compliance Hurdles Beyond theoretical classification, Bae, Kim & Lee’s inquiry delves into practical applications that are already testing regulatory boundaries. A primary focus is the potential for a Korean won-backed stablecoin (KRW-stablecoin) designed for payments. While such an instrument could revolutionize domestic and cross-border settlements, its legality under current financial statutes governing electronic money and fund transfers is unclear. Similarly, the common corporate practice of using business accounts to purchase stablecoins for vendor settlements exists in a legal limbo, potentially conflicting with foreign exchange rules or corporate banking agreements. The firm also highlights consumer-facing ambiguities. For example, the legality of purchasing stablecoins with credit cards—a gateway for many new users—lacks explicit endorsement from financial regulators. Moreover, the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms offering interest on stablecoin deposits presents a direct challenge. These services often mirror traditional banking functions like savings accounts but operate without the requisite banking licenses, raising significant consumer protection and financial stability concerns that new legislation must address. Expert Analysis: The Imperative for Legislative Clarity Legal experts observing the South Korean market emphasize that this analysis is a necessary precursor to effective lawmaking. “Bae, Kim & Lee is performing a vital service by mapping the fault lines,” notes a professor of fintech law at Seoul National University, who prefers to remain anonymous due to ongoing consultations with regulators. “Their questions are not hypothetical; they are the daily operational dilemmas faced by crypto businesses. The upcoming legislation must provide clear answers to establish legal certainty, which is the bedrock of any mature financial market.” The timeline for this regulatory evolution is crucial. The first phase of South Korea’s digital asset framework, implemented in recent years, focused primarily on exchange licensing and anti-money laundering. The anticipated second phase, expected to be debated in the National Assembly throughout 2025, is poised to tackle these more complex asset-specific issues. The global regulatory context adds pressure, as jurisdictions like the European Union with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation and Japan with its detailed payment stablecoin laws are creating established frameworks that attract compliant business. The potential impacts of continued ambiguity are severe. Without clear rules, domestic innovation in blockchain-based payments could lag. Major financial institutions may hesitate to launch regulated stablecoin projects. Meanwhile, international stablecoin issuers might limit services in South Korea due to compliance risks. The table below summarizes the core legal questions and their potential market impact: Legal Question Current Status Potential Market Impact Classification as a Security Unclear Could impose prospectus & licensing requirements, limiting issuance. Issuer as a VASP Unclear Would mandate AML/CFT systems, increasing operational cost. Legality of KRW Stablecoin Unclear Blocks development of a national digital payment rail. Corporate Use for Settlement Gray Area Creates legal risk for businesses adopting crypto for efficiency. DeFi Interest Compliance Likely Non-compliant Leaves consumers without protection on popular platforms. Pathways for the Upcoming Digital Asset Legislation The forthcoming legislation must navigate a complex path. It needs to ensure investor protection and financial integrity without stifling the technological advantages of stablecoins, such as: 24/7 Settlement: Enabling instant, round-the-clock transactions. Reduced Cost: Lowering fees for remittances and cross-border trade. Programmability: Allowing for automated, smart contract-driven finance. Potential models include creating a distinct licensing category for payment stablecoin issuers, with robust reserve asset and redemption requirements. Alternatively, lawmakers could explicitly exclude certain stablecoins from securities law if they meet strict criteria for full backing and low risk. The treatment of algorithmic stablecoins, which maintain parity through code rather than reserves, will likely be even more stringent following global failures like TerraUSD in 2022. Ultimately, the clarity provided by the new laws will determine South Korea’s position in the next era of digital finance. A balanced, clear framework can position Seoul as a hub for compliant blockchain innovation. Continued ambiguity, however, risks pushing development and investment into more defined jurisdictions. Bae, Kim & Lee’s analysis serves as the definitive roadmap for policymakers to bridge the gap between current law and future financial technology. Conclusion The analysis by Bae, Kim & Lee LLC underscores that stablecoin regulation in South Korea stands at a critical inflection point. The legal uncertainties surrounding classification, issuance, and everyday use are not mere academic concerns but active barriers to a secure and innovative digital asset market. As the country drafts its second phase of digital asset legislation, providing definitive answers to these questions is paramount. The resulting framework will either unlock the transformative potential of blockchain-based payments or constrain the market under the weight of unresolved compliance risks. The path chosen will resonate across Asia’s dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the main concern raised by Bae, Kim & Lee regarding stablecoins? The firm highlights a significant lack of legal clarity on how stablecoins are classified and regulated under South Korea’s current laws, creating uncertainty for businesses and users ahead of new legislation. Q2: Could stablecoins like USDT be banned in South Korea? An outright ban is considered unlikely. The legal process is more focused on determining their regulatory status (e.g., as a security or payment instrument) and applying appropriate rules for consumer protection and market stability. Q3: What is a VASP, and why does it matter for stablecoin issuers? A Virtual Asset Service Provider is a licensed entity under South Korean law, like a crypto exchange. If stablecoin issuers are classified as VASPs, they must comply with strict anti-money laundering, reporting, and cybersecurity requirements. Q4: When is South Korea’s new digital asset legislation expected? The second phase of legislation, which is expected to address these stablecoin issues directly, is anticipated to be debated and potentially enacted within the 2025 legislative calendar. Q5: How does South Korea’s situation compare to other countries? South Korea is following a path similar to other major economies—first regulating exchanges, then tackling specific assets. It is observing frameworks like the EU’s MiCA regulation but is crafting rules tailored to its domestic financial market and consumer protection standards.

This pivotal shift, recorded on major tracking platforms, underscores the evolving dynamics within the digital asset space as investor priorities and technological narratives continue to mature. Monero Surpasses Bitcoin Cash: Analyzing the Market Cap Shift According to data from CoinMarketCap, Monero’s market valuation now exceeds $12.9 billion, edging past Bitcoin Cash. Consequently, this event marks a notable moment for privacy-focused digital assets. Monero’s native token, XMR, is currently trading at approximately $706.63, reflecting a substantial 24-hour gain of 10.55%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash has experienced relative stagnation, allowing its peer to advance. This change is not merely a statistical blip but rather a reflection of deeper market currents and technological adoption trends. Market capitalization, calculated by multiplying the current price by the circulating supply, serves as a primary metric for comparing the relative size of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, Monero’s ascent indicates increased capital inflow and perceived value. Several factors contribute to this movement, including renewed regulatory discussions surrounding privacy, technological upgrades to the Monero network, and shifting trader sentiment. For context, the total cryptocurrency market cap currently fluctuates around $2.5 trillion, making the competition for top-15 positions intensely competitive. The Driving Forces Behind Monero’s Growth Monero’s core value proposition centers on fungibility and privacy . Unlike transparent blockchains like Bitcoin, Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques to obscure transaction details. These techniques include ring signatures, stealth addresses, and Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT). This privacy-centric design attracts users seeking financial confidentiality. Recently, global debates on financial surveillance and digital autonomy have brought such features into sharper focus. Furthermore, the Monero development community has consistently delivered network upgrades. These upgrades enhance security, efficiency, and decentralization. For example, the scheduled tail emission ensures perpetual miner incentives, contrasting with Bitcoin’s eventual reliance solely on transaction fees. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash primarily focuses on its role as a scalable peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Its narrative often revolves around lower fees and faster transactions compared to Bitcoin. The following table highlights key comparative metrics between the two assets: Metric Monero (XMR) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Primary Focus Privacy & Fungibility Low-Fee Payments Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (RandomX) Proof-of-Work (SHA-256) Transaction Privacy Obligatory & On-chain Transparent (Optional Mixing) Recent Price Trend (24h) +10.55% Approx. +1.5% Additionally, exchange listing developments and liquidity improvements for XMR trading pairs have provided easier access for investors. Market analysts also point to broader portfolio diversification strategies, where investors balance transparent assets with privacy coins to hedge against regulatory uncertainty. Expert Perspectives on the Ranking Change Financial technology experts emphasize that market cap rankings represent a snapshot of sentiment and utility. “Monero overtaking Bitcoin Cash is a significant data point,” notes a blockchain analyst from a major fintech research firm. “It signals that a segment of the market is assigning a premium to robust, default-on privacy features, even amid regulatory scrutiny. This isn’t just about speculation; it reflects genuine demand for the unique utility Monero provides.” Historical context is crucial. Bitcoin Cash originated from a 2017 hard fork of Bitcoin, aiming to address scalability. Monero, launched in 2014, has always prioritized privacy. Their divergent paths now culminate in this ranking crossover. The analyst further explains, “While Bitcoin Cash competes in the ‘digital gold’ and ‘payment’ narratives, Monero occupies a more specialized niche. Its rise suggests that niche is expanding in both relevance and monetary value.” Implications for the Broader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem This event has several immediate and potential long-term implications for the crypto market structure. Firstly, it demonstrates that alternative narratives beyond mere store-of-value or payment systems can sustain top-tier valuations. Secondly, it may influence developer and investor attention, potentially accelerating innovation in the privacy-tech sector. Other privacy coins like Zcash and Dash may also see correlated interest. From an investment perspective, the shift highlights the importance of monitoring fundamental technological differentiators. Key considerations for observers now include: Regulatory Developments: How will global regulators respond to the growing market cap of privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies? Network Activity: Will Monero’s on-chain transaction volume and active address count see sustained growth? Market Sentiment: Does this represent a short-term rotation or a long-term re-rating of privacy as a blockchain feature? Technological Roadmaps: Upcoming upgrades on both networks could further alter their competitive positions. Moreover, the change affects index funds and exchange-traded products (ETPs) that track top cryptocurrencies by market cap. These funds may need to rebalance their holdings to reflect the new ranking, potentially creating additional buying pressure for XMR and selling pressure for BCH in the short term. Conclusion Monero’s overtaking of Bitcoin Cash to become the 11th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is a landmark event with multifaceted significance. It underscores the growing market valuation of privacy-focused digital assets and highlights the continuous evolution of the cryptocurrency hierarchy. This shift results from a combination of Monero’s strong technological fundamentals, specific market demand for privacy, and current trading dynamics. As the digital asset landscape matures, such ranking changes will continue to serve as critical indicators of shifting investor priorities and the relative success of competing blockchain narratives. Observers should monitor whether Monero can maintain this position and how both networks evolve in response to an ever-changing regulatory and technological environment. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that Monero overtook Bitcoin Cash in market cap? It means the total market value of all circulating Monero (XMR) is now higher than that of all circulating Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This calculation uses the current price multiplied by the circulating supply, making Monero the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency network by this metric. Q2: Why is Monero’s price rising? Monero’s price increase of over 10% likely stems from a combination of factors. These include increased trading volume, positive market sentiment towards privacy coins, specific network developments, and broader capital rotation within the cryptocurrency market as investors diversify their portfolios. Q3: Is Bitcoin Cash still a major cryptocurrency? Yes, absolutely. While it has moved to 12th place, Bitcoin Cash remains a top-15 cryptocurrency with a multi-billion dollar market cap. It continues to have a large community, developer support, and is widely listed on exchanges, maintaining its status as a significant digital asset. Q4: What are the main technical differences between Monero and Bitcoin Cash? Monero uses mandatory privacy features like ring signatures and stealth addresses to obscure all transaction details. Bitcoin Cash uses a transparent blockchain like Bitcoin but focuses on larger block sizes to enable faster and cheaper payments. Their consensus algorithms and overall goals also differ significantly. Q5: Could Monero’s rise attract more regulatory attention? Potentially. As privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies gain market share, they often draw scrutiny from regulators concerned about compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. The future regulatory landscape for Monero will depend on global policy developments and how the project engages with regulatory bodies.

This equilibrium suggests sophisticated market participants are approaching Bitcoin’s price action with measured caution rather than extreme directional bias, reflecting the maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives markets five years after their explosive growth phase. The data reveals subtle differences between exchanges that professional traders monitor closely for arbitrage opportunities and sentiment signals. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratios Perpetual futures contracts represent one of cryptocurrency’s most innovative financial instruments, allowing traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price movements without expiration dates. These contracts differ significantly from traditional futures through their funding rate mechanism, which periodically transfers payments between long and short positions to maintain contract prices near underlying spot prices. The long/short ratio measures the percentage of traders holding bullish versus bearish positions across these perpetual contracts. Market analysts consider this metric a crucial sentiment indicator because it reflects collective trader psychology and positioning. However, experienced traders interpret these ratios with nuance, recognizing that extreme readings often signal potential market reversals while balanced ratios suggest stability. Historical analysis demonstrates that Bitcoin perpetual futures markets have evolved substantially since their inception. Initially dominated by retail speculation, these markets now attract institutional participants who employ sophisticated hedging strategies. Consequently, long/short ratios have become more balanced over time as professional money managers enter the space. The current data showing near-parity between long and short positions across major exchanges indicates this maturation process continues through 2025. Market structure experts note that balanced ratios typically correlate with reduced volatility and more sustainable price trends compared to periods when one side dominates positioning. Exchange-Specific Analysis of Bitcoin Derivatives Positioning Detailed examination of individual exchange data reveals subtle but meaningful differences in trader behavior across platforms. Binance, the global leader in cryptocurrency derivatives by open interest, shows the strongest bullish tilt among the three major exchanges with 51.61% of positions favoring long exposure. This slight majority suggests Binance traders exhibit marginally more optimism about Bitcoin’s near-term price direction. OKX follows closely with 51.34% long positions, indicating similar sentiment among its user base. Bybit demonstrates the most balanced ratio at 51.11% long versus 48.89% short, suggesting its traders maintain the most neutral stance among the three platforms. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratios – 24-Hour Data Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 51.61% 48.39% +3.22% OKX 51.34% 48.66% +2.68% Bybit 51.11% 48.89% +2.22% Overall Aggregate 50.48% 49.52% +0.96% These variations stem from several factors including different user demographics, regional concentrations, and platform-specific trading features. For instance, Binance’s global user base incorporates diverse trading strategies while Bybit has historically attracted more professional derivatives traders. Additionally, exchange-specific leverage limits, margin requirements, and funding rate schedules influence positioning decisions. Seasoned analysts compare these ratios alongside other metrics like open interest changes, funding rates, and liquidations to develop comprehensive market views. The current data shows remarkable consistency across platforms, suggesting consensus rather than fragmented sentiment. Expert Interpretation of Current Market Positioning Derivatives market specialists emphasize that balanced long/short ratios typically signal healthy market conditions rather than indecision. When examined alongside other 2025 market data, the current positioning suggests several important dynamics. First, institutional participation continues growing as evidenced by the stability of ratios compared to previous years’ volatility. Second, the absence of extreme positioning reduces the likelihood of cascading liquidations that characterized earlier market cycles. Third, the slight bullish bias aligns with broader macroeconomic conditions including potential interest rate adjustments and institutional adoption trends. Historical context proves essential for proper interpretation. During Bitcoin’s 2021 bull market, long/short ratios frequently exceeded 70% on the long side, creating unsustainable conditions that preceded significant corrections. Conversely, extreme short positioning marked market bottoms during subsequent bear phases. The current equilibrium suggests neither euphoria nor panic dominates trader psychology. Market structure analysts note that funding rates—the periodic payments between long and short positions—remain relatively neutral across exchanges, confirming the balanced sentiment indicated by positioning data. This alignment between positioning and funding mechanisms suggests efficient price discovery. Implications for Bitcoin Price Action and Market Stability The balanced long/short ratio across major exchanges carries significant implications for Bitcoin’s price trajectory and overall market health. From a technical perspective, equilibrium between bulls and bears often precedes sustained directional moves once one side gains dominance. Market mechanics suggest that when most participants already hold their preferred positions, fewer traders remain to push prices further in either direction. Consequently, balanced ratios frequently precede volatility expansion as new information forces repositioning. However, the current slight bullish tilt suggests upward momentum faces less resistance than downward moves. Several key factors support this interpretation. First, the aggregate ratio of 50.48% long versus 49.52% short represents less than one percentage point net bias—statistically insignificant in highly liquid markets. Second, all three major exchanges show consistent directional bias rather than conflicting signals. Third, the ratios have remained stable across multiple reporting periods rather than showing sharp fluctuations. Market stability benefits from this equilibrium because extreme positioning creates liquidation risks during price movements. The current data suggests Bitcoin’s derivatives markets have achieved unprecedented maturity, with professional risk management tempering the speculative excesses of earlier years. Regulatory developments in 2025 further influence derivatives market dynamics. Enhanced oversight in major jurisdictions has increased transparency and reduced manipulative practices. Consequently, long/short ratios now more accurately reflect genuine market sentiment rather than artificial positioning. This improvement in data quality allows traders and analysts to make more informed decisions. Additionally, the convergence of ratios across exchanges indicates efficient arbitrage and price discovery, hallmarks of mature financial markets. As cryptocurrency derivatives continue evolving, these metrics will likely gain importance for institutional allocation decisions and risk management frameworks. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data reveals remarkably balanced market sentiment across Binance, OKX, and Bybit during 2025 trading. This equilibrium suggests sophisticated positioning by market participants who recognize both opportunities and risks in current market conditions. The slight bullish bias across all three major exchanges indicates cautious optimism tempered by risk management considerations. As cryptocurrency derivatives markets continue maturing, these sentiment indicators will provide increasingly valuable insights for traders and analysts monitoring Bitcoin’s price discovery process. The current data ultimately reflects the growing institutionalization of cryptocurrency markets and the development of more stable trading environments compared to previous cycles. FAQs Q1: What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio measure? The ratio measures the percentage of traders holding long (bullish) versus short (bearish) positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across specific exchanges, serving as a key sentiment indicator for derivatives markets. Q2: Why do long/short ratios differ between cryptocurrency exchanges? Ratios vary due to differences in user demographics, regional concentrations, trading features, leverage limits, and margin requirements specific to each exchange platform. Q3: How should traders interpret balanced long/short ratios? Balanced ratios typically indicate healthy market conditions with neither euphoria nor panic dominating sentiment, often preceding sustained directional moves once new information forces repositioning. Q4: What other metrics complement long/short ratio analysis? Traders should examine funding rates, open interest changes, liquidation levels, and volume patterns alongside long/short ratios for comprehensive market analysis. Q5: How have BTC perpetual futures markets evolved in recent years? Markets have matured significantly with increased institutional participation, improved regulatory oversight, more sophisticated risk management, and reduced speculative excess compared to earlier periods.

Justin Slaughter, the Director of Policy at prominent crypto investment firm Paradigm, recently delivered a sobering forecast on social media platform X. He projected that even if the landmark U.S. crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, achieves passage, its full implementation could span several years, potentially extending into the next presidential administration. This analysis injects a crucial dose of procedural realism into the ongoing debate about digital asset oversight. The CLARITY Act’s Implementation Timeline Slaughter’s prediction stems from a detailed examination of the bill’s operational requirements. The CLARITY Act, formally titled the “Clarity for Digital Tokens Act of 2024,” is not a self-executing law. Instead, it mandates a massive rulemaking undertaking. According to Slaughter’s analysis, the legislation would require federal agencies to create at least 45 new rules . This rulemaking process is inherently slow, involving public notices, comment periods, reviews, and potential legal challenges. Furthermore, the bill designates the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a primary regulator for many digital assets deemed commodities, necessitating complex coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This inter-agency coordination presents a major logistical challenge. The CFTC and SEC have different mandates, cultures, and existing regulatory frameworks. Harmonizing their approaches to a new asset class requires extensive negotiation and resource allocation. Consequently, the implementation details will be highly complex to finalize. Slaughter emphasized this point, noting that the sheer volume of required rulemaking guarantees a prolonged timeline before businesses and investors see clear, actionable guidelines. Historical Precedent for Major Legislation To support his forecast, Slaughter cited historical precedent for major financial legislation. He stated that implementation of similarly complex bills has previously taken a minimum of three years and as long as eight. A prime example is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010. Regulators spent years writing hundreds of rules to implement its provisions, with some key measures taking over five years to finalize. The table below illustrates the implementation timelines for comparable financial regulations: Legislation Year Passed Key Implementation Period Primary Agencies Dodd-Frank Act 2010 2010-2015+ SEC, CFTC, others Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 2002-2004 SEC, PCAOB CLARITY Act (Projected) TBD 3-8 Years (Est.) CFTC, SEC This historical context is vital for understanding the regulatory process. Law passage is only the first step. The subsequent rulemaking phase determines the law’s practical impact and often involves significant political and industry input that can further delay completion. Expert Analysis on Regulatory Realities Justin Slaughter’s role at Paradigm provides him with a unique vantage point. Paradigm is a leading investment firm focused on crypto and frontier technology, giving Slaughter direct insight into both market needs and policy mechanics. His warning is not a critique of the bill’s substance but a realistic assessment of the U.S. government’s operational tempo. Other policy experts have echoed similar sentiments, noting that even with bipartisan support, the federal rulemaking machine moves deliberately. The implications are profound: Market Uncertainty: A multi-year implementation window prolongs the current period of regulatory ambiguity for crypto firms. Administration Shift: Slaughter noted implementation would likely occur “under the next administration,” introducing potential policy variability depending on election outcomes. Resource Strain: Agencies like the CFTC would need substantial budget increases and staff with specialized expertise to undertake this rulemaking effectively. Therefore, the path from legislative victory to on-the-ground regulatory clarity is a marathon, not a sprint. Industry participants must prepare for a gradual, phased introduction of rules rather than an immediate, comprehensive framework. Impact on the Crypto Industry and Investors The extended timeline for the US crypto bill implementation carries direct consequences. For startups and established companies, planning becomes more difficult without definitive rules. Investment decisions may be delayed, and innovation could be impacted as firms await legal certainty. For investors, the promise of clearer consumer protections and market safeguards remains years away. This prolonged interim period may incentivize some activity to move to jurisdictions with faster-acting or more established regulatory regimes, a phenomenon often called “regulatory arbitrage.” However, a deliberate process also has potential benefits. Thorough rulemaking can create more durable, well-considered regulations that withstand legal scrutiny and market evolution. Rushed rules often lead to confusion, loopholes, and subsequent amendments. The key for the industry will be engaging constructively throughout the multi-year comment process to help shape practical and innovation-friendly outcomes. Conclusion Justin Slaughter’s analysis serves as a critical reminder of the gap between legislative passage and regulatory reality. The journey for the US crypto bill, specifically the CLARITY Act, is far from over once it clears Congress. The ensuing implementation phase, requiring the creation of dozens of new rules and complex agency coordination, projects a timeline measured in years, not months. This reality, grounded in historical precedent and the mechanics of federal rulemaking, sets realistic expectations for all market participants. While the bill represents a crucial step toward legitimacy and structure, the full realization of a clear U.S. crypto regulatory framework remains a long-term project, underscoring the intricate and often slow-moving nature of modern financial governance. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act (Clarity for Digital Tokens Act) is a proposed U.S. bill aimed at creating a comprehensive market structure for cryptocurrencies. It seeks to clarify which digital assets are securities or commodities and assign regulatory roles primarily to the SEC and CFTC. Q2: Why would implementing the crypto bill take so many years? Implementation requires a lengthy federal rulemaking process. The bill mandates creating over 45 new rules, which involves public proposals, comment periods, reviews, and inter-agency coordination between the CFTC and SEC, a historically slow procedure. Q3: What historical legislation had a similar long implementation? The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 is a key example. This major financial reform law took regulators more than five years to implement fully, with hundreds of rules written across multiple agencies, setting a precedent for complex financial legislation. Q4: How does this affect cryptocurrency companies and investors? An extended timeline means continued regulatory uncertainty for several more years. Companies may delay major decisions, and investors will wait longer for clear consumer protections. It may also influence where crypto businesses choose to operate globally. Q5: Could a change in administration affect the implementation? Yes. Since implementation will likely span into the next presidential term, a new administration could influence the rulemaking process’s pace, priorities, and philosophical direction, adding another layer of variability to the timeline.

The Crypto Industry,https://bitcoinist.com/clash-stablecoin-legislation-big-banks-vs-crypto/,"As the Senate Banking Committee unveiled the updated draft of the crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, another critical battle is unfolding surrounding the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoin regulations. The banking lobby is pressing for significant changes, particularly regarding stablecoin rewards. Are Big Banks Disrupting Stablecoin Competition? Summer Mersinger, CEO of the Blockchain Association and a prominent advocate for the crypto industry in Congress negotiations, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to highlight the current state of discussions following the bipartisan passage of the GENIUS Act. She claimed that the “Big Bank lobby” is pushing Congress to revisit settled legislation concerning stablecoin rewards, not due to emerging risks but rather to suppress competition that benefits consumers. Mersinger stated, “When Big Banks face competition, they don’t improve services. They lobby to handicap alternatives. And the consumer suffers.” The firm’s CEO pointed out that the average American savings account currently yields only 0.39%, while checking accounts offer an even lower rate of 0.07%. In contrast, the Federal Funds rate hovers between 3.50% and 3.75%. She argued that this discrepancy is not merely a product of market forces but stems from a substantial barrier that the major banks have constructed, preventing customers from accessing better returns. Mersinger emphasized that the dominance of the six largest US banks, which control assets equivalent to 60% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), only reinforces this trend. She further stressed that when new technologies arise that can provide consumers with superior returns, the banks’ immediate response is to invoke claims of “systemic risk” while lobbying against these advancements. Ultimately, Mersinger and her colleagues are advocating for policies that prioritize consumer options. “We urge Congress to listen,” she implored, signaling the importance of the ongoing debate between the two sectors. Expert Advocates For Fair Returns Market expert Omid Malekan also weighed in, criticizing the notion that stablecoin holders should not earn yields, arguing that the interest revenue generated from taxpayer-backed Treasury bills should be directed to average Americans rather than lining the pockets of bank executives and shareholders. Malekan called for a broader discussion on capping credit card interest rates and swipe fees, along with the implementation of a windfall profit tax on the net interest margins of banks. He asserted, “An industry this anti-competition and consumer choice should suffer the consequences.” Support for Malekan’s view was reinforced by recent earnings reports from major banks. This morning, JPMorgan Chase announced $25 billion in net interest income, illustrating the profits generated by not providing higher returns to savers. Malekan dismissed claims that stablecoins paying interest would harm lending as unfounded.

Although this price ascent is not as spectacular and headline-making as the one from last week, it appears to be more sustainable. At the time, XRP skyrocketed by 30% in the span of just a few days, going from under $1.90, where it closed in 2025, to just over $2.40 – a multi-week peak. However, its rejection was violent, and it tumbled below $2.05 earlier this week. Its price pump now has allowed it to reclaim the fourth spot in terms of market cap from BNB, which managed to gain the upper hand yesterday. Perhaps the most evident reason for XRP’s 4.2% rally today is the market’s state. Bitcoin surged hours ago to a multi-month high of its own at $96,600 after Trump’s latest controversial speech and remarks against Fed Chair Powell, Iran, Venezuela, and tariff haters. The CPI numbers also went out for December yesterday, and they were slightly lower than expected, which allowed Trump to push Powell for further rate reductions in two weeks. Lastly, the net inflows into the spot XRP ETFs have defied last week’s one-off withdrawals . The funds attracted $15.04 million on Monday and $12.98 million yesterday, which are also possible reasons behind the underlying asset’s revival. CRYPTOWZRD weighed in on XRP’s performance, indicating that the asset “closed bullish as expected.” However, the analyst warned that the XRP/BTC pair should “rally as it awaits a decline” in bitcoin’s dominance.

According to CryptoTank, the remaining uncertainty is not whether XRP will be utilized at scale, but how its price will ultimately be set and when formal approval will be granted. The price of XRP has already been agreed to by the BIS, WEF, and all central banks. The ONLY questions are, what is that price and when will they green light it? Will they start it at 3 digits, 4 digits, and gradually increase it over the years, OR will they reprice it at $10k,… pic.twitter.com/I1pahW7Fhk — CryptoTank (@Tank2033js) January 11, 2026 Institutional Structures and Regulatory Context The images attached to the post outline a network of international organizations, including the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the World Economic Forum, and standard-setting bodies such as ISO and SWIFT . CryptoTank’s presentation connects these institutions to Basel III banking rules, capital tier classifications, and liquidity requirements. Within this framework, digital assets and tokenized instruments are portrayed as components of future settlement infrastructure rather than speculative instruments. The material emphasizes Basel III’s focus on Tier 1 capital, reserve quality, and liquidity management, suggesting that compliant digital assets would need to integrate seamlessly into these requirements. CryptoTank positions XRP within this context as an asset designed for high-value settlement, cross-border transfers, and institutional liquidity management under internationally recognized standards. XRP, Interoperability, and Asset Backing Concepts The visual material also associates XRP with interoperability layers alongside networks such as Stellar, Algorand, and XDC, each shown in relation to specific institutional or industrial use cases. In CryptoTank’s interpretation, these networks are aligned with tokenized representations of real-world assets , including precious metals and commodities, presented as one-to-one backing models. XRP is specifically positioned as a bridge asset within this system, intended to facilitate large-scale value transfer rather than retail payment use. Within this narrative, XRP’s relevance is not driven by market trading dynamics but by its perceived readiness for integration into institutional settlement rails governed by international standards. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Pricing Assertions and Forward Outlook The most consequential claim in CryptoTank’s post is that the price of XRP has already been agreed upon by global financial authorities, including central banks, with public confirmation yet to occur. The post argues that the only open questions are the timing of official approval and whether the valuation will be introduced incrementally or through a significant repricing event. Possible valuations range mentioned span from three- or four-digit levels to substantially higher figures. CryptoTank concludes that clarity on this issue is approaching, implying that forthcoming developments will reveal whether XRP’s price is adjusted gradually over time or reset at a level reflecting its proposed institutional role. The post suggests that this outcome is imminent and portrays XRP’s future valuation as the result of policy action rather than market forces.

This strategic partnership, confirmed by sources to Unfolded in early 2025, represents a significant step toward modernizing Pakistan’s financial infrastructure while integrating with international blockchain ecosystems. The move follows Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to address economic challenges through technological innovation. Pakistan Stablecoin Initiative: Strategic Context and Objectives Pakistan’s engagement with World Liberty Financial emerges within a complex economic landscape. The nation has actively explored digital currency solutions to enhance financial inclusion and stabilize its monetary system. Consequently, this partnership focuses on developing a regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoin. Such a digital asset could potentially facilitate remittances, reduce transaction costs, and provide a hedge against local currency volatility. Moreover, the State Bank of Pakistan has previously signaled openness to blockchain pilots, making this collaboration a logical progression. The technical framework for the stablecoin will likely involve a hybrid model. It will combine centralized oversight for compliance with decentralized settlement via WLFI’s protocols. Importantly, the initiative aims to maintain full backing by U.S. dollar reserves, ensuring price stability. This approach mirrors successful models like USD Coin (USDC) but adapts them for Pakistan’s specific regulatory and economic needs. Furthermore, the project includes provisions for interoperability with existing banking and mobile money systems. World Liberty Financial and the Trump Family’s DeFi Vision World Liberty Financial represents a notable entry into decentralized finance by figures associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump. Launched in late 2023, WLFI positions itself as a compliant DeFi platform focusing on institutional-grade financial products. The project emphasizes regulatory adherence, a factor that undoubtedly influenced Pakistan’s decision to partner. Additionally, WLFI’s architecture reportedly utilizes zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and layer-2 scaling for efficiency. The Trump family’s involvement brings both significant visibility and scrutiny. Eric Trump serves as the public chairman of WLFI’s advisory board, while other family members hold strategic roles. Their participation links the project to a globally recognized name, potentially accelerating adoption. However, it also introduces geopolitical considerations, given the family’s high-profile political history. WLFI’s whitepaper outlines a vision for “sovereign-grade” DeFi, aiming to serve national economies alongside individual users. Expert Analysis: Implications for Pakistan’s Economy Financial technology analysts highlight several potential impacts. First, a successfully implemented stablecoin could streamline the flow of remittances, which exceeded $30 billion for Pakistan in 2024. Second, it may reduce reliance on informal hawala networks, increasing transparency. Third, the partnership could attract foreign blockchain investment to Pakistan’s growing tech sector. Dr. Ayesha Khan, a senior economist at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, notes, “This represents a calculated risk. The technological benefits are substantial, but success depends entirely on robust regulatory frameworks and macroeconomic stability.” Conversely, risks include potential regulatory clashes, cybersecurity threats, and market volatility. The partnership will require close coordination between Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance, the State Bank, and WLFI’s technical team. A phased rollout, beginning with a limited pilot for cross-border corporate payments, is considered the most probable implementation path. This cautious approach aligns with global central bank digital currency (CBDC) testing methodologies. Global Stablecoin Landscape and Competitive Positioning The Pakistan-WLFI initiative enters a crowded but rapidly evolving market. The table below compares key attributes of major dollar-pegged stablecoins: Stablecoin Issuer Backing 2025 Market Cap (Est.) Tether (USDT) Tether Limited Reserves (Cash & Equivalents) $110B USD Coin (USDC) Circle Full Cash & U.S. Treasuries $32B Binance USD (BUSD) Paxos Full Cash & U.S. Treasuries $8B WLFI-Pakistan Coin (Proposed) World Liberty Financial Full Dollar Reserves (Escrowed) N/A (Pilot) The proposed stablecoin differentiates itself through its sovereign partnership model and focus on a specific national economy’s needs. Its success may inspire similar collaborations between other developing nations and private blockchain consortia. Notably, several Southeast Asian and African central banks are observing this project closely for potential lessons. Regulatory Pathways and Implementation Timeline Pakistan’s government has established a dedicated task force to oversee the stablecoin project. This group includes representatives from: The State Bank of Pakistan’s Digital Currency Division The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication Independent blockchain legal experts The projected timeline, based on official statements and industry sources, outlines a multi-phase process: Q2 2025: Finalization of legal and technical memoranda of understanding.

With the approval, DZ will launch its crypto trading platform “meinKrypto.” The platform, which was approved at the end of December, allows primary institutions to offer retail customers access to crypto trading. Cooperative banks Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken must now submit their own MiCAR notification for “meinKrypto” to BaFin, an official statement read. Once approved and integrated with the VR banking app, meinKrypto functions as a wallet for self-directed investors. At the launch, initial tradable assets will include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA). Further, each of the cooperative banks will decide individually whether to implement the crypto service. German Co-Op Banks Look at Crypto Trading In September 2025, the German Cooperative Banking Association released a poll , which suggested that co-op banks in Germany are considering offering cryptocurrency services such as Bitcoin and Ether trading. The study found that 71% of the country’s 670 Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken banks are looking at crypto, up from 54% last year. Besides, a third of banks eyeing crypto say they aim to launch services within the next five months. The meinKrypto platform was developed by Atruvia, the IT service provider for the cooperative financial group, and DZ Bank. Further, Stuttgart Stock Exchange Digital will handle the custody of the crypto assets. DZ Bank Joins Euro Stablecoin Consortium DZ Bank, the central institution for the country’s co-op banking sector, said in a separate statement on Tuesday that it has joined the European banking consortium Qivalis, for the launch of a regulated stablecoin. The group of 11 banks plans to introduce its euro stablecoin next year under a new Dutch entity named Qivalis. “We are delighted to welcome DZ BANK as the eleventh member of the consortium,” said Jan-Oliver Sell, CEO of Qivalis. Their participation strengthens our joint commitment to building a robust, MiCAR-compliant euro stablecoin infrastructure for European businesses and consumers.” Qivalis is currently seeking approval from the German National Bank (DNB) to establish as an e-money institution.

The platform will enable transactions against Bitcoin, Tether, and the South Korean won starting at 9:00 a.m. UTC, marking a pivotal moment for stablecoin accessibility in one of the world’s most active crypto economies. This strategic move follows months of regulatory preparation and market analysis, positioning Upbit to capitalize on growing demand for diversified stable assets. Upbit USDe Listing Details and Market Context Upbit’s official notification confirmed the USDe listing with three primary trading pairs: USDe/BTC, USDe/USDT, and USDe/KRW. The exchange operates under strict South Korean financial regulations, requiring thorough due diligence before adding any digital asset. Consequently, this listing signals regulatory comfort with USDe’s underlying mechanisms. Market analysts immediately noted the timing coincides with increased institutional interest in algorithmic stablecoins. Furthermore, the KRW pairing provides direct fiat on-ramp access for Korean investors, potentially reducing reliance on USD-pegged intermediaries. The announcement generated immediate market reactions across Asian trading hours. Historically, Upbit listings create substantial trading volume for newly supported assets. For instance, previous major listings have seen initial 24-hour volumes exceeding $100 million. The exchange commands approximately 80% of South Korea’s crypto trading volume, according to recent Financial Services Commission reports. This dominant position means its listing decisions significantly influence regional asset valuations and liquidity patterns. Understanding USDe’s Stablecoin Mechanism USDe represents an algorithmic stablecoin maintaining its peg through sophisticated blockchain protocols. Unlike traditional fiat-collateralized stablecoins, USDe employs a combination of cryptocurrency collateral and algorithmic monetary policy. This design aims to provide price stability while maximizing capital efficiency. The stablecoin’s whitepaper outlines a multi-layered approach involving: Over-collateralization with volatile crypto assets Dynamic interest rate algorithms that adjust based on market conditions Decentralized governance through token holder voting mechanisms Transparent reserve audits conducted by third-party blockchain analytics firms Market observers compare USDe’s approach to established models like MakerDAO’s DAI, but with enhanced focus on cross-chain interoperability. Recent blockchain data shows USDe circulating supply exceeding $500 million before the Upbit announcement. The stablecoin already maintains trading pairs on several global exchanges, though Upbit represents its first major Asian platform listing with direct fiat pairing. Regulatory Landscape for Stablecoins in South Korea South Korea implemented comprehensive digital asset regulations through the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in 2024. These regulations establish specific requirements for stablecoin issuers and trading platforms. Upbit’s listing indicates USDe meets these stringent standards, including reserve transparency and issuer accountability measures. The Financial Services Commission requires quarterly audit reports for all listed stablecoins, with particular attention to redemption mechanisms during market stress. Korean regulators have historically maintained cautious attitudes toward algorithmic stablecoins following the 2022 Terra-LUNA collapse. Consequently, USDe’s approval suggests either enhanced regulatory frameworks or improved stablecoin design. Market surveillance systems now monitor stablecoin deviations more rigorously, with automatic trading halts triggered at predetermined threshold breaches. This regulatory evolution creates safer environments for innovative financial instruments while protecting retail investors from systemic risks. Comparative Analysis of Stablecoin Trading Pairs The introduction of USDe/KRW trading provides Korean investors with direct access previously unavailable. Traditionally, Korean traders converted won to USDT before accessing other stablecoins, incurring multiple transaction fees. The new pairing eliminates this friction, potentially lowering costs by 0.5-1.5% per transaction according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The table below illustrates Upbit’s current stablecoin offerings: Stablecoin Trading Pairs 24H Volume (KRW) Launch Date USDT KRW, BTC, ETH ₩2.1 trillion 2017 USDC KRW, BTC ₩850 billion 2020 DAI KRW, BTC ₩320 billion 2021 USDe KRW, BTC, USDT New listing March 27, 2025 This diversification strategy aligns with global exchange trends toward multi-stablecoin ecosystems. Major platforms like Binance and Coinbase now offer 5-7 stablecoin varieties, recognizing different user preferences for decentralization, regulatory compliance, and yield generation. Upbit’s expansion follows this pattern while adapting to specific Korean market characteristics, including high retail participation and strong regulatory oversight. Market Impact and Future Implications The USDe listing immediately affects several market segments. Korean retail investors gain access to innovative DeFi protocols utilizing USDe as primary collateral. Institutional traders can implement more sophisticated arbitrage strategies across KRW-based pairs. Additionally, the listing strengthens South Korea’s position in global crypto innovation, potentially attracting blockchain developers focused on stablecoin applications. Industry experts anticipate several developments following this listing. First, competing Korean exchanges may accelerate their own stablecoin evaluations. Second, USDe’s trading volume could surpass ₩100 billion within the first week based on historical listing patterns. Third, the successful integration may encourage other algorithmic stablecoin projects to pursue Korean market entry. Finally, regulatory bodies might refine stablecoin guidelines based on real-world trading data from this implementation. Global cryptocurrency markets increasingly recognize Asia’s importance for adoption and innovation. South Korea consistently ranks among top three nations for crypto penetration per capita. The country’s advanced digital infrastructure and tech-savvy population create ideal testing grounds for new financial technologies. Upbit’s strategic decision reflects this reality while positioning the exchange for continued regional leadership as digital asset adoption accelerates. Technical Implementation and User Experience Upbit executed the USDe listing through systematic technical deployment. The exchange’s engineering team conducted extensive blockchain integration testing throughout February 2025. These tests verified wallet functionality, transaction processing, and security protocols. Users can now deposit USDe via Ethereum and compatible Layer-2 networks, with planned support for additional blockchains in subsequent phases. The trading interface incorporates USDe into existing spot trading sections with clear market data displays. Upbit’s mobile application received corresponding updates simultaneously with web platform enhancements. Security measures include enhanced monitoring for unusual trading patterns and automated compliance checks for large transactions. These implementations follow the exchange’s established protocols for new asset integrations, ensuring system stability during initial trading periods. Conclusion The Upbit USDe listing represents a milestone for South Korea’s cryptocurrency ecosystem and algorithmic stablecoin adoption. This strategic expansion provides Korean investors with direct access to innovative digital assets while demonstrating regulatory progress in digital finance. The KRW trading pair particularly enhances market efficiency for domestic traders. As global stablecoin evolution continues, Upbit’s careful implementation establishes valuable precedents for exchange operations and regulatory compliance. Market participants will closely monitor trading volumes and price stability metrics in coming weeks, with potential implications for broader Asian cryptocurrency market development. FAQs Q1: What time exactly does USDe trading begin on Upbit? Upbit commenced USDe trading at precisely 9:00 a.m. UTC on March 27, 2025. The exchange enabled all three trading pairs simultaneously. Q2: Which blockchain networks support USDe deposits to Upbit? Initially, Upbit accepts USDe deposits via the Ethereum mainnet. The exchange plans to add support for Layer-2 networks and other compatible chains in future updates. Q3: How does USDe maintain its price stability differently from USDT? USDe employs algorithmic mechanisms with crypto collateral, while USDT uses traditional fiat currency reserves. Both aim for 1:1 USD pegs through different technical approaches. Q4: What are the trading fees for USDe pairs on Upbit? Upbit applies standard trading fees of 0.05% for makers and 0.07% for takers across all USDe trading pairs, consistent with other spot trading markets. Q5: Does this listing indicate regulatory approval for algorithmic stablecoins in South Korea? The listing suggests regulators find USDe compliant with existing frameworks, though it doesn’t represent blanket approval for all algorithmic models. Each project undergoes individual assessment.

A recent Bitwise and VettaFi survey found 32% of financial advisors allocated to crypto in client accounts in 2025, up from 22% in 2024, setting an all-time high for the series. The jump lands after a headline year for digital assets, with the report pointing to Bitcoin’s run to a $126k all-time high in 2025 and faster progress on US rules, including the GENIUS Act that pushed stablecoins further into the mainstream. Bitwise and VettaFi collected 299 eligible responses, with outreach running from Oct. 31 to Dec. 8, 2025 across advisor types ranging from registered investment advisors to wirehouse representatives and broker-dealer reps. #10: CRYPTO EQUITY ETFS CONTINUE TO BE ADVISORS’ TOP CHOICE When asked what crypto exposure they were most interested in allocating to in 2026, crypto equity ETFs were the favorite among advisors. — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 13, 2026 RIAs Lead Crypto Adoption As Access Widens Client demand stayed steady, and advisors felt it. The survey said 94% of advisors received a question about crypto from clients in 2025, and 56% reported owning crypto in their personal portfolios, another record for the dataset. Allocation rates varied sharply by channel. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) led with 42% saying they allocate to crypto in client accounts, followed by wirehouse representatives at 35%, and the report also tracked 33% for other financial professionals, 25% for independent broker-dealer representatives and 18% for financial planners. Access keeps improving, and the numbers show it. The share of advisors who said they can buy crypto in client accounts rose to 42% from 35% in 2024, and 58% said they were unable to buy crypto in client accounts or unsure whether they could. Image Source: Bitwise/VettaFi 2026 survey Familiar Products Lead Advisor Crypto Strategy For 2026 Clients also keep taking matters into their own hands. Advisors said 74% of clients invested in crypto outside the advisory relationship in 2025, up from 71% in 2024, a pool of held away assets that firms can try to pull back into a broader wealth plan. Sizing remains cautious, and it is rising. The survey said 83% of client portfolios with crypto exposure held less than 5% in crypto, and 64% of crypto-exposed client portfolios held more than 2%, up from 51% in 2024. When advisors fund an allocation, they usually sell what they already know. Equities were the top source at 43%, followed by cash at 35%, with smaller shares citing commodities, bonds, and gold. Image Source: Bitwise/VettaFi 2026 survey Looking ahead, the next wave may come from advisers who stayed on the sidelines. Among those who did not allocate to crypto in client accounts, 18% said they definitely or probably plan to add exposure in 2026, and another 38% said they are considering it. Among advisors already allocating, 99% plan to maintain or increase exposure. Product preference is tilting toward familiar wrappers. Advisors again picked crypto equity ETFs as their top exposure for 2026, and the next choices included spot crypto ETFs at 16%, diversified crypto index funds at 14%, multistrategy solutions at 13%, and income-generating strategies at 9%. The same report laid out the frictions holding adoption back, with volatility and regulatory concerns topping the list, and home office restrictions also showing up as a major constraint.

The CPI data that came out yesterday was once again lower than expected, which only reaffirmed the POTUS’s claims that the rates should be lowered during the late January FOMC meeting, even though previous reports said Powell would pause the cuts. Bitcoin’s price surged to a two-month high of $96,600, while many altcoins have marked significant gains. Although also in the green, Pi Network’s native token has failed to follow suit, and it’s up by only 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Pi Network (PI) Price on CoinGecko This has been an evident trend for the token for the past few months. Its performance has been quite different from that of most other altcoins. In November, when the market was crashing, PI remained relatively still and even charted some gains at one point. In early January 2026, when BTC surged toward $95,000 and some alts were up by double digits, PI stood behind and couldn’t break out from its $0.20 and $0.22 consolidation range. The landscape appears similar, at least for the time being. PI’s minor daily increase hasn’t provided the necessary push for a more profound breakout. As usual, the project’s community appears bullish, posting numerous price predictions on X with some ridiculous targets of $100 or even $314 per token, which are unattainable at this point, to say the least. However, some popular AI models believe there’s a minor chance of a sustained breakout from PI unless there’s a major catalyst coming from the project itself. The latest update, published at the end of last week, couldn’t do the job for now.

Key Takeaways: Russia is preparing legislation to let non-qualified investors access crypto, while capping retail purchases at 300,000 rubles. The draft bill would remove crypto from special regulation, signaling a push to make digital assets part of everyday finance. Authorities aim to expand crypto use in cross-border settlements while keeping strict limits to manage financial risks. According to a Tuesday report from state news agency TASS , Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma’s Financial Markets Committee, said a draft bill has already been finalized and is expected to be considered during the spring parliamentary session. The proposal would remove cryptocurrencies from a special regulatory regime, effectively treating them as a more conventional financial instrument. Russia Lawmaker Says Crypto Set to Enter Everyday Use Under New Bill “A bill has already been prepared that removes cryptocurrencies from special financial regulation, meaning they will become commonplace in our lives,” Aksakov said in an interview with the Russia-24 television channel, as cited by TASS. Under the proposed framework, access for non-qualified investors would remain capped. Individuals who do not meet Russia’s qualified-investor requirements would be allowed to buy cryptocurrencies worth up to 300,000 rubles, or roughly $3,800. Aksakov said professional market participants would not be subject to similar restrictions. Beyond domestic trading, the law is also expected to support the use of crypto in cross-border activity. Aksakov said the changes could facilitate international settlements and enable the overseas placement of tokens issued by Russian entities, an area of growing interest as the country seeks alternatives to traditional financial rails. According to TASS, Russian State Duma Financial Market Committee chair Anatoly Aksakov said a bill is ready that would remove cryptocurrencies from “special financial regulation,” aiming to make their use more common in daily life. Speaking to Rossiya-24, Aksakov said upcoming… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 14, 2026 The comments follow earlier signals from Russian authorities pointing to a more permissive, but closely monitored, approach to retail crypto use. In December, the Bank of Russia proposed allowing non-qualified investors to trade digital assets after passing a risk-awareness test, while maintaining a ban on anonymous and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Around the same time, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the finance ministry and the central bank were working toward a coordinated framework that would permit retail participation within defined limits. Officials have repeatedly emphasized that transaction caps and investment thresholds would be critical to containing financial and systemic risks as crypto adoption expands. Crypto Questions Flood Russia’s Social Fund As reported, Russia’s Social Fund received about 37 million calls in 2025, with crypto-related questions emerging as one of the most common topics alongside standard social benefit inquiries. Citizens frequently asked whether pensions could be paid in digital assets and whether income from crypto mining would count toward benefit calculations, prompting officials to reiterate that all state payments are made exclusively in rubles and that crypto taxation falls under the Federal Tax Service. The attention comes as crypto mining gains political and economic relevance. Senior officials have argued that mining should be recognized as an export activity, noting its impact on foreign exchange flows despite the lack of physical cross-border movement. Late last month, Moscow Exchange and St. Petersburg Exchange confirmed readiness to launch crypto trading once Russia’s legislative framework takes effect by July 1, 2026, following the Bank of Russia’s December 23 regulatory concept release.

This reveals that despite having a capable blockchain, a low level of activity can be identified in prices. The fact is that smart investors in these days look for newer projects. An example of such an investment would be Mutuum Finance , which is in presale and has been highlighted as an ideal place to invest and the best cheap crypto to buy. This DeFi crypto only costs $0.04 and has been highlighted as an extremely strong investment and one of the top places to invest in the market. Solana Price Analysis Solana has experienced massive use cases, with trading volumes above $1.6 trillion on the network in the last year. Institutional investors like Morgan Stanley have also indicated interest in the asset, filing for an ETF related to Solana. However, it looks like the SOL price has faced challenges in overcoming the current level of resistance at $147. If there is a challenge for the top crypto to break this particular level, it is expected that it will form a sideway trend. This might be quite disappointing for investors, as they may be looking for gains immediately. Due to such challenges, investors have been looking for presale options like the DeFi crypto Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Of the investment opportunities, the one that is most easily available is the presale of Mutuum Finance. At the moment, they are in Phase 7, with token prices at $0.04. Phase 7 will soon be completed with Phase 8 imminent at a token price of $0.045. Purchase at this point may enable an individual to make an immediate gain prior to the subsequent 20% jump that will occur in phase 8. Using the same example, 50,000 MUTM may be purchased at this juncture for the price of $2000. Once listed on exchanges for the price of $0.06, its value will increase to $3000. That’s a $1000 profit before any market activity. Overcollateralized Loans Mutuum Finance is a complete lending facility. One such notable thing about this facility is that loans are over-collateralized for securing profits and the stability of the facility. For instance, an investor can decide to collateralize a $7,500 stablecoin loan with $10,000 Ethereum via MUTM’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools. The Ethereum is not sold but is left to gain in case of price increases. Therefore, Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto that is quite sought after as the best cheap crypto to buy now. Peer-to-Peer Business Model Another feature would be Peer-to-Peer Trading or P2P in this system. Investors have the option to create their own deal. The P2P system can be involved in interactive negotiation processes to secure higher profits with higher interest rates as an enticement in a transaction. For example, a loan worth $5,000 in this model at an annual 20% interest rate can yield an extra $1,000. The P2P model delivers bigger APY than the P2C model. It is important to note that even the rate of growth in Mutuum Finance is not like that in SOL by any means. The presale in Mutuum Finance is less expensive and easy to access. Additionally, the role of lending is quite valuable and secure for the DeFi crypto and its investors. For people who seek gains in a short while, MUTM is a top choice as the best cheap crypto to buy.

The agreement marks one of the first publicly disclosed partnerships between World Liberty and a sovereign state, and comes at a time when diplomatic and economic ties between Pakistan and the United States appear to be warming. Under the arrangement, World Liberty Financial will work with Pakistan’s central bank to integrate its USD1 stablecoin into a regulated digital payments framework. The token is expected to operate alongside Pakistan’s own digital currency initiatives, allowing authorities to test the use of blockchain-based payments within an official regulatory structure. Deal signed with SC Financial Technologies; announcement later today The source cited by Reuters said the deal was signed with SC Financial Technologies, a little-known firm linked to World Liberty Financial. No further commercial or technical details were disclosed. Pakistan is expected to formally announce the agreement later on Wednesday during a visit by World Liberty’s chief executive officer, Zach Witkoff, to Islamabad. Neither Pakistan’s finance ministry nor World Liberty immediately commented on the scope or timeline of the project. World Liberty Financial was launched in September 2024 and has rapidly emerged as a significant player in the stablecoin space, benefitting from a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the United States under President Trump. Stablecoins gain traction globally Stablecoins, digital tokens typically pegged to traditional currencies such as the US dollar, have grown sharply in market value and usage in recent years. Advocates argue they offer faster and cheaper cross-border payments compared with traditional banking systems, while critics warn of regulatory, financial stability and governance risks. The US administration has introduced federal rules widely seen as supportive of the crypto industry, prompting other countries to examine how stablecoins could fit into their own payment systems. In May last year, MGX, a state-backed Abu Dhabi investment firm, used World Liberty’s stablecoin to acquire a $2bn equity stake in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. World Liberty’s expansion has also boosted income for the Trump family’s business empire, the Trump Organization, including revenue from overseas entities, Reuters reported previously. Pakistan’s push into digital finance Pakistan has been exploring digital currency and blockchain-based solutions as it looks to reduce reliance on cash and improve the efficiency of cross-border payments, particularly remittances, which are a crucial source of foreign exchange. The central bank said in July that it was preparing to launch a pilot digital currency project and was finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets. These efforts come against the backdrop of years of economic stress, including high inflation, depleted foreign exchange reserves and chronic political instability. Having narrowly avoided a sovereign default in 2023, Pakistan faces persistent structural challenges such as weak capital formation, an inefficient bureaucracy and heavy dependence on remittance inflows. Analysts say these pressures have eroded public confidence in traditional financial systems, creating fertile ground for alternative digital financial tools. Crypto adoption in Pak accelerates amid reforms In March 2025, the government launched the Pakistan Crypto Council to oversee the integration of blockchain technology and digital assets into the country’s financial system. The council is chaired by finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and is tasked with developing policy, encouraging innovation and ensuring regulatory oversight. The council appointed Changpeng Zhao, former chief executive of Binance, as a strategic adviser on crypto regulation in April. A month later, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif named Bilal Bin Saqib, the council’s chief executive, as special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, with minister of state rank. In May, Pakistan also unveiled its first state-backed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at a crypto conference in the United States and announced plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for bitcoin mining and AI data centres. While crypto transactions were illegal in Pakistan until recently, officials say the moves are aimed at attracting foreign investment and engaging with the global crypto industry.

Speaking from a global perspective in early 2025, Buterin’s analysis points to concrete advancements that are transforming theoretical decentralization into practical, scalable infrastructure. This shift marks a pivotal moment where core internet functions can genuinely operate free from centralized control. Vitalik Buterin’s Web3 Maturity Declaration Vitalik Buterin’s recent statement on social media platform X represents more than casual commentary. It serves as a formal assessment of a decade-long development cycle. Buterin specifically highlighted Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as a foundational achievement. This consensus mechanism change, known as The Merge, fundamentally altered the network’s economics and security. Consequently, it reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption by approximately 99.95%, according to the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute. This efficiency gain provides the essential bedrock for sustainable growth. Furthermore, Buterin emphasized the critical role of Layer 2 scaling solutions. Networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon zkEVM now process millions of transactions daily at a fraction of mainnet costs. Data from L2Beat shows the total value locked in these scaling solutions exceeded $40 billion in Q1 2025. This infrastructure expansion directly addresses the historic scalability trilemma—balancing security, decentralization, and scalability. The maturation of these technologies enables developers to build applications with user experiences rivaling traditional web services. The Technical Pillars of a Mature Web3 Buterin identified three specific technological pillars enabling this maturity phase. First, Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (ZK-EVMs) have progressed from research projects to production systems. These advanced cryptographic systems allow for transaction verification without revealing underlying data. Major implementations from Scroll, zkSync, and the Polygon team now provide full Ethereum compatibility with enhanced privacy and throughput. Second, decentralized storage and communication protocols have reached production readiness. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) now serves over 300 petabytes of data through a global network of nodes. Similarly, Waku, the decentralized messaging protocol built for the Ethereum ecosystem, supports whisper-based communication for thousands of decentralized applications. These tools provide the essential plumbing for a web independent of centralized servers. Proof-of-Stake Consensus: Enables energy-efficient validation with over 1 million active validators securing the network. ZK-EVM Technology: Delivers scalable computation with privacy preservation through advanced cryptography. Layer 2 Rollups: Process transactions off-chain while maintaining Ethereum’s security guarantees through periodic settlement. Web3 Maturity Indicators (2023-2025) Metric 2023 Baseline 2025 Status Growth Ethereum TPS (L2 Included) 15-20 1000+ 5000% Average Transaction Cost $5-15 $0.01-0.10 99% Reduction Decentralized Storage Capacity 50 PB 300+ PB 500% Active Web3 Developers 23,000 45,000+ 96% From Vision to Viable Infrastructure The practical implications of this technological maturation are now visible in working applications. Fileverse, mentioned by Buterin, offers Google Docs-like collaboration entirely on decentralized storage. Similarly, decentralized social media platforms like Farcaster and Lens Protocol demonstrate viable alternatives to centralized social networks. These applications leverage the matured infrastructure to deliver familiar user experiences without centralized data control. Industry analysts from firms like Messari and CoinShares confirm this trend in their quarterly blockchain reports, noting increased enterprise adoption of decentralized tools for specific use cases. Decentralized Core Services in Production Buterin specifically cited Waku, IPFS, and Fileverse as evidence of increasing viability. These are not theoretical constructs but actively maintained projects with growing user bases. Waku enables censorship-resistant messaging for applications ranging from decentralized social networks to enterprise communication tools. IPFS provides a robust alternative to centralized cloud storage, with major platforms like Cloudflare and Protocol Labs offering managed services. Fileverse demonstrates that complex collaborative workflows can function without centralized servers, using technologies like IPFS for storage and Ethereum for access control. This maturation follows a clear historical trajectory. The 2017-2018 period focused on conceptual proofs and initial coin offerings. The 2020-2022 phase delivered foundational infrastructure like DeFi primitives and NFT standards. The current 2024-2025 period, as identified by Buterin, represents the integration phase where these components combine into coherent systems. This evolution mirrors the early internet’s development from academic networks to the World Wide Web. Moreover, regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions has provided a more stable environment for development. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework and evolving guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have created clearer operational parameters. This regulatory maturation complements the technological progress, reducing uncertainty for builders and enterprises exploring Web3 integration. The Road Ahead for Web3 Adoption While Buterin’s announcement marks a milestone, significant challenges remain for mainstream adoption. User experience, particularly around key management and transaction signing, continues to improve but still presents barriers for non-technical users. Projects like account abstraction (ERC-4337) aim to address these issues by enabling smart contract wallets with familiar recovery options. Additionally, interoperability between different blockchain networks requires further development to create a seamless multi-chain experience. The economic models supporting decentralized applications also continue to evolve. Sustainable tokenomics that balance incentives for users, developers, and validators represent an ongoing area of research and experimentation. Buterin himself has published extensive writings on these topics, contributing to the intellectual foundation supporting Web3’s maturation. His recent focus has included decentralized governance mechanisms and quadratic funding models for public goods. Expert Perspectives on Web3 Maturation Industry experts echo Buterin’s assessment while adding important context. Dr. Aya Miyaguchi, Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation, notes that “developer education and tooling have reached unprecedented levels of sophistication.” Meanwhile, analysts from Gartner predict that by 2026, 30% of large organizations will have dedicated Web3 initiatives, up from less than 5% in 2023. This institutional interest validates the technological maturity Buterin describes, translating academic research into enterprise-grade solutions. Academic institutions have also increased their blockchain research output significantly. Stanford University’s Center for Blockchain Research and MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative publish peer-reviewed papers that inform protocol development. This academic rigor provides the theoretical underpinning for practical implementations, creating a virtuous cycle of research and development. The maturation Buterin identifies reflects this convergence of theoretical knowledge and engineering practice. Conclusion Vitalik Buterin’s declaration that Web3’s initial vision is entering technological maturity represents a watershed moment for decentralized technology. The convergence of Proof-of-Stake consensus, ZK-EVM development, Layer 2 scaling, and production-ready decentralized services creates a foundation for genuine alternatives to centralized web infrastructure. While challenges around usability and adoption remain, the technological building blocks are now proven and operational. This maturation phase, occurring throughout 2025, transforms Web3 from a promising vision into a viable technological stack capable of supporting the next generation of internet applications. The focus now shifts from proving concepts to refining implementations and driving mainstream adoption of these decentralized tools. FAQs Q1: What did Vitalik Buterin mean by “technological maturity” for Web3? Buterin referred to the point where core Web3 technologies have moved beyond research and development into stable, production-ready systems. This includes Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake consensus, functional Layer 2 scaling solutions, and decentralized services like messaging and storage that can reliably replace centralized alternatives. Q2: How has Ethereum’s shift to Proof-of-Stake contributed to Web3 maturity? The transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge) dramatically reduced energy consumption by approximately 99.95% while increasing network security through economic staking mechanisms. This created a sustainable foundation for scaling and enabled the development of more efficient validation processes essential for mainstream adoption. Q3: What are ZK-EVMs and why are they important for Web3? Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines are compatibility layers that allow Ethereum applications to run while leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for scalability and privacy. They enable transaction verification without revealing sensitive data, addressing both performance and privacy concerns that previously limited Web3 adoption. Q4: Can decentralized tools really replace services like Google Docs or Dropbox? Projects like Fileverse demonstrate that basic collaborative functions can operate on decentralized infrastructure. While feature parity with mature centralized services remains a work in progress, the foundational technologies for decentralized storage (IPFS) and access control (smart contracts) are now sufficiently developed to support practical applications. Q5: What are the main remaining barriers to Web3 adoption despite this technological maturity? Key barriers include user experience complexities (particularly around key management), regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions, interoperability between different blockchain networks, and developing sustainable economic models for decentralized applications that don’t rely solely on token speculation.

In these developments, there is an increased focus being directed towards the applications of blockchain technology, useful data streams, and payment solutions. In these areas, Chainlink Price Prediction and Chainlink Price Forecast are being assessed, alongside future cryptocurrencies working to provide solutions to practical financial issues, such as Remittix . Chainlink Price Prediction models are also being assessed against newly evolving markets. Despite the cautious market sentiments pertaining to the ongoing regulatory discussions in the crypto world, most crypto traders are presently diversifying their investments in the crypto market to projects that are experiencing notable advancement. This trend, in turn, is impacting how the Chainlink Price Prediction for future years has been presented. Chainlink Price Prediction as LINK Holds Key Infrastructure Role Chainlink Price Prediction analysis often starts with its position as a core data provider within decentralized finance and Web3. The current trading price of LINK is $13.25, up 0.82 percent. The market capitalization of LINK stands at $9.38 billion, with a trading volume of $318.17 million, sliding by 12.48 percent. The figures show stable demand but moderate activity. Chainlink remains highly relevant to what is happening in blockchains because of what it offers to decentralized apps: secure data feeds. Its Oracle Network is used by DeFi platforms, insurance protocols, and cross-chain networks that require accurate data. This infrastructure role gives LINK long-term relevance, even during periods of reduced market sentiment. Many crypto analysis reports view this as a reason Chainlink Price Prediction models remain constructive for 2026, particularly if institutional adoption of smart contracts accelerates. At the same time, LINK faces competition from projects targeting adjacent areas, such as payments and real-world finance. This has expanded investor focus beyond traditional oracle networks. Why Remittix Is Entering Chainlink Price Prediction Conversations While Chainlink Price Prediction headlines focus on data infrastructure, Remittix is being discussed for a different reason. The project is building a PayFi ecosystem designed to connect cryptocurrency with traditional finance. Remittix is quietly entering conversations about the best crypto to buy now, thanks to its focus on usability rather than speculation. Remittix currently trades at $0.123 per token and has raised over $28.8 million through private funding, with more than 701 million tokens sold. The Remittix Wallet is already live on the Apple App Store , marking a key delivery milestone. The full crypto-to-fiat PayFi platform is scheduled to launch on 9 February 2026 , according to the team’s official announcement. A major CEX reveal is scheduled for the $30 million mark, while listings on BitMart and LBank are already secured, with a high-profile December announcement planned. Remittix Platform Progress and Security Milestones Remittix stands out in crypto news due to consistent product updates. Beta wallet testing is underway, with community users already interacting with the app. One beta wallet demonstration video shared by the community shows real transaction flows inside the wallet interface. Security has also been a priority. Remittix has completed a full audit and team verification with CertiK , the leading blockchain security firm. The project is currently ranked number one on CertiK for pre-launch tokens, reinforcing trust among crypto investors focused on risk management and transparency. Key factors driving attention toward Remittix include: Wallet lives on the App Store with regular updates Crypto-to-fiat PayFi platform launching on 9 February 2026 CertiK audited smart contracts and verified the team Future CEX listings on BitMart and LBank have already been revealed Targeting global payments and real-world crypto adoption The project has also confirmed a limited 200 percent bonus allocation , which is already more than halfway depleted. This has added urgency without shifting the focus away from utility. Chainlink Price Prediction Meets a Utility-First Market Chainlink Price Prediction models for 2026 increasingly reflect a market that values infrastructure and adoption over narratives. LINK remains a cornerstone of decentralized finance, yet newer altcoins focused on payments and compliance are gaining ground. Remittix fits into this trend by addressing crypto adoption barriers directly, positioning itself among discussions of the best altcoin to buy now based on functionality. Rather than competing directly, LINK and RTX reflect different segments of the crypto market. Chainlink ensures data integrity across the blockchain, while Remittix focuses on enabling digital assets for everyday financial use. This combination explains why both are being described as undervalued within current crypto trends. Final Outlook: Utility Shapes the 2026 Narrative As crypto adoption expands, Chainlink Price Prediction discussions are evolving beyond price charts alone. Infrastructure, payments, and regulation-friendly design are becoming central themes. LINK continues to anchor smart contract ecosystems, while Remittix builds toward practical financial integration.

Spot silver surged more than 5% to touch $91.5535 an ounce, while gold was within $10 of an all-time peak. This follows gold’s record-breaking surge above $4,600 per ounce on January 12. Investors expressed excitement over the rise in the price of precious metals Lower interest rates tend to erode the opportunity cost of holding precious metals, thereby boosting their appeal as a store of value. Analysts in the United States noted that the underlying inflation level in the country as of December last year was lower than what they had previously forecasted, sparking heated debates among individuals. In an attempt to address this controversy, they claimed that the sudden drop in the underlying inflation level was due to the government shutdown that took place from October 1 to November 12, 2025. In the meantime, reports have highlighted that the price of precious metals has continued to rise drastically since last year, capitalizing on the current situation in the crypto ecosystem regarding the possible indictment of Jerome Powell, the Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Notably, Powell’s incident raises concerns about the central bank’s independence. Still, sources confirmed that the Fed chair acquired a substantial support system from central bankers worldwide. However, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, cautioned that political interference poses a risk to the entire ecosystem. On the other hand, U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions have played a crucial role in increasing demand for Haven assets ( investments that typically retain or gain value during economic downturns). These actions include the president’s move against Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela, and his renewed threats concerning Greenland. Another factor that has contributed to this boost is the violent protests in Iran that are anticipated to cause the potential collapse of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government. In response to the market excitement, analysts at Citigroup Inc., a major American multinational investment bank and financial services corporation, have increased their forecasts for the prices of gold and silver over the next three months. They now expect gold to reach $5,000 per ounce and silver to reach $100 per ounce. Heightened tension in the market impacts silver’s global supplies By 2025, reports indicated that silver had outperformed gold by approximately 150%, driven by a short squeeze in October and ongoing supply constraints in London. Meanwhile, reports noted that the situation in the market is likely to worsen after sources highlighted that traders are eagerly awaiting the release of results regarding the U.S. Section 232 investigation, which they believe could lead to the imposition of tariffs on silver. Responding to fears about this potential tax, investors have reportedly stored this metal in US warehouses, which has impacted global supplies and caused declines. Apart from the U.S., Singapore also encountered a rise in the prices of precious metals, according to reports released today at 10:25 a.m. To break this down, reports stated that the Asian country’s spot gold price escalated to $4,621.92 an ounce, reflecting a 0.8% increase in silver to $89.7457, which also saw a 3.2% surge, as well as platinum and palladium.

The bulls woke up on Monday, pushing it to $92,400 on a couple of occasions, but they couldn’t keep the rally going. This changed on Tuesday, though. First, the US CPI numbers came out lower than expected and provided a necessary push to $92,400. BTC maintained that level this time, and the subsequent speech by US President Donald Trump, which triggered a lot of headlines, was likely behind the following BTC rally. In the span of just a few hours, the cryptocurrency surged by four grand and tapped $96,500 for the first time in two months. Since then, it has lost some steam but still trades around $95,000.

Here’s what this could suggest for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Has Fallen To Multi-Year Lows In a new post on X, Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio , an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the sum of all profits and losses realized on the network and the cryptocurrency’s Realized Cap . The Realized Cap here refers to a capitalization model that calculates BTC’s total value by assuming that the value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. The last transfer price of any token is likely to represent its cost basis, so the Realized Cap measures the sum of the cost bases of the total BTC supply. In other words, it represents the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. As such, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio tells us about how the amount of profit and loss that Bitcoin investors are realizing compares against the total capital stored in the asset. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by Beamish that shows how its value has changed over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio shot up to a notable value with the price crash in November. This suggests that investors took a large amount of profit and loss alongside the volatility. Since this high, the indicator’s value has seen a steep drop and has returned to the lowest level since October 2023. The analyst has noted that this points to “subdued conviction behind distribution at current price levels.” Typically, market volatility tends to be low when these conditions form, so it only remains to be seen how the price of the cryptocurrency will develop in the near future. In some other news, demand from the Bitcoin retail investors has been missing recently, as CryptoQuant author IT Tech has pointed out in an X post . The indicator cited by IT Tech is the 30-day change in the Retail Investor Demand , measuring the percentage change in the volume associated with the small hands (transactions valued at less than $10,000). As is visible in the chart, the 30-day change in the Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand has been declining inside the negative zone recently, implying that the activity of the retail entities has been going down. The indicator’s trend hasn’t changed even after the recent recovery surge. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $94,300, up more than 3% over the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Sell Side|Bitcoin Sell-side Risk Ratio|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-14 08:00:25

Analyst Presents the Chart,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-could-hit-all-time-high-this-month-analyst-presents-the-chart/,"Market participants often focus on asset-specific developments while overlooking broader intermarket relationships. In a recent post, crypto commentator Bird shifted attention to a long-term comparative chart linking the performance of the Russell 2000 index with historical movements in XRP. The analysis argues that periods when U.S. small-cap equities enter price discovery have repeatedly coincided with sharp upward moves in XRP , including previous all-time highs. The chart shared alongside the post plots the Russell 2000 as candlesticks and XRP as a blue line, covering multiple market cycles from 2016 through projected activity into 2026. Highlighted zones emphasize moments when the Russell 2000 broke above prior highs, followed closely by aggressive upside moves in XRP. According to Bird, this recurring sequence provides a simple but consistent signal that has played out across several cycles. I’m going to show you another very simple chart that shows why I think $XRP hits an all time high this month. In '17, the Russell 2000 broke into all time highs > XRP went parabolic to ATHs. In '21, the Russell 2000 hit all time highs again > XRP went parabolic (but didn’t… pic.twitter.com/KOjJpVpO4A — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 13, 2026 Historical Context: 2017 and 2021 The first comparison centers on 2017, when the Russell 2000 broke into new all-time highs during a broader risk-on environment. Shortly after that breakout, XRP experienced a rapid upward move that culminated in a cycle peak. Bird presents this as the earliest example of the relationship between small-cap equity strength and XRP’s most explosive price action. The pattern appeared again in 2021. The Russell 2000 reached fresh highs as liquidity expanded across financial markets. XRP responded with another strong rally. However, Bird notes that this cycle differed from 2017 due to external constraints. The now-concluded court case involving Ripple at the time limited XRP’s ability to fully complete the move, preventing it from establishing a definitive new all-time high despite parabolic momentum. The 2024 Breakout and Current Conditions The analysis then shifts to the most recent cycle. In 2024, the Russell 2000 once again pushed into new highs, signaling renewed strength in small-cap equities. XRP followed with another sharp advance, which Bird interprets as confirmation that the historical relationship remains intact. The chart highlights this phase as a completed repetition of the earlier pattern, reinforcing the argument that the connection is structural rather than coincidental. According to Bird, the Russell 2000 has now re-entered price discovery. In his view, this condition represents the critical trigger. Each prior instance of sustained price discovery in the index coincided with XRP entering a phase of accelerated price expansion. Based on that history, he argues that XRP is positioned to reach a new all-time high within the current month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supporting Commentary from Market Observers An additional perspective came from X user Amaury Viera, who characterized the setup as a clean intermarket signal that is frequently overlooked. Viera emphasized that when small-cap equities expand, liquidity tends to rotate into higher beta assets. From this standpoint, XRP has historically benefited from such shifts. He further argued that the 2021 cycle should be viewed as interrupted rather than invalidated, suggesting that the broader move may still be incomplete if Russell 2000 strength persists. Taken together, the chart and commentary present a straightforward point. Sustained expansion in the Russell 2000 has repeatedly aligned with XRP’s most aggressive upward phases, and current market conditions are being interpreted as a continuation of that long-standing pattern.

The proposals cover a wide range of topics, from banning returns on stablecoins completely to preventing government officials from making money through cryptocurrency investments. Changes to how digital asset mixing services are classified have also been put forward. Members from both major political parties have submitted these modifications. Markup sessio n se t for Thursday On Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee will convene for a markup session. Legislators will debate the suggested amendments, cast votes on whether or not to approve any of them, and then determine whether or not the main measure should proceed. A similar meeting had been scheduled by the Senate Agriculture Committee, but it has been rescheduled until the end of January. Just before midnight on Monday, the Banking Committee’s original legislation became accessible. Legislators and business officials have been attentively examining the specifics ever since. Several of the proposed modifications have support from members of both parties. Senators Thom Tillis and Angela Alsobrooks have jointly submitted three changes. Two of them focus on the part of the bill dealing with stablecoin rewards. One would take out the word “solely” from the current language, which states that “a digital asset service provider may not pay any form of interest or yield (whether in cash, tokens, or other consideration) solely in connection with the holding of a payment stablecoin.” Their other proposal would change reporting rules and introduce risk guidance requirements for yield payments. Several additional proposed modifications also target the stablecoin rewards section, with some aiming to remove yield payments altogether. During typical congressional markup sessions, most proposed amendments fail to pass. Many could also be withdrawn based on agreements made during the meeting. This means most items on the long list probably will not make it into the final version. Ethical concerns remain unresolved What remains uncertain is whether lawmakers have reached an agreement on concerns Democrats raised earlier during negotiations. The main issue involves ethical questions Democrats have about President Donald Trump and his family’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry. They formally outlined this worry in a document last fall. Senator Ruben Gallego reportedly helped negotiate ethics provisions, but none of his proposed changes appear to address this topic based on their descriptions. Senator Chris Van Hollen has submitted a proposal calling for an “anti-corruption provision” and another requiring disclosure of financial interests labeled as an “anti-touting requirement.” A Democratic staff member said Tuesday evening that ethics discussions are ongoing, but no agreement has been finalized. The staff member called ethics “one of a couple sticking points in these talks.” Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester has proposed changes addressing “quorum requirements.” This relates to Democratic concerns that Trump has not appointed any Democrats to what are supposed to be bipartisan commissions running the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Both agencies currently have only Republicans in leadership positions. Democratic Senators Gallego, Alsobrooks, Blunt Rochester, Jack Reed, Andy Kim, Raphael Warnock, Catherine Cortez Masto, Elizabeth Warren, and Van Hollen submitted proposals before Tuesday’s deadline. From the Republican side, Tillis, Mike Rounds, Bill Hagerty, Pete Ricketts, Katie Britt, John Kennedy, Cynthia Lummis, Kevin Cramer, and Tim Scott filed provisions.

On the “big coin” side, Ethereum price prediction models using a simple 5% annual growth assumption point to ETH around $4,293 in 2026, about $5,218.59 by 2030, and roughly $5,479.52 by 2031 (not guaranteed). If you’re hunting the best crypto to buy this mix of steady forecasts and real volatility makes timing feel urgent. Now look at Cardano (ADA): it’s around $0.3883, with a forecast target of $0.5340 by Feb 11, 2026 (+37.15%), even while sentiment is bearish and fear is high (Fear & Greed 27). In this noisy market, APEMARS ($APRZ) is still in presale, Stage 3 (BANANA BOOST) at $0.00002448, aiming for $0.0055, with stated 22,300% ROI math and early traction (385 holders, $78k+ raised, 3.77B sold). That’s the “early entry” spark many buyers crave. Ethereum price prediction If Ethereum (ETH) grows at a steady 5% per year, the model estimates ETH at about $4,293 in 2026, around $5,218.59 by 2030, and roughly $5,479.52 in 2031, with longer-range projections of $6,993.41 in 2036 and $8,500.54 by 2040. In this setup, ETH’s current price is $4,293 (with a -8.77% 1-year change noted), and the “5 years” outcome implies a +27.63% increase to approximately $5,479.52. For a simple investment example, if you put $1,000 into ETH and it compounds at 5% annually, the predicted gain after 5 years is about $276.28, which equals a 27.63% ROI (profit only, not counting fees). These figures are purely based on the fixed-growth assumption, meaning they’re not a guarantee and don’t account for volatility, different market scenarios, past performance patterns, or trading/holding costs. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction Cardano (ADA) is currently around $0.3883, and the latest forecast targets $0.5340 by February 11, 2026, a projected +37.15% move. Short-term calls are modest, with a 5-day prediction of $0.3923 and 1-month/3-month predictions near $0.5340 / $0.5800, while longer horizons (6M, 1Y, 2030+) are marked as “unlock.” The broader mood is cautious: Fear & Greed Index 27 (Fear), sentiment bearish, and high volatility (5.51%), even though the 14-day RSI is neutral at 49.92; key trend markers show ADA below its 50-day SMA ($0.3996) and far under the 200-day SMA ($0.6477). For an example scenario, the investment calculator suggests that a $1,000 ADA buy held until Aug 05, 2026 could yield an estimated $825.99 profit (about 82.60% ROI) over 203 days, based on the model’s path. The 2026 trading channel is projected between $0.3871 and $0.7064, with an average annualized price near $0.5542, but the tech readout still leans bearish overall (more bearish than bullish signals). Near-term levels to watch include support at $0.3865 / $0.3818 / $0.3767 and resistance at $0.3962 / $0.4013 / $0.4060, which may decide whether ADA stabilizes or extends the pullback. APEMARS and the Best Crypto to Buy Feeling (Presale Energy That Makes People Move Fast) APEMARS is like buying your favorite toy before it hits every store shelf. Early buyers love that “I got it first!” feeling, and presales are built to spark exactly that emotion. If you’re chasing the best crypto to buy, APEMARS is positioned as the high-upside, early-entry option, more risk than major coins, but also the kind of setup that creates big FOMO. APEMARS ($APRZ) Stage 3 BANANA BOOST Stats (Presale Live): Current stage: 3 (BANANA BOOST) Stage 3 price: $0.00002448 Listing price: $0.0055 ROI from Stage 3: 22,300% (price-gap math, not guaranteed) Holder count: 385 Amount raised: $78k+ Tokens sold: 3.8B Now let’s keep it super simple: Ethereum and Cardano are like big grown-up bikes, strong, proven, and popular. APEMARS is like a brand-new scooter in presale that hasn’t hit the streets yet. The scooter can be thrilling… but you still need to be careful. Orbital Boost System (Referral Sharing Like Bringing a Friend to Play) APEMARS also includes a referral-style feature designed for community growth. Once a minimum contribution threshold is met, it unlocks a system that rewards both people (the one who refers and the one who joins). It’s meant to encourage organic sharing and community building.

Investment Scenario “$5,000 in Stage 3… Are You About to Be the Person Who Says ‘I Was Early’?” Let’s play a simple candy-counting math game. If you invest $5,000 in APEMARS ($APRZ) at $0.00002448, you’d get about 204,248,366 tokens (around 204.25 million). That’s a huge pile of tokens while the price is still tiny, which is exactly why presales feel so exciting. Now here’s the FOMO part: if APEMARS lists at $0.0055, that pile could be worth about $1,123,366. Sounds wild, right? But say it clearly: it’s not guaranteed, crypto can go up, down, sideways, and silly. Still, Stage 3 feels powerful because the entry price is small, and that “if it lists” math creates urgency. So… do you watch from the sidelines, or take a calculated early shot? Conclusion Ethereum and Cardano are like the big superheroes of crypto, well-known, widely used, and built for long journeys. They can still grow and dip, but they have deep communities and real ecosystems. If you want stability and long-term building, ETH and ADA can feel like “core” choices in a portfolio. But if you’re hunting the best crypto to buy with the “I want to be early” energy, APEMARS is built to trigger that exact moment. Stage 3 is live at $0.00002448, targeting $0.0055, showing 385 holders, $78k+ raised, and 3.8B tokens sold. Presale stages don’t wait for anyone. If you buy later, you may end up saying the words crypto people hate most: “I should’ve done it earlier.” Check out APEMARS ($APRZ) now and decide while Stage 3 still exists.

Beginners often like established coins like Ethereum and Cardano for stability. Presales like APEMARS ($APRZ) can be exciting but riskier. Choose based on your comfort with risk and learning. Is APEMARS ($APRZ) a good option compared to Ethereum? Ethereum is established and widely used. APEMARS ($APRZ) is early-stage and high-risk, but the presale pricing can offer bigger upside potential if the project performs after launch. Can Cardano outperform Ethereum this year? It’s possible, but not predictable. Cardano can grow with upgrades and ecosystem expansion, while Ethereum grows with adoption and network activity. Both can win in different market conditions. How does APEMARS presale pricing work? APEMARS uses multiple stages with changing prices over time. Stage 3 is priced at $0.00002448. Earlier stages are cheaper, later stages usually get tighter. Stage progression creates urgency and momentum. Is the 22,300% ROI guaranteed for $APRZ? No. That figure is based on the gap between Stage 3 price and the stated listing price. Markets can change quickly. Always research and only invest money you can afford to lose. Should I buy APEMARS ($APRZ) or stick to Ethereum and Cardano? Many investors mix both: major coins for stability and smaller presales for upside. If you do that, keep it balanced. Don’t go all-in on high-risk assets, even if the math looks exciting.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ADA|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-14 08:08:13

BMNU’s elevated expense ratio is offset by superior liquidity, mitigating bid/ask spread risk and supporting efficient daily trading strategies. BMNR faces a critical shareholder vote to expand authorized shares, introducing potential dilution and heightened correlation to Ethereum price movements. I assign BMNU a Hold rating due to its suitability for daily trading only, with significant risks from leverage, value decay, and volatility. The T-REX 2X Long BMNR Daily Target ETF ( BMNU ) is a leveraged exchange-traded fund designed to provide 2x the daily performance of the underlying asset, BitMine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ). BMNU is a highly liquid trading strategy with an average of $233mm in share value changing hands on a daily basis, making this ETF an appealing vehicle for those seeking to amplify exposure to BMNR. Given that this is a leveraged strategy, investors should only consider BMNU for daily exposure given the risks associated with a long-term position, including compounded returns and long-term value decay. About T-REX 2X Long BMNR Daily Target ETF BMNU was launched by REX Shares on September 26, 2025 on the Cboe BZX Exchange. BMNU has a net expense ratio of 150 bps, a relatively expensive leveraged strategy when considering single-stock leveraged strategies tend to charge around 100 bps +/-. Seeking Alpha Despite having a relatively higher expense ratio, BMNU exhibits substantially greater liquidity when compared to peer leveraged BMNR strategies, making it an appealing trading vehicle for those seeking to amplify daily performance. Given that BMNU was designed to be actively traded, I believe liquidity should be considered over management fees given that bid/ask spread risk can add up over time, potentially creating a higher lifetime fee relative to the expense ratio. Liquidity is also an important factor for ensuring accurate pricing and ETF mechanics; though the 2x daily performance target is not guaranteed, strong liquidity will certainly help. Seeking Alpha About BitMine BitMine is an Ethereum treasury company with operations that include staking and decentralized finance. The company is approaching a critical shareholder vote to increase authorized shares from 500mm to 50b, a strategy designed to expand its Ethereum holdings to increase shareholder value . The expansionary authorized share count will provide the company with significant flexibility to raise capital to engage in mergers & acquisitions as well as to “accommodate future share splits.” Investors should recognize that share splits and reverse stock splits do not add or destroy the value of an investment in the company; it merely proportionately increases or decreases the ownership concentration of each share by decreasing or increasing the share count. i.e. a 2-for-1 stock split will double an investor’s share count without diluting the percentage of ownership in the company by proportionally halving the price of the shares. The core difference is that increasing the authorized share count may be dilutive and impact the value of existing shares held. As a result, if the authorized share count is increased, BMNR may dilute the float and may negatively impact the share price. According to the press release, management’s goal is to maintain a share price of $25/share through the function of stock splits over time with the presumption of a relative value coefficient to Ethereum held. BMNR shares are generally directionally correlated to the price of Ethereum over time; this means that BMNU may amplify exposure to Ethereum to a certain extent. TradingView TradingView On a daily basis, BMNU targets 2x the daily performance of BMNR shares through the use of BitMine swap derivatives. Swap contracts are designed to exchange the daily performance of the underlying asset for a fixed rate. Swap derivatives are settled daily in cash, resulting in the exchange of performance for the fixed rate. This phenomenon translates into the performance of BMNU in which performance will be reset on a daily basis. As a result of this feature, BMNU’s long-term performance may compound over BMNR depending on the general pricing trend of BMNR. For example, if BMNR were to realize positive returns over multiple consecutive days, BMNU’s price performance may extend beyond the 2x daily performance target. The same performance can work to the downside and may potentially result in unavailable losses. For this reason, BMNU should only be held for daily exposure. In addition to this, BMNU may experience value decay over time, which may erode the net asset value. Additional Risks to Consider Leveraged strategies were designed to amplify daily performance and are not meant to be held for longer than a single trading day. Long-term exposure may result in compounded returns, value decay, and significant exposure to volatility. BMNU may expose investors to higher trading fees and short-term capital gains on top of the management fee that should be equated into total returns. Investors should be mindful of liquidity, as this may impact volatility and bid/ask spread risk. Investors should adhere to strict risk management protocol with predetermined selling parameters in order to protect one’s investment from significant losses. You can review additional risks here and the SEC bulletin here . Final Thoughts BMNU is a highly liquid investment strategy designed to provide 2x the daily performance of BMNR. BMNU can be an appealing investment vehicle for those seeking to amplify their daily performance over BMNR, though investors should bear in mind that an investment in BMNU is not a direct investment in BMNR. Given the risks involved in the strategy, I am recommending BMNU with a Hold rating.",BMNR|BMNU,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-14 08:08:19

According to data from the analytics platform Onchainlens, an address widely associated with DWF Labs moved 6.93 million FXS, valued at approximately $5.41 million, from the leading global exchange to a private wallet. This move, observed globally on March 21, 2025, represents a classic bullish signal that analysts often interpret as a shift from trading to long-term holding. Consequently, the transaction has sparked extensive discussion regarding the strategic intentions of major liquidity providers and the underlying value proposition of the Frax Finance ecosystem. DWF Labs FXS Withdrawal: A Deep Dive into the Transaction The withdrawal of $5.41 million worth of FXS tokens by DWF Labs from Binance is not an isolated event but part of a broader pattern of institutional behavior in digital asset markets. Market makers like DWF Labs provide essential liquidity across trading venues, and their wallet movements frequently serve as high-conviction indicators for other participants. For instance, moving assets off an exchange typically reduces immediate sell pressure and suggests a custodial preference for holding. Furthermore, this specific action involved a substantial portion of the circulating FXS supply, thereby drawing significant scrutiny to the Frax protocol’s fundamentals. The transaction was executed seamlessly, highlighting the sophisticated operational capabilities of modern crypto-native firms. To understand the scale, consider the following comparative data for recent notable exchange withdrawals by institutional entities: Entity Asset Value (USD) Exchange Date DWF Labs FXS $5.41M Binance Mar 2025 Known Whale ETH $12.70M Coinbase Feb 2025 Venture Fund SOL $8.20M FTX Estate Jan 2025 This table illustrates that DWF Labs’s move is strategically significant within the context of recent institutional capital flows. Analysts from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode consistently note that such withdrawals, especially from active trading firms, often precede periods of accumulation or strategic partnership announcements. The action directly impacts FXS’s liquidity profile on Binance, potentially leading to increased volatility or a tightening of the bid-ask spread. Understanding the Frax Finance Ecosystem and FXS Tokenomics To fully grasp the implication of a $5.41 million FXS withdrawal, one must first understand the Frax Finance protocol. Frax is a pioneering fractional-algorithmic stablecoin system. Its native stablecoin, FRAX, maintains its peg through a hybrid mechanism combining collateralized and algorithmic elements. The FXS token sits at the heart of this system, performing several critical functions: Governance: FXS holders govern the Frax protocol, voting on parameters like collateral ratios and fee distributions. Utility: It accrues fees and revenue generated by the Frax ecosystem. Value Accrual: FXS captures the seigniorage income and excess value from the protocol’s growth. Therefore, a large-scale acquisition of FXS by a sophisticated player like DWF Labs is not merely a bet on token price appreciation. It is a strategic position in the governance and future revenue of a leading DeFi stablecoin platform. Recent protocol upgrades, including the launch of Frax v3 and expanded cross-chain deployments, have likely enhanced FXS’s fundamental value proposition. Market data shows that FXS’s staking yield and protocol-controlled value have trended positively, offering tangible returns to long-term holders. Expert Analysis: Decoding Market Maker Moves Industry experts emphasize the need to contextualize DWF Labs’s action within standard market maker behavior. “Market makers operate with a dual mandate,” explains a former quantitative strategist at a top-tier trading firm who spoke on background. “They must provide liquidity for client orders and manage their own proprietary book. A withdrawal of this size from an exchange vault strongly indicates a shift in proprietary strategy from liquidity provisioning to strategic asset holding.” This perspective is echoed by on-chain analysts who track wallet patterns. They note that DWF Labs has a history of making strategic, long-term investments in infrastructure tokens beyond its core market-making activities. The potential impacts of this move are multifaceted. Firstly, it reduces the immediately tradeable supply of FXS on Binance, which can lead to positive price momentum if demand remains constant or increases. Secondly, it signals confidence to the broader market, potentially influencing retail and institutional sentiment. Finally, it may grant DWF Labs greater governance influence within the Frax DAO, allowing it to shape the protocol’s future direction. Historical precedent shows that similar large withdrawals by known entities have sometimes preceded major protocol announcements or integrations. The Broader Context of Crypto Exchange Flows in 2025 The movement of assets on and off centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance remains a key on-chain metric for gauging market sentiment. In 2025, with enhanced regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, these flows have become more nuanced. Exchange net flows are now analyzed in conjunction with derivatives data, staking activity, and cross-chain bridge volumes. A withdrawal by a market maker carries different weight than one by a mining pool or a retail whale. Data from CryptoQuant indicates that overall exchange reserves for major assets have been declining throughout early 2025, suggesting a broader trend of investors moving assets into self-custody or DeFi protocols for yield. This environment makes DWF Labs’s decision particularly noteworthy. As a liquidity provider, DWF Labs inherently holds assets on exchanges to facilitate trading. Choosing to remove a significant sum indicates a high-conviction, longer-term view that potentially outweighs the short-term opportunity cost of not having those assets readily available for market-making operations. This action aligns with a growing institutional theme of treating high-quality crypto assets as strategic treasury holdings rather than purely trading instruments. Conclusion The $5.41 million FXS withdrawal by DWF Labs from Binance is a compelling case study in modern crypto market dynamics. This transaction underscores the strategic behavior of key market participants and highlights the growing importance of sophisticated tokenomics, as seen in the Frax Finance ecosystem. While on-chain data provides a transparent record of the action, its true significance lies in the confidence it may signal in FXS’s underlying value and the Frax protocol’s roadmap. As the digital asset market continues to mature, movements by entities like DWF Labs will remain critical indicators for analysts and investors tracking the intersection of liquidity, governance, and long-term value accrual in decentralized finance. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a market maker like DWF Labs withdraws tokens from an exchange? It typically signals a strategic shift from holding assets for liquidity provision to holding them for long-term investment or governance purposes. This action reduces immediate sell pressure on the asset and is often interpreted as a bullish signal. Q2: What is FXS, and why is it important? FXS is the governance and utility token of the Frax Finance protocol, a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin system. It accrues fees and revenue from the ecosystem, and holders can vote on key protocol decisions, making it central to the project’s operation and value. Q3: How reliable is on-chain data from sources like Onchainlens? On-chain data is highly reliable for verifying transactions, as it is immutable and public. Analytics platforms like Onchainlens, Nansen, and Arkham use clustering heuristics to link addresses to entities, which, while highly accurate, should be considered a strong presumption rather than an absolute guarantee. Q4: Could this withdrawal affect the price of FXS? Potentially, yes. By reducing the readily available supply on a major exchange like Binance, the withdrawal can decrease sell-side liquidity. If buying demand persists or increases, this imbalance can create upward price pressure, although many other market factors are also at play. Q5: What is the difference between FRAX and FXS? FRAX is the stablecoin product of the Frax protocol, designed to maintain a value pegged to $1. FXS is the protocol’s governance token, which captures the system’s excess value and fees. Holding FXS is an investment in the protocol itself, while holding FRAX is akin to holding a dollar-pegged digital asset.

Key Takeaways: Stablecoin payments on Revolut surged in 2025, with volumes rising by 156% to about $10.5 billion. Onchain data shows growth has been steady throughout the year, driven by everyday payments. Revolut’s fee-free USDC and USDT conversions are helping push stablecoins into routine retail use. Revolut has not released official stablecoin payment data for the year, but crypto researcher Alex Obchakevich estimates that stablecoin transactions nearly doubled as a share of the platform’s total payments compared with 2024. Dune Data Shows Steady Growth in Revolut Stablecoin Flows The analysis draws on blockchain data compiled by Dune Analytics and focuses on stablecoin flows linked to Revolut wallets. “Despite the small absolute share, the dynamics are impressive,” Obchakevich said, noting that growth has been consistent throughout the year rather than driven by short-lived spikes. The trend aligns with broader projections for the sector. Bloomberg Intelligence said this week that stablecoin payment flows could grow at an 81% compound annual rate, reaching $56.6 trillion by 2030, as retail adoption expands and more institutions integrate blockchain-based settlement. Revolut has actively pushed into the space. In October, the company introduced a feature allowing users to exchange US dollars for USDC and USDT at a 1:1 rate, with no commissions or hidden fees. The move lowered friction for customers looking to move funds onchain without navigating external exchanges. Stablecoins on @Revolut are showing exponential growth. The volume of transactions with stablecoins is growing four times faster at 156% compared to the total payment volume of 38.5%. This indicates the active implementation of crypto solutions on @Revolut . Over the year, the… https://t.co/1XBP5K07J5 pic.twitter.com/TiO1JwowbE — Alex (@obchakevich_) January 12, 2026 Transaction data suggests stablecoins are being used for routine payments rather than only large transfers. Obchakevich said transfers between $100 and $500 accounted for roughly 30% to 40% of all stablecoin transactions on the platform, pointing to practical, day-to-day use cases. “This indicates that Revolut users actively use stablecoins for everyday medium-sized payments, not just for large transfers,” he said. Ethereum dominates stablecoin activity on Revolut, accounting for more than two-thirds of total volume, while Tron follows with about 22.8%. The platform also supports networks such as Polygon , Solana, Arbitrum and Optimism. The broader stablecoin market is valued at about $312 billion, and US Treasury estimates suggest it could reach $2 trillion by 2028. Revolut is not alone in tapping into that growth. Western Union plans to roll out a stablecoin settlement system on Solana in 2026, while MoneyGram and Zelle are also moving to integrate stablecoin-based payments for cross-border transfers. Stablecoin Transactions Hit $33 Trillion in 2025 as USDC Leads Usage Global stablecoin transaction value reached $33 trillion in 2025, marking a 72% increase from the previous year, according to Bloomberg data compiled by Artemis Analytics. USDC emerged as the most-used stablecoin by transaction volume, processing $18.3 trillion, while Tether’s USDT handled $13.3 trillion, despite maintaining its lead by market capitalization at $187 billion. The surge in activity followed the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025, the first comprehensive U.S. regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. Industry participants say the legislation has provided legal certainty that encouraged broader institutional and global adoption.

This innovative platform integrates spot trading, perpetual futures, and prediction markets into a single, cohesive interface. Consequently, traders can now manage diverse strategies from one account, marking a pivotal step toward streamlined digital asset management. The launch, first reported by The Block on November 26, 2024, signals a new phase of product integration within decentralized finance. Backpack Exchange Introduces Unified Trading Experience The newly launched private beta represents a core evolution for the Solana-based exchange. According to CEO Armani Ferrante, the Unified Prediction Portfolio allows users to flexibly allocate capital from a single account balance. Therefore, a trader can simultaneously speculate on a prediction market event, hedge that exposure with a perpetual futures contract, and maintain a long-term spot position in a related asset. This integration addresses a common pain point: fragmented capital and complex transfers between different trading venues or product types. Backpack, known for its focus on security and user experience following its origins with the Mad Lads NFT project, is building this on the high-throughput Solana blockchain. The architecture potentially offers lower fees and faster settlement times compared to some integrated platforms on other networks. This technical foundation is crucial for the seamless operation of a system handling multiple, concurrent order types and market data streams. The Mechanics of Integrated Prediction Market Trading Prediction markets allow users to trade on the outcomes of real-world events, from elections to sports scores. Traditionally, these markets operate in isolation from spot and derivatives crypto trading. Backpack’s model breaks down these silos. For instance, a user bullish on Solana’s adoption could engage in three correlated actions within one portfolio: Spot Holding: Purchase and hold SOL tokens. Futures Hedge: Open a short perpetual futures position on a correlated asset to manage downside risk. Prediction Bet: Take a position on a market predicting “Solana TVL will exceed $5B by Q2 2025.” This synergy creates a more nuanced risk management framework. Importantly, capital efficiency improves because margin and collateral can be shared across product types, subject to the platform’s risk parameters. The table below contrasts traditional versus unified trading approaches: Aspect Traditional Separate Platforms Backpack Unified Portfolio Capital Management Fragmented across accounts/wallets Unified pool for all products User Experience Multiple logins, interfaces, and settlement steps Single dashboard and workflow Strategic Execution Slow, manual coordination between trades Rapid, integrated strategy deployment Cross-Margin Potential Limited or impossible Native and programmable Expert Analysis on Market Structure Evolution Industry observers note this launch aligns with a broader trend of product convergence in crypto exchanges. Following the success of blended offerings in traditional finance, crypto platforms are racing to become one-stop shops. The integration of prediction markets is particularly noteworthy. It bridges decentralized finance (DeFi) with real-world information, potentially attracting a new cohort of users interested in event-driven trading beyond pure cryptocurrency price speculation. Furthermore, the move leverages Solana’s technical capabilities. The network’s high speed and low cost are essential for maintaining a smooth user experience when aggregating liquidity and updating positions across three distinct market types. Performance lags or high fees would severely undermine the value proposition of a unified account. Backpack’s existing infrastructure, built with a focus on compliance and security after past industry failures, provides a trusted foundation for this complex expansion. Potential Impacts and Future Roadmap The private beta phase will allow Backpack to stress-test system integrity, liquidity mechanisms, and risk engines with a controlled user group. A successful rollout could pressure other exchanges, both centralized and decentralized, to pursue similar integration. Moreover, it could increase the utility and liquidity of prediction markets by directly connecting them to deeper crypto derivatives and spot markets. The long-term vision suggests a platform where sophisticated, multi-legged strategies can be executed with a few clicks. For the broader Solana ecosystem, a flagship application like this drives developer attention and user adoption. It demonstrates practical use cases for the blockchain beyond simple token swaps or NFT minting. However, the success hinges on robust security, deep liquidity across all integrated markets, and clear regulatory navigation for prediction markets in various jurisdictions. Conclusion The Backpack Exchange’s private beta for its Unified Prediction Portfolio represents a innovative leap in crypto trading infrastructure. By merging spot, futures, and prediction markets into a single Solana-based account, Backpack is pioneering a more efficient and strategic trading environment. This development underscores the ongoing maturation of cryptocurrency platforms toward integrated, user-centric financial services. The success of this model could redefine standards for capital efficiency and strategic flexibility across the entire digital asset industry. FAQs Q1: What is Backpack Exchange’s Unified Prediction Portfolio? The Unified Prediction Portfolio is a new beta feature from the Solana-based Backpack Exchange. It integrates trading for spot cryptocurrencies, perpetual futures contracts, and prediction markets into one account, allowing users to manage combined strategies seamlessly. Q2: Who can access the private beta? Access is currently limited to a select group of users invited by Backpack. The exchange typically uses a phased rollout to test stability and gather feedback before a public launch. Q3: How does this integration benefit a trader? It offers superior capital efficiency, as funds can be allocated across different product types without transfers. It also enables complex, hedged strategies—like betting on a prediction market while hedging the financial risk with futures—from a single, simplified interface. Q4: What blockchain is this built on, and why does it matter? The platform is built on Solana. Its high transaction speed and low fees are critical for providing a smooth, real-time experience when managing multiple, interdependent order types and market data feeds. Q5: Are prediction markets legal everywhere? No, the regulatory status of prediction markets varies significantly by country and region. Users are responsible for understanding and complying with the laws applicable to them. Backpack, as a regulated exchange, will likely enforce geoblocking in restricted jurisdictions.

The chairman thanked Senator Cory Booker for continued partnership on the legislation designed to provide regulatory frameworks for digital asset markets. NEW: After scrambling to meet the 5 PM deadline, Senators on the Banking Committee have submitted 137 amendments to last night’s text, according to multiple sources who have seen the list. Some of these will be debated during Thursday’s markup. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 14, 2026 Banking Lobby Secures Restrictions on Stablecoin Yield The latest Senate Banking Committee draft prohibits digital asset service providers from paying interest solely for holding payment stablecoin balances, marking a significant win for traditional banking groups. The provision allows rewards tied to specific activities, including transactions, wallet usage, loyalty programs, liquidity provision, collateral deposits, and participation in network governance. “ Banks may have won this round on stablecoin yield ,” Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett wrote , noting the draft states companies cannot pay interest just for holding balances. The language emerged after intense lobbying from banking groups who warned that yield-bearing stablecoins could drain deposits from community institutions. Coinbase told the crypto industry to “ stand down on opposing the stablecoin yield language for now, ” according to Decrypt Senior Writer Sander Lutz, citing a source with direct knowledge. The exchange characterized the provisions as “ the least favorable language they’d still support, ” with Lutz noting the company believes “ the loopholes are decent enough for yield on stablecoin activity/loyalty programs. “ Key update: Coinbase is telling the crypto industry to stand down on opposing the stablecoin yield language for now, a source with direct knowledge tells me.

Democratic Opposition Threatens Bipartisan Consensus Key Senate Democrats are demanding ethics guardrails that prohibit public officials, including the president, from profiting off crypto business ties, creating a potential deal-breaker for the legislation. Senator Adam Schiff said ethics controls covering the White House were essential, stating “ that needs to be applied to everyone .” Senator Ruben Gallego went further, calling it “ a red line ” and warning, “ They need to get it right, or they’re not going to have enough votes to pass this. ” Three Democratic senators sent a letter demanding a full hearing before Thursday’s markup, criticizing the release of legislative text “ just two days before the markup. “ Industry sources told Lutz that current vibes on the bill’s chances are “ NGMI ” due to ongoing disagreement over ethics language between Senate Democrats and the White House. If Democrats kill landmark legislation that would cement U.S. leadership in fintech- simply to score political points- they’ll have to explain that choice to voters in November. https://t.co/Q1F7jYEWDo — Bo Hines (@BoHines) January 13, 2026 Bo Hines of the Bitcoin Policy Institute warned that “ if Democrats kill landmark legislation that would cement U.S. leadership in fintech simply to score political points, they’ll have to explain that choice to voters in November. “ Industry Split on DeFi and Self-Custody Protections The Banking Committee added a massive new section on decentralized finance that the crypto lobby wasn’t expecting, prompting industry sources to express concern over definitions and murky language. Attorney Zack Shapiro’s detailed analysis noted the bill protects software developers while establishing compliance pressure on web-based user interfaces. “ The bill explicitly protects software developers and preserves the right to self-custody digital assets, ” according to the Senate Banking Committee GOP’s myth-versus-fact release. 1/23 Here's my full walk-through of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (HR 3633 substitute).

Consensys attorney Bill Hughes characterized the moment as potentially “ the best deal you could ever hope to get, ” arguing critics should “ hold your nose and accept ” the compromise. Paradigm VP Alexander Grieve also warned Congress might “ squander progress ” by restricting stablecoin rewards to merchant transactions, calling it “ a government-mandated windfall for financial intermediaries at the expense of individual Americans. “ As it stands now, the bill is progressing and Senator Cynthia Lummis has emphasized bipartisan contributions, stating, “ every section includes bipartisan input and I look forward to working with my Democratic colleagues to deliver a bill that secures America’s financial future. “ Proud of the bipartisan work that went into the Clarity Act. When we put politics aside and focus on what’s best for America’s economic future, we can achieve real progress.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-the-xrp-ledger-is-waking-up-big-time-heres-why/,"Recent data from the XRP Ledger indicates a notable shift in network behavior. For most of 2024 and much of 2025, AccountSet transactions remained few, showing only brief, isolated spikes. That pattern shifted late last year. A recent chart shared by crypto analyst Arthur (@XrpArthur) shows that AccountSet transactions have repeatedly exceeded 40,000 in a single day since November 2025. These levels stand among the highest recorded in years. XRPL IS WAKING UP BIG TIME! AccountSet transactions just went nuclear : multiple spikes hitting 40K+ in a single day, highest levels in years ! It's MASSIVE wallet setups, trust lines, institutional configs, AMM prep, RLUSD corridors & real adoption kicking in. Utility… pic.twitter.com/z2XOAq42ON — Arthur (@XrpArthur) January 12, 2026 Rising XRPL Activity AccountSet transactions configure wallets. They establish permissions, trust lines, flags, and operational settings. They typically occur before active usage, and sudden growth in this metric shows preparation across the network rather than speculative activity. Arthur described the move directly, stating that “AccountSet transactions just went nuclear.” He attributed the surge to a potential inflow of new users setting up wallets, trust lines, and institutional activity on the ledger. His list also included automated market maker activity , RLUSD corridors, and increased adoption. The timing and structure of the spikes support that interpretation. The activity arrived in waves across several weeks. The peaks clustered close together and persisted into January. This pattern suggests organized deployment rather than retail experimentation. Reading the Chart More Closely Earlier sections of the chart show a long, flat base. From late 2024 through mid-2025, daily AccountSet counts stayed low with limited follow-through. August 2025 marked the first expansion phase, with activity briefly climbing into the five-figure range before retracing. That move now resembles a precursor to recent activity. The decisive shift occurred in November. From that point forward, both peaks and baseline levels rose. Even on quieter days, activity stayed elevated relative to previous months. Supply Conditions and Positioning Arthur also noted tightening supply conditions , writing that “ETFs suck up supply & exchanges bleed dry.” While the chart does not track balances, the behavior fits institutional positioning. Entities preparing for sustained on-ledger use typically move assets off exchanges and configure wallets directly on the network. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s price has not yet reflected the intensity of this setup phase. That divergence creates interest. Network preparation often precedes price movement. Many market participants are waiting to see the impact of ETFs on the asset’s price, and these spikes may be a sign of things to come. What This Signals for XRP The sustained rise in AccountSet transactions indicates the network is entering an operational phase. Trust lines, AMMs, and regulated rails require deliberate setup. The chart reveals work is underway at scale. If this activity translates into usage, XRP’s role within the ledger ecosystem could expand meaningfully.

This collaboration, confirmed in early 2025, represents a significant evolution in how businesses and individuals will conduct cross-border transactions. The integration allows select enterprise clients to pre-fund payments using dollar-pegged digital currencies and send them directly to recipients’ digital wallets worldwide. Visa Stablecoin Remittance: The Technical Infrastructure Visa’s integration with BVNK’s payment infrastructure creates a hybrid system that bridges traditional finance with blockchain technology. Visa Direct, the company’s real-time push payments platform, now incorporates BVNK’s stablecoin settlement layer. This technical architecture enables businesses to convert fiat currency to stablecoins at the point of transaction initiation. Subsequently, the system processes these digital assets through BVNK’s regulated gateway before delivering funds to end-users’ digital wallets. The partnership specifically focuses on established stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and PayPal USD (PYUSD), which maintain 1:1 reserves with the U.S. dollar. This selection ensures regulatory compliance and price stability for both sending and receiving parties. Visa’s existing network of 15,000 financial institutions and 130 million merchant locations provides the distribution scale, while BVNK brings specialized blockchain settlement expertise. Business Applications and Real-World Impact The Visa-BVNK collaboration targets several specific use cases that demonstrate immediate practical value. First, multinational corporations can now disburse salaries to international contractors and remote employees with unprecedented speed and reduced costs. Traditional international wire transfers typically require 2-5 business days and incur substantial fees, whereas the new stablecoin integration promises near-instant settlement at a fraction of the cost. Second, the service revolutionizes overseas remittances, particularly for migrant workers sending funds to families in developing nations. The World Bank estimates that global remittance flows reached $860 billion in 2024, with an average cost of 6.2%. The Visa-BVNK solution potentially reduces these costs to below 2% while eliminating the typical 3-5 day waiting period. Third, gig economy platforms and content creator networks can implement real-time micropayments to global participants without traditional banking infrastructure. Regulatory Framework and Compliance Considerations Both companies have designed this integration within existing regulatory frameworks across major jurisdictions. Visa maintains its traditional anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols at the onboarding stage, while BVNK ensures blockchain transaction monitoring through chain analysis partnerships. The system operates under money transmitter licenses in relevant U.S. states and equivalent financial service authorizations in the European Union and United Kingdom. Notably, the partnership follows the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s 2024 guidance on bank engagement with stablecoins and the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation implementation. This regulatory alignment distinguishes the Visa-BVNK initiative from earlier cryptocurrency payment experiments that faced compliance challenges. The companies have also engaged with financial authorities in key remittance corridors including Philippines, India, Mexico, and Nigeria to ensure cross-border compliance. Market Context and Competitive Landscape The Visa-BVNK announcement arrives during a pivotal period for both traditional finance and digital assets. Several developments provide crucial context for understanding this partnership’s significance: Traditional Competitors: Mastercard launched its Multi-Token Network in 2023, while SWIFT completed blockchain interoperability experiments in 2024 Crypto-Native Solutions: Companies like Ripple and Stellar have processed billions in cross-border payments but lack Visa’s merchant acceptance network Market Timing: Stablecoin transaction volume surpassed $10 trillion in 2024, demonstrating mainstream adoption potential Infrastructure Readiness: 78% of central banks surveyed by the Bank for International Settlements now have digital currency projects underway This competitive landscape highlights Visa’s strategic positioning. Rather than building blockchain infrastructure internally, the partnership approach leverages BVNK’s specialized expertise while maintaining Visa’s core payment network advantages. The collaboration also represents a maturation from Visa’s earlier cryptocurrency card programs to a more fundamental integration of blockchain technology into payment rails. Technical Implementation and User Experience From a technical perspective, the integration maintains backward compatibility with existing Visa systems. Businesses using Visa Direct APIs can add stablecoin functionality with minimal code changes. The user experience varies slightly depending on the endpoint: User Type Experience Settlement Time Cost Advantage Business Sender Funds converted to stablecoin at initiation Near-instant 60-80% reduction vs. wire Individual Recipient Funds arrive in digital wallet automatically Seconds to minutes No receiving fees Banked Recipient Optional auto-conversion to local currency Same business day Better exchange rates The system incorporates multiple fail-safes, including automatic reversion to traditional settlement if blockchain congestion exceeds predetermined thresholds. This hybrid approach ensures reliability while offering blockchain efficiencies during normal operation. BVNK’s infrastructure handles the cryptocurrency settlement layer, while Visa manages the fiat on-ramps and off-ramps through its banking partnerships. Economic Implications and Future Developments The Visa-BVNK partnership carries significant implications for global financial inclusion and economic efficiency. International Monetary Fund research indicates that reducing remittance costs by just 2 percentage points could increase developing nation GDP by approximately $32 billion annually. Furthermore, the transparency of blockchain settlements potentially reduces fraud and improves audit trails for corporate treasury operations. Looking forward, both companies have outlined a roadmap for expanding the service. Phase two, scheduled for late 2025, will introduce support for additional stablecoins pegged to the Euro, British Pound, and Singapore Dollar. Phase three, planned for 2026, will incorporate central bank digital currency (CBDC) interoperability as various national digital currency projects reach maturity. This forward-looking approach positions the partnership to evolve alongside the broader digital asset ecosystem. The collaboration also establishes new technical standards for stablecoin payments. BVNK has committed to publishing interoperability specifications that other financial institutions can adopt, potentially creating a more unified ecosystem for digital asset payments. These standards address critical issues including transaction privacy, regulatory reporting, and cross-chain settlement finality. Conclusion The Visa stablecoin remittance service developed through the BVNK partnership represents a watershed moment for financial technology convergence. By integrating blockchain settlement with traditional payment networks, the collaboration offers tangible benefits in speed, cost, and accessibility for cross-border transactions. This initiative demonstrates how established financial institutions can leverage cryptocurrency innovations while maintaining regulatory compliance and system reliability. As the service expands through 2025 and beyond, it will likely accelerate the broader adoption of digital assets for everyday financial activities, potentially transforming how value moves globally. FAQs Q1: How does the Visa-BVNK stablecoin service differ from traditional international wire transfers? The service uses blockchain technology for settlement, reducing processing time from days to minutes and cutting costs by 60-80%. Unlike wire transfers that move through correspondent banks, stablecoin transactions settle directly on distributed networks. Q2: Which stablecoins does the Visa Direct integration support initially? The initial rollout supports USD Coin (USDC) and PayPal USD (PYUSD), both fully reserved dollar-pegged stablecoins. The companies plan to add Euro and Pound sterling stablecoins in late 2025. Q3: Can individuals receive stablecoin remittances without a cryptocurrency wallet? Yes, the system includes optional automatic conversion to local currency deposited directly to bank accounts. However, maintaining funds as stablecoins in digital wallets provides additional flexibility and potential cost savings. Q4: How does this partnership address regulatory concerns about cryptocurrency payments? Both companies maintain full compliance with financial regulations. Visa handles traditional KYC/AML requirements, while BVNK provides blockchain transaction monitoring. The system operates under appropriate money transmitter licenses in all served jurisdictions. Q5: What geographical regions will initially have access to the stablecoin remittance service? The service launches in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, and key remittance corridors including Philippines, India, Mexico, and Nigeria. Expansion to additional regions will follow based on regulatory approvals and market demand.

Those trends may be linked to asset appreciation or the expansion of on-chain activity. In 2026, six trends may shape the crypto market, encompassing multiple platforms and apps within the crypto space. The latest Cryptopolitan report details on-chain activity and what to expect in the coming year. While 2025 moved under speculative price action, on-chain activity decoupled from trading. The newly emerging apps and trends will remain the main drivers of adoption this year. Spot markets: on-chain liquidity closes the gap Spot activity converged between centralized and decentralized trading venues. The main driver of this trend is BNB Chain, which hosts new waves of tokens. The new year started with DEX trading making up 17.36% of centralized activity. The growing share of DEX activity is linked to several brands, like Binance, which combine CEX activity with a Web3 element. New tokens and memes can thus access liquidity easily, without being added to the centralized markets. Spot activity is also dependent on bots, which supply the necessary speed for short-lived asset pumps. Futures markets expand on perpetual DEX volumes A significant part of futures speculation moved onto decentralized markets. In 2026, those markets reached escape velocity and became staples in the crypto space. Derivative markets had a significant structural shift. DEX futures started out from just 4.9% of centralized markets and ended up at 17.49% of the total trading volume. Both retail and high-profile whales joined the perpetual futures DEX trend. In 2026, Hyperliquid, Aster, and other markets remain the main drivers of both general market trends and specific asset pumps. Traditional assets move on-chain In 2026, multiple tools have emerged for a crossover between traditional markets and crypto. With more developed trading and transaction infrastructure, platforms are scaling the tokenization of stocks. Real-world asset (RWA) tokens may replace some of the altcoins by offering more reliable intrinsic value. The tokenization trend also extended to centralized exchanges. Some of the markets are offering futures based on precious metals and stocks, utilizing their already liquid, regulated platforms for new markets. In 2026, the already adaptable crypto infrastructure is showing its ability to carry new types of crossovers between traditional finance and on-chain activity. Stablecoins expand on-chain roles Stablecoins not only expanded their supply but also diversified their on-chain roles. Circle’s USDC served regulated platforms and regions where dollar-backed tokens were required. USDT kept serving P2P markets, DeFi, and global exchanges. Stablecoin supply started 2026 with near-peak levels, in addition to growing on-chain activity and transfer volumes. | Source: Artemis . Stablecoin transfers still surpass VISA, as well as international remittances. The new year started with peak address activity for P2P payments and general transfers, moving up to $3.4T in reported volume per month. Stablecoin senders almost doubled to 2.3M addresses, with the biggest activity still happening on Ethereum. Prediction markets keep growing in mainstream adoption Prediction markets are setting new records in early 2026, after a peak year. After an initial activity slowdown, prediction markets opened new pairs and drew in both crypto natives and mainstream users. Polymarket and Kalshi remain the leaders, but other platforms are also showing significant demand for predictions. On-chain activity not only depends on direct bets, but also on oracle and voting activity for resolutions. Creator assets are emerging as a new class In a bid to generate value, crypto projects are turning to creators or prominent personalities. Creator tokens are emerging as a trend on Solana, but the original idea came from the Base chain. Creator, news meme tokens, and similar content-based assets vary widely in their trading lifecycle. Some of the creator tokens aim for longevity, while others are used to support creators and are often sold for profit or rug-pulled. The emergence of new types of memes shows the market continues to evolve, instead of stalling once the initial meme trends ended. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

ETH token rose to $3,340, and this trend may accelerate in the coming months as it has formed the highly bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, and the spot ETH ETF inflows have continued. Ethereum price technical analysis points to a surge The weekly timeframe chart shows that the ETH price tumbled to a low of $1.360 in April last year and then rebounded to a record high of $4,965 in August. It has now retreated and moved into a technical bear market as it moved to the current $3,335. A closer look shows that the coin has formed the highly bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. In this case, the head section was at $1,360, and it has just completed the formation of the right shoulder. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has started to point upwards and crossed the important neutral point at 50. The two lines of the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) indicator have also flat lined at the neutral level. There are also signs that the coin has invalidated the recently forming bearish flag chart pattern. Therefore, the most likely ETH price forecast is bullish as long as it remains above the right shoulder at $2,663. If this happens, the coin may rebound soon and hit the key resistance level at $4,000, followed by the all-time high of $4,965. ETH price chart | Source: TradingView ETH price has numerous bullish catalysts In addition to its strong technicals, the reality is that Ethereum has some of the best fundamentals in the crypto industry. First, data shows that American investors have started buying spot ETH ETFs this week. Spot Ethereum ETFs had over $129 million in inflows on Tuesday and $5 million a day before that. The funds have now had over $12.57 billion in cumulative inflows, with their total assets rising to nearly $20 billion. Second, Ethereum has continued to gain its market share across all areas in the crypto industry, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which most analysts believe is the future of finance. Ethereum has of $152 billion locked in its DeFi ecosystem and $473 billion in its bridged TVL. Its market dominance has jumped to 76%, even as new chains have been launched in the past few years. They include networks like Base, Berachain, Katana, and Monad. Ethereum has become the most popular chain for handling stablecoin transactions, with the volume rising to over $8 trillion in the last quarter. Its RWA ecosystem has also continued to boom, with top companies like Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan using its chain. Additionally, BitMine has continued to accumulate the token in the past few months. It has bought over 4 million tokens since July last year and is on track to hit its target of holding 6 million tokens over time. BitMine has a vote to increase the number of authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. This raises the possibility that the company will change its goalpost and decide to accumulate more Ethereum over time. There are also signs that Ethereum is undervalued. For example, it has a market capitalization to DeFi TVL ratio of 2.64, much lower than Solana’s 3.85 and BSC’s 3.85.

This analysis provides a structured, evidence-based Ethena price prediction for 2026 through 2030, examining the technical, fundamental, and macroeconomic factors that will determine if ENA can realistically cross the $2 threshold. Market data from Q1 2025 shows DeFi protocols with sustainable yield mechanisms gaining renewed investor attention. Ethena Price Prediction: Foundation and Current Market Context Ethena Labs launched its ENA token in April 2024 to govern its synthetic dollar protocol, USDe. This protocol aims to create a crypto-native, scalable money solution not reliant on traditional banking systems. Consequently, its price trajectory intertwines with the adoption of USDe and broader DeFi trends. According to on-chain analytics from Dune Analytics, USDe’s supply surpassed $2 billion in early 2025, demonstrating initial product-market fit. However, price predictions must account for protocol risks, competitor dynamics, and regulatory developments in the stablecoin sector. Market analysts consistently emphasize that token valuations derive from utility and revenue capture. Technical and On-Chain Analysis Framework Evaluating ENA’s potential requires a multi-faceted framework. First, protocol metrics like USDe supply growth, collateral quality, and yield reserves are critical. Second, tokenomics dictate that ENA facilitates governance and captures protocol fees. A report from blockchain research firm Delphi Digital in March 2025 noted that sustainable fee generation is a primary driver for long-term token value. Finally, broader market cycles heavily influence all crypto assets. Historical data indicates that altcoins like ENA often exhibit higher beta, meaning they amplify both upward and downward Bitcoin trends. ENA Price Trajectory: 2026-2027 Near-Term Forecast The 2026-2027 outlook hinges on Ethena’s execution against its roadmap and prevailing market conditions. Assuming successful integration of additional collateral types and expansion to new blockchain networks, demand for USDe could increase substantially. 2026 Scenario Analysis: A baseline scenario projects a trading range between $0.85 and $1.40. This assumes moderate DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) growth and no major regulatory setbacks for synthetic assets. 2027 Price Drivers: By 2027, the protocol’s fee-sharing mechanism with ENA stakers could become a significant value accrual model. If USDe establishes itself as a top-five stablecoin by market cap, ENA’s price could test resistance levels between $1.20 and $1.80. Conversely, challenges like smart contract vulnerabilities, unsustainable yield sources, or intense competition from other stablecoin projects could suppress price growth. Analysts from firms like Messari stress that protocol security and transparency reports will be paramount for investor confidence during this period. The Long-Term Vision: ENA Price Prediction for 2030 Projecting to 2030 involves assessing Ethena’s potential to become a foundational DeFi primitive. Long-term success would require USDe to be widely used as a trading pair, collateral asset, and savings instrument across the global crypto economy. ENA Price Prediction Summary (2026-2030) Year Conservative Forecast Moderate Forecast Optimistic Forecast Key Catalyst 2026 $0.70 – $1.10 $0.85 – $1.40 $1.00 – $1.70 USDe Multi-Chain Expansion 2027 $0.90 – $1.50 $1.20 – $1.80 $1.50 – $2.20 Institutional Adoption of USDe 2030 $1.50 – $2.50 $2.00 – $4.00 $3.00 – $6.00+ Global Scale as Money Market Asset The path to $2 and beyond appears most plausible in the 2027-2030 window under a moderate or optimistic scenario. It necessitates not just protocol success but a favorable macro environment for digital assets, including clear regulations and institutional capital inflows. The $2 level represents a significant psychological and technical barrier that would require a substantial increase in network utility and captured value. Expert Insights on Critical Risk Factors Industry experts uniformly highlight specific risks for any price prediction. For Ethena, the sustainability of the ‘Internet Bond’ yield is a primary concern. This yield relies on derivatives funding rates and staking rewards, which can fluctuate. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny of algorithmic and collateralized stablecoins is increasing globally. A research note from Kaiko in February 2025 concluded that protocols with robust risk management frameworks and transparent operations are better positioned to navigate these challenges. Therefore, ENA’s price will be a direct function of the market’s perception of Ethena’s risk management prowess. Conclusion This Ethena price prediction for 2026 to 2030 illustrates a path where the ENA token could challenge the $2 mark, particularly in the latter half of the decade. The analysis underscores that this target is not based on speculation but on the protocol’s ability to scale USDe securely, generate real yield, and withstand market cycles. While the $2 price level is achievable under a confluence of positive adoption, technical execution, and bullish macro trends, investors must weigh this potential against the inherent volatility and novel risks of synthetic dollar protocols. Ultimately, ENA’s long-term value will be dictated by its utility within the Ethena ecosystem and its success in redefining money on the blockchain. FAQs Q1: What is the main factor that could drive ENA price to $2? The primary driver would be massive, sustained adoption of Ethena’s USDe synthetic dollar as a core DeFi money market asset, leading to significant and sustainable fee revenue captured by the ENA token. Q2: How does Ethena’s ‘Internet Bond’ yield affect ENA’s price? The yield generated by the protocol’s reserves is a key value proposition. A stable and attractive yield boosts demand for USDe, increasing protocol fees. These fees can potentially be distributed to ENA stakers, creating a direct value accrual mechanism that supports the token price. Q3: What is the biggest risk to ENA’s price growth? The most significant risk is a failure in the protocol’s delta-hedging mechanism or a prolonged period of negative funding rates, which could undermine the stability of USDe and erode confidence in the entire ecosystem, negatively impacting ENA. Q4: Could broader crypto market conditions impact this Ethena price prediction? Absolutely. ENA, like most altcoins, is highly correlated with Bitcoin and general crypto market sentiment. A prolonged bear market would likely delay any price appreciation, while a strong bull market could accelerate growth beyond these projections. Q5: Is ENA’s token supply inflationary, and how does that affect the price? ENA has a fixed maximum supply, making it non-inflationary in the traditional sense. However, token unlocks and vesting schedules for investors and team members introduce periodic selling pressure that the market must absorb, which can affect short-to-medium-term price action.

Polkadot (DOT): Network Upgrades Drive Institutional Interest Polkadot maintains a market cap of $3.38–$3.46 billion, trading at $2.05–$2.09, with daily volume of $126–$135 million. Recent performance has been mixed, but consolidation near support levels signals potential for upward momentum. The network is preparing for Polkadot 2.0, featuring Async Backing, Agile Coretime, and Elastic Scaling for optimized developer adoption and blockspace efficiency. Institutional sentiment is cautiously bullish at ~84%, supported by Grayscale’s inclusion of DOT on its Q1 2026 consideration list. Tokenomics changes, including a 2.1B DOT supply cap starting March 2026, are designed to introduce scarcity, which may drive long-term demand. While price remains ~96% below ATH, active parachain growth and developer engagement indicate DOT’s ability to regain attention. For investors comparing early-stage presales, Polkadot offers measured upside, backed by network stability and institutional validation. Chainlink (LINK): Oracle Dominance and Cross-Chain Potential Chainlink commands a market cap of $9.33–$9.37 billion, trades at $13.18–$13.23, and has daily volumes of $346–$397 million. LINK continues to dominate oracle infrastructure, powering DeFi and real-world asset integrations. The Data Streams GA and CCIP expansions are enhancing low-latency cross-chain functionality and strengthening institutional adoption and enterprise trust. Whale activity is notable, with some accumulation seen amid minor sell-offs. Chainlink benefits from integrations with Nasdaq-CME, Swift, and BNY Mellon, as well as ETF momentum through Bitwise and Grayscale. Analysts see LINK trending toward $15–$25+ if adoption accelerates. For those watching top 100x crypto opportunities, Chainlink shows steady institutional-driven growth, but the exponential early-stage potential of APEMARS presents a starkly higher upside for early buyers.

Thi s wa s driven by a wave of institutional adoption that is blurring the lines between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized infrastructure. In 2025, several entities transitioned from small pilots to tokenizing financial assets, including Treasuries, corporate bonds, private credit, and commodities. A factor that helped push the total on-chain RWAs to $18.6 billion, according to Cryptopolitan analysts. Cryptopolitan noted in its “State of Onchain Activity” report that on-chain RWA activity increased by more than $13 billion in 2025, compared with $5.6 billion in 2024. Tokenized equities value increased 27x According to the report, tokenized equities drove impressive growth in RWAs, bringing traditional stocks and ETFs onto the blockchain. From $31.57 million in January last year, tokenized stocks soared to $858.43 million by December, a 27-fold increase in just 12 months. Platforms such as xStocks and Ondo Global Markets particularly fueled the surge, paving the way for actual equities on crypto rails. They provided investors 24/7 availability, fractional ownership, and near-instant settlement. Considering the explosive rise in RWAs and institutional adoption, some analysts believe the market could exceed $2 trillion by the year 2030. In early 2024, McKinsey analysts predicted the on-chain RWA value could rise to over $4 trillion under bullish conditions. Around the same time, Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock , also noted that more institutions would tokenize financial assets and soon every stock, every bond would be on one general ledger. Tokenization did not suddenly take off overnight. Early entrants, including TZERO and a few pioneers, began exploring blockchain-based securities, paving the way for the growth we see today. However, the sector truly took off when BlackRock launched its BUIDL fund on Ethereum, alongside Securitize, in March 2024. The fund’s value grew from $40 million at the fund’s inception to $1.8 billion on-chain as of the end of 2025. To date, BUIDL has expanded beyond Ethereum to encompass several networks, including BNB Chain and Aptos. The stablecoin market hit $300 billion in 2025 The Cryptopolitan report also reveals that RWAs were not the only assets recently experiencing exponential growth; stablecoins also saw a surge. In total, stablecoin capitalization increased from $216 billion to $306.4 billion, representing a $90 billion rise, or 42%, which indicates the ongoing demand for blockchain-based settlement assets. Moreover, stablecoins have achieved a 30-day average transaction volume of approximately $3.4 trillion, surpassing that of Visa, PayPal, and global remittances. Additionally, the number of daily stablecoin senders also jumped to 2.3 million from 1.2 million. Cryptopolitan analysts also found that stablecoins were being used more for payments and transfers in the year than for speculative trading. Timothy Massad, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, had cited the enactment of the GENIUS Act as a catalyst for market growth in stablecoins, arguing that the framework brought clarity. He remarked, “The passage of the GENIUS Act was quite important. That created a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins that we haven’t had.” However, stablecoins were already taking off among institutions before the GENIUS Act took effect. Stripe said in May that its platform would support stablecoin rails across more than 100 countries. In September, PayPal also added PYUSD support on the Tron and Avalanche networks.

This integration fundamentally changes how traders access leveraged derivatives markets. Consequently, users can now trade perpetual futures contracts for both cryptocurrencies and U.S. equities directly from their self-custody wallets. Importantly, this eliminates the traditional requirement to deposit assets onto a centralized exchange like Binance.com. The move represents a strategic pivot toward decentralized infrastructure while maintaining user familiarity with the Binance ecosystem. Binance Wallet Perpetual Futures: A Technical Breakdown The integration between Binance Wallet and ASTER creates a novel bridge between a widely-used custodial interface and a decentralized trading protocol. Perpetual futures, or ‘perps,’ are derivative contracts without an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. Traditionally, accessing these instruments required trusting a centralized exchange with funds. However, the ASTER integration enables a non-custodial approach. Users connect their Binance Wallet to the ASTER protocol. Then, they can execute trades where the contract and collateral management occur on-chain via smart contracts. This model offers distinct advantages. Primarily, it enhances security by allowing users to retain control of their private keys. Furthermore, it increases transparency as all transactions and liquidations are verifiable on the blockchain. The supported assets reportedly include major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, it covers synthetic representations of U.S. stocks, providing exposure to traditional markets. This dual-market access from a single, non-custodial interface is relatively uncommon in the current DeFi landscape. The Evolving Landscape of Decentralized Derivatives The Binance Wallet and ASTER collaboration arrives during a period of rapid growth for decentralized derivatives. Centralized exchanges have long dominated the futures market due to their liquidity and speed. However, concerns over fund custody, regulatory scrutiny, and transparency have fueled demand for decentralized alternatives. Perpetual DEXs (PerpDEXs) like ASTER, dYdX, and GMX have emerged to meet this demand. They use innovative mechanisms like virtual automated market makers (vAMMs) or peer-to-pool models to facilitate trading without centralized order books. ASTER’s specific architecture focuses on cross-margin capability and deep liquidity aggregation. The protocol’s integration with Binance Wallet is strategic. Binance Wallet serves as a gateway for millions of users already comfortable with the Binance brand. This lowers the entry barrier to decentralized trading. For context, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi derivatives protocols has seen consistent quarterly growth, indicating strong market interest. The following table compares key features of the new integration with traditional methods: Feature Traditional CEX Futures Binance Wallet + ASTER Asset Custody Held by exchange Held in user’s wallet Market Access Primarily crypto Crypto & synthetic stocks Transparency Opaque internal ledger On-chain, publicly verifiable Counterparty Risk Exchange itself Smart contract & protocol Expert Analysis on Market Impact and User Security Industry analysts view this integration as a logical step in Binance’s broader strategy. Following increased global regulatory pressure, major exchanges are diversifying their service models. Promoting non-custodial solutions through wallet integrations aligns with a philosophy of user empowerment and regulatory risk mitigation. A report from Delphi Digital in late 2024 highlighted the ‘wallet-as-a-gateway’ trend as a key growth vector for DeFi adoption. From a security perspective, the model shifts risk from exchange hacks to smart contract audits and user key management. ASTER’s contracts have undergone audits by reputable firms, a standard practice for established DeFi protocols. However, experts consistently warn users that decentralized trading does not eliminate risk. It merely changes its nature. Impermanent loss in liquidity pools, smart contract vulnerabilities, and the complexity of self-custody remain critical considerations. Therefore, the integration likely targets experienced traders comfortable with DeFi mechanics rather than complete novices. Operational Mechanics and User Workflow For a user, the trading workflow involves several clear steps. First, they must fund their Binance Wallet with supported assets on a compatible blockchain, such as BNB Smart Chain or Ethereum. Next, they navigate to the ASTER application through the wallet’s integrated dApp browser or by connecting the wallet to ASTER’s web interface. After connection, the user can select a market, choose leverage, and set order parameters. Upon execution, the smart contract locks the required collateral from the wallet and creates the position. Key operational features include: Cross-Margin Efficiency: Collateral in the wallet can be shared across multiple positions, optimizing capital use. Real-Time Oracle Pricing: ASTER relies on decentralized oracle networks for accurate, tamper-resistant price feeds to determine profits, losses, and liquidation triggers. Decentralized Liquidation: A network of keepers monitors positions and executes liquidations in a permissionless manner when health scores fall below threshold. This process contrasts sharply with centralized exchanges where all these functions occur off-chain within the exchange’s proprietary systems. Regulatory Considerations and Future Trajectory The offering of synthetic U.S. stock perpetuals introduces notable regulatory nuances. These instruments are typically price-tracking derivatives, not actual equity shares. They do not confer ownership or voting rights. Regulatory bodies like the SEC have previously scrutinized such synthetic products. The decentralized and non-custodial nature of the ASTER protocol may place it in a different jurisdictional category than a centralized entity offering similar products. However, the legal landscape remains fluid and varies significantly by region. Looking ahead, the success of this integration will depend on several factors: Liquidity Depth: Sufficient liquidity must develop on ASTER to ensure tight spreads and minimal slippage. User Education: Binance may need to provide extensive resources to guide users from custodial to non-custodial trading mindsets. Protocol Performance: The network must maintain uptime and handle volatility without congestion or excessive fees. If successful, this model could be replicated by other major wallet providers, accelerating the convergence of CeFi and DeFi. The long-term vision points toward a modular financial system where users choose custody and execution venues independently. Conclusion The integration of Binance Wallet with the ASTER perpetual futures exchange marks a pivotal moment for accessible decentralized derivatives trading. By enabling direct perpetual futures trading for both crypto and U.S. stocks from a self-custody wallet, it addresses growing demand for transparency and asset control. This move reflects broader industry trends toward modular, non-custodial financial primitives. While it introduces a different risk profile centered on smart contracts and self-management, it empowers users with direct market access. The evolution of the Binance Wallet perpetual futures capability through ASTER will be a key narrative to watch, potentially shaping how millions of users interact with leveraged markets in a decentralized future. FAQs Q1: What is the main advantage of trading perpetual futures through Binance Wallet and ASTER? The primary advantage is non-custodial trading. Users never deposit funds to a centralized exchange; instead, they trade directly from their self-controlled wallet using smart contracts, enhancing security and transparency. Q2: Do I need a Binance.com account to use this feature? No, you do not need a Binance.com exchange account. You only need the Binance Wallet application, which is a separate, non-custodial wallet product that can be used independently. Q3: What assets can I trade with this integration? The integration supports perpetual futures contracts for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as synthetic derivatives that track the price of U.S. stocks. Q4: How does liquidity work on a decentralized exchange like ASTER? ASTER typically uses a virtual Automated Market Maker (vAMM) model or a liquidity pool system. Liquidity is provided by other users who deposit assets into pools, and trades are executed against these pools algorithmically rather than via a traditional order book. Q5: Are there any specific risks with decentralized perpetual futures trading? Yes, risks differ from centralized exchanges. They include smart contract vulnerability risk, liquidity provider risk (like impermanent loss for LPs), reliance on oracles for pricing, and the user’s own responsibility for securing private keys. There is also no centralized customer support for disputes. Q6: How are liquidations handled on ASTER? Liquidations are performed in a decentralized manner. When a position’s margin ratio falls below a maintenance threshold, permissionless network participants called “keepers” can trigger a liquidation transaction to close the position, earning a fee in the process.

Additionally, the technical breakout level of the Dogecoin market is close to $0.14, which has appropriate speculation because of its meme value. Moving to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is at the current price of $0.04, it has an admirable growth trajectory which was born out of utility. Dogecoin: Hype vs Utility Presently, Dogecoin is trying to break through an inverted trend line. However, the value for this asset is still based on social media values and not any product development. At $250, it can be said that the amount that is going to be invested can be affected by changes in market prices and does not relate to any underlying assets or any product development. On that basis, MUTM, which is a new crypto of the Mutuum Finance DeFi platform, provides a genuine reason for the creation of value. Maximizing the $250 investment in the MUTM presale The simplest way to make some profits is through the presale on the Mutuum Finance platform. At the moment, the cost of one MUTM token in Phase 7 is $0.04. Using the maximum budget of $250, one can purchase 6,250 tokens. This will be the final opportunity to purchase the token at this rate since the price for Phase 8 will be higher, starting at $0.045, with the launch price set at $0.06. The earlier an investor buys the new crypto, the more profit they stand to see. It would therefore be safe to assume that the value of investment $250 would rise to $375 upon listing, which indicates a $125 profit prior to market trading. Analysts looking for which crypto to buy believe that market demand following listing might lead to increments in values to $0.10. In such a scenario, investment value $250 would rise to $625, a near 3x ROI. Earning Passive Yield through Peer-to-Contract Pools Mutuum Finance will enable passive income for investors when the platform is launched. However, this is not a feature on Dogecoin. Mutuum Finance makes use of Peer-to-Contract technology. Using the technology, users get to lock their USDT or another asset in a pool. When borrowers access the pool, lenders start earning interest. For example, if a user locks a sum of $1,000 in the pool bearing an annual return rate of 15%, the user shall receive $150 passive returns, and the Principal shall be retained with the user. This use case shall elevate MUTM from just a new crypto to a financial instrument and shall offer a benefit for use of the token. Security through a Proactive Bug Bounty Program With regard to contemporary threats, it has become the need of the day to build trust in a new cryptocurrency system. Mutuum Finance has reinforced this notion of trust by participating in a $50,000 bug bounty program. This bug bounty program pays researchers for discovering bugs before the mainnet launch and goes up to a maximum of $2,000 for critical bugs. Not only has it reduced threats of exploitation, but it has made safety a paramount element in this new initiative, which was originally unheard of in new initiatives such as this. There is also a $100,000 giveaway that will go to 10 MUTM presale investors. This is on top of a $500 daily reward bonus for the biggest investor of the day. These initiatives reward presale activity and presents Mutuum Finance as a serious project. Starting with an investment of $250, this project has given people the feeling of security and trust, which has not been experienced in other projects based on hyped markets with no actual innovation in them. One can invest in the upcoming DeFi project while Dogecoin investors get to see the breakout. Mutuum Finance has a proven product, a share of the revenues, and a comprehensive security audit. The presale is in Phase 7 at $0.04. The current timing is very opportune for new investments that could help transform a $250 investment into a major portfolio for investors asking which crypto to buy. The choice is to speculate or to grow.

The South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinone has announced a significant market decision, revealing plans to delist the Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA) token from its trading platform. This removal will officially occur at 6:00 a.m. UTC on February 13, 2025, marking another pivotal moment in the evolving regulatory landscape for gaming cryptocurrencies. Consequently, this decision directly impacts token holders and reflects broader exchange compliance trends. Coinone Announces MAVIA Delisting Details Coinone formally notified users about the MAVIA delisting through an official公告 on its website. The exchange specified that all MAVIA trading pairs will cease at the designated time. Furthermore, deposit services for the token halted earlier this week. Withdrawal functionality will remain available for a limited grace period after delisting. Typically, exchanges provide a two-week window for users to withdraw delisted assets. This standard procedure helps prevent user fund losses. Market analysts immediately observed a price reaction following the announcement. The MAVIA token experienced notable volatility across global exchanges. However, trading volumes on Coinone itself diminished rapidly. This pattern aligns with historical precedents where delisting announcements trigger short-term sell pressure. Importantly, the exchange cited internal policy reviews as the primary reason for the removal. Coinone regularly assesses all listed assets against updated criteria. Understanding the Heroes of Mavia Project Heroes of Mavia is a mobile-based play-to-earn strategy game built on the Ethereum blockchain. Skrice Studios, the development team, launched the game in early 2023. Players purchase and develop virtual land plots represented by MAVIA tokens. They then defend their territories to earn cryptocurrency rewards. The project gained initial traction during the last gaming crypto boom. Its native token facilitates all in-game transactions and governance. The project’s tokenomics involve a fixed maximum supply of 100 million MAVIA. A significant portion was allocated for game rewards and ecosystem development. Recently, however, user activity metrics have shown a gradual decline. Monthly active users decreased by approximately 40% throughout 2024. This reduced engagement potentially influenced exchange listing evaluations. Gaming tokens often face scrutiny based on sustained utility and user growth. Exchange Listing Criteria and Compliance Factors Major exchanges like Coinone employ rigorous listing frameworks. These frameworks typically evaluate several key areas. First, project development activity and GitHub commits receive scrutiny. Second, trading volume and liquidity metrics undergo analysis. Third, regulatory compliance and legal opinions are essential. Fourth, community size and social engagement factor into decisions. Finally, token distribution and concentration risks are assessed. South Korean exchanges operate under particularly strict regulations. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) mandates comprehensive due diligence. Exchanges must monitor listed assets continuously. They perform quarterly reviews against evolving standards. Projects failing to meet updated requirements face potential delisting. Recent amendments to the Virtual Asset User Protection Act have tightened these standards further. Consequently, exchanges are taking proactive compliance measures. Recent Major Crypto Delistings in South Korea (2024-2025) Exchange Token Date Primary Reason Cited Upbit FLOW Nov 2024 Regulatory concerns Bithumb KLAY Jan 2025 Low trading volume Coinone MAVIA Feb 2025 Policy review Korbit AXS Dec 2024 Project development issues Immediate Impact on MAVIA Token Holders Current MAVIA holders on Coinone must take specific actions before the deadline. First, they should cease any open buy or sell orders. Second, transferring tokens to a private wallet is advisable. Third, exploring alternative exchanges that still list MAVIA is crucial. Several international platforms continue supporting the token. However, users should verify withdrawal addresses carefully. Always use official contract addresses when moving assets. The delisting affects different holder groups uniquely. Retail investors face immediate liquidity reduction. Gaming enthusiasts need alternative on-ramps for in-game assets. Long-term holders might consider cold storage options. Importantly, the token remains tradeable on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Platforms like Uniswap and PancakeSwap offer MAVIA trading pairs. Yet, DEX trading involves different risks and fee structures. Withdrawal Deadline: Confirm the final withdrawal date from Coinone. Tax Implications: Consult a tax professional regarding disposal events. Market Alternatives: Research other centralized exchanges listing MAVIA. Project Communication: Monitor official Heroes of Mavia channels for updates. Broader Implications for Gaming Cryptocurrencies The MAVIA delisting reflects wider trends affecting gaming tokens. Regulatory bodies globally are scrutinizing play-to-earn models. South Korea specifically examines gambling-adjacent mechanics. Games offering financial rewards face additional compliance layers. The Game Rating and Administration Committee (GRAC) evaluates blockchain games differently. They consider user protection and financial risk factors extensively. Exchange delistings can create domino effects within niche sectors. Other gaming projects may undergo similar reviews soon. Consequently, developers are enhancing transparency and compliance efforts. Many now publish quarterly transparency reports voluntarily. They also engage more proactively with regulatory consultations. This evolving landscape requires continuous adaptation from all ecosystem participants. Historical Context of Crypto Delistings Delistings are common occurrences in cryptocurrency markets. Major exchanges routinely refresh their asset listings. For example, Binance delisted over 30 tokens in 2024 alone. These decisions often follow comprehensive project reviews. Typically, exchanges provide public explanations for removals. Common reasons include low liquidity, security concerns, or regulatory conflicts. Sometimes, projects voluntarily request delisting after strategic shifts. The South Korean market presents unique characteristics. Domestic exchanges prioritize local regulatory compliance above global trends. They often delist tokens before international counterparts. This conservative approach aims to protect Korean investors specifically. However, it sometimes creates arbitrage opportunities with global markets. Traders occasionally exploit price discrepancies during delisting periods. Conclusion Coinone’s decision to delist MAVIA underscores the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. The Heroes of Mavia token removal follows established exchange policy reviews. Affected holders have clear steps to secure their assets before the February 13 deadline. Moreover, this event highlights increasing regulatory scrutiny on gaming cryptocurrencies. As exchanges worldwide enhance compliance standards, similar delistings may occur across sectors. Ultimately, market participants must prioritize due diligence and adaptable portfolio management. The MAVIA delisting serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investments require continuous monitoring of exchange policies and regulatory developments. FAQs Q1: What should I do if I hold MAVIA on Coinone? Immediately stop trading MAVIA on Coinone and prepare to withdraw your tokens to a private wallet before the February 13 deadline. Confirm the exact withdrawal cutoff time through official Coinone announcements. Q2: Will MAVIA still be available on other exchanges? Yes, several international exchanges continue listing MAVIA. However, always verify the legitimacy of any exchange and check current listing status before depositing tokens. Q3: Why did Coinone decide to delist MAVIA? Coinone cited internal policy review as the reason. Exchanges regularly evaluate listed tokens against criteria including trading volume, project development, regulatory compliance, and market demand. Q4: Does this delisting affect the Heroes of Mavia game itself? The game continues operating independently. The delisting only affects trading on Coinone’s platform. Players can still use MAVIA within the game ecosystem and on other supporting exchanges. Q5: Are there tax implications from this delisting? Consult a qualified tax professional. Withdrawing tokens to a private wallet typically isn’t a taxable event, but selling or exchanging tokens might trigger capital gains taxes depending on your jurisdiction.

57153403,657575,1768383014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57153403.jpeg,Ripple Calls XRPL Permissioned Domains A ‘Gamechanger’ As Go-Live Nears,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-xrp-permissioned-domains-gamechanger/,"Ripple’s developer arm RippleX says the XRP Ledger’s “Permissioned Domains” amendment is nearing its activation threshold, positioning the network to roll out institution-friendly access controls that could underpin a permissioned version of XRPL’s native decentralized exchange. In a series of posts on X late Tuesday, RippleX framed Permissioned Domains as a “gamechanger” enabling layer for “permissioned flows” on a public blockchain, an approach aimed squarely at regulated firms that want on-chain settlement and trading without adopting fully private infrastructure. Ripple’s Next ‘Gamechanger’ For The XPR Ledger Via X, RippleX said : “The amendment for Permissioned Domains is nearing the threshold for activation.Ripple supports this feature, as well as the Permissioned DEX which this will ultimately enable. “ Under XRPL’s governance process, amendments become active after maintaining a 80% validator supermajority for a sustained period. According to xrpl.org, the PermissionedDEX is currently open for voting and has reached 50.00% thus far, while the PermissionedDomains amendment stands at 76.47%. RippleX describes the feature as a “game-changer for XRPL because they bring institutional-grade controls to a public network, without sacrificing the trade-offs of a private chain.” The company further writes: “While the Permissioned Domains amendment is an enabling feature, it sets the stage for financial institutions to engage in permissioned flows on a fast, scalable, and resilient blockchain network, the XRPL. The Permissioned DEX will enable permissioned trading flows, and the upcoming lending protocol may apply Permissioned Domains for controlled lending and borrowing flows.” On XRPL’s documentation, permissioned domains are described as controlled environments that “do nothing on their own,” but can be used by higher-level features, such as permissioned DEX functionality and lending protocols,to restrict and manage access for compliance-driven deployments. Permissioned DEXes are the practical endpoint: regulated entities participating in XRPL’s native order books while enforcing who can interact with specific markets. “Traditionally, any XRPL DEX offer can be matched by anyone. A permissioned DEX changes that,” Ripple wrote, describing permissioned trading as rules-based matching limited to approved participants. RippleX also points to adjacent roadmap items, including an upcoming lending protocol that could apply the same domain-based controls to borrowing and lending flows, suggesting the design pattern is intended to extend beyond trading into broader onchain finance primitives. The announcement drew immediate interest from XRP community voices. Popular community member Krippenreiter highlighted “on-chain FX” as a headline application, while Anodos Finance CEO Panos Mekras responded that “the only thing left is to bring the actual assets and liquidity to flow.” Krippenreiter agreed, calling for “more stablecoins, RWAs, and more market making.” We talked about this on the show @panosmek .

Corporate treasuries held by public and private firms rose from about 854,000 BTC to roughly 1.11 million BTC over the past six months, an increase of around 260,000 BTC — roughly 43,000 BTC per month. This adds close to $25 billion in value to corporate balance sheets and points to a growing appetite among firms for holding the coin, on-chain analytics provider Glassnode disclosed, Tuesday. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Watch $0.28 As Breakout Signals Stack Up Corporate Treasuries Swell A single firm dominates that pile. Strategy now controls the largest share of corporate Bitcoin, holding 687,410 BTC after a fresh buy earlier this month. The company disclosed it acquired 13,627 BTC between January 5 and January 11, its biggest purchase since last July. Reports have highlighted how this concentration means a few big buyers still shape the corporate treasury picture. Over the past 6 months, Bitcoin treasuries held by public and private companies have grown from ~854K BTC to ~1.11M BTC. That’s an increase of ~260K BTC, or roughly ~43K BTC per month, highlighting the steady expansion of corporate balance-sheet exposure to Bitcoin.… https://t.co/hHXjcSDDj4 pic.twitter.com/oluVGO2bGD — glassnode (@glassnode) January 13, 2026 Smaller, but still significant corporate holders are visible on the list. MARA Holdings, for example, holds about 53,250 BTC. That makes it one of the largest corporate holders after Strategy, and shows that miners and mining firms are also choosing to keep a chunk of the coin they create. ETF Demand Could Tighten Supply Exchange-traded funds are part of the story. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US pulled in more than $20 billion in flows during 2025, with some funds taking the largest share of those inflows. Analysts say ETF buying can soak up fresh supply and, if consistent, might remove available coins from the market for long periods. That dynamic has been flagged as one reason corporate accumulation could matter more now than in past cycles. Miners Are Producing Less Than Corporates Are Buying Over the same six months, miners are estimated to have created about 82,000 BTC. That means corporate buying has outpaced mining issuance by roughly three to one. In plain terms: more Bitcoin is being added to company balance sheets than is coming out of the ground, which tightens available supply if buyers continue to hold rather than sell.

Safe-haven interest has stayed firm amid geopolitical noise and questions about central bank policy, leaving prices supported but range-bound. Short-term moves will likely reflect both ETF flows and whether existing holders keep selling into demand.

57153524,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261411,1768383311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ripple Secures Pivotal EMI License Approval in Luxembourg, Expanding EU Crypto Payments",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ripple-emi-license-luxembourg-approval/,"BitcoinWorld Ripple Secures Pivotal EMI License Approval in Luxembourg, Expanding EU Crypto Payments LUXEMBOURG, 2025 – Ripple has achieved a significant regulatory milestone by securing preliminary approval for an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license from Luxembourg’s financial authorities, positioning the company to transform institutional payment services across the European Union with compliant stablecoin solutions. Ripple’s Strategic EMI License Breakthrough Financial authorities in Luxembourg granted Ripple preliminary approval for its Electronic Money Institution license application. This development, first reported by The Block, represents a calculated expansion of Ripple’s regulatory framework. Consequently, the company gains authorization to issue electronic money and provide payment services. Specifically, Ripple will now operate regulated stablecoin payment services for institutional clients throughout the European Union’s single market. Luxembourg’s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) oversees the approval process. The nation maintains a reputation as a progressive financial hub within Europe. Therefore, this decision signals growing regulatory acceptance of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, emphasized the strategic importance of this approval. “Luxembourg provides a robust regulatory gateway to the European Union,” Alderoty stated in an official announcement. “This preliminary approval underscores our commitment to operating within fully compliant frameworks globally.” The company plans to establish its European institutional services headquarters in Luxembourg City. This move aligns with the EU’s broader Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation implementation timeline. MiCA establishes comprehensive rules for crypto asset service providers across member states. Understanding Electronic Money Institution Licenses An Electronic Money Institution license represents a critical regulatory authorization within the European Economic Area. EMIs can issue electronic money, which includes digital representations of fiat currency stored electronically. Furthermore, licensed institutions provide payment services like transfers, withdrawals, and merchant acquiring. The European Union’s revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) governs EMI operations. Luxembourg’s CSSF maintains particularly stringent requirements for license applicants. Companies must demonstrate adequate capital reserves, robust anti-money laundering controls, and secure technological infrastructure. Several key distinctions separate EMIs from traditional banks and other financial entities: Scope of Services: EMIs focus specifically on electronic money issuance and payment services rather than full banking activities like lending Capital Requirements: EMI capital requirements typically range from €350,000, significantly lower than full banking licenses Passporting Rights: Luxembourg-issued EMI licenses enable operation across all EU member states without additional national approvals Supervisory Framework: EMIs operate under payment service regulations rather than comprehensive banking supervision Luxembourg’s Evolving Crypto Regulatory Landscape Luxembourg has systematically positioned itself as a cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdiction within Europe. The nation’s financial regulator approved the first EU-based cryptocurrency exchange-traded products in 2020. Additionally, Luxembourg hosts numerous blockchain companies and investment funds. The CSSF maintains a dedicated fintech innovation hub that guides companies through regulatory processes. This proactive approach attracts technology-driven financial services firms. Luxembourg’s existing financial infrastructure supports this technological transition effectively. The country already serves as a major center for traditional investment funds and banking services. Comparative analysis reveals Luxembourg’s strategic advantages for crypto firms: Jurisdiction EMI License Timeline Capital Requirements Passporting Rights Luxembourg 6-9 months average €350,000 minimum Full EU access Germany 8-12 months average €125,000-€730,000 Full EU access United Kingdom 12+ months average £50,000-£5,000,000+ Limited post-Brexit Malta 6-8 months average €730,000 minimum Full EU access Institutional Stablecoin Payment Services Expansion Ripple’s EMI license enables the company to provide regulated stablecoin payment services to institutional clients across Europe. These services will leverage Ripple’s existing blockchain infrastructure and liquidity solutions. Institutional clients include banks, payment providers, and corporate treasury departments. The services facilitate cross-border payments with enhanced speed and reduced costs. Stablecoins offer price stability compared to more volatile cryptocurrencies. Therefore, they serve as practical settlement assets for commercial transactions. The European Union’s payment infrastructure currently processes over €240 trillion annually. Traditional cross-border payments often experience delays and high fees. Blockchain-based solutions potentially reduce settlement times from days to seconds. Additionally, they can lower transaction costs by 40-80% according to Bank for International Settlements research. Ripple’s existing RippleNet already connects over 300 financial institutions globally. The EMI license allows expansion of these services with fully regulated euro-denominated stablecoins. This development coincides with increasing institutional adoption of digital assets for treasury management. Expert Analysis of Regulatory Implications Financial regulation experts view Ripple’s license approval as indicative of broader trends. Dr. Elena Schmidt, Professor of Digital Finance at the University of Luxembourg, explains the significance. “Luxembourg’s approval demonstrates regulatory maturity regarding blockchain payment systems,” Schmidt notes. “Authorities increasingly recognize that properly regulated crypto services enhance financial system efficiency rather than threaten it.” The approval follows Ripple’s previous regulatory achievements including Singapore’s Major Payment Institution license and numerous U.S. state money transmitter licenses. Industry analysts highlight several immediate impacts from this development: Market Validation: Regulatory approval lends credibility to blockchain-based payment systems Competitive Advantage: Ripple gains first-mover status among major crypto firms with EU EMI licenses Institutional Confidence: Regulated status encourages broader institutional adoption Standard Setting: Establishes compliance benchmarks for other blockchain payment providers Broader Context of Ripple’s Global Regulatory Strategy Ripple’s Luxembourg approval represents one component of a comprehensive global regulatory strategy. The company maintains over 30 money transmitter licenses across United States jurisdictions. Additionally, Ripple secured a Major Payment Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore in 2023. These regulatory achievements contrast with Ripple’s ongoing litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case concerns whether XRP constitutes a security under U.S. law. Recent court decisions have provided mixed rulings on different aspects of the case. Ripple’s regulatory approach focuses on jurisdictions with clear digital asset frameworks. The company prioritizes markets where authorities provide specific guidance for cryptocurrency businesses. This strategy reduces regulatory uncertainty for institutional clients. Consequently, financial institutions feel more comfortable integrating Ripple’s solutions. The European Union’s MiCA regulation, fully effective in 2025, creates uniform rules across member states. Luxembourg’s approval positions Ripple advantageously before MiCA’s complete implementation. Other blockchain payment providers will likely pursue similar regulatory pathways. Conclusion Ripple’s preliminary EMI license approval in Luxembourg marks a transformative development for institutional crypto payments in Europe. The authorization enables regulated stablecoin payment services across EU member states through Luxembourg’s regulatory passporting system. This achievement reflects both Ripple’s compliance-focused strategy and Luxembourg’s progressive approach to financial innovation. As the European Union implements comprehensive crypto regulations through MiCA, Ripple’s early regulatory positioning provides significant competitive advantages. The license approval ultimately facilitates more efficient, cost-effective cross-border payments for institutional clients while maintaining rigorous regulatory compliance standards. FAQs Q1: What exactly is an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license? An EMI license authorizes companies to issue electronic money and provide payment services within the European Economic Area. It represents a specific regulatory category under the EU’s Payment Services Directive, allowing digital representation and transfer of fiat currency. Q2: Why did Ripple choose Luxembourg for its EMI license application? Luxembourg offers several advantages including established financial infrastructure, progressive regulatory approach to fintech, efficient licensing processes, and full EU passporting rights that allow services across all member states from a single license. Q3: How does this license benefit Ripple’s institutional clients? The license enables Ripple to provide fully regulated stablecoin payment services with reduced transaction costs, faster settlement times, and enhanced compliance assurance for banks, payment providers, and corporate treasury departments operating in Europe. Q4: What distinguishes an EMI from a traditional bank? EMIs focus specifically on electronic money issuance and payment services rather than comprehensive banking activities like lending and deposit-taking. They operate under different capital requirements and supervisory frameworks tailored to payment services. Q5: How does this development relate to the EU’s MiCA regulation?

This strategic whale activity, meticulously tracked by on-chain analysts, provides a rare, transparent window into high-stakes digital asset strategy and its potential implications for the broader 2025 crypto market. Decoding the $177 Million Ethereum Whale Accumulation According to prominent on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, the anonymous address beginning with 0x46DB0 executed its latest transaction on February 13, 2025, withdrawing 2,000 ETH valued at approximately $6.65 million from the OKX exchange. This withdrawal represents the latest in a consistent series of acquisitions that began on December 5 of the previous year. Consequently, the entity has systematically removed a total of 53,451.6 Ether from centralized trading platforms, amassing a position worth $177 million at current valuations. Blockchain analytics firms like Nansen and Glassnode provide the tools to track these flows. They monitor exchange wallets and identify large transfers to private, non-custodial addresses. This specific pattern—sustained withdrawal from exchanges—strongly suggests a long-term holding strategy, often called ‘HODLing’ in crypto vernacular. Analysts calculate the whale’s average entry price at $3,125.13 per ETH. Therefore, given Ethereum’s current market price, the address sits on an estimated unrealized profit of $11.06 million. The Strategic Context of Major Crypto Withdrawals Large-scale withdrawals from exchanges carry significant weight in cryptocurrency market analysis. Primarily, moving assets off an exchange reduces immediate selling pressure. Assets held in self-custody wallets are less likely to be liquidated quickly during market volatility. This action often signals a shift from trading to long-term investment. Furthermore, it reflects growing confidence in personal security measures over exchange custody. Historically, periods of heavy exchange outflow have preceded major market rallies. For instance, similar accumulation patterns were observed among Bitcoin whales before its 2021 bull run. The current Ethereum accumulation occurs amidst key network developments. The successful completion of the Merge to Proof-of-Stake and ongoing scalability upgrades through layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism have fundamentally improved Ethereum’s investment thesis. This whale’s actions may be a direct response to these technological milestones. Expert Analysis of Whale Behavior and Market Impact Seasoned market observers interpret this activity through multiple lenses. Firstly, the scale and duration point towards institutional involvement rather than a retail investor. Entities capable of deploying $177 million methodically over weeks typically possess sophisticated treasury management strategies. They often accumulate during periods of relative price stability or consolidation to avoid moving the market against themselves. Secondly, the choice of Ethereum is particularly noteworthy. While Bitcoin is often viewed as ‘digital gold,’ Ethereum functions as the foundational layer for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless other applications. A bet of this size on ETH is implicitly a bet on the growth of the entire Web3 ecosystem. Analysts reference metrics like Net Exchange Flow, which tracks the difference between inflows and outflows. A sustained negative flow, as seen here, is a classic bullish indicator for asset prices. Understanding the Tools and Tactics of On-Chain Surveillance The very visibility of this transaction underscores the transparent nature of public blockchains. Anyone can audit the Ethereum ledger using a block explorer like Etherscan. Analysts like ai_9684xtpa use specialized software to parse this data, identify patterns, and cluster addresses. They track not just the movement of funds, but also interactions with smart contracts, which can reveal staking activity, DeFi participation, or NFT purchases. For example, if this whale address begins depositing ETH into a liquid staking protocol like Lido or a lending platform like Aave, it would signal an intent to generate yield on the holding. So far, the strategy appears purely accumulative. The table below summarizes the whale’s known activity: Metric Detail Total ETH Accumulated 53,451.6 ETH Total USD Value $177 Million Accumulation Period 40 Days (From Dec 5) Average Entry Price $3,125.13 Estimated Unrealized Profit $11.06 Million Primary Source OKX Exchange Withdrawals This transparency, however, exists alongside anonymity. The wallet owner’s identity remains unknown, which is a double-edged sword. It protects privacy but also means the market cannot ascertain if the entity is a hedge fund, a venture capital firm, a corporation, or a wealthy individual. The market must judge the action by its scale and consistency alone. Potential Implications for the 2025 Cryptocurrency Landscape The ramifications of such a sizable accumulation extend beyond a single wallet’s balance. Firstly, it reduces the liquid supply of ETH available on exchanges. A lower liquid supply can lead to increased price volatility, especially if buying demand rises. This dynamic can create a bullish feedback loop. Secondly, it may influence market sentiment. Retail and institutional investors often monitor whale wallets as a form of ‘smart money’ indicator. Key factors to watch next include: Price Reaction: Will Ethereum’s price break key resistance levels following this news? Imitative Behavior: Will other large holders follow suit and withdraw from exchanges? Whale’s Next Move: Will the address stake its ETH, use it in DeFi, or simply hold? Exchange Reserves: Monitoring overall ETH balances on all major exchanges for broader trends. Ultimately, this event highlights the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. Large, strategic capital allocations are now planned and executed with precision, tracked in real-time by a global audience, and analyzed for deeper macroeconomic signals. It moves the narrative away from pure speculation and towards fundamental, long-term value accumulation based on network utility. Conclusion The stunning $177 million Ethereum whale accumulation over 40 days stands as a definitive case study in modern crypto investment strategy. It demonstrates how transparent blockchain data provides unparalleled insight into high-level market moves. This activity, characterized by sustained exchange withdrawals, strongly suggests a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum’s fundamentals from a major capital holder. For the broader market, it serves as a powerful data point, emphasizing the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s role as the cornerstone of the decentralized web. As the 2025 landscape evolves, the market will closely watch whether this whale’s profound bet catalyzes a wider shift in investment sentiment and ETH market dynamics. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a ‘whale’ withdraws crypto from an exchange? A1: Withdrawing assets from an exchange to a private wallet typically signals a long-term holding strategy. It reduces immediate selling pressure on the market, as the coins are moved from a trading venue to secure storage, indicating the holder does not plan to sell in the short term. Q2: How do analysts track and identify whale wallets? A2: Analysts use blockchain explorers and specialized analytics platforms to monitor large transactions from known exchange wallets. They track patterns, cluster addresses potentially owned by the same entity, and use metrics like Net Exchange Flow to identify accumulation trends. Q3: Could this large Ethereum accumulation manipulate the market price? A3: While a $177 million purchase spread over 40 days is significant, it is unlikely to single-handedly manipulate Ethereum’s ~$400 billion market cap. However, it can influence sentiment and contribute to reducing liquid supply, which can exacerbate price moves driven by broader market demand. Q4: What is the difference between an unrealized and a realized profit in crypto? A4: An unrealized profit is a paper gain based on the current market price versus the purchase price. The profit is only realized when the asset is actually sold for fiat currency or another asset. The whale’s $11.06 million profit is currently unrealized. Q5: Why is the whale’s anonymity important? A5: Anonymity is a core principle for many cryptocurrency users. It protects the holder from targeted attacks, regulatory scrutiny before necessary, and market speculation based on identity rather than on-chain actions. The market evaluates the transaction on its own merits.

The survey also found that nearly one-third (~32%) of advisors invested in crypto for clients in 2025, a 10% increase from the previous year. The eighth annual “Bitwise/VettaFi 2026 Benchmark Survey of Financial Advisor Attitudes Toward Crypto Assets” report, released today, found that allocation size within portfolios is also growing. Roughly 64% of client portfolios with crypto exposure had allocations greater than 2%, a massive uptick from 2024’s 51%. More professional financial advisors also own cryptocurrency than ever before, with approximately 56% reporting that they hold cryptocurrency in their personal portfolios. That marked the highest level of advisor crypto ownership since the survey kicked off in 2018. Meanwhile, institutional access is surging, with 42% of financial advisors reporting that they can buy crypto in their clients’ accounts. That also marked a huge increase from 2024’s 35% and 19% in 2023.

The Bitwise/VettaFi report also stated that 2025 was momentous for crypto, with Bitcoin hitting a new ATH (~$126K) and many other cryptos rallying as well. Financial Advisors were responsible for stewarding trillions of dollars in wealth last year. Meanwhile, Hougan believes the future of crypto will soon become almost entirely dependent on what financial advisors think of it. He noted that people who have wondered what advisors would do if the crypto market hit a patch of volatility have their answer: They are planning to buy more. “As crypto moves farther into the mainstream, we’re excited to see surging interest and enthusiasm from a demographic that has always played a central role in crypto’s future.” – Matt Hougan , the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research and editorial at TMX VettaFi, also observed that the strong demand for crypto-related ETFs in 2025 was easily evident, adding that what happens next is less obvious. Advisors are sharing about how they and their clients are increasingly allocating to crypto, according to Rosenbluth. Advisors overwhelmingly prefer crypto equity ETFs The Bitwise/VettaFi report found that advisors overwhelmingly prefer crypto equity ETFs. showing they are most interested in allocating to crypto equity ETFs in 2026. Advisors also prefer crypto index funds (42%) to single-token funds. Meanwhile, advisors are increasingly sourcing their crypto allocations from equities (43%) or cash (35%). Stablecoins and tokenization have also piqued the interest of advisors (30%), followed by digital gold/fiat debasement (22%), and crypto-related AI investments (19%). On the other hand, independent registered investment advisors (IRAs) represented the largest number of respondents (46%), followed by independent broker-dealer representatives (25%), financial planners (16%), wirehouse representatives (7%), institutional investors (3%), and other investment professionals (3%). Meanwhile, “Other” financial professionals were the most likely to own crypto in their personal portfolios at 89%, followed by institutional investors (75%), RIAs (50%), financial planners (45%), and independent broker-dealers (41%). Crypto also remained at the top of investors’ minds in 2025, with 94% of advisors reporting that they received crypto-related questions from their clients last year. That percentage was slightly lower than 2024’s 96%, but an increase from 88% in 2023 and 90% in 2022. Meanwhile, the report noted that it has become more important than ever for advisors to be well-equipped to answer crypto-related client questions. Overall, the survey results also indicate that institutional crypto adoption is on the rise, and allocation sizing within investor portfolios has continued to grow as crypto assets move into the mainstream.

The Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) officially pulled the plug on internet access at 6:00 p.m. local time on Tuesday, just two days before voters head to the polls. This is the third consecutive election cycle where authorities have disabled online access, a move officials claim helps curb misinformation during politically sensitive periods. Uganda’s history of election-period shutdowns stretches back nearly a decade. In 2016 and again in 2021, President Yoweri Museveni’s government enacted multi-day internet blackouts during elections, citing national security and public order. But for many Ugandans, the blackout is seen less as a protective measure and more as an attempt to obscure electoral processes. Critics argue the absence of connectivity undermines transparency and stifles the ability of voters and poll watchers to communicate and share real-time results. Bitchat secures No. 1 spot on app stores Against this backdrop, Bitchat has soared to the top of Uganda’s app store rankings on both the Apple App Store and Google Play. (See below.) Bitchat ranking on the Apple App Store. Source: Appfigures. The encrypted messaging platform, launched by Jack Dorsey in 2025 , is built to function without internet access, relying instead on a Bluetooth mesh network where each device relays messages to others nearby. This peer-to-peer infrastructure has made it particularly useful in blackout zones, where conventional messaging apps fail. Bitchat’s popularity in Uganda began building in late December after opposition candidate Bobi Wine publicly urged his supporters to install the app in preparation for a possible communications clampdown. Data posted by Bitchat developer Calle on Jan. 5 indicated over 400,000 downloads in Uganda alone, a number that has likely grown further following Tuesday’s shutdown. calle @callebtc · Follow I was about to celebrate 1M bitchat android downloads but uganda’s opposition leader bobi wine jinxed it ✊ 1:57 PM · Jan 5, 2026 604 Reply Copy link Read 40 replies The UCC’s executive director, Nyombi Thembo, had previously assured the public that there would be no internet disruptions. “Why would you use Bitchat when there is internet, internet will be there,” he stated last week. He also dismissed the app as inconsequential and claimed the government possessed the technical capacity to disable it. “We know how it can be made not to work. Don’t be excited by Bitchat, it’s a small thing,” Thembo said. However, Bitchat’s open-source contributors disputed those claims, arguing that Bitchat’s decentralised design, which lacks central servers or user accounts, makes it difficult to shut down or censor. Using the app requires no SIM cards, phone numbers, or emails to operate, and includes features like panic wipes and traffic obfuscation to safeguard user privacy during volatile conditions. Bitchat’s role as a tool against censorship Bitchat’s emergence in Uganda mirrors its role in several other countries that have experienced civil unrest or infrastructure failures. During the Nepal protests last year , the app became a digital lifeline after social media platforms were restricted by the government. Within just days, daily downloads surged from a few thousand to nearly 50,000, helping organisers coordinate marches and share information. Similar waves of adoption were seen in Madagascar during political protests, and in Indonesia, where demonstrators turned to the app to maintain anonymity and evade surveillance. Most recently, during Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean, Bitchat saw widespread use in Jamaica as wind damage knocked out cellular and internet infrastructure.

The legislation targets a specific provision that would exempt DOGE from securities laws based on its existing exchange-traded fund presence. The proposal centers on a straightforward mechanism. Any cryptocurrency with an ETF trading on a major exchange before January 1 would automatically receive ”non-ancillary asset” classification. This designation removes the asset from SEC securities oversight and registration mandates. Dogecoin meets this criterion. The bill's passage would create an immediate pathway for expanded institutional investment and retail access, without the compliance burdens that other digital assets face. Regulatory Framework Changes The legislation establishes a clear dividing line in crypto regulation. Projects without pre-existing ETF products remain subject to traditional securities law scrutiny. Those meeting the January 1 threshold gain blanket exemption from these requirements. This structure eliminates ambiguity for market participants. Exchanges can list Dogecoin products without fear of enforcement action. Asset managers gain certainty when developing new financial instruments tied to DOGE. The approach differs sharply from current SEC policy. The agency has maintained that most cryptocurrencies function as securities under existing law. This bill would override that position for qualifying assets through legislative action. Industry observers note the narrow scope. Only a handful of cryptocurrencies operated ETF products before the cutoff date. The bill does not establish broader standards for determining which digital assets escape securities classification. Market Implications and Timeline Multiple asset management firms withdrew Dogecoin ETF applications in recent months due to regulatory uncertainty. The pending legislation would allow these companies to resubmit filings with reduced legal risk. Coinbase and other major platforms have limited their Dogecoin offerings in some jurisdictions. Securities law concerns prompted these restrictions. The bill's passage would remove this constraint entirely. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.1484 following a 6.25% surge in the last 24 hours.

These aren’t just virtual worlds or games. They are entire digital ecosystems where people communicate, create, trade, invest, and earn. The term “metaverse” is now applied to a multitude of projects with different goals, technologies, and economic models. Some well-known platforms have already become brands, attracting brands, investors, and communities. Others are at an earlier stage of development. But they all share one common goal: to create a space for the digital economy, creativity, and interaction. Decentraland и The Sandbox Decentraland is one of the most well-known Web3 projects. It is an open virtual world where participants purchase land, build properties, and trade assets on the blockchain. In this world, all possessions and items are represented by NFTs (non-fungible tokens). The Sandbox is similar in concept: it’s a platform focused on creativity and economic activity. Players create their own worlds, host gaming activities, and sell digital goods. Well-known brands like Gucci have already opened themed platforms in The Sandbox , combining virtual exhibitions, game mechanics, and social interaction. Both platforms utilize blockchain and cryptotokens. Ownership of assets provides property rights, enabling the creation of markets for virtual land, items, and services. Horizon Worlds, Roblox и Rec Room Horizon Worlds — a project by Meta. It’s focused more on social interaction and creating personal spaces without the need to own cryptocurrencies. Users create avatars, communicate in virtual rooms, participate in events, and upload their own content. Roblox and Rec Room represent a different approach. These are platforms where thousands of creators create worlds and games. While not always related to crypto technologies, they demonstrate how mass virtual activity can be organized around creativity and interaction. Web3 Elements, Economy, and Game Worlds Games with blockchain elements, like those listed on Reddit (e.g., Axie Infinity, Illuvium, Upland, and others), combine gameplay with a digital economy. In these projects, players earn tokens and items for achievements, which can then be used or traded. These mechanics are called “play-to-earn” or “mine-to-earn.” These models are inspired by the idea that virtual worlds can create real economic value. This is confirmed by research and examples of the use of metaverses for commercial purposes (for example, as shown in the analysis from Shopify , which lists various ways to make money in the metaverse: from virtual real estate to selling digital products and services). The metaverse could become a business space, not just a gaming world. Padma.ooo – A New Look at the Metaverse Against the backdrop of all these projects, Padma.ooo — an ecosystem built around Web3 economies with their own token, mining, DAO governance, and a community of creators. Padma is positioned not just as a virtual world or a social platform, but as a full-fledged digital economic mechanism with the possibility of earnings for active participants . Here are the Key benefits of Padma.ooo , which stand out among other metaverses: 1. Own economic system Padma has its own token, PAD, which is mined within the ecosystem. It can be viewed in real time on an analytical panel, which allows participants to track the dynamics of the economy. 2. DAO-management Each token holder participates in the project’s governance through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Users can propose changes, vote, and decide strategic issues related to Padma’s development. 3. Active community and launch The project is actively developing its community, organizing meetups, Zoom sessions, and discussions about future plans. This creates an atmosphere of participation and direct interaction with the developers. 4. Game and mining mechanics Padma combines elements of token mining, in-game resources, and a game economy. This allows participants to earn tokens as a result of their activity and participation in the ecosystem. For example: binary auctions and rates on political events. 5. Padma Bank The ability to combine digital finance with traditional paymentsFast exchange of any currency. Padma also offers a card for its members, allowing them to travel and make payments anywhere in the world. 6. Transparency and analytics The platform provides transparent data on tokenomics, mining, and asset distribution. This can be useful for participants who want to understand how the system is developing. General trends and significance of metaverses The unifying theme across all platforms is the creation of an active digital space. It may include: social interactions, economic mechanisms, creation of digital assets, user participation in development, integration of brands and external services. Such properties are discussed as part of a general trend toward metaverses, from industrial analysts to digital technology specialists. The point is that these worlds are becoming not just entertainment but also part of the future digital economy. Conclusion Metaverses exist in a wide variety of forms. Some are focused on creativity and social interaction. Others focus on economics and digital property. Many combine elements of interaction, business, and entertainment. Against this background, Padma.ooo demonstrates an integrated approach , combining the capabilities of tokenization, DAO governance, mining, and active community participation. It offers not just a virtual world, but an economic platform where users can earn, participate, and shape their own digital economy. This makes Padma a great example of how the metaverse can work.

Exciting news: we're powering stablecoin payments for @Visa Direct Starting this year with pilot programs, BVNK will provide stablecoin infrastructure for @VISADIRECT 's $1.7 trillion real-time payments network, enabling faster, more flexible global money movement. pic.twitter.com/0SxgIRrhof — BVNK (@BVNKFinance) January 14, 2026 The partnership will allow Visa Direct customers to unlock new options for cross-border payments by using stablecoins alongside traditional fiat rails and expanding flexibility for businesses and end users alike. Expanding Visa Direct with Stablecoins Visa Direct is a real-time money network that processes around $1.7 trillion in volume annually allowing payouts to cards, bank accounts and digital wallets. Under the new partnership BVNK will provide the stablecoin infrastructure that allows some business customers to pre-fund Visa Direct payouts using stablecoins rather than relying solely on fiat currencies. The integration will also support payouts to end recipients directly in stablecoins placing digital dollars into users’ wallets. This opens the door to faster settlement 24/7 availability and reduced reliance on traditional banking hours especially for cross-border and treasury use cases. BVNK said it processes more than $30 billion in stablecoin payments annually and will initially support Visa Direct’s stablecoin services in approved markets with strong demand for digital asset-based payments. Building on an Existing Relationship The announcement represents the next phase of a deepening relationship between Visa and BVNK. Visa Ventures invested in BVNK in May 2025. The firm said the partnership is part of Visa’s broader strategy to explore how stablecoins can modernise money movement complementing existing rails rather than replacing them. Stablecoins as a Payments Infrastructure Layer Mark Nelsen, Global Head of Product for Commercial and Money Movement Solutions at Visa, said stablecoins present an opportunity to reduce friction in global payments and expand access to faster and more efficient settlement. He highlights their usefulness during weekends, holidays and periods when traditional banks are closed, positioning stablecoins as a practical enhancement to existing payment networks. BVNK chief executive Jesse Hemson-Struthers describes stablecoins not just as a new payment method but as a foundational layer of modern payments infrastructure. By integrating stablecoins directly into Visa’s network the partnership aims to give businesses and consumers more control over how and when funds are sent and received. Phased Rollout and Global Ambitions The rollout will begin in select markets where demand for digital asset payments is already strong, with plans to expand more broadly based on customer needs and regulatory considerations. For businesses the integration promises greater choice in treasury management, cross-border payouts and liquidity options, while maintaining the reliability and trust associated with Visa’s global network.

Market analysts observed these divergent movements with keen interest, particularly noting the implications for international trade and monetary policy coordination. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, hovered around 104.50 after dropping from recent highs near 105.80. Meanwhile, the yen weakened past 158 against the dollar, approaching levels that previously triggered intervention concerns from Japanese authorities. These currency fluctuations reflect complex interactions between central bank policies, economic data releases, and shifting investor sentiment across global financial markets. Dollar Stabilization: Technical and Fundamental Factors The US dollar’s stabilization followed several weeks of gradual depreciation against major counterparts. Market participants attributed this shift to multiple converging factors. First, recent Federal Reserve communications suggested a more cautious approach to interest rate adjustments. Second, stronger-than-expected retail sales data provided fundamental support for the currency. Third, technical indicators showed the dollar approaching significant support levels that historically prompted buying interest. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent testimony before Congress emphasized data-dependent policy decisions, creating uncertainty about the timing of potential rate cuts. Consequently, traders reduced their aggressive short-dollar positions, allowing the currency to consolidate. The dollar’s relative strength against emerging market currencies remained particularly notable, reflecting ongoing capital flows toward perceived safe-haven assets during periods of global uncertainty. Comparative Central Bank Policies Central bank policy divergence continues to drive currency market dynamics. The Federal Reserve maintains its benchmark rate at 5.25%-5.50%, while the Bank of Japan keeps its policy rate near zero. This substantial interest rate differential, exceeding 500 basis points, creates powerful incentives for carry trade strategies. Investors borrow yen at ultra-low rates to purchase higher-yielding dollar assets, generating persistent selling pressure on the Japanese currency. European Central Bank officials have signaled potential rate cuts in coming months, potentially narrowing the policy gap with the United States. Bank of England policymakers similarly debate the appropriate timing for monetary easing. These policy trajectories influence currency valuations through capital flow patterns and relative yield attractiveness. Market participants closely monitor central bank communications for clues about future policy adjustments. Yen’s Persistent Weakness: Structural Challenges The Japanese yen’s continued depreciation reflects deep structural factors beyond temporary market fluctuations. Japan’s trade balance shifted to deficit in recent years, reducing natural demand for yen from export transactions. Additionally, Japanese investors increasingly allocate capital overseas seeking higher returns, creating consistent yen-selling pressure. The country’s aging population and high public debt levels further constrain policy options. Japanese authorities face difficult choices between supporting economic growth through accommodative policies and defending currency stability through intervention or policy normalization. Finance Ministry officials previously intervened in currency markets when the yen approached 160 against the dollar, spending approximately $60 billion to support the currency. Market participants now watch for similar intervention thresholds, though effectiveness remains debated among analysts. The yen’s weakness provides short-term benefits for Japanese exporters but raises import costs significantly, particularly for energy and food commodities priced in dollars. Recent Currency Performance Against USD Currency Current Level Weekly Change Monthly Change Japanese Yen (JPY) 158.20 -1.8% -4.2% Euro (EUR) 1.0850 +0.3% +1.2% British Pound (GBP) 1.2750 +0.5% +1.8% Swiss Franc (CHF) 0.8950 -0.2% -0.8% Global Economic Implications Currency movements create significant ripple effects across global economies. A stabilizing dollar provides relief to emerging markets burdened by dollar-denominated debt. Many developing nations borrowed extensively in US dollars during periods of low rates, creating repayment challenges as the dollar strengthened. Yen weakness affects regional Asian economies through trade competition and tourism patterns. South Korean and Taiwanese exporters face intensified competition from Japanese counterparts benefiting from favorable exchange rates. European manufacturers similarly monitor currency impacts on competitiveness. Tourism flows show notable shifts, with Japan becoming more affordable for international visitors while Japanese travelers reduce overseas spending. These economic interconnections demonstrate how currency fluctuations transmit effects across borders through multiple channels including trade, investment, and consumption patterns. Market Reactions and Trading Patterns Foreign exchange markets exhibited characteristic responses to these currency developments. Trading volumes increased during Asian and European overlap sessions as yen crosses attracted heightened attention. Options markets showed rising demand for protection against extreme yen movements, with implied volatility increasing for longer-dated contracts. Hedge funds and institutional investors adjusted positioning based on evolving policy expectations. Retail traders demonstrated caution amid elevated volatility, reducing leverage in currency pairs involving the yen. Market liquidity remained adequate despite the pronounced moves, though bid-ask spreads widened temporarily during periods of rapid price action. Regulatory authorities monitored trading patterns for signs of disorderly conditions that might warrant official commentary or intervention. The overall market structure proved resilient despite the significant currency adjustments occurring across major pairs. Historical Context and Comparisons Current currency patterns show similarities and differences with historical precedents. The yen’s weakness recalls the mid-1990s period when the currency approached 160 against the dollar before substantial intervention. However, current economic fundamentals differ significantly, with Japan facing demographic challenges absent decades ago. The dollar’s stabilization resembles patterns observed during 2018-2019 when the currency consolidated after Federal Reserve policy shifts. Important distinctions include today’s higher global debt levels and different inflation dynamics. Analysts examine these historical parallels while recognizing unique contemporary factors. Previous currency cycles provide valuable lessons about intervention effectiveness, market psychology, and policy coordination challenges. The Plaza Accord of 1985 and Louvre Accord of 1987 demonstrated both possibilities and limitations of coordinated currency management among major economies. Expert Analysis and Forward Projections Financial institutions published varied assessments of currency outlooks. Goldman Sachs analysts suggested the dollar might resume strengthening if US economic data continues outperforming peers. Morgan Stanley researchers highlighted risks of yen intervention around the 160 level. JPMorgan economists noted that currency adjustments typically precede broader economic rebalancing. Independent analysts emphasized several key factors to monitor: US inflation data: Upcoming CPI releases will influence Federal Reserve policy expectations Japanese wage growth: Spring wage negotiations outcomes affect Bank of Japan policy normalization prospects Geopolitical developments: Regional tensions and global conflicts impact safe-haven currency flows Commodity prices: Oil and natural gas prices significantly affect trade balances and currency valuations Most projections anticipate continued volatility with potential for policy responses if movements become disorderly. The International Monetary Fund recently noted that flexible exchange rates provide valuable adjustment mechanisms but can also transmit volatility across borders. Bilateral and multilateral consultations among finance officials reportedly increased ahead of upcoming G7 and G20 meetings. Conclusion The contrasting trajectories of the US dollar and Japanese yen highlight complex dynamics in global currency markets. The dollar stabilizes as markets reassess Federal Reserve policy expectations amid mixed economic signals. Meanwhile, the yen continues weakening due to structural factors and substantial interest rate differentials. These currency movements create significant implications for international trade, investment flows, and economic policy decisions. Market participants monitor developments closely, particularly watching for potential Japanese intervention around key psychological levels. The evolving situation demonstrates how currency markets reflect and transmit economic forces across borders, requiring careful analysis of both technical factors and fundamental drivers. As global economic conditions continue evolving, currency adjustments will remain crucial mechanisms for balancing international competitiveness and financial stability. FAQs Q1: Why is the Japanese yen continuing to weaken against the dollar? The yen weakens primarily due to substantial interest rate differentials between Japan and the United States, with the Bank of Japan maintaining ultra-low rates while the Federal Reserve keeps rates elevated. Structural factors including Japan’s trade deficits and overseas investment outflows contribute additional downward pressure. Q2: What factors contributed to the US dollar’s stabilization? The dollar stabilized due to reassessed Federal Reserve policy expectations, stronger US economic data, technical support levels, and reduced speculative positioning. Market participants adjusted forecasts for interest rate cuts, providing fundamental support for the currency. Q3: How do currency movements affect global trade patterns? Currency valuations significantly impact international competitiveness. A weaker yen benefits Japanese exporters but increases import costs. Dollar strength affects emerging market debt servicing capacity and global commodity pricing. Exchange rate fluctuations create winners and losers across trade-dependent sectors. Q4: What levels might trigger Japanese intervention to support the yen? Japanese authorities previously intervened around 160 yen per dollar. Market participants watch this psychological level closely, though intervention decisions consider multiple factors including volatility, economic impact, and international policy coordination considerations. Q5: How do central bank policies influence currency markets? Central banks influence currencies through interest rate decisions, quantitative policies, and forward guidance. Policy divergence creates yield differentials that drive capital flows. Market expectations about future policy adjustments significantly impact currency valuations as investors position accordingly.

The Uganda Communications Commission ordered mobile providers to suspend public internet access from 6 p.m. local time, citing concerns over misinformation and electoral fraud as 81-year-old President Yoweri Museveni seeks his seventh term against opposition challenger Bobi Wine. Bitchat developer Calle reported the app became Uganda’s most downloaded application as citizens prepared for the shutdown. The peer-to-peer messenger uses Bluetooth to relay encrypted messages between nearby devices, creating mesh networks that function independently of traditional internet infrastructure and do not require phone numbers or account registration.

The directive applies to all access technologies, including mobile broadband, fiber-optic services, and satellite internet, with violators facing fines and possible license suspensions. NetBlocks confirmed “ nation-scale disruption to internet connectivity ” shortly after the 3 p.m. GMT implementation deadline. Confirmed: Live network data show a nation-scale disruption to internet connectivity in #Uganda ; the measure comes days ahead of general elections and corresponds to a shutdown notice from the Uganda Communications Commission ""to mitigate the rapid spread of misinformation"" pic.twitter.com/01ZGYVRSuG — NetBlocks (@netblocks) January 13, 2026 Voice calls and basic SMS services remained operational, while essential state services received exemptions through secure whitelisted systems restricted to authorized personnel. The government had repeatedly promised internet access would remain available, stating on January 5 that “ claims suggesting otherwise are false, misleading, and intended to cause unnecessary fear and tension among the public. “ Uganda previously cut internet access during its 2021 election, which international observers described as marred by widespread allegations of rigging and state violence against opposition supporters. Opposition Faces Intensified Repression Ahead of Vote United Nations Human Rights Office reported that police and military forces used live ammunition to disperse peaceful rallies, conducted arbitrary detentions, and abducted opposition supporters in the election run-up. Security forces detained hundreds of opposition supporters while repeatedly firing tear gas at campaign events supporting Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi. The government on Tuesday ordered two local rights groups (Chapter Four Uganda and Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda) to immediately cease operations. The state-run National Bureau for NGOs accused the organizations of activities “ prejudicial ” to Uganda’s security. Both groups had documented alleged arbitrary detention and torture of opposition supporters and journalists covering the election campaign. Another opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, who challenged Museveni in four previous elections, remains jailed on treason charges after being kidnapped in Kenya in 2024 and returned to Uganda for military trial. Decentralized App Provides Communication Alternative Bitchat entered beta testing in July and requires no accounts, phone numbers, or central infrastructure. The app fragments messages into 500-byte chunks that hop between devices within 30 meters, with up to 7 relay points enabling transmission during connectivity blackouts. Store-and-forward systems cache messages for offline users up to 12 hours, ensuring delivery when direct connections are unavailable. Wine encouraged supporters to download the application during his final Monday rally, where heavy security deployment established a perimeter that deterred attendance.

Uganda Communications Commission executive director Nyombi Thembo warned regulators could disable Bitchat if needed, stating, “ Don’t be excited by Bitchat, it’s a small thing. “ Calle rejected that assessment , citing internal data showing over 400,000 Ugandan downloads while declaring, “ You can’t stop Bitchat. You can’t stop us. “ Museveni came to power in 1986 after leading a five-year rebellion and is Africa’s third-longest serving head of state. He has changed the constitution twice to remove age and term limits. His campaign slogan “ Protecting the Gains ” contrasts sharply with Wine’s “ Protest Vote ” message, emphasizing generational change for Uganda’s population, where more than one in four citizens are between 18 and 30 years old. Notably, Uganda’s adoption follows similar patterns during recent civil unrest across multiple countries.

57154097,https://timestabloid.com/?p=94884,1768384823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"A Cheap Crypto Near $0.04 That Could Replay Bitcoin (BTC)’s 5,600% Rally",https://timestabloid.com/a-cheap-crypto-near-0-04-that-could-replay-bitcoin-btcs/,"Bitcoin (BTC) started as a low-priced idea that many ignored. Over time, steady demand, real utility, and growing trust pushed it into one of the most talked-about assets in the world. Today, crypto investing often focuses on finding early-stage projects that combine real use cases with disciplined execution. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits that narrative as a defi crypto still priced near $0.04, designed around active lending, borrowing, and revenue-driven incentives rather than hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale phase 7, with a total supply of 4 billion tokens. The current price sits at $0.04, while the combined presale has already generated around $19.73 million. Across all phases, the project has attracted over 18,800 holders, showing steady organic interest. In the current phase, 6% of the 180 million token allocation has already been sold, reflecting ongoing demand even before launch. Earlier phases offered lower prices, and those entries now stand well ahead of later buyers as the presale progresses toward higher valuations. BTC 56,00% Rally and Near Future Projections Bitcoin (BTC)’s historic 5,600% rally was driven by early adoption, increasing utility, and trust built over time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates in a different era but follows a similar foundation by tying token demand directly to platform activity. At $0.04, the token remains accessible, especially when compared to its planned listing price of $0.06. A buyer entering now secures a 50% price difference before listing, while post-listing projections point toward multiple price expansions as platform usage scales. An investor who reallocated part of a portfolio from ETH and SOL into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during phase 1 at $0.01 already holds a 300% gain by phase 7. This return has been achieved purely through presale progression, without public trading. At the listing price of $0.06, that same position reflects a 500% increase from entry. With post-listing projections targeting several times the listing valuation as usage expands, the compounding effect becomes clear within a structured crypto investing strategy. Buying later phases reduces upside. A $10,000 purchase at $0.04 yields 250,000 tokens, while the same amount at $0.06 secures only 167K tokens. That difference directly affects long-term returns as the platform matures. The discounted nature of the current phase keeps early access attractive while the ecosystem prepares for launch. The presale is positioned as a legitimate offering rather than a short-term gamble. The team has been active since early 2025 and has followed its roadmap with consistent delivery of milestones. A fully functional protocol launch is approaching, supported by visible community growth and transparent development. This steady execution separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from the many short-lived projects that dominate the market and reinforces its status as a long-term venture. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Safe Dual Lending Models Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a formal security audit by Halborn , completed in November 2025. The audit reviewed core smart contract code and identified six issues, including one high-severity item. All findings were fully resolved before completion, with Halborn confirming 100% remediation. This process strengthens confidence as the project advances toward its V1 testnet on Sepolia and eventual launch. A key growth driver is the dual lending structure combining Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. In the P2C system, users will pool assets such as USDT, ETH into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access liquidity by providing overcollateralized collateral, while interest rates will adjust dynamically based on pool usage. Lenders will receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio, representing their deposits and accrued interest. For example, a user lending $15,000 in DAI will receive 15,000 mtDAI. With an average APY around 10%, annual earnings reach $1,500 in passive income, all while retaining liquidity through mtTokens. Borrowers benefit as well. Using $1,000 worth of BTC as collateral allows access to up to 75% borrowing capacity, providing liquidity without selling the underlying asset and maintaining exposure to market upside. The P2P model expands opportunities for assets like DOGE and SHIB. Here, lenders and borrowers negotiate terms directly, accepting higher risk for higher returns while isolating volatility from core liquidity pools. Overcollateralization and a Stability Factor govern all loans, ensuring system health through controlled liquidations when thresholds are breached. Liquidity management and volatility controls are central to the protocol. Lower-volatility assets such as ETH and stablecoins sustain higher Loan-to-Value ratios near 6%, while more volatile tokens operate within tighter limits. These parameters protect solvency and support efficient liquidations, maintaining confidence among participants for secure and consistent ROI. MUTM Buybacks and Simultaneous Platform Launch Another demand driver is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. Platform revenue from borrowing activity will be used to repurchase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens from the open market. These tokens will be distributed to mtToken stakers, aligning rewards with real usage rather than emissions. As activity increases, consistent buy pressure supports price momentum and incentivizes long-term engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) expects to launch its platform and token simultaneously. Lending, borrowing, and staking will be live from day one, giving the token immediate utility. This coordinated rollout strengthens exchange listing prospects and provides traders and users with a working product rather than a promise. Final Verdict For community expansion, the platform also features an upgraded 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the top participant earns a $500 MUTM reward by completing at least one transaction, with resets at 00:00 UTC. This daily incentive encourages ongoing activity and visibility within the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a defi crypto near $0.04 that combines disciplined development, audited security, and real economic activity. With presale momentum, structured growth drivers, and a clear path to launch, the project aligns with the same fundamentals that once powered Bitcoin (BTC)’s early rise. For investors focused on strategic crypto investing, the current phase represents a calculated entry point before higher valuations define the next stage of growth.

He predicted that 5,000 XRP would be worth 1 BTC in 2026, creating a clear valuation benchmark. Bitcoin trades at $91,200. His prediction places XRP at roughly $18.24 per token if his ratio plays out. Prediction: 5,000 XRP will be worth 1 Bitcoin in 2026. — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 12, 2026 Is XRP Going to Double Digits? 1 Bitcoin is currently worth almost 44,500 XRP, but Bird did not present this as a soft or uncertain view. He treated it as a confident forward outlook. By fixing XRP to Bitcoin in this way, he defines a double-digit price level that many holders would immediately consider transformative for the asset’s market presence. Bitcoin remains the most dominant cryptocurrency. Suggesting XRP can achieve a value relationship strong enough to match 5,000 tokens to 1 BTC shifts expectations toward higher utility, stronger liquidity, and meaningful scaling of XRP’s economic relevance. XRP Army Gets Excited Replies to the post highlighted curiosity, confidence, and strong forward expectations. One community member jokingly stated that one Bitcoin would be $5, implying a decisive decline for both assets. Another user took it further, questioning whether Bird’s confidence overlooked a future crisis for Bitcoin, but the analyst rejected the idea. One participant highlighted XRP’s potential role in large-scale tokenization . He emphasized the need for significant XRP liquidity to support tokenization processes across assets. Another user projected an even more ambitious scenario by suggesting a future where 1 XRP could surpass the value of Bitcoin, echoing the narrative that XRP will flip BTC . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 One commenter expanded on the prediction. He showed that if Bitcoin continues to rise, XRP could hit $30 when BTC is at $150,000, and $50 once BTC reaches $250,000. Why Tokenization is a Key Supporting Theme One reply pushed an important point that goes beyond price excitement. The focus shifted to tokenization and real-world integration of assets. The argument suggested that a powerful XRP price supports liquidity pools, improves capital availability, and strengthens the network’s role in large financial systems. Bird responded to that idea by saying XRP availability on-chain matters for building liquidity pools between XRP and tokenized assets. He also noted that a rising price helps this process because higher value tokens can support deeper liquidity .

They claim that restricting the exemption will result in millions of Americans having to deal with complex tax regulations when making normal transactions using cryptocurrency. In collaboration with Bitcoin Voter, Blocks, Crypto Council, Digital Chamber, MoonPay, River, and a number of other organizations, the Bitcoin Policy Institute spearheaded the initiative. Two influential politicians, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Michael Crapo, received their request on Sunday. Every crypto purchase triggers a taxable event The groups argue that current plans would only help people using payment stablecoins that follow rules set by the GENIUS Act , which became law in July. They say this narrow approach defeats the point of making crypto taxes easier. Right now, the IRS considers cryptocurrency to be property. That means anyone buying something small, like a cup of coffee, with Bitcoin has to report it as a taxable event. They must track their original purchase price and figure out if they made or lost money on the transaction. “Imagine having to pay capital gains every time you swipe a card? It’s definitely discouraging crypto payments, and if the U.S. wants to be the crypto capital of the world, allowing crypto to be used as money without any restrictions and compliance burdens is critical,” said Zakhil Suresh, who runs BitSave, a crypto asset management company. The coalition wants payment stablecoins that meet GENIUS Act standards to get the same treatment as physical cash, with no limits on individual transactions or yearly spending. They explained that payment stablecoins depend on blockchain networks that use separate tokens to function. These network tokens handle things like security and processing transactions. The groups say both types of digital assets need tax relief for any policy to actually work. Their proposal includes specific guidelines. Network tokens would need a market value of at least $25 billion to qualify. Individual transactions would be capped at $600, with a yearly limit of $20,000. Millions of Americans already use crypto for payments According to Federal Reserve information, around 45 million Americans hold cryptocurrency, mostly Bitcoin. The letter pointed out that roughly 7 million Americans made payments using Bitcoin or similar network tokens last year. More than 3,500 stores now take Bitcoin payments in all 50 states, making America the biggest market for Bitcoin transactions. This push follows an earlier attempt that didn’t succeed. Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming tried to add crypto tax changes to President Donald Trump’s reconciliation bill in July, but couldn’t get it through. Jack Dorsey, who started Block, brought the issue back up last October. He called for federal tax breaks on everyday Bitcoin purchases when his payment company launched crypto wallets for small businesses. Lummis promised then to bring the proposal back in future Senate meetings, calling it important for wider Bitcoin use. The groups say the matter has become more pressing because new broker reporting rules took effect on January 1, 2025. These rules require reporting of digital asset sales on Form 1099-DA. “Without calibrated de minimis relief, the result will be widespread discrepancies, unnecessary audit risk, and reporting complexity vastly disproportionate to the economic substance of the transactions involved,” the letter says.

The French financial regulator delivers an unequivocal ultimatum to cryptocurrency companies operating within its borders. Starting July 2025, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) will mandate the suspension of all crypto asset service providers lacking a European Union Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license. This decisive enforcement action directly impacts a significant portion of the nation’s registered digital asset sector, marking a pivotal moment for regulatory harmonization across the continent. MiCA License Deadline: France’s Regulatory Enforcement Timeline The AMF recently clarified its enforcement position regarding the MiCA framework. According to official communications and reports from financial publications like Cointelegraph, the regulator will issue formal orders for non-compliant firms to cease operations. France has adopted a strict interpretation of the EU’s comprehensive regulatory package, which fully came into effect in late 2024 after a transitional period. Consequently, the July deadline represents the final enforcement phase for existing companies. French authorities have processed applications methodically since MiCA’s implementation. To date, they have granted full MiCA licenses to only a select few companies that demonstrate robust compliance frameworks. This cautious approach contrasts with the registration system previously in place, which allowed nearly 90 firms to operate under lighter oversight. The transition from registration to full licensing now separates compliant operators from those facing imminent suspension. Statistical Reality: Compliance Gaps Among Registered Firms Current data reveals substantial compliance challenges within the French crypto ecosystem. Of the approximately 90 entities previously registered with French authorities, a concerning 40% have explicitly stated they possess no intention of pursuing a MiCA license. An additional 30% have failed to respond to official inquiries from the AMF regarding their licensing status. These statistics, confirmed through regulatory updates, suggest that up to 70% of currently registered firms risk operational suspension in July. The remaining 30% of firms either hold a license or maintain active applications under review. This distribution highlights the significant market consolidation likely to occur. The AMF’s stance reflects a broader EU-wide push for standardized consumer protection, market integrity, and anti-money laundering standards. France, as a major financial hub, positions itself at the forefront of this enforcement wave. Expert Analysis: The Rationale Behind Strict Enforcement Financial regulation experts point to several factors driving France’s firm stance. Firstly, MiCA establishes a unified legal framework across 27 member states, eliminating regulatory arbitrage. Secondly, the framework mandates stringent requirements for: Consumer Asset Safeguarding: Segregation of client funds from operational capital. Transparency Obligations: Comprehensive whitepaper disclosures for asset issuers. Governance Standards: Fit-and-proper tests for management and significant shareholders. Operational Resilience: Cybersecurity protocols and complaint-handling procedures. Firms unwilling or unable to meet these standards likely face insurmountable barriers to licensing. Market analysts suggest the exiting firms may include smaller exchanges, niche service providers, and entities with ambiguous business models. Their departure, while reducing consumer choice, aims to enhance overall market stability and investor confidence in the remaining licensed operators. Comparative Landscape: France Within the European MiCA Rollout France’s enforcement approach exists within a spectrum of EU member state implementations. The table below summarizes key differences in early 2025: Country Licensing Approach Notable Deadline Estimated Firm Impact France Strict suspension for non-compliance July 2025 High (Up to 70% of registered firms) Germany Phased transition with extended reviews Q4 2025 Moderate Netherlands Active supervision with remediation periods Already enforced High Ireland Case-by-case assessment June 2025 Low to Moderate This variance stems from national discretions allowed within the MiCA regulation. France’s Financial Markets Authority chooses to leverage the full extent of its supervisory powers, signaling a low tolerance for non-compliance. This strategy may attract established, well-capitalized firms seeking a clear regulatory environment, while potentially stifacing innovation from smaller startups. Market Impact and Future Trajectory for Crypto in France The impending suspension carries immediate and long-term consequences. In the short term, consumers using services from non-compliant firms must prepare for potential service interruptions. They should verify their provider’s licensing status directly on the AMF’s official register. Furthermore, market liquidity on smaller, unlicensed platforms may diminish ahead of the deadline. Long-term implications involve a more concentrated, institutional-grade cryptocurrency market in France. Licensed entities, such as those affiliated with major traditional finance groups, will likely capture greater market share. This consolidation aligns with global trends where comprehensive regulation precedes broader institutional adoption. The French Treasury has previously expressed support for blockchain innovation, but strictly within regulated parameters that prioritize investor protection and financial stability. Industry groups have responded with mixed reactions. Some associations commend the clarity and high standards, arguing they legitimize the sector. Conversely, other advocates warn that excessive stringency could push innovative projects to more lenient jurisdictions outside the EU. The true balance between consumer safety and technological advancement will unfold in the months following the July enforcement date. Conclusion France’s commitment to suspending crypto firms without a MiCA license from July 2025 represents a definitive step in European cryptocurrency regulation. The AMF’s enforcement action, backed by concerning compliance statistics, will reshape the national digital asset landscape. This move underscores the irreversible shift from a period of experimental innovation to one of formalized oversight under the MiCA framework. The coming months will test the resilience of the French crypto market, ultimately determining whether strict regulation fosters greater trust and sustainable growth or constricts the diversity of its digital finance ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What is the exact deadline for crypto firms in France to obtain a MiCA license? The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) will begin ordering non-compliant firms to cease operations starting in July 2025. Companies must secure their license before this enforcement date to continue operating legally. Q2: How many crypto firms in France currently face suspension? Based on available data, approximately 40% of registered firms have no license intention, and 30% have not responded to regulators. Therefore, up to 63 firms out of roughly 90 may face suspension, representing a significant portion of the market. Q3: What are the main requirements for obtaining a MiCA license in France? Key requirements include stringent capital adequacy rules, robust custody solutions for client assets, transparent governance structures, comprehensive consumer disclosure documents, and advanced cybersecurity and anti-money laundering systems. Q4: Can a suspended firm reapply for a license after July? Yes, in theory, a suspended firm can submit a new application. However, it must cease all regulated activities during the application review, which is a lengthy and rigorous process, putting it at a significant competitive disadvantage. Q5: How does France’s approach compare to other EU countries under MiCA? France is among the stricter enforcers, with a clear suspension threat for non-compliance. Other nations like Germany offer more transitional flexibility, while the Netherlands has already enforced similar strict measures, indicating a trend toward rigorous oversight within the bloc.

This comprehensive analysis examines Monero’s price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, exploring the complex interplay between technological innovation, regulatory pressures, and growing demand for financial confidentiality. Recent developments in privacy-enhancing technologies and shifting global regulatory landscapes create both challenges and opportunities for this pioneering cryptocurrency. Monero Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026-2030 Trajectory Monero’s price prediction for the coming years depends on multiple interconnected factors. The cryptocurrency’s unique privacy features, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions, continue to differentiate it from transparent blockchain alternatives. Market analysts observe that privacy coins face increasing regulatory scrutiny globally, particularly following the 2024 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations. However, technological advancements within the Monero ecosystem, including ongoing protocol upgrades and community-driven development, provide fundamental strength. Historical price data reveals Monero’s resilience during market downturns, often outperforming less specialized cryptocurrencies. The network’s consistent mining decentralization, achieved through its RandomX algorithm, ensures security against specialized mining hardware. Furthermore, Monero’s predictable emission schedule, with tail emission beginning in 2022, creates predictable inflation rates that contrast sharply with fiat currencies. These technical fundamentals underpin most long-term price predictions. Privacy Coin Growth: Regulatory and Adoption Dynamics Privacy coin growth faces significant regulatory headwinds but also benefits from increasing demand for financial privacy. Several jurisdictions have implemented restrictions on privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, with exchanges delisting Monero in regulated markets. Conversely, adoption continues in regions with capital controls or surveillance concerns. The tension between regulatory compliance and individual privacy rights creates a complex landscape for Monero’s future development. Technological innovation remains crucial for Monero’s sustained growth. The development community consistently enhances privacy features while maintaining network efficiency. Recent protocol upgrades have improved transaction efficiency and strengthened privacy guarantees. These improvements address scalability concerns that previously limited Monero’s utility for everyday transactions. Additionally, ongoing research into zero-knowledge proofs and other advanced cryptographic techniques may further enhance Monero’s privacy capabilities. Expert Analysis: Institutional Perspectives on Privacy Assets Financial institutions increasingly recognize privacy as a legitimate feature rather than solely a compliance concern. Several hedge funds now include privacy coins in diversified cryptocurrency portfolios, citing their non-correlation with traditional assets. Academic research from institutions like Stanford and MIT continues to explore the societal benefits of financial privacy, potentially influencing future regulatory approaches. These developments suggest growing institutional acknowledgment of privacy cryptocurrencies’ legitimate use cases. Market data indicates changing patterns in Monero adoption. While early adoption focused on privacy-conscious individuals, recent years show increasing use in jurisdictions with unstable currencies or restrictive financial systems. This geographical diversification strengthens Monero’s network effects and reduces dependency on any single regulatory regime. The cryptocurrency’s fungibility, ensured by its privacy features, maintains its utility as a medium of exchange despite regulatory challenges. Technological Evolution and Network Security Monero’s technological roadmap includes several significant developments that may influence its price trajectory. The ongoing optimization of transaction sizes and verification speeds addresses previous limitations for everyday use. Network security remains robust due to the decentralized mining ecosystem, with no single entity controlling significant hash rate. This decentralization protects against 51% attacks and ensures network integrity. The cryptocurrency’s privacy features continue evolving in response to both technological advances and potential vulnerabilities. The Monero community maintains an active bug bounty program and transparent disclosure process for security issues. This proactive approach to security builds trust among users and developers. Furthermore, the project’s funding mechanism, supported by community donations and developer contributions, ensures sustainable development without venture capital dependencies that might compromise the project’s principles. Comparative Analysis: Monero Versus Alternative Privacy Solutions Monero competes with both other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and privacy features implemented on transparent blockchains. The table below compares key characteristics: Feature Monero Zcash Privacy on Transparent Chains Default Privacy Yes Optional No Fungibility High Variable Low Transaction Size Larger Variable Smaller Regulatory Scrutiny High Medium Low This comparative analysis highlights Monero’s distinctive approach to privacy. Unlike optional privacy implementations, Monero’s mandatory privacy ensures uniform fungibility across all transactions. This characteristic proves particularly valuable for users requiring consistent privacy guarantees. However, the larger transaction sizes present scalability challenges that the development community continues addressing through protocol improvements. Market Dynamics and Price Influencing Factors Several specific factors will likely influence Monero’s price between 2026 and 2030: Regulatory developments: Global coordination on cryptocurrency regulation Technological advancements: Improvements to privacy and scalability Adoption patterns: Geographic and demographic expansion Macroeconomic conditions: Inflation and currency instability Competitive landscape: Alternative privacy solutions Market analysts particularly monitor regulatory developments, as coordinated international action could significantly impact privacy coin accessibility. However, technological workarounds and jurisdictional arbitrage may mitigate some regulatory restrictions. The fundamental demand for financial privacy, driven by both legitimate concerns and illicit activities, ensures continued interest in Monero regardless of regulatory challenges. Conclusion Monero’s price prediction from 2026 through 2030 reflects the complex balance between growing demand for financial privacy and increasing regulatory scrutiny. The cryptocurrency’s strong technological fundamentals, dedicated development community, and proven resilience suggest continued relevance in the evolving digital asset landscape. While regulatory challenges present significant obstacles, they also highlight the enduring value proposition of genuine financial privacy. Ultimately, Monero’s future trajectory will depend on its ability to navigate regulatory environments while maintaining its core privacy guarantees and expanding legitimate use cases. FAQs Q1: What makes Monero different from Bitcoin regarding privacy? Monero provides mandatory privacy through ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions, making all transactions private by default. Bitcoin transactions are transparent and traceable on a public ledger. Q2: How does regulatory scrutiny affect Monero’s price prediction? Increased regulation typically creates short-term price pressure due to exchange delistings and reduced accessibility. However, long-term demand often persists through alternative access methods, potentially creating valuation disparities between regulated and unregulated markets. Q3: What technological developments might influence Monero’s future price? Ongoing protocol upgrades improving transaction efficiency, potential integration of advanced cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs, and scalability solutions could positively impact adoption and valuation. Q4: How does Monero maintain network security with privacy features? Monero uses the RandomX mining algorithm to ensure ASIC resistance, promoting decentralized mining. The privacy features don’t compromise security; instead, they operate through cryptographic techniques that maintain transaction validity while obscuring details. Q5: Can Monero achieve mainstream adoption despite regulatory challenges? Mainstream adoption faces significant regulatory hurdles in many jurisdictions. However, adoption continues in regions valuing financial privacy or facing currency instability, suggesting a bifurcated future with varying adoption levels across different regulatory environments.

Key Takeaways: Ripple secured preliminary EMI approval in Luxembourg to expand regulated EU payments. Back-to-back approvals in Luxembourg and the UK deepen Ripple’s European footprint. The licenses support Ripple’s push to deliver payment infrastructure for banks and institutions. The approval was granted by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier and came in the form of a “green light letter,” Ripple said in a recent blog post . While the authorization remains subject to final conditions, it positions the company to broaden its cross-border payments platform across the European Union, allowing financial institutions to move funds using stablecoins and other digital assets within a regulated framework. Ripple Secures UK and Luxembourg Approvals to Deepen EU Presence The Luxembourg decision follows closely on Ripple’s recent regulatory progress in the United Kingdom, where it received both an EMI license and cryptoasset registration from the Financial Conduct Authority. Together, the approvals strengthen Ripple’s footprint in two key European markets as regional rules for digital assets continue to take shape. Ripple President Monica Long said Europe’s regulatory approach has given financial institutions the confidence to move blockchain technology beyond pilot programs. She added that expanding Ripple’s licensing portfolio allows the company to offer an end-to-end payments solution that combines stablecoins with onchain liquidity, helping institutions modernize legacy systems and operate around the clock. Ripple Payments operates as a licensed, end-to-end cross-border payments platform, managing the flow of funds on behalf of clients while connecting them to a global network of payout partners. By handling blockchain infrastructure and operational complexity internally, Ripple enables banks and payment providers to launch digital services without building or maintaining their own systems.

The firm holds more than 75 licenses and registrations worldwide, placing it among the most heavily regulated companies in the digital asset sector. Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s managing director for the UK and Europe, said Luxembourg’s supervisory framework offers the legal certainty needed for financial innovation. She described the preliminary approval as a pivotal step toward delivering compliant blockchain infrastructure across the EU, noting Ripple’s focus on aligning its operations with Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime. Ripple’s RLUSD Wins Regulatory Green Light in Abu Dhabi As reported, Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD was cleared for institutional use in Abu Dhabi after receiving recognition as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token from the local regulator. The approval allows licensed firms within Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) to use RLUSD for regulated financial activities inside the free-zone financial center. The decision strengthens Ripple’s expansion across the UAE. In recent months, the company secured approvals in Dubai and Abu Dhabi and onboarded partners including Zand Bank and Mamo. As reported, Ripple is also weighing whether to bring staking to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , a move that would push the decade-old blockchain deeper into the rapidly expanding world of decentralized finance.

57156114,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=894792,1768390141,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57156114.jpeg,Low rug-pull count masks crypto’s most expensive year,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cryptos-year-rug-pulls-most-expensive/,"2025 turned out to be a year of progress for crypto investors who had burned their money in the previous cycle. With all the positive things happening for the digital assets market last year, scams, hacks, and rug pulls also grabbed eyeballs. A report suggests that the crypto industry lost $3.4 billion to theft for the year. The February mega Bybit hack alone accounted for $1.5 billion. North Korean hackers managed to steal $2.02 billion in crypto in 2025. This has been a 51% year-over-year increase for them. Amid all this, rug pull events became less frequent, but looted many investors. 2025’s rug pulls were marked by social influence, insider access, and rapid liquidity drains. These events covered politically linked meme coins to DeFi protocols that broke trust built over months or even years. Collapse of Mantra The fall of Mantra Network shocked the market in April. Its OM token collapsed by more than 90% in under an hour. It plunged from nearly $6 to below $0.40, which led to the erosion of billions overnight. However, analysts flagged unusual activity shortly before the crash, but they were unable to avoid it. Large and sudden position closure became one of the main reasons behind the fall as it pushed liquidity under pressure. John Patrick Mullin, Mantra co-founder, has rejected the allegations around insider rug pull. He argued that the collapse was triggered by exchange-side liquidations. These trades were reportedly carried out without margin calls or notice. Some called it the result of reckless liquidations. The collapse of Mantra’s price. Source: CoinMarketCap . At the end of the event, approx. $6 billion was wiped out. This made Mantra one of the largest alleged rug pull collapses in crypto history. OM is trading at an average price of $0.08 at the press time. It’s down by 99% from its all-time high of $9.04. Pi Network pulling high hopes down On one side, Mantra showed investors a sudden collapse, then Pi Network displayed the risks of delayed hopes on the other. Pi came into the market with a buzz around the first mobile mining crypto. It managed to grab millions of users over time. Meanwhile, its much-awaited mainnet launch in early 2025 turned into a controversial affair. Blockchain investigators alleged that 12 million PI tokens were dumped within hours. This slashed the token’s price by more than 50%, sending investors under pressure. Pi Core Team wallets were reportedly flagged as potential sources of the outflows. Such allegations raised questions about insider behavior. However, Pi’s backers denied it . More than $8 billion in notional value was drained by the end of the incident. Pi price went on to nose-dive straight from $2.7 (27 Feb, 2025) to hit below $1.3 (3 March 2025). It then went on to break below $1 later. The token is trading at an average price of $0.20 at the press time. It is still holding a market cap of $1.7 billion. MetaYield Farm made DeFi suffer February 2025 witnessed another massive free fall of hopes. MetaYield Farm, a DeFi protocol, disappeared entirely. They drained approx. $290 million from more than 14,000 users. On-chain data reportedly flagged funds being bridged from Hyperliquid to Ethereum. Almost 752 ETH were routed out through Tornado Cash. This landed MetaYield at the top of the pure DeFi rug pull of the year. The team deleted all online presence while investors tried to find out answers. The whole project ran on aggressive social media marketing. Unverified smart contracts were used to attract liquidity before the running away act. Rise of political meme coins The year 2025 saw a new fascination with politically branded tokens. LIBRA turned out to be one of the most controversial tokens in the category. Argentine President Javier Milei took to social media to promote the $LIBRA token based on Solana. His tweets are sent the token’s market cap to hit above $4.5 billion. Insiders were quick they pull out between $107 million and $250 million within hours. Over 114,000 investor wallets lost money in the act. Milei later said he had no connection to the project. He also deleted the post after the matter made the global headlines. However, the damage was already done. The episode became known locally as “Cryptogate.” In the US, the Trump family-linked tokens followed a similar arc. Cryptos with names like $TRUMP, $MELANIA, and $BARRON came into the market. They also recorded a drop of around 90% to 99% from their peaks. A federal class-action lawsuit alleged that insiders treated the projects as well as planned pump-and-dump schemes. TRUMP is trading at an average price of $5.64 at the press time. It had posted an ATH of over $75 in Jan 2025. Similarly, MELANIA is trading down by 99% from its ATH of $13.73. Investors also got duped into a fake Eric Trump token, too. The fake project went on to hit $160 million market cap before crashing to near zero. With rug pulls, the crypto investors also got a taste of some huge hacks. February saw the Bybit hack. Users lost around $1.5 billion in stolen Ethereum. This turned out to be the largest single crypto theft ever recorded.

57156115,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=894665,1768390200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57156115.jpeg,"Cardano (ADA) Stabilizes, While Analysts Back a $0.04 Token as the Better Buy",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-ada-stabilizes-while-analysts-back-a-0-04-token-as-the-better-buy/,"Cardano (ADA) has now entered a stabilization phase, whereas for quite some time, there has been fluctuation in the price trend of this famous cryptocurrency. Even now that it has been charted in the “to watch” lists of various investors, there appears to be only restricted growth in store for it in the coming cycles. Currently trending is another exciting DeFi crypto in presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Its cost to buy is $0.04 in presale Phase 7, up 4x from when the presale started at $0.01. The presale has been able to attract nearly $20 million in funds to date with an ever-expanding supply of token supporters. Cardano (ADA) Consolidation ADA is having a quiet reset as its trading volume falls 38% while its open interest soars to $794M. The crypto is stuck between $0.33 and $0.48. While a breakout above $0.48 may open doors for a rally toward $0.48, ADA lacks momentum. MUTM Presale Rally Mutuum Finance gives investors the opportunity to invest in its DeFi project early. At Phase 7, one would need to pay $0.04, which is the cheapest MUTM will ever cost. Phase 8 will lift the price nearly 20% to $0.045. This gives one an opportunity to gain an instant return in case one acts fast. Launch price is pegged at $0.06. It is predicted that once it attains adoption, one could make $30,000 from $300 invested today, thereby being one of the best options in DeFi crypto. Yield-Bearing Collateral Mutuum Finance offers stability with a USD-pegged stablecoin and yield-generating collaterals. This allows one to lock in their assets to enable them to borrow the stablecoin. Their collateral goes to lending pools that earn interest that can be used to pay back some of the loaned amount. For example, if a lender had placed $5000 in ETH as collateral for $3500 in MUTM stablecoin loan, then the $5000 in ETH earns 10% APR to pay back some of that loan amount. This explains why MUTM is one of the best DeFi cryptos and why it should be considered to be one of the best crypto currently. Security and Testnet Security is yet another field where MUTM is extremely interested. MUTM has a score of 90/100 token scan from CertiK and has also undergone a Halborn Security audit of its lending and borrowing smart contracts. Further bolstering the security mechanisms of the platform is the $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards white hat hackers for bug findings in the platform. Coming down the pike is the V1 protocol going live on the Sepolia testnet where users will be able to interact with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt contracts, and the liquidator bot for under-collateralized positions. Community Incentives for Adoption Mutuum Finance interacts with the community through various activities. The $100,000 giveaway will treat ten members to $10,000, while there is another reward for the biggest buyer, who gets a MUTM bonus of $500 every day. These activities not only serve as engagement strategies for MUTM, but they also ensure a constant flow of demand for the token. MUTM ensures its presence and importance as one of the top DeFi cryptos in early investment through this. In contrast to Cardano, whose potential is limited, Mutuum Finance has a successful presale as well as DeFi solutions being built, including staking rewards. This has made the new token the top DeFi crypto to buy.

Bank of America Is Running Tests With Ripple,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-bearish-on-xrp-bank-of-america-is-running-tests-with-ripple/,"Interest in real utility keeps growing around XRP, and recent commentary from X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) highlights why. He presented a clear message about what is taking shape. He stated that Bank of America is already running tests with Ripple technology, while the U.S. provides the regulatory environment that allows progress. He described XRP as moving into a critical position within financial systems. He called the asset “ core financial plumbing ,” setting the context for how serious this development looks. Bearish on $XRP ? Bank of America is already running tests with Ripple Cross-border payments are being rewritten. Ripple provides the tech. BoA runs the tests. The U.S. enables the legality. You think this ends with crypto Twitter price debates? $XRP is becoming core… pic.twitter.com/sgbyIMnznd — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 12, 2026 A Strong Message for the XRP Army X Finance Bull’s post takes a direct approach. He points toward active testing and usage rather than discussion. He stresses real movement rather than theory. His statement says Bank of America runs tests with Ripple. Ripple provides the technology. The U.S. supports legality. He challenges the idea that XRP remains part of simple online price conversations. He argues that investors should think in terms of positioning for real financial integration rather than simple speculation. This presents XRP in a confident light. It presents progress as something already in motion rather than something distant. What the Image Shows and Why It Matters The attached image supports his message with structure. Bank of America sits on one side as the symbol of large institutional involvement. The U.S. government appears as the authority figure that regulates and enables legal clarity. Ripple stands as the builder and maintainer of the technology, with XRP as the asset that supports that system. The payments market represents demand and value creation. The graphic suggests a complete ecosystem rather than a single corporate partnership. It highlights pilots, RippleNet usage, efficient cross-border payments, stablecoins like RLUSD for liquidity, and industry impact through large bank participation. This helps present XRP as a serious tool for settlement speed, low-cost movement, and operational reliability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Positive Direction for XRP If Bank of America continues testing Ripple technology, it supports confidence in XRP’s utility. Large banking interest signals belief in blockchain solutions for real financial activity. Government involvement means structure, rules, and legitimacy. Demand from the payments market could mean a rapid growth in real-world usage . These factors point toward strength, and X Finance Bull advised investors to position themselves. They point toward rising relevance. They also create conditions that can support price growth because utility, confidence, and adoption help drive stronger valuation environments.

People often hold USDT for its stability. But if you’re using your exchange like a wallet, that stability becomes worthless. Moreover, leaving USDT on an exchange means you’re giving the company a loan with no collateral. They can freeze, be hacked, or disappear at any moment. When you transfer Tether to a wallet, you eliminate this counterparty risk altogether. Here we will focus on both hot wallets (software you use on your phone or computer) and cold wallets (dedicated hardware devices). Just remember that there are different blockchains for USDT, and if you send to the wrong one, you can lose your money. Let’s start with that. Quick Glance at the Best USDT Wallets Wallet Type Networks Supported Cost Best For Ledger Nano X Cold (Hardware) ERC-20, TRC-20, BEP-20, Polygon, Arbitrum $149 Large holdings, multi-chain users Ledger Flex Cold (Hardware) ERC-20, TRC-20, BEP-20, Polygon, Arbitrum $249 Premium security with clear-signing display Trezor Safe 3 Cold (Hardware) ERC-20, BEP-20 (No native TRC-20) $79 Budget hardware, Bitcoin-focused users Trust Wallet Hot (Mobile) ERC-20, TRC-20, BEP-20, Polygon, Arbitrum Free Mobile payments, TRC-20 transfers MetaMask Hot (Browser/Mobile) ERC-20, BEP-20, Layer 2s, TRC-20 (via integration) Free DeFi users, dApp connections Exodus Hot (Desktop/Mobile) ERC-20, TRC-20, BEP-20 Free Portfolio visualization Understanding USDT Networks (Don’t Skip This) USDT isn’t a single token. It’s the same Dollar-pegged asset, but deployed on multiple different blockchain networks. These networks don’t directly talk to each other. So if you send USDT from the Tron network to the Ethereum network, you might lose your funds permanently. ERC-20 (Ethereum) USDT on Ethereum is the one everyone uses in the institutional space, as Ethereum is considered the safest network. Pretty much all major DeFi protocols support Ethereum. The downside is the gas fees. At the peak of the bull market, when the Ethereum network was busy, users found that sending $100 USDT cost $50 in Ethereum. Even when the network is not busy, expect to pay $1-3, and the transactions normally take anywhere from 15 seconds to several minutes to go through. When to use ERC-20: Long-term storage, DeFi lending on Aave or Compound, and trading on Uniswap – all the usual stuff. TRC-20 (TRON) Tron is a widely used network due to its low fees and incredibly fast transfer times: the fee is only a couple of cents. The downside is that people do consider it a bit too centralized. There are only 27 Super-Representatives who validate the transactions. Ethereum, for example, has a number of transaction validators that is worlds apart from the number Tron has. This, however, is irrelevant to the vast majority of people who simply want to transact and use DeFi. Using Tron is perfect for situations such as when you want to send money to someone, when you want to transfer money from one exchange to another, and other situations where you want to send money to a destination quickly and inexpensively. Keeping money in it for long periods of time is not ideal. BEP-20 (BNB Chain) Binance Smart Chain strikes a balance between Ethereum and Tron. It has Ethereum-like security and Tron-like fees. The cost of a transaction is between $0.10 and $0.30. Plus, they confirm transactions in about 3 seconds. However, there is a major downside: BEP-20 tokens have the same address format as Ethereum: 0x. In fact, you can have the same wallet address in Ethereum and with BEP-20 tokens. However, they are not interchangeable. If you send BEP-20 USDT to a platform that only accepts ERC-20 tokens, you might have a lost funds situation that is only reversible with a manual recovery (if the platform has that option). BEP-20 tokens are the only option for accessing Binance’s PancakeSwap and other services in the Binance DeFi ecosystem. Use BEP-20 tokens when you need to avoid Ethereum’s fees, but want to stay in the same EVM-compatible ecosystem. Top-Rated Hardware Wallets for USDT (Cold Storage) Ledger Nano X / Ledger Flex When it comes to hardware wallets, Ledger is the dominant product. It’s got comprehensive network coverage and solid products. Both Ledger Nano X ($150) and the top-of-the-line Flex ($249) handle ERC-20, TRC-20, BEP-20, and Layer 2 USDT natively through the Ledger Live app. The native TRC-20 support is a game-changer. Unlike some of its competitors, Ledger can handle USDT based on the TRON network directly on its native application without having to use third-party software. This makes it a whole lot simpler and reduces the attack surface. Both Nano X and Flex can be used with a wide variety of devices. Via USB on desktops, or via Bluetooth on mobile devices. The Ledger Live application is also available on Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android. The Flex adds a 2.8-inch E-Ink touchscreen that displays the transaction details before you sign off. This “clear signing” feature lets you see exactly what you’re approving – the recipient address, the amount, and the network – right on the device’s screen, which protects you from phishing sites that display one thing but execute another. Pros: Native support for most major USDT networks. Bluetooth connectivity (Nano X/Flex) for mobile use. EAL6+ certified Secure Element chip for top-notch security. Clear signing on Flex stops blind signing attacks cold. Cons: Firmware is closed-source. Optional “Ledger Recover” backup service raises some eyebrows among privacy enthusiasts. A bit pricey compared to the competition. Trezor Model T / Trezor Safe 3 Trezor, as a hardware wallet manufacturer, has an opposite approach compared to Ledger. Trezor’s firmware is open-source, meaning that anyone can examine it. Trezor’s style has largely remained the same: the most recent Trezor Save 7 ($250) has a color touchscreen, and it supports Shamir Backup, a feature that allows users to divide their recovery phrase into multiple pieces, meaning that no single backup location has full control over a user’s recovery keys. On the other end of the price spectrum, the Safe 3 is only $79. It renders the competition to be the most affordable hardware wallet with EAL6+ certification. It also has a Secure Element chip, and Trezor is still open-source. However, Trezor does not have native support for Tron TRC-20 tokens, which is extremely problematic. Trezor Suite does allow for access to TRC-20 tokens via third-party wallets, for instance, Exodus. But this is more complicated, and it means that users are placing their trust in that additional software layer. Pros: Open-source and fully auditable. Shamir Backup option for storing your seed phrase bits and bobs across multiple locations. Safe 3 offers a Secure Element at the $79 price point. Cons: No native TRC-20 support in Trezor Suite. Requires third-party software (like Exodus) for TRON tokens Top-Rated Software Wallets for USDT (Hot Wallets) Hot wallets run on your phone or computer. They’re not as secure as hardware wallets because your private keys exist on an internet-connected device. They are also free, very practical, and good for smaller amounts. Trust Wallet – Best for Mobile Trust Wallet is one of the only mobile apps that properly supports multi-chain USDT. When you open it, you see your balances for ERC-20, TRC-20, and BEP-20, all in one list. There is no need to check which network a token is on because the app automatically detects it. Trust Wallet is a good option for TRC-20 transfers. You can stake your TRX in the app to earn free transaction “Energy,” and it’s just as simple to send TRC-20 USDT as it is to send any other token. The wallet creates a typical 12-word recovery phrase not locked to Trust Wallet, so you can import it to other wallets like MetaMask, Exodus, or Ledger if you ever want to change them. Trust Wallet also has slightly higher in-app swap fees than Binance or Coinbase. For small amounts, it is very convenient to use the swap feature, but for larger amounts, you should use a different provider with lower fees. Exodus – Best for Desktop and Ease of Use Exodus is a good option for users who like to visualize their wallet alongside their portfolio, as the interface shows pie charts to represent the wallet holdings, and historical graphs to illustrate the user’s activity throughout the networks (so, for instance, users can see Tether USD on TRON). The main benefit of Exodus is being a bridge to Trezor hardware wallets. Managing TRC-20 USDT through Exodus is more secure since your Trezor keys stay locked, but Exodus gives a more feature-rich interface than Trezor, which is more limited. Like Trust Wallet, Exodus also offers swaps, but for the same reasons as before, they have high fees, and we do not recommend it. Other than that, Exodus is a good option and is easy to use on a PC. MetaMask – Best for DeFi Action MetaMask is the best for Ethereum-based DeFi apps. If you want to lend USDT on Aave, get some liquidity on Uniswap, or connect to any dApp, you probably need MetaMask. For a long time, MetaMask only supported Ethereum and a handful of EVM-compatible chains such as the BNB Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. They didn’t even support Tron until the MetaMask and TRON DAO announcement for new native integrations for both MetaMask and Tron. Finally, for the first time, you could use MetaMask for TRC-20 USDT. However, the risk is still there as it is still possible to get phished on MetaMask and approve a sketchy transaction. As the most popular wallet, it gets targeted the most. MetaMask has new features to warn you before making a transaction, but it’s not a guaranteed solution. Connecting a hardware wallet like a Ledger or a Trezor is a good idea so that any transaction still requires a paper sign on the device. About the “Official” Tether Wallet There is no official Tether wallet. If you see an app claiming to be the “Official Tether Wallet,” it is most likely not real – fake wallet scams are super common. Tether has released a Wallet Development Kit (WDK) to developers who are building payments infrastructures, and it is believed there will be a wallet geared towards consumers, focusing on the Bitcoin Lightning Network, USDT, and gold-backed XAUT. However, the current recommendation is to use the third-party, non-custodial wallets mentioned above. Choosing the Right Tether Wallet Choosing the right wallet for USDT depends on your needs and usage. Security Model If you’re storing loads of USDT that you can’t afford to lose, we highly recommend one of the hardware wallets. Software wallets are at risk from phone theft, computer compromise, and the like. If security is your priority, hardware is where it’s at. Network Support Do you want TRC-20 to save on transfer costs? Ledger has that covered, but Trezor doesn’t. Are you using Layer 2s like Arbitrum? MetaMask and Ledger are both compatible with that, while some of the mobile wallets are a bit behind the game. If you transact USDT on some of the lesser-known networks, think about the native network for support. Cross-Chain Swaps Since wallets with integrated swap functionalities allow you to convert USDT from ERC-20 to USDT on TRC-20 without leaving the wallet, we recommend those services. Just know you may incur higher fees than you would on a centralized exchange. Dapp Usage Most software wallets work with dApps, and hardware wallets are often better for USDT in higher amounts. So use those if you can. Step-by-Step: A Guide to Receiving USDT Safely Getting your USDT into your wallet safely is a no-brainer as long as you stick to a consistent process. Setting Up The Wallet Install your chosen wallet directly from the official source – the vendor’s website for desktop apps or verified listings in the App Store or Google Play for mobile. Never ever download wallet software from dodgy third-party sites, ads, or links that land in your inbox. When you start setting up, you’ll get a 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. Write this down on a bit of paper (no notes apps, screenshots, or cloud storage). This phrase is the master key to all your hard-earned crypto. If it falls into the wrong hands, your funds will be completely drained. Keep it in a super secure spot, ideally in two different places. Finding Your Wallet Address Your wallet will generate a unique receiving address for each network it supports. These addresses don’t translate between networks, and you can’t just swap them out. For TRC-20 USDT, you’ll need to find your TRON address – it looks like TXj7… and starts with “T”. For ERC-20 USDT, it’s your Ethereum address, starting with “0x” and looking a bit like 0xAbC… And for BEP-20 USDT, your BNB Chain address will also have a “0x,” but that’s a whole different network. While the Binance and Ethereum addresses look similar, sending funds to the wrong network can result in permanent loss of funds on platforms such as exchanges. Most of the time, all you need to do is navigate to “Receive”, select “USDT”, pick the specific network, and the app will display a QR code and the address for that specific network. The $10 Test Transaction Rule If you’re doing a large transaction, first send a small test transaction to make sure everything is working as it should. Wait for it to confirm and check that it pops up in your wallet. Only then can you send the rest. This $10 test will cost a few cents in fees, but it’s a tiny price to pay to avoid making an expensive mistake. Security Risks And Scams To Watch Out For Crypto scams have become so sophisticated these days that they’re no longer just about phishy emails. Here’s what’s actually going on and how to steer clear of it. Address Poisoning Scammers have set up automated bots monitoring the blockchain. When they see you making a transaction, they make a fake transaction that looks almost identical at the same time. So the next time you try to copy the recipient’s address, you might accidentally use the scammer’s address from your transaction history instead of the real one. Staying Safe: Never copy the address from your transaction history. Use an address book or a whitelist feature. Additionally, carefully check multiple parts of the address every time you make a transaction. Fake Wallet Apps Scammers pay for ads for search terms like “Ledger Live download” or “Trust Wallet app.” Their fake apps look like the real deal, but will ask you to type in your recovery phrase to “sync” or “verify” your account. Sometimes they even manage to enter the app store. The moment you enter that 12 or 24-word phrase into a dodgy app, automated bots will drain your wallet in seconds. Staying safe: Legitimate hardware wallets will never ask you to enter your recovery phrase on a phone or computer. That phrase only goes on the device’s tiny screen. For software wallets, only download them from official vendor websites and double-check the URL. Blind Signing / Malicious Approvals After approving some transactions, your digital wallet shows a hash or a sketchy confirmation message, which you easily click approve. That transaction was for unlimited token approval for a bad contract, and you just lost all your USDT. Staying safe: Use wallets with transaction simulation (Rabby, Ledger Flex, MetaMask’s updated interface) that show you what a transaction will do before you sign it. If a dApp does not give you what you need to make an informed decision, do not approve it. Wrong Network Transfers Sending BEP-20 USDT to an Ethereum address you control isn’t catastrophic. When you switch networks to BNB Chain, your funds will appear. However, sending ERC-20 USDT to an exchange that only supports TRC-20. Recovery depends on the exchange; some are assistive, while others will help for a 50 to 500-dollar fee. Staying safe: The rule of test transactions catches these mistakes before they are expensive. Final Verdict For most users, the decision is simple: Start with a software wallet. Holding more than $1,000? Get a hardware wallet. Ledger Flex ($249) includes on-device transaction detail verification. Are TRC-20 payments and transfers your primary use? For using the TRON network, Trust Wallet and Ledger are the best options for daily use. Are you an active DeFi user? MetaMask is the best for dApp integrations. With built-in TRON support, it covers all major networks. For security, link it to a hardware wallet. You may consider a wallet the best for you based on the network and security needs. A Ledger Flex $249 is excessive for someone who makes $50 TRC-20 payments. A Trust Wallet using $50,000 in stablecoins is reckless. Wallet payments need to be aligned with the use case.",Cryptocurrency Guides|Exodus|Ledger|MetaMask|Trezor|Trust Wallet,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|USDT|WALLET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-14 11:35:00

The UK-based firm already handles over $30 billion worth of stablecoin transactions annually. Through the partnership, BVNK manages the process of moving and settling the stablecoins across supported markets. Visa, in turn, links that capability to its worldwide payout network. Consequently, businesses can access blockchain settlement without having to build their own infrastructure for managing digital assets. Visa first invested in BVNK through its venture arm in May 2025. Five months later, Citigroup made a strategic investment in the company backing the stablecoin platform. These investments indicate the growing institutional support of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The companies confirmed that the rollout will start in areas where there is strong demand for digital asset payments. However, they did not mention specific markets for the initial phase. Expansion decisions will be based on customer demand and business use cases, according to Visa. Additionally, according to the announcement, all transactions will still be subject to local compliance and regulatory requirements. Visa stressed that the integration is in line with its existing risk and governance frameworks. As a result, stablecoin payouts will be subject to the same standards as used across Visa’s large payment ecosystem. It is worth noting that Visa reported that its stablecoin settlement run rate had topped 3.5 billion per annum as of November 2025. In addition to the BVNK pilot, Visa has begun allowing U.S. banks to make transactions in USDC, a dollar-backed stablecoin, over the Solana blockchain. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

57156386,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261444,1768391114,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bybit Delisting: Strategic Removal of 6 USDT Spot Trading Pairs Including MEMEFI Signals Market Evolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-delisting-usdt-trading-pairs/,"BitcoinWorld Bybit Delisting: Strategic Removal of 6 USDT Spot Trading Pairs Including MEMEFI Signals Market Evolution In a significant market development on January 21, 2025, cryptocurrency exchange Bybit announced the strategic delisting of six USDT spot trading pairs, marking another evolution in digital asset market structure. The exchange will remove MEMEFI/USDT, RACA/USDT, ART/USDT, SPEC/USDT, XCAD/USDT, and MYRO/USDT from its platform at precisely 8:00 a.m. UTC, affecting thousands of traders globally. This Bybit delisting decision follows comprehensive quarterly reviews of trading pair performance and aligns with broader industry trends toward market consolidation. Bybit Delisting Decision: Analyzing the Six Affected Assets Bybit’s announcement specifically targets six distinct digital assets paired with Tether’s USDT stablecoin. Consequently, the exchange will remove MEMEFI, a meme-inspired utility token, from its active trading roster. Additionally, the delisting affects RACA (Radio Caca), a metaverse and gaming ecosystem token. The decision also includes ART (Maecenas), a platform for tokenizing fine art. Furthermore, SPEC (Spectre.ai), a derivatives trading platform token, faces removal. The exchange will also delist XCAD, a content creator monetization token. Finally, MYRO, a Solana-based meme token, completes the list of affected assets. Market analysts immediately noted several common characteristics among the delisted tokens. Primarily, these assets demonstrated consistently low trading volumes throughout 2024. Moreover, they showed limited liquidity depth across multiple exchanges. The tokens also exhibited higher volatility relative to their market capitalization. Significantly, they maintained weaker price correlation with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These factors collectively contributed to Bybit’s risk assessment framework triggering the delisting protocol. Cryptocurrency Exchange Regulatory Compliance and Market Standards The cryptocurrency exchange landscape has undergone substantial regulatory evolution since 2023. Specifically, global standards now require more rigorous listing maintenance procedures. Bybit’s decision reflects these heightened compliance requirements. Furthermore, the exchange operates under multiple jurisdictional frameworks. Therefore, it must balance innovation with regulatory obligations. The delisting announcement demonstrates this careful balancing act. Industry observers point to several regulatory developments influencing this decision. Notably, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in Europe established clearer delisting criteria. Similarly, the United States SEC guidance on digital asset securities created new compliance layers. Additionally, Asian financial authorities implemented stricter market surveillance requirements. These regulatory shifts collectively pressure exchanges to maintain higher quality standards. Consequently, periodic portfolio reviews became standard industry practice by early 2025. Trading Volume Analysis and Market Impact Assessment Detailed trading data reveals why Bybit selected these specific pairs for removal. According to exchange statistics from Q4 2024, the six assets showed concerning metrics. For instance, MEMEFI/USDT recorded average daily volumes below $50,000. Similarly, RACA/USDT maintained volumes under $75,000 daily. Meanwhile, ART/USDT struggled to reach $30,000 in daily trading activity. These figures represent less than 0.01% of Bybit’s total spot volume. Delisted Trading Pairs Performance Metrics (Q4 2024) Asset Average Daily Volume Price Change (90 Days) Liquidity Score MEMEFI $48,200 -34.2% 2.1/10 RACA $71,800 -18.7% 3.4/10 ART $28,500 -42.5% 1.8/10 SPEC $52,100 -29.8% 2.5/10 XCAD $63,400 -15.3% 3.1/10 MYRO $56,900 -38.6% 2.3/10 The market impact extends beyond simple volume metrics. Importantly, affected traders received multiple notifications before the deadline. Bybit’s communication strategy included email alerts, in-app notifications, and public announcements. The exchange also provided clear withdrawal timelines. Users can transfer assets to external wallets until February 21, 2025. After this date, remaining balances may face conversion or forfeiture according to terms of service. Expert Analysis: Exchange Strategy and Market Health Indicators Financial technology analysts interpret this move as strategically positive. According to market structure experts, regular delistings indicate healthy exchange management. They demonstrate proactive risk mitigation. Furthermore, they reflect responsive platform governance. Industry observers note that top exchanges now conduct quarterly reviews. These reviews assess multiple performance dimensions. The dimensions include trading volume, liquidity depth, and regulatory compliance. They also evaluate technological integration and community engagement. Market strategists emphasize several broader implications. First, the delisting reduces platform fragmentation. Second, it concentrates liquidity in stronger assets. Third, it enhances overall market efficiency. Fourth, it signals maturity in cryptocurrency market operations. Historical data supports this perspective. Major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase conducted similar reviews throughout 2024. Their actions removed underperforming assets while adding promising new listings. This cycle represents normal market evolution rather than negative disruption. Historical Context: Cryptocurrency Market Evolution Since 2020 The current delisting wave continues patterns established in previous market cycles. Specifically, the 2021-2022 period saw numerous exchange listings. Many projects launched during favorable market conditions. However, the 2023-2024 consolidation phase tested their sustainability. Projects with weak fundamentals naturally struggled. Consequently, exchanges began removing underperforming assets systematically. This process accelerated throughout 2024. Several key developments shaped this evolution. Initially, the 2022 market downturn exposed weak projects. Then, increased regulatory scrutiny raised compliance costs. Meanwhile, institutional adoption demanded higher quality standards. Additionally, technological advancements required better integration. These factors created natural selection pressure. Stronger projects survived while weaker ones faced delisting. The current Bybit action reflects this ongoing market maturation. Investor Implications and Risk Management Strategies Traders holding affected assets face several immediate considerations. First, they must decide between selling or transferring tokens. Second, they should assess tax implications in their jurisdiction. Third, they need to evaluate alternative trading venues. Fourth, they might reconsider investment thesis for these assets. Professional investors typically follow established protocols during delistings. Immediate Action: Review position sizes and execute necessary trades before deadline Platform Research: Identify alternative exchanges listing these assets Portfolio Rebalancing: Assess whether to maintain, reduce, or eliminate exposure Tax Documentation: Record all transactions for accurate reporting Market Monitoring: Watch for price volatility around delisting dates Risk management becomes particularly crucial during delisting events. Typically, affected assets experience increased volatility. Liquidity often diminishes before removal. Sometimes, price discrepancies emerge across exchanges. Therefore, investors should exercise additional caution. Setting limit orders rather than market orders proves advisable. Monitoring order book depth also helps avoid unfavorable executions. Conclusion Bybit’s delisting of six USDT spot trading pairs represents standard market maintenance in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The exchange’s decision to remove MEMEFI, RACA, ART, SPEC, XCAD, and MYRO follows comprehensive performance reviews and aligns with global regulatory trends. This Bybit delisting action demonstrates the platform’s commitment to market quality, risk management, and regulatory compliance. As the digital asset industry matures, such periodic portfolio optimizations will likely continue across all major exchanges. Investors should view these developments as signs of market maturation rather than negative indicators, while maintaining vigilant risk management practices during transition periods. FAQs Q1: What happens to my tokens after Bybit delists these trading pairs? You can continue holding the tokens in your Bybit wallet or withdraw them to an external wallet until February 21, 2025. After this date, Bybit may convert or remove remaining balances according to their terms of service. Q2: Can I still trade these assets on other exchanges after the Bybit delisting? Yes, many of these assets remain listed on other cryptocurrency exchanges. However, you should verify current listings and liquidity on alternative platforms before making trading decisions. Q3: Why did Bybit specifically choose these six assets for delisting? Bybit typically delists assets based on multiple factors including low trading volume, poor liquidity, regulatory concerns, and weak market performance. These six assets showed consistently low metrics across these categories throughout 2024. Q4: Will Bybit compensate users for any losses due to this delisting?

This analysis provides a structured, evidence-based examination of Ethereum’s potential price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, specifically addressing the widely discussed possibility of ETH reaching the $10,000 threshold. We will ground our exploration in verifiable network data, historical performance, and the fundamental technological upgrades shaping its future. Ethereum’s Foundational Context and 2025 Baseline Understanding future price predictions requires a firm grasp of present conditions. Consequently, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism via “The Merge” fundamentally altered its economic model. This shift significantly reduced new ETH issuance, creating a potentially deflationary pressure during periods of high network usage. Furthermore, ongoing developments like proto-danksharding aim to drastically enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees. These technical milestones provide the essential backdrop for any forward-looking assessment. Market analysts consistently emphasize that Ethereum’s price is not merely speculative but increasingly tied to utility metrics like daily active addresses, total value locked in DeFi, and network revenue. Methodology for Long-Term Cryptocurrency Forecasting Responsible price prediction avoids simple extrapolation. Instead, it synthesizes multiple analytical frameworks. First, quantitative models like stock-to-flow adaptations and Metcalfe’s Law-based valuations offer one perspective by correlating network size with value. Second, qualitative analysis of ecosystem growth is crucial. This includes tracking developer activity, major institutional adoption narratives, and regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union. Finally, comparative analysis against traditional asset classes and macroeconomic indicators, such as inflation rates and monetary policy, provides essential context. Experts from firms like CoinShares and ARK Invest regularly publish reports integrating these diverse data points. The $10,000 Question: A Scenario Analysis The prospect of ETH reaching $10,000 represents a significant increase from its early 2025 price point. Achieving this milestone would likely require the convergence of several positive catalysts. A primary driver would be the massive, scalable adoption of Ethereum for real-world asset tokenization, decentralized social media, and next-generation gaming. Simultaneously, the approval and subsequent success of a U.S. spot Ethereum ETF could unlock substantial institutional capital flows. From a supply perspective, the net deflationary trend would need to persist, effectively reducing the circulating supply over time. It is critical to note that such a price target also implies a total market capitalization that would place Ethereum among the world’s largest financial assets, a scenario carrying its own set of assumptions about global crypto adoption. Year-by-Year Analysis: 2026 to 2030 Breaking down the long-term horizon into shorter intervals allows for more nuanced analysis. The following table outlines potential price ranges based on different adoption scenarios, synthesizing consensus views from multiple analytical reports. Year Conservative Scenario Moderate Adoption Scenario Aggressive Adoption Scenario Key Catalysts 2026 $4,500 – $6,000 $6,000 – $8,000 $8,000+ Full rollout of scaling solutions, ETF inflows. 2027 $5,500 – $7,500 $7,500 – $9,500 $9,500+ Mature DeFi & NFT markets, enterprise use cases. 2030 $7,000 – $9,000 $9,000 – $12,000 $12,000+ Global regulatory clarity, Web3 mass adoption. These ranges are not predictions but illustrative frameworks. The conservative scenario assumes linear growth tied to broader financial markets. Conversely, the moderate scenario incorporates successful technological execution and steady adoption. Finally, the aggressive scenario reflects a “hyper-financialization” of the Ethereum ecosystem. Notably, each scenario must account for inherent market volatility and potential black swan events. Critical Risk Factors and Counterarguments A balanced analysis must rigorously examine potential headwinds. Several significant risks could impede progress toward higher price targets: Technological Competition: Rival layer-1 and layer-2 networks may capture market share if they offer superior scalability or lower costs. Regulatory Pressure: Unfavorable legislation in major economies could stifle innovation and limit institutional participation. Macroeconomic Downturns: Cryptocurrency markets often correlate with risk-off environments during recessions or periods of monetary tightening. Network Security Challenges: While robust, the proof-of-stake system must continually prove itself against novel attack vectors. Execution Risk: Delays or failures in implementing the full Ethereum roadmap could erode developer and user confidence. Prominent skeptics, including some traditional finance economists, argue that cryptocurrency valuations still lack a universally accepted fundamental anchor. They point to historical boom-and-bust cycles as evidence of persistent speculation. Therefore, any long-term forecast must acknowledge this inherent uncertainty. Conclusion In summary, the Ethereum price prediction for the period 2026 to 2030 hinges on a complex interplay of technological execution, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments. While a path to a $10,000 ETH by 2030 exists within plausible adoption scenarios, it is far from guaranteed. The network’s foundational strengths—its vast developer community, established ecosystem, and ongoing upgrades—provide a solid basis for long-term optimism. However, investors and observers should prioritize understanding these underlying fundamentals over fixating on specific price points. The true measure of Ethereum’s success by 2030 may be less about its dollar price and more about its proven utility in building a more open and efficient digital economy. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for Ethereum’s price growth by 2030? The single most critical factor is the successful, large-scale adoption of its technology for applications beyond speculation, such as tokenized real-world assets and decentralized infrastructure. Q2: How does Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake affect its long-term value? The transition to proof-of-stake reduces ETH issuance and energy consumption, potentially making the asset more appealing to institutional investors focused on environmental and governance criteria. Q3: Could a Bitcoin market crash derail Ethereum’s price predictions? Historically, high correlation exists between major crypto assets. A severe, prolonged Bitcoin downturn would likely pressure Ethereum’s price in the short-to-medium term, though long-term divergence based on utility is possible. Q4: What role will Ethereum ETFs play in its price trajectory? Approved spot Ethereum ETFs would provide a regulated, accessible channel for traditional finance capital to gain exposure, potentially increasing buying pressure and stabilizing volatility. Q5: Are the $10,000 predictions for ETH simply hype? While some predictions are undoubtedly speculative, serious analyses tying the $10,000 target to specific adoption metrics and supply dynamics exist.

The coin is currently rallying thanks to growing retail demand fueled by rising trading volume and Open Interest (OI). With the funding rates also positive and the momentum indicators switching bullish, ZIL could rally towards the $0.0065 mark for the first time since December. On-chain data paints a bullish picture for Zilliqa ZIL has added 13% to its value in the last two days, outperforming the major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP. Data obtained from Santiment shows that ZIL’s ecosystem trading volume hit $92.59 million on Monday, the highest level since July 4, and steadied at around $27.46 million on Wednesday. The surge in trading volume suggests that traders are regaining interest in Zilliqa, adding more liquidity to the market and boosting its bullish outlook. Furthermore, derivatives data support a bullish outlook for ZIL. CoinGlass’s data reveals that ZIL futures OI across exchanges reached $13.48 million on Tuesday, the highest level since October 11. With the OI on the rise, additional money is entering the ZIL ecosystem, with more traders taking long positions over shorts in the market. ZIL’s OI-Weighted Funding Rate also reveals that traders betting on ZIL’s price declining are lower than those expecting it to rally higher. The OI flipped to a positive rate, standing at 0.0059% on Wednesday, indicating that longs are paying shorts. When this happens, ZIL’s price has rallied in the near term. ZIL bulls target the $0.0065 resistance level The ZIL/USDT 4-hour chart has switched bullish since adding 13% to its value in the last two days. The rally allowed it to close above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.0055 and briefly hit the $0.0062 resistance level. ZIL encountered resistance around the $0.0062 and has slightly retraced to now trade at $0.0058 per coin. If the daily candle closes above the $0.0058 level, ZIL could overcome the wick at $0.0062 and rally towards $0.0065 for the first time in nearly two months. An extended rally could see ZIL hit the $0.00682 psychological level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart is 57, above the neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum is gaining traction. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish crossover that remains intact, adding further confluence for the buyers. However, if ZIL fails to close the daily candle above $0.0058, the correction could extend towards the 50-day EMA at $0.0055. The Sunday low of $0.00510 could also be revisited if the bearish trend extends further. Currently, the market conditions are bullish, and this could see ZIL’s price rally higher in the near term.

This strategic threshold represents a pivotal moment for corporate cryptocurrency adoption, potentially enabling Metaplanet to significantly expand its already substantial Bitcoin treasury of 35,102 BTC. The company’s calculated approach to digital asset accumulation continues to draw attention from both traditional finance and cryptocurrency sectors, particularly as global institutions increasingly recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a treasury reserve asset. Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: The 637 Yen Threshold Explained Financial analysts confirm that Metaplanet requires its stock to reach 637 yen per share to activate its share issuance authorization. Currently trading slightly below this critical level, the company needs approximately a 5% gain to cross this threshold. Upon reaching this price point, Metaplanet gains authorization to issue up to 210 million new shares through market offerings. Company executives have explicitly stated their intention to allocate these proceeds primarily toward additional Bitcoin purchases, continuing their established corporate strategy of accumulating digital assets as treasury reserves. This strategic move follows Metaplanet’s established pattern of using equity financing to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. The company first announced its Bitcoin treasury strategy in early 2024, positioning itself as Japan’s most prominent publicly-traded Bitcoin holder. Market observers note that the 5% gap represents both a technical financial threshold and a psychological market barrier. Furthermore, the company’s transparent communication about its Bitcoin allocation intentions provides investors with clear insight into capital deployment strategies. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Japan’s Leading Example Metaplanet currently maintains Japan’s largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, holding approximately 35,102 BTC valued at over $2.4 billion at current market prices. The company’s systematic approach to Bitcoin accumulation has positioned it as a case study in corporate digital asset strategy. Unlike speculative trading approaches, Metaplanet treats Bitcoin as a long-term treasury reserve asset, similar to how corporations traditionally hold gold or foreign currency reserves. This strategic positioning aligns with growing institutional recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. Japanese corporate Bitcoin adoption has accelerated significantly since 2023, with several listed companies following Metaplanet’s lead. The country’s regulatory clarity regarding cryptocurrency holdings for corporations has created an environment conducive to such strategic moves. Additionally, Japan’s prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and yen volatility has prompted corporations to seek alternative treasury assets. Metaplanet’s public commitment to Bitcoin provides other Japanese companies with a regulatory-compliant blueprint for digital asset adoption. Financial Mechanics of Share Issuance for Bitcoin Acquisition The financial mechanism behind Metaplanet’s strategy involves several calculated steps. First, the company must achieve the 637 yen share price threshold to make new share issuance financially viable and attractive to investors. Once this price level is reached, Metaplanet can issue up to 210 million new shares through public offerings. The proceeds from this equity issuance would then be converted primarily to Bitcoin through regulated cryptocurrency exchanges or over-the-counter trading desks. This approach offers multiple advantages. Equity financing provides non-dilutive capital for Bitcoin purchases without incurring debt. Additionally, issuing shares at a higher valuation maximizes capital raised per share issued. The strategy also aligns shareholder interests with Bitcoin’s performance, as the company’s treasury value directly correlates with cryptocurrency market movements. Financial analysts note that this creates a unique feedback loop where Bitcoin price appreciation could potentially drive further share price increases, enabling additional equity issuance for more Bitcoin purchases. Market Implications and Investor Considerations The potential issuance of 210 million new shares represents significant market activity with multiple implications. For existing shareholders, dilution concerns must be balanced against potential treasury appreciation from additional Bitcoin acquisitions. Market liquidity would increase substantially with such a large share issuance, potentially affecting trading dynamics. Furthermore, the explicit linkage between share issuance proceeds and Bitcoin purchases creates a direct correlation between Metaplanet’s equity performance and cryptocurrency market movements. Investors considering Metaplanet shares must evaluate several factors. The company’s valuation now incorporates both traditional business metrics and Bitcoin treasury valuation. Share price movements may reflect both corporate performance and Bitcoin market sentiment. Additionally, regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency holdings could impact the company’s strategic flexibility. The transparency of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin allocation strategy provides clarity but also creates specific risk exposures that investors must acknowledge. Comparative Analysis: Global Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Metaplanet’s approach differs from other corporate Bitcoin strategies in several key aspects. Unlike MicroStrategy’s aggressive debt-financed accumulation, Metaplanet utilizes equity financing. Compared to Tesla’s more trading-oriented approach, Metaplanet maintains a strict treasury reserve strategy. The Japanese company’s method most closely resembles traditional gold accumulation strategies employed by mining companies or certain national reserves. Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Comparison Company Bitcoin Holdings Primary Acquisition Method Strategy Type Metaplanet 35,102 BTC Equity Financing Treasury Reserve MicroStrategy 226,331 BTC Debt & Cash Flow Primary Treasury Asset Tesla Approx. 10,800 BTC Corporate Cash Trading & Treasury This comparative analysis reveals Metaplanet’s distinctive positioning within corporate Bitcoin adoption. The company’s focus on equity financing rather than debt accumulation creates different risk profiles and financial implications. Additionally, Metaplanet’s pure treasury approach contrasts with more active trading strategies employed by some corporations. These strategic differences highlight the evolving nature of corporate digital asset management as businesses develop specialized approaches matching their specific circumstances and risk tolerances. Regulatory Environment and Future Developments Japan’s regulatory framework has evolved to accommodate corporate cryptocurrency holdings while maintaining investor protections. The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has established clear guidelines for cryptocurrency accounting and disclosure. These regulations require corporations to mark Bitcoin holdings to market value quarterly and disclose significant holdings in financial statements. This regulatory clarity has enabled Metaplanet to pursue its Bitcoin strategy with confidence regarding compliance requirements. Future developments could significantly impact Metaplanet’s strategic flexibility. Potential regulatory changes, tax treatment adjustments, or accounting standard revisions might affect the attractiveness of corporate Bitcoin holdings. Additionally, developments in cryptocurrency custody solutions, particularly institutional-grade options with insurance coverage, could influence risk management approaches. The evolution of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Japan might provide alternative exposure mechanisms for corporations considering digital asset allocation. Conclusion Metaplanet’s pursuit of a 5% stock gain to enable share issuance for Bitcoin purchases represents a calculated strategic move within Japan’s evolving corporate finance landscape. The 637 yen threshold serves as both a financial trigger and symbolic milestone for corporate cryptocurrency adoption. As Metaplanet continues accumulating Bitcoin through equity financing, it provides a distinctive model for other corporations considering digital asset treasury strategies. The company’s transparent approach to Bitcoin allocation, combined with Japan’s regulatory clarity, creates a compelling case study in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Market observers will closely monitor whether Metaplanet achieves its target share price and how subsequent Bitcoin acquisitions impact both its treasury reserves and shareholder value. FAQs Q1: What specific stock price does Metaplanet need to reach to issue new shares for Bitcoin purchases? Metaplanet must reach a share price of 637 yen, representing approximately a 5% increase from recent trading levels, to authorize the issuance of new shares specifically for Bitcoin acquisitions. Q2: How many Bitcoin does Metaplanet currently hold in its corporate treasury? The Japanese investment firm currently holds 35,102 Bitcoin in its corporate treasury, making it Japan’s largest publicly-traded corporate Bitcoin holder with holdings valued at over $2.4 billion. Q3: What is the maximum number of new shares Metaplanet can issue for Bitcoin funding? Upon reaching the 637 yen threshold, Metaplanet gains authorization to issue up to 210 million new shares, with proceeds primarily allocated to additional Bitcoin purchases according to company disclosures. Q4: How does Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy differ from other corporations like MicroStrategy? Unlike MicroStrategy’s debt-financed accumulation, Metaplanet utilizes equity financing through share issuance. The Japanese company also maintains a pure treasury reserve approach rather than more active trading strategies. Q5: What are the potential risks for investors considering Metaplanet shares given its Bitcoin strategy? Investors face dilution from potential share issuance, Bitcoin market volatility exposure, regulatory changes affecting cryptocurrency holdings, and the unique valuation methodology required for companies holding significant digital assets.

Prices kept climbing as supply pressure, political risk, and new doubts around central bank independence pulled more money into metals. On Monday, gold cleared $4,600 an ounce after news broke that Jerome Powell, chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, is under criminal investigation linked to the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. By early Wednesday, spot gold traded around $4,633.46 an ounce. Silver also stayed hot. It broke above $90 for the first time on Tuesday and later traded 3.5% higher at $90.42 per ounce, as Cryptopolitan is reporting . The gains followed a brutal year for anyone betting against metals. In 2025, spot gold rose about 65% and hit multiple records. Silver climbed roughly 150% over the same period. The run did not fade in January. Gold is up 7.1% so far this year, while silver has already added 26.6%. Money managers now say the same forces that drove last year’s rally remain in place, with few signs of relief on supply or geopolitics. Trade conflicts and resource controls tighten supply Daniel Casali, a partner in investment strategy at Evelyn Partners, said his team remains positive on both metals. He pointed to ongoing geopolitical stress, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and President Donald Trump’s “liberation day” tariff announcements last April, as drivers that continue to support gold prices. “When Trump started to raise tariffs, China started to respond, so they pulled out what I would define as a battle between the U.S. and China of resource nationalism,” Daniel said. He said China answered those tariffs by restricting rare earth exports, which exposed how critical those materials are to U.S. defense, technology, and AI supply chains. He added that export limits later extended to silver, a key input for AI hardware, electric vehicles, renewables, and industrial production across the U.S. and Europe. Investors are now watching for a possible in-person meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi in April. “How that goes? No idea,” Daniel said. “But you bet your bottom dollar export controls are going to be a key discussion point.” Political risk rose again in the first week of 2026 after the U.S. removed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the White House discussed possible military action to bring Greenland under U.S. control. Daniel said both Washington and Beijing are lining up resources to gain leverage. China controls exports of rare earths and silver, while Trump is working to restrict flows of Venezuelan oil that largely go to China. Price targets rise as shortages and policy risk persist Ned Naylor‑Leyland, an investment manager at Jupiter Asset Management, said he said it was “absolutely” possible for gold to reach $5,000 this year and for silver to break $100. Based on current conditions, he said investors “should assume that that would definitely happen this year.” Ned said silver remains the tighter market. He pointed to shortages caused by Beijing’s export controls. “Silver is basically disappearing now to China and India, there’s about a $10 premium being paid in Shanghai,” he said. He added that trading now centers on physical bars, not screens. Silver plays a critical role across industries, from computers and phones to cars, appliances, and weapons systems. “The thing about silver is, if you don’t have it, you can’t build anything,” Ned said. “Whether it’s electronics or white goods or missiles or cars, you don’t have it, you can’t have it.” On gold, he said wider political risk and easier monetary policy remain key. “The base case with gold is presuming central banks remain dovish,” he said. “We’re in a rate cutting environment with unconventional policies and chasing down Chairman Powell. Unless they reverse course and start hiking, you can expect gold to do pretty much what it did last year or more.” Paul Syms, head of EMEA ETF fixed income and commodity product management at Invesco, said the same trends look even stronger now. He added that Powell’s investigation raised fresh concerns about Fed independence and U.S. monetary policy. A dozen global central bankers, including the heads of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, later issued a statement backing Powell. Paul said with ongoing worries around the dollar, budget deficits, lower rates, high geopolitical tension, and rising industrial demand for silver, there is no clear near term trigger that points to falling metal prices.

The ad with the World Cup winner Julián Álvarez uses football culture to explain Bitget’s UEX plan. Bitget is running on a vision to unify access to crypto, tokenized stocks, gold, forex, and derivatives for traders. Bitget, the world’s largest Universal Exchange (UEX), has released a new global video featuring World Cup winner Julián Álvarez, using football culture to explain a simple idea, which is “if you want to trade the world, you should not have to shop around.” The video brings Bitget’s Universal Exchange vision to life through a familiar setting for football fans. Set inside a stylized football megastore, Álvarez browses match-day essentials that double as investment cues. Crypto takes the place of footballs, stocks show up as shin guards, and forex is laced into boots built for speed. Bitget taps World Cup winner in new ad The visual language does the heavy lifting, turning a complex multi-asset idea into something instantly intuitive: everything a trader needs, under one roof. The creative lands on Bitget’s core proposition as it evolves into a universal exchange , offering unified access to crypto, tokenized stocks, gold, forex, and derivatives through a single account. Instead of switching platforms as markets move, users can rotate capital across asset classes with greater efficiency, transparency, and flexibility. The video captures this shift in a way that feels familiar to football fans and translates seamlessly to traders who value speed, coverage, and control. Bitget doubles down on trader convenience in UEX push “Just as a professional footballer needs access to the best equipment in one place, Bitget gives traders seamless access to diverse asset classes within one platform,” said Ignacio Aguirre, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget. “That convenience is a competitive edge.” Álvarez’s role in the campaign reflects the same principles behind UEX. Consistency, readiness, and the ability to adapt as the game changes. As markets become increasingly interconnected and trade around the clock, Bitget’s infrastructure is designed to support continuous access and smarter capital deployment across asset classes without compromising liquidity or cost. The new video is now live across Bitget’s global channels and marks the latest step in the brand’s push to blend culture, sport, and trading education in the UEX era. As Bitget continues to expand market coverage and roll out additional multi-asset capabilities, the message behind the campaign stays the same. Trade smarter. Stay ready.

They note that on 14 January, US President Donald Trump launched an attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell has the support of several major central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada. “This episode is not merely a personnel dispute, but a repricing of confidence in the monetary policy framework itself,” the analysts say. “For the crypto market, the core macro variables remain the duration of elevated interest rates and the credibility of policy institutions.” They continue: “If concerns over central bank independence continue to widen—driving volatility in the dollar and real yields—crypto asset volatility is likely to increase. Conversely, if markets regain confidence that the policy path is not being politically distorted, BTC may re-enter a bullish rhythm following a period of structural consolidation. Crypto markets should remain highly attentive to how shifts in the macro narrative cascade into changes in overall risk appetite.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC stood at $94,953. The coin started the day at the lowest point of $91,820. It relatively gradually appreciated to the intraday high of $95,804, before slightly correcting to the current price. BTC remains green in the 7-day timeframe as well, having appreciated 3% over a week. It has been trading in the $89,799–$95,724 range. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView In the near term, BTC will likely continue to trade between $80,000 and $96,000. Yet, a break above $98,000 could lead to $100,000, and a decisive breakout above that could open doors toward the $116,000-$120,000 level. Should it go red, we could see levels below $80,000 and $70,000. Moreover, Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,328. For the majority of the past 24 hours, it traded between the intraday low of $3,119 and $3,210. However, it then jumped to the intraday high of $3,350. Over the past 7 days, ETH has gone up 2.7%. It moved between $3,068 and $3,350. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time If ETH continues rising, it could see $3,450, after which the path may open for higher levels of $3,600 and $3,850. A firm breakout above this level could lead to ETH reclaiming the $4,000 zone. On the other hand, a drop could push the price back down towards $3,000, while stronger pressure would lead to the sub-$3,000 levels.

The crypto fear and greed index stands at 52 today , compared to 41 we’ve been seeing over the past few days. Though still in the neutral territory, the metric no longer borders the fear zone and is approaching the greed zone, which it hasn’t seen since a brief spike in October 2025. While the caution remains, it’s clear that optimism amongst market participants is increasing. It’s still unclear if this is a brief rise or a part of a longer-term trend. ETFs Go Green On Tuesday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a second straight day of positive flows, adding $753.73 million in total, the highest level since October. With this, the total net inflow increased to $57.27 billion. Seven of the twelve ETFs posted inflows, and none recorded outflows. Fidelity was at the top, taking in $351.36 million. It’s followed by Bitwise and BlackRock with $159.42 million and $126.27 million, respectively. Moreover, the US ETH ETFs posted positive flows on 13 January as well, totalling $129.99 million . This is a significant jump compared to the minor inflows of the day prior. The latest amount increased the total net inflow to $12.57 billion. Of the nine funds, five saw inflows, and none saw outflows again. The highest among these is BlackRock’s $53.31 million. Grayscale is next with inflows of $39.35 million recorded on the same day. Meanwhile, a recent Bitwise and VettaFi survey found that 32% of financial advisors allocated to crypto in client accounts in 2025. This is up from 22% in 2024, setting an all-time high for the series. Advisors picked crypto equity ETFs as their top exposure for 2026, while their next choice was spot crypto ETFs at 16%. #10: CRYPTO EQUITY ETFS CONTINUE TO BE ADVISORS’ TOP CHOICE When asked what crypto exposure they were most interested in allocating to in 2026, crypto equity ETFs were the favorite among advisors. — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 13, 2026 Quick FAQ Did crypto move with stocks today?

The World Economic Forum put out its yearly Global Risks Report on Wednesday, painting a troubling picture of what lies ahead. When asked about the next two years, half of business executives and other leaders said they see rough times coming. Just 1% think things will stay peaceful. Economic weapons and trade battles take center stage The biggest worry on everyone’s mind right now is what the report call s ge o-economic confrontation. Countries are increasingly using money as a weapon, whether through tariffs , supply chain manipulation, new regulations, or limiting investment flows. This growing rivalry coul d sh rink worldwide commerce in a big way, the study warns. “Concern s gr owing over an economic downturn, rising inflation and potential asset bubbles as countries face high debt burdens and volatile markets,” wrote Saadia Zahidi, who runs day-to-day operations at the World Economic Forum. The organization puts out this analysis every year. Marsh, the world’s biggest insurance broker, works with the WEF on tracking these global threats. The company actually changed its name on Wednesday from Marsh McLennan. John Doyle, who leads Marsh, told CNBC that the world isn’t dealing with one massive emergency right now. Instead, he said, “it’s a moment of poly-crises.” He pointed to conflicts over trade, cultural battles, fast-moving technology changes, and wild weather as just some of what companies are juggling these days. “It’s a lot for businesses to confront and to manage,” Doyle said. Coming in second place on the list of immediate dangers i s fa lse information spreading online and through other channels. Third is growing division in society, where groups with opposite views are drifting further apart. Looking out over 10 years, inequality stands out as the most connected problem tying everything else together. All these issues make it harder for countries and organizations to work together when economic shocks hit, according to the findings. More quickly than any other hazard assessed in the poll, one threat has risen to the top. Last year, worries about artificial intelligence going wrong ranked 30th among short-term risks; this year, they rank sixth among long-term dangers. One significant risk of AI, according to the paper, is the loss of jobs . A negative circle of economic problems and public indignation could result from workers being replaced by robots, widening the wealth gap, further dividing society, and causing people to spend less money. According to the study, all of this would occur even as businesses saw a sharp increase in productivity. Machine learning and quantum computing are coming together, developin g fa ste r th an before. The report sounds an alarm about this supercharged situation, saying it “may lead to situations in which humans lose control.” Insurers brace for growing losses Even so, extreme weather still tops the list when leaders think about the next 10 years. Insurance companies are expected to pay out $107 billion for natural disasters in 2025. That marks the sixth year running that losses crossed $100 billion, a sharp jump from what insurers saw in the early 2000s. Doyle brought up the California wildfires from early 2025 to make a point about insurance rules. He sai d ra tes need to match actual risk levels to bring more money into the market. “There are risk takers. There are investors and insurance companies that are willing to finance these risks,” Doyle explained. He added that building codes should reflect what we learn from past disasters and that new technology needs to help manage the dangers. The study predicts that “extreme heat, drought, wildfires and other extreme weather events are likely to become more intense and frequent.” It’s interesting to see that environmental issues like pollution, species extinction, and significant changes in Earth’s natural systems have declined in importance. This demonstrates how the things that keep leaders up at night have evolved. “Coalitions of the willing” are crucial right now, according to the report’s conclusion. To build strength and create practical solutions to the world’s most pressing problems, governments, academic institutions, businesses, and ordinary citizens must collaborate.

At moments like this, price action tightens, volatility fades, and technical structures begin to mirror past breakout phases. Many seasoned traders believe the altcoin market has entered exactly such a moment, with charts suggesting that a major upside expansion may be approaching. If history repeats, XRP could stand among the biggest beneficiaries. In a recent post on X, analyst Bird drew attention to a striking technical formation developing across the broader altcoin market. He focused on the total crypto market capitalization excluding Bitcoin, a metric that strips out Bitcoin’s influence and offers a clearer view of altcoin strength. His analysis centers on a familiar bullish continuation pattern that has preceded major rallies in previous cycles. Is it just me, or does this look so damn obvious that the altcoin market is about to giga send back to ATHs?! (This will make $XRP go parabolic btw) pic.twitter.com/XT05GGV6Wa — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 13, 2026 A Bullish Flag Anchored at Strong Support Bird’s TradingView chart highlights a bullish flag forming above the $1.28 trillion level in total altcoin market capitalization. This structure typically emerges after a strong impulsive rally, followed by a controlled consolidation that allows the market to absorb profits without breaking the trend. In this case, price continues to respect former resistance, now acting as solid support. The market’s ability to hold this level signals strength rather than exhaustion. Instead of aggressive selling, buyers continue to step in on dips, compressing prices within a tightening range. This behavior often sets the stage for a continuation move once momentum returns. Historical Parallels With the 2021 Altcoin Surge The significance of this setup becomes clearer when viewed through a historical lens. During the 2021 bull cycle, the altcoin market displayed a nearly identical structure before accelerating toward new all-time highs. At that time, consolidation near similar levels preceded a sharp expansion from around $1.5 trillion toward the $2 trillion region. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bird’s comparison suggests that the current pattern may represent a macro reset rather than a topping formation. If the structure resolves to the upside, the altcoin market could revisit—and potentially exceed—previous peak capitalization levels. Why XRP Could React Aggressively XRP has consistently demonstrated explosive behavior during broad altcoin expansions. When capital rotates out of Bitcoin and into high-liquidity altcoins, XRP often attracts outsized inflows due to its deep markets and historical volatility. With XRP already maintaining a constructive technical structure, a confirmed altcoin breakout could act as a powerful catalyst. As altcoin market capitalization expands , XRP’s price has historically moved faster than the broader market once momentum takes hold. This dynamic supports Bird’s view that XRP could enter a parabolic phase if the bullish flag confirms. A Market at an Inflection Point The current setup reflects a market coiling for resolution rather than signaling weakness. While no pattern guarantees an outcome, the alignment of structure, support, and historical precedent strengthens the bullish case. If the altcoin market breaks higher from this consolidation, XRP may not simply follow—it may lead the charge.

This transaction marks one of the first times globally that physical commodities have been financed using stablecoins secured by blockchain-native Bills of Lading, proving that digital money can now operate directly within real-world supply chains. From Cargo to Capital On Chain JOC Australia, an exporter of agricultural and frozen-meat products, was conducting a cross-border sale to an overseas buyer under standard trade terms, where part of the payment is received in advance and the balance is settled after shipment. The transaction was executed using TradeGo’s electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) system, which represents legal control of cargo in digital form. JOC used the eBL as collateral to obtain short-term trade financing from WSPN. Global traders simply pledged its on-chain, asset-backed title and received stablecoin-denominated, fully collateralized trade credit. One block later the goods were financed; one block after payment the title auto-released. Global traders side-step the traditional banking settlement cycle: funds arrive in minutes, not days, and the digital title transfers the moment payment is confirmed. No overnight waits, no weekend gaps, no correspondent-bank float. Why This Matters This transaction demonstrates a shift in how stablecoins can be used in global trade: beyond payments, they can now serve as the settlement and credit backbone for real, asset-backed transactions. WSPN provided financing not based on corporate guarantees, but through cryptographic control of the cargo via the on-chain electronic Bill of Lading. By holding the eBL, WSPN had first-priority claim over the goods and the ability to enforce title or block cargo release if necessary. This approach offers security comparable to traditional bank-backed trade finance while enabling faster, more efficient funding. Through WSPN’s infrastructure, commodities become digitally controlled, legally enforceable, and immediately financeable, opening new opportunities for exporters, lenders, and supply-chain participants across Australia, Asia, and Latin America. Looking Ahead This deployment reflects WSPN’s commitment to bridging traditional trade with blockchain-enabled financial infrastructure. As more exporters and trade finance participants adopt digital bills of lading and stablecoin-based settlement, WSPN expects broader adoption of faster, more transparent, and more inclusive trade finance solutions globally. About WSPN WSPN is a leading provider of next-generation stablecoin infrastructure, dedicated to building a more secure, efficient, and transparent global payment ecosystem. Our flagship stablecoin, WUSD, is fully backed and pegged 1:1 to the U.S. Dollar, serving as the foundation for a suite of integrated financial solutions.

This finding, reported by The Block on April 15, 2025, provides quantitative validation for hedge fund titan Ray Dalio’s long-held thesis on diversification beyond traditional assets. The data suggests a pivotal shift for investors seeking stability and growth in an evolving financial landscape. Bitcoin Portfolio Allocation: The Numbers Behind the Outperformance Bitwise’s rigorous analysis compared two distinct portfolio constructions over a significant historical period. The traditional model, a 60% allocation to the S&P 500 and 40% to U.S. aggregate bonds, served as the baseline. The innovative model replaced 15% of that traditional allocation with a split between physical gold and Bitcoin. The results were unequivocal. The Sharpe Ratio, a critical metric developed by Nobel laureate William Sharpe that measures excess return per unit of risk, told the definitive story. The 60/40 portfolio achieved a Sharpe Ratio of just 0.232. Conversely, the portfolio with the 15% Bitcoin and gold allocation soared to a Sharpe Ratio of 0.679. This represents a nearly threefold increase, signaling dramatically superior risk-adjusted performance. This performance gap stems from the complementary, non-correlated nature of the assets. Historically, gold has acted as a defensive safe-haven asset during periods of market stress and currency devaluation. Bitcoin, particularly in post-2020 cycles, has demonstrated strong asymmetric return profiles and acted as a growth accelerator during risk-on periods. Bitwise’s report meticulously details how this combination simultaneously dampens overall portfolio volatility while capturing significant upside, a dual benefit that traditional fixed income has struggled to provide in recent years of rising interest rates. Deconstructing the 60/40 Portfolio’s Modern Challenges The traditional 60/40 portfolio has been a cornerstone of investment strategy for decades. Its premise is simple: stocks provide growth, while bonds provide income and stability, with the two often moving inversely. However, the macroeconomic environment of the 2020s has severely tested this model. Persistently high inflation has eroded the real returns of fixed-income assets. Furthermore, rising interest rates, implemented by central banks like the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, have caused simultaneous declines in both stock and bond prices, breaking their historical negative correlation. This phenomenon has led to consecutive years of negative returns for the classic 60/40 mix, eroding investor confidence. Financial analysts now widely refer to this as the “Great Correlation Breakdown.” In this context, the search for truly uncorrelated or diversifying assets has become paramount for institutional and retail investors alike. Bitwise’s research enters this conversation with powerful, data-driven evidence, positioning Bitcoin and gold not as speculative alternatives but as essential components for modern risk management. The Ray Dalio Hedge: From Theory to Quantifiable Strategy Bitwise explicitly connects its findings to the public advocacy of Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund. For years, Dalio has warned of the long-term risks of holding wealth in currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, amidst high debt levels and monetary expansion. He has publicly recommended holding a portion of one’s portfolio in “non-debt, non-dollar” assets, specifically naming gold and, more recently, Bitcoin, as potential hedges. Bitwise’s analysis transforms Dalio’s conceptual hedge into a quantifiable, optimized portfolio slice. The 15% figure is not arbitrary; it represents a meaningful allocation capable of moving the needle on overall returns without introducing disproportionate risk. The asset manager’s report explains that gold’s role is primarily defensive, preserving capital during drawdowns. Bitcoin’s role is offensive, providing explosive growth potential during market recoveries and technological adoption phases. This symbiotic relationship is the engine behind the enhanced Sharpe Ratio. Implementing the Strategy: Considerations for 2025 Investors For investors considering this allocation, understanding the mechanics is crucial. The 15% is taken from the traditional asset pool, meaning the resulting portfolio might resemble a 55/30/15 structure (55% stocks, 30% bonds, 15% split between gold and Bitcoin). The exact split between gold and Bitcoin within that 15% can vary based on an investor’s risk tolerance. Bitwise’s research implies a balanced split, but further optimization is possible. Key implementation points include: Gold Exposure: Can be achieved through physical bullion, ETFs like GLD, or shares in gold mining companies. Bitcoin Exposure: For most investors, regulated spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, offer the most secure and convenient access, providing direct exposure to the spot price without the complexities of self-custody. Rebalancing: A disciplined quarterly or annual rebalancing schedule is essential. This forces investors to sell portions of outperforming assets (like Bitcoin after a rally) and buy more of the underperformers, systematically “buying low and selling high.” The following table contrasts the core characteristics of the two portfolio approaches: Metric Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Portfolio with 15% Gold/Bitcoin Primary Assets Stocks (S&P 500), Bonds (Aggregate) Stocks, Bonds, Physical Gold, Bitcoin Historical Sharpe Ratio 0.232 0.679 Key Strength Simplicity, Long-term track record Enhanced risk-adjusted returns, Inflation hedge Modern Risk Correlation breakdown, Inflation sensitivity Volatility of crypto component, Regulatory landscape Ideal For Conservative, income-focused investors Growth-oriented investors seeking diversification Conclusion The investment landscape of 2025 demands strategies that evolve beyond 20th-century models. Bitwise’s compelling analysis demonstrates that a strategic Bitcoin portfolio allocation, combined with gold, can fundamentally improve a portfolio’s efficiency. By tripling the Sharpe Ratio compared to the standard 60/40 model, this approach offers a data-backed path to better risk-adjusted returns. This research validates the theoretical hedges proposed by experts like Ray Dalio and provides a clear, quantitative framework for investors aiming to protect and grow their capital amidst currency debasement and shifting market correlations. As asset allocation enters a new era, incorporating non-correlated stores of value is no longer a speculative alternative but a cornerstone of sophisticated portfolio management. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a Sharpe Ratio and why is it important? The Sharpe Ratio measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. A higher ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns. Tripling this ratio, as Bitwise found, means the portfolio generated significantly more return for each unit of risk taken. Q2: Does the 15% allocation refer to 15% in both gold AND Bitcoin, or 15% total? The analysis specifies a 15% total allocation split between gold and Bitcoin. The exact internal split (e.g., 7.5% each) can vary, but the research highlights the combined 15% slice’s impact on the overall portfolio. Q3: Is this strategy too risky for a conservative retiree? While the enhanced returns are attractive, the inclusion of Bitcoin adds volatility. A conservative investor might opt for a smaller allocation (e.g., 5%) within a diversified portfolio or focus solely on the gold component for its stabilizing properties. Q4: How does this strategy hedge against a decline in the U.S. dollar? Both gold and Bitcoin are perceived as assets outside the traditional fiat currency system. Their value is not directly tied to the health of the U.S. dollar or its monetary policy. During periods of dollar weakness or inflation, these assets have historically appreciated, preserving purchasing power. Q5: What are the main risks of implementing this Bitcoin and gold allocation? Primary risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility, potential regulatory changes affecting cryptocurrency markets, the custodial risk of holding physical gold, and the possibility that historical correlations between these assets may not persist in the future.

The schedule places digital asset regulation back on the Senate calendar as lawmakers push to define oversight lines between financial regulators. On X, Senate Agriculture Committee Republicans said Chairman John Boozman will release legislative text by the close of business on Jan. 21. The committee then plans to hold a markup at 3 p.m. on Jan. 27. The process centers on the Senate’s work tied to the CLARITY Act framework, which seeks to clarify how crypto markets are regulated in the United States. The announcement confirms that Senate Agriculture will move ahead with its portion of the broader crypto market structure effort, which follows earlier action in the House and parallel work in other Senate committees. Crypto market structure returns to Senate agenda The Agriculture Committee plays a key role in crypto legislation because it oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As a result, its work focuses on defining which digital assets fall under the CFTC’ s authority, particularly in spot crypto markets. The upcoming text release is expected to outline how the committee plans to structure that oversight. While details remain unpublished, previous discussions around the CLARITY Act have centered on separating commodities-like crypto assets from securities, a distinction that affects trading platforms, brokers, and developers. By scheduling a markup, the committee signals that negotiations have reached a stage where senators are ready to debate language publicly, offer amendments, and vote on advancing the bill. A successful markup would move the legislation one step closer to full Senate consideration. How the Jan. 27 markup fits the wider crypto debate The Senate effort follows months of debate across Congress over how to regulate crypto without overlapping or conflicting rules. In the House, lawmakers already advanced a version of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, placing pressure on the Senate to act. At the same time, other Senate committees remain involved. The Banking Committee handles issues tied to securities law and investor protection, meaning final legislation will require coordination across panels. That structure has slowed progress but also narrowed disagreements compared with earlier drafts. For the crypto industry, the Agriculture Committee’s timeline provides a near-term signal on when regulatory clarity may start to take shape. The release of text on Jan. 21 will offer the first detailed look at how Senate Republicans plan to frame CFTC authority and market rules. The Jan. 27 markup will then determine whether that framework can advance amid ongoing negotiations over crypto regulation in Congress.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-14 12:10:29

However, the data suggests that the strongest portfolios hold both. In fact, experts from Bitwise found that gold consistently cushions downside during market drawdowns, while BTC tends to outperform sharply during recoveries. Gold-and-Bitcoin Portfolio A new report by Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon and Quantitative Research Analyst Mallika Kolar stated that investors seeking protection from dollar debasement and market volatility may benefit most from holding both gold and Bitcoin rather than choosing between the two. The analysis was prompted by recent comments from Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, who recommended a combined 15% allocation to gold and BTC amid rising US federal debt and persistent deficit spending, which he said increases the risk of long-term currency debasement. To test the claim, Bitwise analyzed major market downturns over the past decade and compared a standard 60/40 portfolio with versions that included gold, BTC, or both. The findings showed that gold consistently acted as a defensive asset during periods of market stress, while bitcoin tended to outperform sharply during subsequent recoveries. During the 2018 equity drawdown, when stocks fell 19.34%, and BTC declined more than 40%, gold gained 5.76%. In 2020, equities dropped nearly 34% during the COVID-19 shock, BTC fell 38.1%, and gold declined just 3.63%. A similar pattern emerged in 2022, when equities fell 24.18% and BTC nearly 60% amid inflation, aggressive rate hikes, and crypto-specific turmoil, while gold dropped less than 9%. Sharpe Ratios In the 2025 market pullback tied to escalating trade tensions, equities fell 16.66%, bitcoin declined 24.39%, and gold rose nearly 6%. In the recoveries that followed, the crypto asset repeatedly delivered outsized gains, including a nearly 79% rally after the 2018 bottom, a 775% surge following the 2020 pandemic lows, and a 40% rise in 2023 as inflation eased and expectations grew for a shift in monetary policy. Gold also posted solid gains during recoveries. However, these were typically less dramatic, while equities rebounded strongly. The report evaluated performance across full periods rather than individual phases. On that basis, portfolios that included both gold and Bitcoin showed a superior balance of risk and return, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.679. This is nearly three times higher than the traditional 60/40 portfolio and well above a portfolio that added gold alone. While a BTC-only allocation produced a higher Sharpe ratio, it also came with significantly higher volatility.

At the same time, a separate Binance signal showed open interest dropping 31%, adding evidence that leverage is clearing out while price holds firm. Spot Buyers Drive Bitcoin Higher as Derivatives Fade the Move Bitcoin extended its latest rally as spot market demand took the lead, while derivatives traders positioned against the move. The setup shows a clear split between buyers using real capital and leveraged traders expressing caution, based on market data and on-chain metrics. Price climbed steadily on the 15-minute BTC/USDT chart, pushing toward the $94,300 area. During this advance, aggregated spot volume jumped to its highest level in several days. That rise in spot activity signals direct buying rather than leverage-driven positioning. At the same time, candles show limited upper wicks, which suggests buyers absorbed supply without sharp rejection. Bitcoin/USDT 15 Minute Chart. Source: TradingView/X Meanwhile, derivatives data moved in the opposite direction. Aggregated open interest increased, indicating more futures positions entered the market as price rose. However, funding rates turned negative, meaning short positions paid longs. This combination points to traders fading the rally through perpetual contracts instead of chasing it. In simple terms, leverage leaned bearish even as price moved higher. This divergence matters. When spot volume expands while funding drops below zero, it often reflects real demand meeting skeptical leverage. Spot buyers commit capital without forced liquidation risk, while perpetual traders can unwind quickly if price keeps rising. As a result, sustained spot-led rallies can pressure short positions over time, especially if price continues higher. The structure also shows that open interest rose alongside price rather than collapsing. That detail suggests the move did not come from short covering alone. Instead, new positions entered both sides of the market. However, the funding signal shows that many of those positions leaned short, reinforcing the idea that derivatives traders resisted the upside. Overall, the data frames this rally as structurally supported by spot flows, not leverage. As long as spot demand remains elevated and funding stays negative, the market reflects a tension where real buyers lead and derivatives traders hesitate. Bitcoin Deleveraging Pushes Open Interest Lower Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s derivatives market moved into deleveraging as open interest on Binance fell by about 31%, based on CryptoQuant data. The drop reflects traders closing leveraged positions while price avoided a sharp breakdown. Binance Bitcoin Deleveraging Signal Chart. Source: CryptoQuant The chart highlights several red-shaded periods where open interest declined while Bitcoin price stabilized or later advanced. In the latest phase, open interest moved closer to its 180-day average as price stayed near recent highs around $90,800. That alignment shows leverage leaving the system without heavy downside follow-through. Lower open interest reduces liquidation risk because fewer leveraged positions remain exposed to volatility. As leverage contracts, price action tends to depend more on spot flows than on derivatives positioning. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost noted that similar declines in open interest have often appeared near major market lows in past cycles. Those phases followed periods of elevated leverage and were later followed by stronger price trends. At present, Bitcoin trades with open interest well below recent peaks.

According to a pivotal 2024 report from Delphi Digital, decentralized perpetual futures exchanges, or Perp DEXs, are not merely growing—they are systematically eroding the long-held market share of centralized exchanges (CEXs). This seismic shift, driven by compelling advantages in cost and transparency, signals a fundamental evolution in how traders interact with digital asset derivatives. The data underscores a clear trend: from a modest 2.1% market share in January 2023, Perp DEXs captured a formidable 11.7% by November, as reported by CoinGecko. Furthermore, their cumulative trading volume skyrocketed from $4.1 trillion to over $12.09 trillion in the same period, a staggering threefold increase that demands attention from every market participant. The Data-Driven Rise of Perp DEXs The ascent of decentralized perpetual futures exchanges represents a data-verified market movement. Analysts point to several structural advantages fueling this growth. Primarily, Perp DEXs operate on blockchain networks, enabling non-custodial trading where users retain control of their assets. This model starkly contrasts with centralized platforms, which require users to deposit funds into exchange-controlled wallets. Consequently, the transparency of on-chain settlement and the reduction of counterparty risk serve as powerful draws for institutional and retail traders alike. Moreover, the fee structure on these platforms often proves significantly more competitive. By automating market making and settlement through smart contracts, Perp DEXs can bypass many traditional operational costs. A comparative analysis reveals that trading fees on leading Perp DEXs can be 20-50% lower than those on top-tier CEXs for comparable products. This economic incentive directly translates to the captured market share detailed in the Delphi Digital analysis. The report projects that if current growth trajectories hold, Perp DEXs could command over 25% of the total derivatives market by the end of 2025. From Exchanges to Financial Hubs: The Delphi Digital Vision Delphi Digital’s analysis extends beyond simple market share metrics. The firm posits a transformative future where these platforms evolve into comprehensive, decentralized financial hubs. In this vision, a single Perp DEX protocol could integrate the functions of a brokerage, custodian, bank, and clearinghouse. This vertical integration within a transparent, code-based system presents a paradigm shift. For instance, the report highlights Hyperliquid (HYPE), which recently launched its own native lending service directly within its perpetual trading ecosystem. This move demonstrates the early stages of hub development, allowing users to collateralize assets for trading without leaving the protocol’s environment. Competition and Innovation Accelerate the Trend The market is responding dynamically to this opportunity. While established players like dYdX and GMX continue to innovate, newer entrants are rapidly joining the fray, intensifying competition. Delphi Digital specifically mentions protocols like Aster (ASTER) and Lyra (LIT) as catalysts for accelerated development. Each new project typically introduces novel mechanisms for liquidity provision, risk management, or user experience. This competitive pressure benefits end-users through better products, lower fees, and more robust security models. The innovation cycle is therefore a key driver behind the erosion of CEX market share, as centralized entities often struggle to iterate and deploy new features at the same speed as their decentralized counterparts. The following table illustrates the core comparative advantages driving this shift: Feature Centralized Exchange (CEX) Decentralized Perp DEX Custody User funds held by exchange (custodial) User retains control (non-custodial) Transparency Opaque internal ledger & risk engines On-chain, verifiable settlement & liquidity Fee Structure Higher, includes operational overhead Typically lower, automated by code Innovation Speed Slower, corporate development cycles Rapid, open-source protocol upgrades Access & Compliance Geographic restrictions, KYC required Permissionless, global access (often) The Real-World Impact on Traders and Markets The practical implications of this shift are profound. For traders, the growth of Perp DEXs means greater choice, reduced costs, and enhanced security through self-custody. For the broader market, it promotes a more resilient and distributed financial infrastructure less prone to single points of failure, as historically witnessed in CEX collapses. However, challenges remain. The user experience on DeFi platforms, while improving, can still be complex for newcomers. Additionally, the regulatory landscape for decentralized derivatives is evolving and varies significantly by jurisdiction, creating uncertainty. Despite these hurdles, the data-driven momentum appears strong, suggesting that the erosion of centralized exchange dominance in derivatives is a sustained trend, not a passing phase. Conclusion The Delphi Digital report provides compelling, evidence-based analysis that Perp DEXs are fundamentally reshaping the cryptocurrency derivatives landscape. Their rapid gain in market share from centralized exchanges is fueled by undeniable advantages in transparency, cost, and user sovereignty. As these platforms evolve beyond simple exchanges into integrated financial hubs, and as competition from new entrants like Aster and Lyra intensifies, the trend is likely to accelerate. While centralized exchanges will remain significant players, especially for spot trading and fiat on-ramps, their dominance in the perpetual futures market faces an inevitable and data-backed erosion. The future of crypto derivatives is increasingly transparent, decentralized, and user-controlled. FAQs Q1: What is a Perp DEX? A Perp DEX, or Decentralized Perpetual Futures Exchange, is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to trade perpetual futures contracts without a central intermediary. Users trade directly from their self-custodied wallets using smart contracts for settlement. Q2: Why are Perp DEXs gaining market share so quickly? They are gaining share primarily due to lower trading fees, greater transparency through on-chain verification, and the security benefit of non-custodial trading, which reduces counterparty risk compared to centralized exchanges. Q3: What does Delphi Digital mean by “financial hubs”? Delphi Digital suggests that successful Perp DEX protocols will expand their services to include lending, borrowing, and other prime brokerage functions within a single, integrated application, moving beyond just trading. Q4: Are Perp DEXs regulated? The regulatory status is complex and varies globally. Most operate in a permissionless, decentralized manner, making them difficult for any single jurisdiction to regulate directly, unlike centralized exchanges which are licensed entities. Q5: What are the main risks of using a Perp DEX? Key risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, potential liquidity issues on smaller platforms, the complexity of use for beginners, and market volatility that can lead to rapid liquidation if positions are highly leveraged.

South Korea is placing an enormous wager on artificial intelligence. Parliament approved a massive 727.9 trillion won ($495.8 billion) budget for 2026, with President Lee Jae Myung more than tripling AI-related investment to 10.1 trillion won ($6.9 billion). The administration sees AI as nothing less than the foundation for the country’s future economic competitiveness. But a controversy now unfolding in the government’s flagship AI competition reveals how difficult it may be to achieve the technological independence Seoul is seeking. The irony is striking. At the very moment South Korea commits record funding to build homegrown AI capabilities, the companies selected to lead that charge are being accused of relying on foreign technology. The competition, which started last June, aims to build an AI model using only Korean-developed technology. The goal is to reduce the country’s dependence on American and Chinese artificial intelligence systems that currently control the global market. Achieving that independence has proven harder than expected Out of five companies that made it to the finals of the three-year contest, three have been caught using at least some computer code from AI systems built in other countries, including China. The companies involved say it doesn’t make practical sense to ignore existing AI technology and start over from nothing. Other observers counter that bringing in foreign tools poses security dangers and defeats the whole point of creating a truly Korean AI system. Gu-Yeon Wei, who teaches electrical engineering at Harvard University and knows about the Korean contest, said requiring every line of code to be written completely in-house isn’t realistic. “To forgo open-source software, you’re leaving on the table this huge amount of benefit,” Wei said. Nations around the globe are trying to become less dependent on foreign technology as they work to build their own AI capabilities. The technology could have major impacts on both economic strength and national defense. South Korea has jumped into this race with particular energy. The country has major computer chip manufacturers, software companies, and strong government support for what officials call sovereign AI . The competition is designed to pick two domestic winners by 2027 Those winners need to perform at least as well as 95% of the top AI models from companies like OpenAI or Google. Winners will receive government money for data collection and hiring workers, plus access to computer chips purchased by the government that are necessary for AI work. The controversy exploded recently around Upstage, one of the five finalists. Ko Suk-hyun, who runs Sionic AI, a competing Korean company, said parts of Upstage’s AI model looked similar to an open-source system from Zhipu AI , a Chinese company. He also claimed copyright notices from Zhipu AI were still visible in some of Upstage’s computer code. “It’s deeply regrettable that a model suspected to be a fine-tuned copy of a Chinese model was submitted to a project funded by taxpayers’ money,” Ko wrote on LinkedIn. Sionic had entered the South Korean contest but didn’t make the final round. Upstage responded by broadcasting a live verification session where it showed its development records to demonstrate the model was built and trained from the beginning using its own techniques. However, the company acknowledged that the inference code that makes the model work did include open-source elements that came from Zhipu AI, which many developers worldwide use. Ko later apologized . The attention then shifted to other finalists. Naver’s AI system was accused of resembling products from China’s Alibaba and OpenAI in its visual and audio encoders, which convert images and sounds into machine-readable formats. SK Telecom faced similar questions about its inference codes looking like those from DeepSeek, another Chinese company. Naver acknowledged using outside encoders but called it a smart choice to use standard technology. The company emphasized that its core engine, which controls how the system learns and gets trained, was built entirely by its own team. SK Telecom made the same argument, highlighting that its model’s foundation was independently developed. The competition rules never clearly stated whether contestants could use open-source code from foreign companies. South Korea’s science ministry, which runs the contest, hasn’t issued any new guidance since the controversy started.

Ethereum ETFs See $130 Million Inflow as BlackRock Leads Buying U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds recorded a combined net inflow of about $130 million on Jan. 13, according to daily fund flow data. The move marked one of the stronger single-day inflows this month and signaled renewed institutional demand for ETH exposure. Ethereum ETF Inflows Jan. 13, 2026. Source: Ted Pillows (X) BlackRock accounted for the largest share of the activity. Its iShares Ethereum Trust added roughly $53.3 million in net inflows during the session, based on the figures shared by market analysts. Other issuers, including Fidelity and Bitwise, also posted positive flows, contributing to the overall increase. Meanwhile, the inflows followed several mixed sessions in late December and early January, when redemptions weighed on total ETF balances. However, the latest data shows buying pressure returning across multiple funds, even as some issuers continued to report flat or modest activity. At the same time, cumulative Ethereum ETF holdings rose as fresh capital entered the products, while staking features for most funds remain pending regulatory approval. In contrast, Grayscale’s ETH products, which already support staking, showed smaller net changes compared with the newer spot ETFs. Overall, the $130 million inflow highlights a shift back toward accumulation, with BlackRock once again leading Ethereum ETF demand during the session. Ethereum Breaks Triangle Pattern as Price Pushes Above Key Resistance Ethereum confirmed a breakout on the daily chart after price moved above the upper boundary of a long-forming symmetrical triangle, based on technical data shared by Ali Charts. The structure had compressed ETH price action since December, with lower highs and higher lows narrowing into a clear decision zone. Ethereum Breakout Targets $4,000. Source: Ali Charts (X) The breakout occurred near the $3,330 area, where ETH cleared descending trendline resistance that capped rallies throughout the consolidation. Candles show acceptance above the pattern rather than a brief spike, which signals follow-through buying instead of a short-lived move. As a result, the triangle structure is no longer intact. With the pattern resolved to the upside, the chart opens a higher price range. The next major reference level sits near $4,000, derived from the height of the triangle projected upward from the breakout point. That zone also aligns with a prior high-liquidity area from earlier market cycles. At the same time, former resistance near $3,000 shifts into structural support. A sustained move above the breakout level keeps the bullish setup active, while a return below the trendline would weaken the signal. For now, the daily close confirms that Ethereum has exited consolidation and entered a new expansion phase.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-14 12:19:28

Key Takeaways: Animoca Brands acquired Somo to expand its Web3 collectibles strategy. The deal aligns with a sharp early-2026 NFT market rebound. Despite the recent surge, NFT valuations remain far below prior cycle highs. The company said Wednesday that Somo will be integrated into Animoca’s broader Web3 ecosystem, adding a lineup of playable, streamable and tradable digital collectibles to its portfolio of blockchain-based platforms. Animoca to Plug Somo Into Global Web3 Partner Network Animoca plans to support the expansion through cross-promotion, shared infrastructure and access to its global network of partners across gaming, media and digital assets. “SOMO is building the cultural operating system for collectibles, which complements our existing portfolio,” Animoca Brands co-founder and executive chairman Yat Siu said. “By bringing SOMO into the Animoca Brands ecosystem, we aim to connect it to our global network of games, communities, and partners.” The acquisition comes as the non-fungible token market recorded a sharp rebound at the start of 2026. Data from CoinGecko shows the total NFT market capitalization climbed about 20% in the first two weeks of the year, rising from roughly $2.5 billion on Jan. 1 to more than $3 billion by mid-January. The move marked one of the strongest short-term recoveries for NFTs in over a year, following a prolonged downturn that weighed on prices and trading activity throughout much of 2025. Do you remember @playsomo and $SOMO ? They just got acquired by @animocabrands . We’ll see how this plays out. I’ve yapped about it a lot, and I’ve been waiting almost two years for the presale.

Market participants pointed to renewed interest in established NFT collections, a pickup in high-value sales and the release of new token-linked NFT drops as drivers behind the surge. However, some community members questioned whether the rally signals the start of a new cycle or a short-lived bounce after months of compressed valuations. Despite the recent uptick, the sector remains well below its previous highs. As of now, the NFT market cap stands at approximately $7.3 billion, a decline of about 59% year over year. Meta Plans Reality Labs Layoffs as Focus Shifts From Metaverse to AI As reported, Meta is preparing to cut roughly 10% of staff from its Reality Labs division, a move that highlights the company’s growing pivot away from the metaverse and toward artificial intelligence. The layoffs could affect around 1,500 employees and may be announced as soon as Tuesday, with the cuts expected to fall heavily on teams working on virtual reality hardware and metaverse platforms. Reality Labs, which employs about 15,000 people, has been a major source of losses for Meta since its launch in 2020. The unit has accumulated more than $70 billion in losses, including $4.4 billion in operating losses in the third quarter of 2025 alone. Recent reports suggest Meta is also redirecting some funding from Reality Labs to its wearables business, as well as trimming overall metaverse spending while increasing investment in AI development. The broader metaverse sector has struggled to meet early expectations, with engagement concentrated in gaming-focused platforms such as Roblox and Fortnite.

Prices have been moving in a narrow range and investors appear cautious. Related Reading: Futures Frenzy Pushed Crypto Exchange Volume To Nearly $80 Trillion In 2025 Bitcoin has been trading just above $94,000 when this report was made, which is about 3.5% higher than its opening price for the year of $88,650, but still below an early-year peak near $94,780. Fund Flows Keep Pressure On Reports show that fund movements have been a big drag on sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.38 billion in outflows between January 6 and January 9. Based on CoinShares data, digital asset vehicles recorded a net outflow of $454 million in the prior week. The year opened with strong demand — crypto-based ETPs pulled in over $1 billion in the first two trading days — but that momentum faded and ETPs retained $580 million at the end of the week of January 3. Last week, investors withdrew $405 million from Bitcoin ETPs and $116 million from Ethereum ETPs. Those shifts in cash show how quickly mood can turn and how dependent the rally is on fresh money. CRYPTO FUND OUTFLOWS SLOW RECOVERY Cryptocurrencies are recovering gradually, but gains remain limited as investor caution persists, marked by continued outflows from crypto funds, says IG analyst Chris Beauchamp. He notes that prices lack fresh inflows needed for a stronger… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 13, 2026 Key Levels And What They Mean Beauchamp pointed to $95,000 as a crucial level for Bitcoin. According to his note, a reclaim and steady hold above that area would be a sign the market has broken to the upside. At the time of writing, Bitcoin actually moved past the $94k level, briefly hitting $95.450 before returning to the $94k mark. On the downside, $90,000 is being watched as an important psychological floor. The market has been consolidating below its yearly high, and that tight range is keeping trading quiet. Some coins that had jumped earlier, like XRP and Cardano, have seen their gains trimmed as this consolidation takes hold. Macro Events Could Tip Prices Several outside factors could push the market one way or another. US inflation data, which sits at 2.7%, has reduced the odds of a near-term Fed rate cut, and that outlook can limit risk appetite in crypto. The banking sector’s Q4 earnings are scheduled to come through this week and may change investor tone if results surprise. A planned crypto market bill hearing was expected to act as a catalyst; it has since been moved to later in January. Then we have geopolitical tensions and questions about Fed independence have kept safe-haven demand alive, adding another layer of uncertainty. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Watch $0.28 As Breakout Signals Stack Up What Comes Next Based on reports and the analyst’s view, the recovery will likely need a fresh wave of inflows to gain real traction. If new capital arrives and Bitcoin can push past $95,000 and hold, higher prices could follow. If outflows continue and the $90,000 area fails to hold, downside pressure would increase. The story now is one of patience and watching for clear signs — in fund flows, in US economic figures, and in corporate earnings — that the market’s mood has turned more confident.

The request raises fresh questions about conflicts of interest at a moment when stablecoins are moving deeper into the US financial system and Washington is debating how far to go in regulating the sector. Stablecoin Charter Puts OCC in Political Crosshairs, Warren Says In a letter sent Tuesday to Jonathan Gould, the Comptroller of the Currency, Warren urged the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to delay consideration of World Liberty Financial’s bid until Trump divests from the company and removes what she described as “real and serious” financial conflicts involving himself and his family. Source: Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Warren, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said the situation was no longer hypothetical after a World Liberty subsidiary formally applied on January 7, 2026, to operate a national trust bank designed to support stablecoin services. World Liberty Financial was launched in 2024 and lists Trump and his sons Barron, Eric, and Donald Trump Jr. as co-founders. Trump-backed World Liberty Financial has launched World Liberty Markets, a new crypto lending platform tied to its #USD1 stablecoin. #Stablecoins #DeFi #USD1 #CryptoNews https://t.co/vginSli5es — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 12, 2026 The platform has grown quickly, raising more than $550 million through token sales and launching a dollar-backed stablecoin, USD1, in March 2025. USD1 has since expanded to an estimated $3.4 billion in market value and has been used in high-profile transactions, including a $2 billion Binance investment by a third-party firm using the token. A World Liberty subsidiary, WLTC Holdings, filed for the charter that would allow it to issue , custody, and convert USD1 directly under federal supervision. World Liberty Financial filed for a US national banking charter, seeking OCC oversight to bring its dollar-backed stablecoin USD1 fully inside the regulatory perimeter. @worldlibertyfi #WLFI #OCC https://t.co/kDgbVB1c25 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 8, 2026 Warren argued that the application places the OCC in an unprecedented position. Under the National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, signed into law by Trump in July 2025 , the OCC became the primary regulator for federally licensed stablecoin issuers. That role includes approving charters, writing rules, supervising issuers, and enforcing violations. Warren said that approving World Liberty’s application would effectively make the president responsible for overseeing a financial company from which he and his family benefit, while the regulator itself serves at the president’s pleasure. Crypto Policy Debate Intensifies as Trump Family Ventures Expand In a public report cited in Warren’s letter, Trump and his family have earned more than $1 billion from World Liberty Financial and other crypto ventures. Beyond World Liberty, the Trump family controls entities tied to an official Trump-branded meme coin launched on Solana in early 2025, several NFT collections that have generated millions in licensing revenue, and a Bitcoin mining company established by Trump’s sons last year. These ventures mark a sharp shift from Trump’s earlier skepticism of digital assets and have been accompanied by a policy agenda that has rolled back enforcement actions and positioned the US as a global crypto hub. The charter filing comes as regulators have shown greater willingness to bring crypto firms under bank-style oversight. In December, the OCC approved national trust bank charters for several digital asset companies, including BitGo, Circle, Paxos, Ripple, and others. The OCC has conditionally approved five crypto firms, including @Circle and @Ripple , to launch national trust banks. #Ripple #Circle https://t.co/wCeTNrhOQZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 13, 2025 Trust banks cannot take deposits or make loans, but they can provide custody and settlement services, making them an attractive structure for stablecoin issuers seeking tighter integration with the traditional financial system. Warren’s push also lands amid broader legislative friction. There are many efforts going on in Congress, including the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act and the End Crypto Corruption Act , that aim to restrict elected officials and their families from owning or profiting from digital assets, but none have advanced into law.

By becoming a reliable tool for liquidity and reserve management, XRP strengthens its position as a viable option for institutional portfolios. Its adoption reflects confidence in its long-term viability and usefulness beyond speculative trading. The asset has maintained a growing presence among digital currencies. Aljarrah’s assessment emphasizes XRP’s potential to complement institutional and central bank assets. Its network effects, regulatory engagement, and utility in financial operations support a strong foundation for continued adoption.

57158276,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261472,1768396213,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japanese Yen Pressure Intensifies as Takaichi’s Election Plans Spark Market Uncertainty,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/takaichi-election-plans-yen-pressure/,"BitcoinWorld Japanese Yen Pressure Intensifies as Takaichi’s Election Plans Spark Market Uncertainty TOKYO, March 2025 – Financial markets face renewed pressure on the Japanese yen as political developments surrounding former Internal Affairs Minister Sanae Takaichi create uncertainty about Japan’s future monetary policy direction. According to recent analysis from Citigroup Global Markets, Takaichi’s positioning ahead of potential leadership elections introduces significant variables that could influence the Bank of Japan’s approach to interest rates and currency stabilization. This development comes at a critical juncture for Japan’s economy, which continues navigating post-pandemic recovery while managing inflation targets and global monetary policy divergence. Understanding the Yen Pressure from Political Developments Currency markets react sensitively to political signals that might affect monetary policy. The Japanese yen, traditionally considered a safe-haven currency, now faces downward pressure from multiple directions. Citigroup analysts highlight how Takaichi’s policy preferences could influence the Bank of Japan’s independence and approach to inflation targeting. Historically, political pressure on central banks creates currency volatility as investors reassess risk premiums and policy expectations. The current situation reflects broader tensions between government fiscal priorities and central bank mandates for price stability. Japan’s monetary policy framework has evolved significantly since the introduction of Abenomics in 2013. The Bank of Japan currently maintains yield curve control while targeting 2% inflation. However, political leadership changes could accelerate policy shifts. Market participants monitor these developments closely because currency values fundamentally reflect relative monetary policies between nations. When political figures advocate for specific economic approaches, currency traders immediately adjust their positions based on anticipated policy outcomes. Sanae Takaichi’s Economic Policy Positions Sanae Takaichi brings distinct economic perspectives that differentiate her from other potential leadership candidates. As a former Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, she has consistently advocated for specific monetary approaches. Her public statements reveal several policy preferences that concern currency market participants: Monetary Policy Stance: Takaichi has historically supported more aggressive monetary easing measures Inflation Targeting: She advocates for higher inflation targets than the current 2% benchmark Central Bank Independence: Her comments suggest potential for greater political influence over BOJ decisions Fiscal-Monetary Coordination: She emphasizes closer alignment between government spending and central bank policies These positions matter because Japan maintains the world’s third-largest economy and its currency serves as a major global reserve asset. When political figures propose significant policy changes, international investors reassess their Japanese asset allocations. Currency values ultimately reflect these capital flow decisions. The yen’s recent weakness against the US dollar partially stems from expectations that Japanese interest rates will remain lower than American rates for longer periods. Historical Context of Political Influence on Yen Valuation Political developments have frequently influenced yen valuation throughout modern Japanese economic history. The Plaza Accord of 1985 demonstrated how international political agreements could dramatically affect currency values. More recently, leadership transitions between Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe, Yoshihide Suga, and Fumio Kishida each created temporary yen volatility as markets assessed policy continuity. The current situation presents particular concerns because it coincides with global monetary policy normalization following pandemic-era stimulus measures. Japan’s economy faces unique structural challenges including demographic aging, high public debt, and persistent deflationary pressures. These factors make monetary policy particularly sensitive to political direction. When political leaders advocate for specific approaches, currency markets must price in the probability of policy shifts. Citigroup’s analysis suggests that Takaichi’s potential influence introduces additional uncertainty precisely when global markets seek stability amid geopolitical tensions and economic transitions. Citigroup’s Analysis Framework and Market Implications Citigroup employs sophisticated models to assess political risk factors in currency markets. Their analysts examine multiple dimensions when evaluating how political developments might affect the yen: Analysis Dimension Current Assessment Potential Impact on Yen Policy Continuity Probability Moderate Uncertainty Increased Volatility BOJ Independence Risk Elevated Concerns Downward Pressure Inflation Target Changes Possible Revision Upward Mixed Effects Global Rate Differential Widening Expected Sustained Weakness Currency markets function as discounting mechanisms that incorporate future expectations into current prices. When Citigroup analysts identify increased political uncertainty, institutional investors frequently adjust their currency exposures. These adjustments create immediate price movements that reflect changing probability assessments. The yen’s recent trading patterns show characteristic signs of political risk premium incorporation, with increased volatility during Japanese political announcements and leadership speculation periods. Global hedge funds and institutional investors monitor these developments through multiple channels. Many maintain dedicated Japan political analysts who track leadership dynamics and policy debates. Their trading decisions collectively determine currency valuation through enormous daily transaction volumes. When consensus forms around particular policy outcomes, currency values adjust to reflect those expectations. Current market positioning suggests growing concern about yen stability amid political transitions. Broader Economic Context and Global Market Connections The yen’s valuation never exists in isolation from global economic conditions. Several interconnected factors currently influence currency dynamics: US Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions create fundamental dollar-yen dynamics Commodity Prices: Japan’s energy import dependence makes yen sensitive to oil and gas prices Asian Economic Integration: Regional trade patterns affect yen demand for transaction purposes Global Risk Sentiment: The yen’s safe-haven status attracts flows during market turbulence Political developments intersect with these global factors in complex ways. For example, when political uncertainty increases in Japan while US interest rates rise, the yen typically weakens significantly. This occurs because capital seeks higher returns in more stable environments. Current conditions present this exact scenario, with Japanese political uncertainty coinciding with relatively attractive US interest rates. Citigroup’s analysis must therefore consider both domestic political factors and international monetary policy divergence. Japan’s current account balance provides another crucial context for understanding yen dynamics. Despite years of trade deficits, Japan maintains substantial overseas investment income that supports currency fundamentals. However, political uncertainty can temporarily overwhelm these fundamental supports when investors fear policy instability. The timing of current developments proves particularly challenging because global markets already face multiple sources of volatility including geopolitical conflicts and technological disruptions. Expert Perspectives on Policy Transmission Mechanisms Economic researchers identify specific channels through which political developments affect currency values. The most significant mechanisms include: Central Bank Appointment Influence: Political leaders influence central bank governor appointments, which subsequently affect monetary policy decisions. Even subtle changes in leadership preferences can shift policy orientations over time. Fiscal-Monetary Coordination Expectations: When politicians advocate for specific fiscal approaches, markets anticipate corresponding monetary accommodation. This expectation affects currency valuation through interest rate expectations. International Policy Coordination: Political leadership changes affect how Japan engages in international economic forums. These engagements influence currency values through coordinated intervention possibilities and policy harmonization. Citigroup’s analysis incorporates these transmission mechanisms when assessing potential yen movements. Their models weight different channels based on historical effectiveness and current market sensitivity. The current assessment suggests that appointment influence and coordination expectations present the most significant near-term risks for yen stability. Market Reactions and Trading Pattern Analysis Financial markets have demonstrated specific reactions to political developments surrounding Takaichi’s positioning. Several observable patterns emerged in recent trading sessions: Yen volatility increased measurably following specific political announcements. Options markets showed rising demand for yen protection against sharp movements. Currency correlation patterns shifted as yen decoupled temporarily from traditional drivers. These market behaviors indicate genuine concern rather than temporary noise. Professional traders distinguish between political developments that matter fundamentally versus those representing mere headlines. The current situation clearly falls into the former category based on trading volumes and positioning changes. Institutional investors employ various strategies to manage political currency risk. Many increase hedging activities when uncertainty rises. Others adjust their Japanese asset allocations based on probability-weighted scenarios. These collective actions create observable market patterns that analysts like those at Citigroup monitor for signals about future developments. Current patterns suggest growing caution rather than panic, but with clear recognition of elevated risk profiles. Conclusion The Japanese yen faces sustained pressure from multiple sources, with political developments surrounding Sanae Takaichi’s election plans introducing additional uncertainty. Citigroup’s analysis highlights how potential leadership transitions could influence monetary policy direction and central bank independence. These concerns emerge amid challenging global conditions including monetary policy divergence and geopolitical tensions. Market participants must monitor both domestic political developments and international economic conditions when assessing yen prospects. The currency’s future trajectory will depend on how political uncertainties resolve relative to fundamental economic factors. Ultimately, yen stability requires clear policy frameworks that balance domestic economic needs with international financial integration. FAQs Q1: How exactly do political election plans pressure a currency like the yen? Political election plans create currency pressure by introducing uncertainty about future economic policies. When candidates propose specific monetary approaches, markets must price in potential policy shifts. This uncertainty increases risk premiums and can trigger capital flows that affect currency valuation. Q2: What specific policies does Sanae Takaichi advocate that concern currency markets? Takaichi has advocated for potentially higher inflation targets, more aggressive monetary easing, and closer coordination between government fiscal policy and central bank actions. These positions raise concerns about Bank of Japan independence and potential yen depreciation policies. Q3: How does Citigroup analyze political risk in currency markets? Citigroup employs sophisticated models that assess policy continuity probabilities, central bank independence risks, inflation target stability, and global rate differentials. They analyze historical patterns, current positioning, and scenario probabilities to forecast currency impacts. Q4: Why does the yen matter globally as a currency? The Japanese yen represents the world’s third-most traded currency and serves as a major reserve asset. Japan maintains the third-largest economy globally, and yen movements affect international trade, capital flows, and global financial stability through various transmission channels. Q5: What other factors currently influence yen valuation besides political developments? The yen responds to US monetary policy differences, commodity price movements (especially energy), global risk sentiment, Japan’s current account balance, and broader Asian economic integration. These factors interact with political developments to determine ultimate currency valuation.

The price is reacting cleanly to higher-timeframe levels while volatility has compressed, which usually precedes expansion. The key point here is that this is not distribution yet; it’s digestion. How BTC behaves around the current resistance will define whether this move is just another lower high or the start of a broader continuation. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, the asset is trading below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which sit inside a clear resistance zone. This area has already acted as a supply flip multiple times, so rejection here is technically valid. However, the daily structure is still holding higher lows from the November bottom, meaning sellers have not regained full control. As long as the price holds above the higher-low base and does not lose the demand zone below, this remains a corrective range rather than a trend reversal. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows a rising wedge / ascending corrective structure pushing into resistance. The price has just tagged the local supply and stalled, while RSI also pushed into the overbought territory and is pulling back. The market is balanced here: a strong breakout above the horizontal resistance level at $95K and the higher boundary of the wedge pattern would open room toward the next daily supply zone just above $100K. On the other hand, a rejection will cause the price to rotate back inside the pattern and potentially the lower range support. Therefore, the mid-term price action of BTC heavily depends on its reaction to the current level. Sentiment Analysis Futures data shows average order size mostly belonging to retail traders compared to last year, indicating larger players are mostly inactive. Retail participation has picked up near resistance, which increases the risk of short-term fakeouts. This combination usually leads to choppy price action rather than immediate continuation. Overall sentiment is cautiously bullish but crowded and retail-driven near highs. This means that BTC likely needs either a clean breakout with volume from large players or a reset lower to shake weak hands before the next directional move occurs.

This new peak, reported by The Block in March 2025, eclipses the previous record of 29.54% set in July 2024 and signals a profound shift in the network’s economic security and investor behavior. Consequently, this milestone underscores a maturation phase where institutional capital is becoming a dominant force in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Staked ETH Reaches Unprecedented Levels The journey to 36 million staked ETH marks a significant evolution from Ethereum’s proof-of-work origins. Following the successful Merge in September 2022, which transitioned the network to proof-of-stake, participation in staking has steadily climbed. However, the recent acceleration to nearly 30% of the total supply highlights a new phase of adoption. For context, this locked value of $118 billion now rivals the market capitalization of major traditional corporations. The Block’s data indicates this surge is not merely retail-driven; instead, it reflects strategic accumulation by large-scale entities. This trend directly impacts network security, as a higher percentage of staked ETH makes the blockchain more expensive to attack, thereby enhancing its overall resilience and trustworthiness for decentralized applications. A Timeline of Staking Growth Understanding this record requires examining key milestones. The Shanghai upgrade in April 2023 was pivotal, as it enabled staked ETH withdrawals, removing a major barrier for risk-averse institutions. Subsequently, staking participation entered a consistent growth trajectory. By July 2024, the ratio hit 29.54%, a record that stood until the recent breach. The leap to 36 million tokens and nearly 30% in early 2025 suggests a compounding effect, where growing institutional confidence fuels further participation. This timeline demonstrates a clear correlation between protocol improvements, regulatory clarity for custodial services, and increased staking activity. The Institutional Engine Driving the Surge The primary catalyst for this record, as identified by The Block, is aggressive participation from institutional players. Firms like Bitmine (BMNR) are actively increasing their staking operations, contributing significant volumes of ETH to the validator set. More broadly, the landscape is witnessing a growing entry of traditional asset managers. A prominent signal of this trend is Morgan Stanley’s reported preparations to launch an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) that includes staking rewards. Such a product would offer regulated exposure to staked ETH for mainstream investors, potentially funneling billions in new capital. This institutional pivot is multifaceted, driven by the search for yield in a digital asset framework and the desire for compliant, infrastructure-heavy investment vehicles. Yield Generation: Staking provides a consistent, protocol-native yield, attractive in various macroeconomic climates. Portfolio Diversification: Institutions view crypto assets, particularly core protocols like Ethereum, as a non-correlated asset class. Infrastructure Maturation: The emergence of regulated custodians and staking-as-a-service providers has lowered the technical and operational barrier for large entities. Market Dynamics and Supply Shock Implications The locking of such a substantial portion of ETH’s circulating supply carries significant implications for market structure and volatility. As The Block suggested, a shrinking liquid supply can amplify price movements during periods of heightened demand. This phenomenon, often termed a “supply shock,” means that buy-side pressure can lead to sharper price increases because fewer tokens are readily available on exchanges. Conversely, it may also provide a stronger price floor, as a large portion of the supply is held for long-term staking rather than short-term trading. Analysts monitor the exchange reserve metrics closely, as declining reserves often precede volatile bullish movements. Ethereum Staking Milestones & Impact Date Milestone Staked ETH (Approx.) Key Driver Sep 2022 The Merge to Proof-of-Stake ~13 million Protocol Upgrade Apr 2023 Shanghai Upgrade (Withdrawals Enabled) ~18 million Reduced Lock-up Risk Jul 2024 Previous Record ~35.5 million (29.54%) Growing Retail & Institutional Mix Mar 2025 Current Record >36 million (~30%) Institutional Surge & ETF Developments Expert Perspective on Network Security From a network security perspective, this trend is overwhelmingly positive. In a proof-of-stake system, security is economically guaranteed by the total value staked. A higher percentage staked means an attacker must acquire and lock an exorbitantly expensive amount of ETH to attempt a network takeover, making such an attack financially irrational. Therefore, the move toward 30% staked ETH represents a deepening of Ethereum’s economic moat. Furthermore, it decentralizes validator control away from early solo stakers toward a more diverse set of entities, including regulated institutions, which may improve the network’s perceived stability and regulatory standing over the long term. Conclusion The breakthrough of 36 million staked ETH, nearing 30% of the total supply, is a definitive milestone for the Ethereum ecosystem. It reflects a powerful convergence of technological maturity, institutional validation, and evolving financial product offerings like staking-enabled ETFs. This record level of staked ETH fundamentally strengthens the network’s security model while simultaneously introducing new dynamics to its market economics, where reduced liquid supply could increase volatility. As institutional participation becomes a core pillar of Ethereum’s staking landscape, the network’s evolution will be increasingly intertwined with the strategies of traditional finance, marking a new chapter in the integration of decentralized and conventional economic systems. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that ETH is “staked”? Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake blockchain. Users lock up their cryptocurrency to support network operations, and in return, they earn rewards, similar to earning interest. Q2: Why is institutional participation in staking significant? Institutional involvement brings large-scale, long-term capital, which enhances network security and stability. It also signals mainstream financial acceptance and often precedes the development of new regulated investment products for everyday investors. Q3: Could too much staked ETH be a problem? While high staking levels boost security, extremely high ratios could theoretically reduce liquid supply for everyday transactions and DeFi applications. However, the current level near 30% is widely viewed as healthy for both security and ecosystem liquidity. Q4: How does an ETF with staking rewards work? A staking ETF would hold Ethereum on behalf of investors, use that ETH to participate in staking via professional validators, and then distribute the earned rewards to shareholders as part of the fund’s yield, all within a regulated stock exchange framework. Q5: Does staking make Ethereum more environmentally friendly? Yes, absolutely. Ethereum’s move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (staking) reduced its energy consumption by over 99.9%, as it no longer requires energy-intensive mining hardware to secure the network.

Meta started cutting jobs this week in its Reality Labs unit, which handles virtual reality work. The layoffs will eliminate more than 1,000 positions, hitting roughly 10% of workers who make Quest VR headsets and run the Horizon Worlds virtual social platform, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The New York Times first broke the story. Several game studios working on VR projects are shutting down completely. These include Armature Studio, Twisted Pixel, and Sanzaru, along with a tech team called Oculus Studios Central Technology. Other studios like Ouro Interactive, which Meta started in 2023 to create content for Horizon Worlds, are also seeing staff reductions. Supernatural, a workout app for VR that Meta bought for $400 million in 2023, has been put on maintenance mode. That means only a small crew will keep it running, with no new features or content coming. Andrew Bosworth, who serves as Meta’s chief technology officer, plans to meet with all Reality Labs staff on Wednesday. The job cuts come as Meta pours more money into artificial intelligence, which has become CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s latest priority. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, the company spent $14.3 billion in June to bring on Alexandr Wang, who started Scale AI, to lead AI strategy. Other engineers and researchers from that startup also joined. In October, Vishal Shah moved from running metaverse projects for four years to become vice president of AI products. That same month, Meta raised its 2025 spending plans to between $70 billion and $72 billion, with even bigger increases expected in 2026. Smart glasses find success where VR failed A Meta representative said the changes follow plans announced in December to move money within Reality Labs from VR projects to AI glasses and wearable technology. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” the spokesperson stated. Meta has found better results with AI-powered wearables than VR products. The company partnered with EssilorLuxottica to create Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. In September, they introduced the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses for $799, which show small messages and photo previews on a built-in screen. Meta said last week it would postpone the worldwide launch because of “limited” supplies due to “unprecedented” demand in America. Stefano Grassi, who handles finances at Luxottica, said in October that they expect to hit their goal of making 10 million units sooner than the original end-of-2026 target. Meta hasn’t completely given up on VR The company is now trying to get developers who make games for Roblox, a gaming platform with more than 150 million daily users that kids love, to create content for Horizon Worlds instead. Horizon has never attracted more than a few hundred thousand monthly users, even though Zuckerberg highlighted it when he changed the company name. Last year, Bosworth told the team to make Horizon Worlds successful as a phone app after testing began in 2023. Meta moved workers from other Reality Labs areas to the Horizon Worlds team in 2025. Ben Hatton, who analyzes connected devices for CCS Insight, explained to CNBC that poor VR headset sales and strong mobile growth forced Meta’s direction. “It kind of follows that Meta will be moving it towards mobile as mobile gaming has become very popular over the last five years or so,” Hatton noted. Meta bought Oculus VR for $2 billion twelve years ago to enter this market. Since late 2020, Reality Labs has lost more than $70 billion total. In October’s earnings report, Meta revealed Reality Labs lost $4.4 billion while making only $470 million in sales. Horizon Worlds has struggled from the beginning. In August 2022, Zuckerberg posted a picture of his avatar near the Eiffel Tower and a Spanish church. People mocked the poor graphics online. Days later, he shared a better-looking avatar and promised improvements were coming.

He stated, “I’m 100% confident that $XRP will be on this leaderboard as a top 10 global asset by market cap within the next 24 months.” He added a short clarification. “Not just crypto. All assets.” The reference point was a global asset leaderboard that includes gold, silver, major technology companies, and Bitcoin. Entry into that group requires a market capitalization of roughly $1.7 trillion. That figure defines the threshold XRP must reach to stand alongside the world’s largest assets. I’m 100% confident that $XRP will be on this leaderboard as a top 10 global asset by market cap within the next 24 months. Yes… Not just crypto. All assets. https://t.co/Q8nzzFxjmM — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 12, 2026 Required XRP Price for Top 10 XRP currently trades at $2.1. Its market cap stands at $128.06 billion. The circulating supply is 60.69 billion tokens, with a total supply of 100 billion tokens . At present levels, the asset sits well below the trillion-dollar class. The only cryptocurrency currently on that list is Bitcoin. A market cap of $1.7 trillion divided by a circulating supply of 60.69 billion tokens results in a required price of approximately $28.02 per token. That price marks the minimum level needed for XRP to meet the $1.7 trillion threshold. At that valuation, XRP could join the top 10 global assets by market capitalization. Placement Among Global Assets At $28.02 per token, XRP could join the top 10 global assets. Gold currently leads with a $32 trillion market capitalization. Silver sits at around $5 trillion. While Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Amazon range between $1.6 trillion and $4.5 trillion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin appears near $1.87 trillion. Reaching $28.02 positions XRP alongside these globally recognized assets, moving it into the tier of trillion-dollar valuations. Can XRP Join the Top 10? The required increase from $2.10 to $28 represents a 13.3x rise. This aligns precisely with the market cap expansion from $128.06 billion to $1.7 trillion, given the circulating supply. The path depends entirely on price growth. Bird referenced a 24-month window for XRP to reach this target. While it may seem out of reach, XRP has grown more than 13.3x in the past. Many experts also believe it can outperform Bitcoin , and surpassing Bitcoin would place it much higher on the list.

Prediction markets covering multiple categories, including politics, sports, macroeconomic events, cryptocurrencies, and global developments, have expanded rapidly in recent years. However, market data, liquidity, and pricing remain fragmented across isolated platforms, making it difficult for participants to compare outcomes and identify inefficiencies efficiently. Fors addresses this challenge by aggregating multiple prediction venues into a single, unified interface. The platform normalizes probabilities, pricing, and liquidity, allowing users to compare identical outcomes side by side across different markets. Built on Solana, Fors leverages high-performance infrastructure to support real-time aggregation and low-latency data processing. The platform is also developing smart order routing capabilities designed to direct trades toward the most favorable venue based on price, liquidity, and execution conditions, while maintaining transparency and user control. One of the core benefits of aggregation is improved visibility into cross-market price differences. By presenting pricing disparities across venues, Fors enables users to identify arbitrage opportunities that may exist due to fragmented liquidity and inconsistent market pricing. In addition to aggregation and execution optimization, the beta release introduces copy trading functionality adapted for prediction markets. Users can follow experienced participants across aggregated venues, supported by transparent performance metrics, historical analytics, and configurable risk controls. A built-in demo practice mode allows users to test copy trading strategies without committing real capital. Fors operates with a non-custodial design, ensuring users retain ownership of their funds while interacting with multiple prediction markets through a single interface. The January 8 beta launch represents an early step in Fors’s broader vision to provide infrastructure-level tools as prediction markets continue to mature. About Fors Fors was created to solve the fragmentation and inefficiencies in modern prediction markets. Built on Solana, the platform aggregates multiple prediction venues into a single, transparent interface. Fors focuses on fairness, neutrality, and data integrity, allowing users to compare markets without bias. Its mission is to make prediction markets accessible, efficient, and professional-grade. With features such as real-time aggregation, smart order routing, arbitrage visibility, and copy trading with demo practice, Fors has attracted strong early adoption and is helping shape the next generation of prediction market infrastructure.

Bitcoin is holding around $95,000 as the upside surprise reinforces concerns about sticky inflation pressuring the Fed’s ability to cut rates aggressively in 2026. Monthly PPI came in at 0.2% as expected, but the annual acceleration to 3.0% signals producer-level price pressures remain elevated and could eventually pass through to consumer prices. The PPI surprise matters because producer prices are a leading indicator for consumer inflation—higher wholesale costs typically flow through to retail prices with a lag. With yesterday’s December CPI already showing headline inflation stuck at 2.7% and core at 2.6%, both well above the Fed’s 2% target, today’s hot PPI reading suggests the inflation pipeline remains clogged. The combination of elevated producer prices and stubborn consumer inflation creates the exact “ higher for longer ” scenario Powell warned about, where the Fed keeps rates at 3.50%-3.75% through at least Q1 2026 rather than delivering the aggressive easing crypto markets priced in earlier. Bitcoin’s technical setup remains under pressure with support at $88,000-$90,000 and resistance at $92,000. As it stands now, traders digest whether the PPI shock forces the Fed to reconsider even its reduced two-cut guidance for 2026.

During the same period, the crypto market soared over 3% to a capitalization of more than $3.23 trillion. All of the top 10 largest cryptos by market cap printed gains throughout the past 24 hours, but ENA outperformed all of the crypto majors. Data from CoinCodex shows that ENA trades at $0.2366 at the time of writing. ENA price (Source: CoinCodex) While the crypto has managed to post a strong 24-hour performance, it’s still more than 2% in the red on the longer-term monthly timeframe. However, the altcoin could soon recover from its weekly performance, as known crypto figure Arthur Hayes predicted today that the crypto will eventually soar to $1 per coin. Hayes Says ENA Will Soar to $1 Hayes made his bold prediction in an X post earlier today. In his X post, Hayes included an announcement from Upbit that it will list Ethena’s USDe stablecoin and introduce a range of trading pairs at around 6:00 PM KST today. According to the exchange’s announcement, it added KRW, BTC, and USDT trading pairs for the stablecoin. Upbit is the largest crypto exchange in one of the most active crypto trading regions globally. As such, the platform listing USDe could be a massive boost for the entire Ethena ecosystem, including its ENA crypto, in coming weeks. If ENA does indeed soar to $1 like Hayes has predicted, it would mean a gain of about 318% from current levels. Hayes Has Been Acquiring ENA and Other “High-Quality” Defi Tokens The prediction by Hayes follows the crypto executive’s announcement in recent weeks that he will be allocating more of his portfolio to “high-qaulity” DeFi tokens. While he did not mention which cryptos he would be buying specifically, on-chain data shared by Lookonchain in December shows that Hayes was actively purchasing ENA, PENDLE, and ETHFI. According to Arkham Intelligence data , Hayes still holds about 3.16K ETH, which makes the altcoin king the largest allocation in his portfolio. His next-biggest investment is in EETH, followed by WEETH. At number 4 is ENA, with the crypto executive holding over 15.79 million tokens. At current prices, his holdings in ENA are valued at approximately $3.77 million.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-14 13:46:14

The developer, who launched the meme coin alongside Jackson Palmer in 2013, expressed skepticism about the prospect of new all-time highs in the immediate future. Markus posted his thoughts on X, stating that while the cryptocurrency sector appears healthy, he remains unconvinced about imminent record-breaking price levels. His comments come at a time when major digital assets continue to trade well below their previous peaks. The Dogecoin co-founder wrote that he would rather wait for concrete evidence of new all-time highs before getting excited about current market conditions. His tweet suggested a measured approach to evaluating crypto performance, despite generally positive market sentiment. Selective Endorsement of Digital Assets Markus has been vocal about his preferences within the cryptocurrency space. Based on his public statements, he reserves respect for a limited number of projects. Bitcoin and Ethereum top his list, followed by Dogecoin and a handful of other alternative coins. This selective stance sets him apart from many crypto enthusiasts who embrace a broader range of digital assets. Markus maintains clear boundaries about which projects he considers legitimate or worthy of attention. His skepticism extends beyond individual coins to entire categories of crypto activity. The developer has repeatedly compared cryptocurrency trading to gambling. He has even suggested it resembles a compulsive behavior rather than a rational investment strategy. Markus holds similarly negative views about non-fungible tokens. He has criticized both the NFT market and those who participate in collecting or trading these digital collectibles. His position reflects a cautious approach to newer developments in the blockchain space. Bitcoin's Recent Price Movements Bitcoin reached its most recent all-time high on October 6, when the cryptocurrency touched $126,198. The milestone marked a significant achievement for the digital asset market. Since that peak, Bitcoin has experienced substantial volatility. The cryptocurrency currently trades around $95,234, representing a decline of approximately 25% from its record level.

It is yet to receive a full MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) license, but it keeps taking pivotal steps towards 100% compliance as highlighted by its latest announcement. According to a recent post shared via Ripple’s official X page, they have secured preliminary approval for an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license from Luxembourg’s financial regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). Ripple secures EMI license approval The approval, issued in the form of a “Green Light Letter” from the CSSF, marks a step towards Ripple receiving its full EMI authorization, subject to relevant conditions. Once it gains full authorization, the license will allow Ripple to provide regulated payment services, including those involving stablecoins and digital assets, across the EU via passporting rules, which means it won’t need separate approvals in each country. “With the EU taking the lead in building a regulatory framework for digital assets, we’re helping institutions transition from pilots to commercial scale, and we’re bridging the gap between legacy finance and the digital future to unlock trillions in dormant capital,” the post read. “Thanks to the CSSF’s progressive and sophisticated approach to supervision, Luxembourg is establishing itself as a premier hub for financial innovation by providing the harmonised framework and legal certainty that our industry needs,” said Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, UK & Europe at Ripple. In the coming months, the company will focus on getting a full Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license under MiCA for broader compliance. Ripple now holds more than 75 licenses and registrations globally, with over $95 billion in volume processed while reaching 90% of daily FX markets. This underscores its push for regulatory legitimacy following its troubled history in the US. Ripple backs up UK registration with EMI license Days before the green light letter came from Luxembourg’s CSSF, Ripple announced it secured approval of its Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license and Cryptoasset Registration from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on January 9, 2026, as reported by Cryptopolitan. According to an official release, both permissions will allow the company to expand its licensed payments platform, providing UK institutions with the ability to send cross-border payments, using digital assets, seamlessly and efficiently. This will happen through Ripple Payments, a licensed, end-to-end cross-border payment solution that will manage the flow of funds on behalf of its customers, connecting them to its global payout partners to facilitate fast, transparent, and reliable payout capabilities around the world. “The UK has a well-deserved reputation for high regulatory standards. The FCA’s rigorous approach to compliance mirrors Ripple’s commitment to adhering to regulations,” said Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, UK & Europe at Ripple. She called securing approvals from the FCA a pivotal moment that enables the company to provide essential digital assets infrastructure to UK businesses. “We have seen in other jurisdictions how regulatory clarity drives adoption, and the UK is poised to take advantage,” she claimed. “The opportunity presented by digital assets is colossal and with our new licence, Ripple is ready to help the UK’s businesses seize that opportunity.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This crucial inflation metric matched market expectations precisely, providing traders and policymakers with essential data for navigating 2025 economic conditions. Meanwhile, the previously delayed October PPI revision revealed a more modest 0.1% increase, falling below consensus forecasts and adding complexity to the inflation narrative. Understanding the November 2024 US PPI Data Release The Producer Price Index serves as a vital leading indicator for broader inflation trends. This measurement tracks average price changes domestic producers receive for their output across all industries. Consequently, analysts closely monitor PPI movements for early signals about future Consumer Price Index trends. The November 2024 data release carries particular significance as markets assess the Federal Reserve’s potential policy trajectory for the coming year. Several key factors contributed to the November PPI increase. Energy price stabilization played a notable role after previous volatility. Additionally, supply chain normalization continued influencing producer costs throughout multiple sectors. The services component showed moderate pressure while goods prices exhibited mixed movements across categories. Importantly, the core PPI measurement excluding food and energy also demonstrated controlled increases. Historical Context and Inflation Trajectory Analysis Examining recent PPI trends reveals important patterns for economic forecasting. The table below illustrates the last six months of producer price movements: Month PPI Change (MoM) Core PPI Change Market Forecast June 2024 0.3% 0.2% 0.2% July 2024 0.4% 0.3% 0.3% August 2024 0.2% 0.2% 0.3% September 2024 0.3% 0.2% 0.2% October 2024 (revised) 0.1% 0.1% 0.3% November 2024 0.2% 0.2% 0.2% This historical data demonstrates several important trends. First, producer inflation has moderated significantly from earlier 2024 peaks. Second, the October revision downward suggests potential data volatility requiring careful interpretation. Third, the consistent alignment with forecasts indicates improving economic predictability. These patterns collectively suggest a gradual normalization of production-side inflation pressures. Market Implications and Federal Reserve Policy Considerations The November PPI data carries substantial implications for financial markets and monetary policy. Bond markets typically react to inflation signals through Treasury yield adjustments. Equity markets assess corporate profit margin implications from input cost changes. Currency markets evaluate relative economic strength and interest rate differentials. The precise 0.2% November increase suggests several market outcomes: Interest Rate Expectations: Markets likely maintain current Federal Reserve policy projections Corporate Earnings: Stable input costs support profit margin stability Consumer Outlook: Moderate producer increases suggest manageable consumer inflation Economic Growth: Balanced inflation supports sustainable expansion prospects Federal Reserve officials monitor PPI data alongside other indicators when formulating monetary policy. The November reading supports arguments for maintaining current interest rate levels while watching for persistent trends. However, policymakers remain vigilant about potential reacceleration risks from various economic factors. Sector Analysis and Industry-Specific Impacts Different economic sectors experienced varied producer price movements during November 2024. The manufacturing sector showed particular stability with minimal month-over-month changes. Construction materials exhibited slight increases while remaining within historical ranges. Transportation and warehousing costs demonstrated normalization after previous supply chain disruptions. Several key industry observations emerged from the detailed data: Energy sector prices stabilized significantly following earlier volatility. Food production costs showed minimal increases despite seasonal factors. Technology component pricing continued its gradual decline trend. Healthcare services maintained moderate but persistent upward pressure. These sector variations highlight the complex inflation landscape facing different industries as they plan for 2025 operations. Global Economic Context and Comparative Analysis The US PPI data gains additional significance when examined within global economic conditions. Major economies worldwide continue navigating post-pandemic inflation challenges with varying success. European producer prices have shown similar moderation trends in recent months. Asian manufacturing economies experience mixed inflation signals depending on regional factors. Several comparative observations provide valuable context: European Comparison: Eurozone PPI trends show parallel moderation patterns Chinese Influence: Manufacturing export prices affect global production costs Commodity Markets: Raw material prices demonstrate stabilization across categories Currency Effects: Dollar strength influences import cost calculations This global perspective helps analysts distinguish between domestic and international inflation drivers. The US economy demonstrates relative stability compared to certain international counterparts while facing shared global challenges. Understanding these connections proves essential for comprehensive economic analysis. Methodological Considerations and Data Reliability The Producer Price Index methodology involves complex data collection and calculation processes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics gathers price information from thousands of establishments across numerous industries. This comprehensive approach ensures representative measurement of producer-level inflation. However, several methodological factors deserve consideration when interpreting November’s results: Seasonal adjustments account for predictable annual patterns in certain industries. Quality adjustments attempt to separate pure price changes from product improvement effects. Sample rotation maintains data relevance as economic structures evolve. The October data revision highlights the importance of preliminary versus final data distinctions. These methodological elements contribute to the index’s reliability while requiring analytical awareness. Forward-Looking Indicators and Economic Forecasting Beyond the November PPI reading itself, several forward-looking indicators suggest potential inflation trajectories. Manufacturing surveys provide insights into future price expectations. Commodity futures markets offer price direction indications. Supply chain metrics reveal potential bottleneck developments. Business investment plans suggest capacity expansion timing. Analysts combine these indicators with historical PPI data for comprehensive forecasting: Current forward indicators generally suggest continued moderate producer inflation. Manufacturing capacity utilization remains below historical peaks. Global shipping costs show stability across major routes. Technology adoption continues improving production efficiency. Labor market conditions demonstrate gradual normalization. These factors collectively support projections of contained producer price increases through early 2025. Conclusion The US November PPI increase of 0.2% month-over-month provides crucial information for economic analysis and policy formulation. This precise alignment with forecasts indicates improving economic predictability amid complex global conditions. The concurrent October revision downward adds important context about data volatility and interpretation challenges. Together, these producer price measurements suggest contained inflation pressures at the production level as the economy transitions into 2025. Market participants and policymakers will continue monitoring subsequent data releases for confirmation of these trends and potential policy implications. The US PPI November 2024 data ultimately represents another data point in the ongoing assessment of post-pandemic economic normalization and sustainable growth prospects. FAQs Q1: What does the Producer Price Index measure exactly? The Producer Price Index tracks average selling price changes received by domestic producers for their output across all industries. It measures inflation at the wholesale or production level before reaching consumers. Q2: Why is PPI considered a leading indicator for consumer inflation? Producer price changes typically get passed through supply chains to consumer prices over subsequent months. Therefore, PPI movements often predict future Consumer Price Index trends, though the relationship isn’t always direct or immediate. Q3: How does the Federal Reserve use PPI data in policy decisions? The Federal Reserve considers PPI alongside numerous other indicators when assessing inflation trends. While consumer inflation measures receive primary focus, producer prices provide valuable insights about underlying inflation pressures and potential future directions. Q4: What caused the October PPI revision from initial estimates? Monthly economic data often undergoes revisions as more complete information becomes available. The October revision resulted from additional respondent data, seasonal adjustment recalculations, and methodological refinements common in statistical reporting. Q5: How might this PPI data affect financial markets in coming weeks? Financial markets typically respond to inflation data through interest rate expectations adjustments. The precisely forecast-aligned November reading likely maintains current market pricing for Federal Reserve policy while reducing uncertainty about inflation trajectories.

COIN remains highly profitable in crypto, with stablecoin revenues surging to $355 million in Q3'25 and subscription revenues at $747 million, up $190 million YoY. The company has multiple shots on goal—stablecoins, tokenized stocks, prediction markets—making COIN too compelling to ignore near yearly lows. Despite near-term volatility in crypto transaction volumes, the stock trades at just ~15x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA, appearing remarkably cheap relative to its growth runway. Despite positive regulatory developments in the crypto space, Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) has slumped the last 6 months. The crypto exchange is rapidly expanding into new categories, though growth in core products likely pushes the stock higher. My investment thesis is ultra Bullish on the stock following the sell off. Source: Finviz Major Product Expansion Coinbase is highly profitable from a strong crypto business, but the company is quickly expanding into zero-commission stock trading via tokenization and prediction markets. Coinbase is working on building an ""Everything Exchange"" to handle all of the financial transactions for a customer. Coinbase held an event back in December called Coinbase System Update 2025 where the company launched stock trading. At the same time, the company started rolling out the prediction markets business and recently bought The Clearing Company to provide the talent to grow trading on real-world events. The biggest risk is that these markets are already highly competitive with strong private players like Kalshi ( KALSHI ) and innovative fintechs like Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ). While Coinbase is also moving into stock trading, large fintech players like SoFi ( SOFI ) are now moving into crypto trading and using stablecoins for payments. In addition, the prediction markets are very early in development. Kalshi is one of the market leaders and only generated an estimated 2025 revenue of $264 million , though the December transaction fee revenues alone were an estimated $64 million, due primarily to sports predictions. Ultimately, Coinbase needs to just focus on the crypto lead and dive further into the growing opportunity in stablecoins. USDC now has a $74 billion market cap, but more importantly Coinbase generated $355 million worth of revenues during Q3'25, up $108 million YoY. Source: Coinbase Q3'25 shareholder letter The overall business is very volatile due to the large swings in transaction revenues. The Q3'25 revenues of $1.05 billion was actually down over $500 million from the Q4'24 peak. Coinbase continues to make huge progress expanding the subscription and services revenue. Including the stablecoin business, the company hit $747 million in subscription related revenues, up $190 million YoY and up $90 million sequentially. The Q4 forecast was for subscription revenues of $710 to $790 million. The target is mostly inline with the $747 million produced in the prior quarter, though the original guidance was only $665 to $745 million , suggesting another beat at the top end amounts to over $790 million in Q4. The total stablecoin market is only $300 billion now and the initial estimates forecast a market reaching $3 to $4 trillion , or at least 10x the current size. Coinbase is poised to lead this market with access to the 2nd largest coin. Crypto transaction revenues will likely disappoint. Bitcoin dipped to $81K during November, typically leading to lower transaction volumes as evidenced by the reported crypto monthly exchange volumes. Source: The Block Remarkably Cheap The stock only trades at ~15 EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA. A lot of investors view the stock as expensive due to trading at over 30x EPS targets while Coinbase has substantially larger adjusted EBITDA due to stock-based compensation. Source: Coinbase Q3'25 shareholder letter The current analyst estimates don't factor in any of these expansion products into any material growth. Coinbase is only forecast to grow revenues by a combined 25% over the next 2 years to reach just $9.3 billion in 2027. One would generally see the multi-trillion opportunity in stablecoins and blockchain rewards to provide this growth opportunity alone. Any rebound in crypto transactions and the new transaction markets of tokenized stock trading and prediction markets seems more like a huge bonus. The company remains loaded with cash and crypto assets, including $11.9 billion in USD resources and another $2.6 billion in long-term crypto assets. Coinbase has $7.2 billion in long-term debt for a new capital position of $7.3 billion. As discussed above, Coinbase faces low crypto transaction volumes during Q4. The consensus analyst estimates forecast revenues falling 17.3% to only $1.9 billion. The company has the potential for easy crypto comps in 2026 along with revenues from the new expansion products to provide material growth this year. On the flip side, a lot of these large fintechs like Coinbase, Robinhood and SoFi are starting to enter the same segments. The worse possible outcome is competition squeezing profit and cutting off growth. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Coinbase has too many shots on goal to ignore the stock here. Coinbase is too cheap to sell close to the yearly lows, especially before the product expansions in stablecoins, tokenized stock trading and prediction markets are just getting ramped up.",COIN,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-14 13:56:53

The executive made a bullish call of Ethena’s ENA racing to $1 in an expletive-enhanced post. The development comes as Dubai’s financial regulator excluded USDe from its approved stablecoin framework. Hayes, who serves as chief investment officer of his family office Maelstrom and has been a founding advisor to Ethena since 2023, responded to the Upbit announcement on social media platform X, writing , “Giddy up b*tches! it’s time for $ENA = $1.” The token went up by over 8.3% following the announcement and is currently priced at $0.238. The listing, which went live at 6 pm Korean Standard Time on January 14, 2026, offers trading pairs against the Korean won, Bitcoin, and Tether’s USDT across the Ethereum network. How does Ethena’s USDe work on Upbit? It has long been established that USDe is not a regular stablecoin, as it separates itself from traditional fiat-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC through its delta-neutral structure, which combines spot cryptocurrency collateral with offsetting short positions in perpetual futures contracts. The stablecoin is the third largest by market capitalization, coming behind USDT and USDC, respectively. Last year, an internal glitch in Binance’s platform caused the token to briefly depeg. According to Upbit’s statement , “USDe maintains a short position in a derivatives product of the same nominal value while holding cryptocurrency collateral, thereby maintaining stability close to the value of $1.” Upbit shared the USDe address that it supports, informing users to check the contract address when depositing or withdrawing USDe. Hayes, a long-term believer in the Ethena project, has shown his conviction through sustained accumulation of ENA over the years. Most recently, on-chain analytics show he purchased 1.22 million ENA tokens worth approximately $257,500 in late December 2025. Dubai says no to USDe The Upbit listing occurred just a few days after the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) updated its Crypto Token Regulatory Framework , which took effect on January 12. The latest update reserves the “fiat crypto tokens” designation exclusively for stablecoins backed by fiat currency reserves held in segregated accounts with regulated custodians. Elizabeth Wallace, associate director for policy and legal at the DFSA, reportedly stated, “Things like algorithmic stablecoins, it’s a little less transparent about how they operate and being able to redeem them.” As Cryptopolitan reported , Wallace made it known that stablecoins like USDe would not meet the Dubai International Financial Centre’s definition of a stablecoin, but stopped short of outrightly banning it. “The token would be considered a crypto token,” she said. The DFSA’s approved list includes only Circle’s USDC and EURC, along with Ripple’s RLUSD. To qualify, stablecoins must maintain reserves at least equal to outstanding tokens, denominated in the reference currency, held in highly liquid assets that carry minimal credit risk. The regulator also mandated that the accepted stablecoins publish their reserve information, which is independently verified monthly. Get seen where it counts.

This substantial investment fuels the company’s ambitious mission to establish what CEO Nicholas Leonard describes as the industry’s first true “voice agent factory.” The platform directly addresses a critical gap in the rapidly expanding market for conversational AI, specifically targeting enterprise developers who require robust, scalable, and code-native solutions for building sophisticated voice agents. VoiceRun’s Vision: Bridging the Gap in Voice Agent Development The genesis of VoiceRun stems from a clear market deficiency identified by co-founders Nicholas Leonard and Derek Caneja. While demand for AI voice agents skyrocketed, the available development tools presented a stark dichotomy. On one end, no-code platforms enabled rapid prototyping but often resulted in brittle, low-quality agents unsuitable for complex, production-grade applications. Conversely, building custom agents from scratch required months of specialized engineering effort, creating a significant barrier to entry and iteration. “Developers and enterprises desperately needed a viable alternative,” Leonard explained in an exclusive interview. “We recognized that the future of software development would increasingly involve coding agents—AI systems that write, validate, and optimize code. Therefore, the most natural and powerful interface for building voice agents should be code itself.” This fundamental insight became the cornerstone of VoiceRun’s platform, which positions code as the primary medium for agent creation, offering unparalleled flexibility and control compared to visual, diagram-based builders. The Code-First Advantage for Enterprise Scalability VoiceRun’s core differentiator lies in its commitment to a code-first paradigm. Traditional visual interfaces, while user-friendly for simple flows, inherently limit configuration options. For instance, customizing an agent’s dialect, implementing nuanced conversation logic, or integrating with proprietary backend systems can be exceptionally challenging or impossible within a constrained visual canvas. “In code, these tasks become incredibly simple,” Leonard stated. “There exists a long tail of millions of specific, unique requirements that visual interfaces cannot anticipate or support. By operating in code—the native language of both developers and the emerging class of AI coding assistants—we enable the creation of truly sophisticated and tailored voice experiences.” This approach ensures that ownership of business logic and data remains firmly in the customer’s hands, a crucial consideration for enterprise adoption regarding security, compliance, and intellectual property. Market Context and Competitive Landscape The $5.5 million seed round arrives during a period of intense investment and competition within the AI agent ecosystem. In 2024 alone, startups in this space attracted billions in venture capital, reflecting widespread belief in AI automation’s transformative potential. VoiceRun strategically positions itself between two existing market segments: lightweight no-code demo builders like Bland and ReTell AI, and highly complex, developer-centric frameworks like LiveKit and Pipecat. The company’s value proposition combines global voice infrastructure with an evaluation-driven development lifecycle. Key features include: One-Click Deployment: Instantaneous shipping of voice agents to production environments. Integrated A/B Testing: Built-in tools for performance comparison and optimization. Coding Agent Integration: A platform designed for developers to supervise AI agents that write code, run tests, and propose improvements. “We are closing the loop for end-to-end coding agent development,” Leonard emphasized. This focus on the entire agent lifecycle—from creation and testing to deployment and iterative improvement—aims to provide a comprehensive “factory” solution. Addressing the Human-Automation Trust Deficit A significant hurdle for voice AI adoption remains user skepticism. Surveys, such as one conducted by Five9 in 2024, consistently show a strong preference for human customer service agents, often driven by past experiences with “brittle and ineffective” automated systems. Customers frequently report feeling relief when a human answers the phone. Leonard argues that advanced voice agents built on robust platforms like VoiceRun can overcome this trust deficit. “Human agents have inherent limitations, including language barriers, availability, and potential for subjective judgment,” he noted. The goal is to create voice agents so seamless, helpful, and reliable that they become the preferred interaction channel. By empowering developers to build higher-quality agents, VoiceRun aims to shift this pervasive market perception. The Road Ahead: Building the Voice Agent Assembly Line The fresh capital will primarily accelerate platform development, expand engineering teams, and drive enterprise customer acquisition. VoiceRun’s initial use cases demonstrate its versatility, ranging from AI-powered customer service integrations for large corporations to specialized applications like the restaurant-tech company building an AI phone concierge for managing food reservations. Leonard draws a historical parallel to illustrate the company’s ambition: “There were great cars before the Model T, but vehicles didn’t become ubiquitous until the assembly line was invented. Similarly, there are impressive voice agents today, but they won’t achieve ubiquity until we have a scalable, repeatable process for their creation and deployment. VoiceRun is building that assembly line.” The company’s success will hinge on its ability to attract a developer community, continuously enhance its code-first tooling, and demonstrate tangible ROI for enterprise clients navigating the complex transition to AI-augmented operations. As the AI landscape evolves, platforms that effectively bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, scalable implementation are poised to define the next wave of technological integration. Conclusion VoiceRun’s $5.5 million seed funding marks a pivotal step in the maturation of the voice AI sector. By championing a code-first philosophy and targeting the specific needs of enterprise developers, the company is constructing a foundational platform for the next generation of voice agents. The “voice agent factory” vision, if realized, could significantly lower barriers to creating sophisticated, reliable, and scalable conversational AI, ultimately helping to automate complex tasks and reshape how businesses and consumers interact with technology through voice. The race to build the dominant platform in this space is intensifying, and VoiceRun has now secured critical resources to compete. FAQs Q1: What is VoiceRun’s primary innovation? VoiceRun’s core innovation is a “code-first” platform for building AI voice agents. Unlike visual, no-code tools, it allows developers to program agent behavior directly in code, offering greater flexibility, control, and suitability for complex, enterprise-grade applications. Q2: Who led VoiceRun’s recent funding round? The $5.5 million seed round was led by venture capital firm Flybridge Capital, with participation from other investors. This funding will support platform development and market expansion. Q3: What problem does VoiceRun solve for developers? It solves the choice between fast-but-limited no-code tools and slow, resource-intensive custom builds. VoiceRun provides a middle ground: the control and power of coding with the infrastructure and lifecycle management tools needed for scalable production deployment. Q4: What are the main use cases for VoiceRun’s platform? Primary use cases include AI-enhanced customer service systems, voice-based product interfaces, and specialized automation like AI phone concierges for industries such as hospitality (e.g., restaurant reservations) and tech support. Q5: How does VoiceRun handle the challenge of user trust in AI voices? The platform aims to build trust indirectly by empowering developers to create higher-quality, more reliable, and context-aware voice agents. By moving beyond “brittle” automation, these advanced agents can provide a superior user experience that may eventually surpass customer preference for human agents in many scenarios.

Justin Slaughter, Paradigm’s vice president for regulatory affairs, said the law itself would only begin a longer process of writing dozens of detailed rules that agencies must draft, publish for comment, and finalize. Lawmakers Unveil Draft Bill On January 13, 2026, US senators released a draft bill meant to clarify which tokens are securities or commodities and to set who regulates spot crypto trading. The draft would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority over many spot markets and includes measures aimed at limiting how stablecoins are used to pay interest, among other provisions. Rulemaking Could Stretch For Years Slaughter pointed out that the bill would require about 45 separate, detailed rules to be written by regulators before its goals could be fully enforced. That is a heavy technical lift. He compared the likely timeline to rules written after the Dodd-Frank law , which took roughly three to eight years to be finalized for many parts of the financial system. Ok, so here are the main takeaways I have. First, this bill is still missing a lot of things. There’s nothing at all on ethics (which is going to be a big hang-up for people) nor is there anything on a quorum requirement for the Commissions. The Dems won’t sign a bill that… https://t.co/2ckoCO6QlW — Justin Slaughter (@JBSDC) January 14, 2026 That comparison matters because it shows how slow the work can be even when lawmakers act quickly. Agencies must draft proposals, take public comments, revise drafts, and then publish final rules. Each step can be delayed by legal challenges, staffing limits, or political shifts. Industry Groups Prepare For Phased Change Exchanges, banks, and stablecoin firms have already begun drafting compliance plans. Some industry players say they prefer the bill’s tilt toward the CFTC for spot oversight, believing it could ease certain market practices. Others worry that long rulemaking windows will leave uncertainty for months, or even years, while firms try to follow shifting guidance. What Could Slow Things Down Among the likely bottlenecks: fights over who enforces which rules, debates on how decentralized finance fits under old statutes, and political turnover. Slaughter warned that parts of the rulemaking might span two presidential terms before everything is settled. That would leave the sector operating under a mix of new guidance and legacy rules for a long time. Lawyers And Regulators Step Into The Fray Regulatory staff at the SEC and CFTC have already ramped up work on crypto issues. The SEC has signaled plans to update long-standing securities rules to better address tokenized instruments. At the same time, the CFTC is preparing market-structure and custody guidance tied to its growing role. These agency moves will shape the final form of the technical rules required by whatever law, if any, becomes binding.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Is Not In At $126,000, According To The Business Cycle, Here’s Why According to a technical analysis from a crypto analyst known as Jackis on the social media platform X, arguments alone are not enough here because there are both good bullish & bearish arguments out there for Bitcoin. In his words, he has watched similar-looking price action resolve in opposite directions across different cycles. The chart below shows how Bitcoin price action is currently forming an ascending triangle pattern on the 8-hour candlestick timeframe chart. However, examples show how this same formation led to an upward reversal for Bitcoin in the past and then also a bearish continuation for Ethereum in the past. Based on his read, he currently sees more reasons for downward continuation, and until the market proves otherwise, the active trend is bearish. Both bullish and bearish outlooks have a case, but price action has to confirm. Bullish And Bearish Scenarios For Bitcoin Once price breaks out in either direction, the follow-through can be fast, which means being stubborn on the wrong side can be costly. Related Reading: Why The $2.9 Billion Bitcoin Whale Buy Could Spell Doom For The Market On the bullish side, Jackis highlighted that a breakout toward $96,000 is the kind of move that would confirm a bullish continuation. He added that a push through $96,000 at this point could open the path to $107,000 or higher. On the other hand, Jackis’ bearish trigger is tied to the rising support line. Price action can look constructive right up until the trendline snaps, and that’s the point where downside continuation becomes the higher-probability route in this framework. If Bitcoin were to lose the lower trendline of the ascending trend, then it would likely drift back to the April 24 lows. The April lows refer to how Bitcoin rejected above $106,100 in January 2025 and entered into a multi-month correction that eventually bottomed at a low around $76,000. This means that a clean breakdown could change the conversation away from range chop in the mid-$90,000s to a reset.

Under this policy, eligible traders receive payouts within one business day following a completed evaluation process. Fondeo.xyz , a US-based crypto-native proprietary trading firm, has introduced a 24 hour payout guarantee for qualified traders. The operational update reflects an adjustment to the company’s payout process as it continues to expand its services across multiple markets. The payout guarantee is intended to address delays associated with withdrawals in digital asset trading. Under the policy, eligible traders receive payouts within one business day after submitting a withdrawal request. The firm reports having supported a large number of traders through its evaluation-based funding program, with cumulative payouts exceeding $1 million. Traders who complete the Fondeo.xyz evaluation process are eligible for the 24 hour payout policy. The evaluation model includes one step and two step performance phases with defined performance targets and drawdown limits. Traders access accounts through API integration with Bybit’s demo platform. Following funding approval, traders may retain a percentage of trading results, and withdrawals are processed in supported cryptocurrencies through external payment partners. ""The ability to access potential profits quickly is essential to the modern crypto trader,"" said Jake Salomon, COO at Fondeo.xyz. ""Delays in payout processing can limit flexibility, especially for traders navigating high-volatility markets and relying on performance income. Our 24-hour guarantee is part of a broader effort to ensure our infrastructure reflects the needs of those we support."" In contrast to industry standards, where payouts often take several days to process, the new Fondeo.xyz policy reduces uncertainty and strengthens the company's commitment to timely execution. Furthermore, the company developed this payout feature based on direct feedback from its global trading community. Industry data confirms the importance of faster trading infrastructure, particularly in the growing crypto prop trading sector. As cryptocurrency markets continue to mature with 24/7 trading and increasing institutional participation, there has been a sharp rise in demand for advanced platforms offering quick access to capital, direct exchange integrations, and deep liquidity. This focus on speed and transparency aligns with the broader ambition of crypto prop firms to empower disciplined traders in dynamic digital asset environments. ""Our goal has always been to align with how crypto traders work today,"" the spokesperson added. ""Whether they are manual or algorithmic traders, working full time or part time, the certainty of payouts is a fundamental component of a sustainable model."" Traders must complete the Fondeo.xyz evaluation process to qualify for the 24 hour payout.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-coach-xrp-will-be-the-one-they-will-say-they-missed-heres-why/,"Every major market cycle leaves behind a trail of missed opportunities that only become obvious in hindsight. Assets that once felt uncertain often transform into case studies of regret after price moves decisively higher. In the crypto market, these moments repeat with striking consistency, and XRP now appears to be approaching one of those defining phases. In a recent post on X, finance educator and market commentator Coach JV shared a perspective that places XRP within this familiar historical pattern. He framed XRP as an asset many investors may later reference with the same frustration once reserved for Bitcoin’s early years, when hesitation overshadowed conviction. Markets Reward Conviction Before Consensus Financial markets rarely reward comfort. During early accumulation phases, skepticism dominates, and narratives remain fragmented. Investors often wait for widespread validation, but by the time consensus forms, price has already repriced significantly. Coach, JV’s message highlights this psychological reality, emphasizing that hesitation, not lack of access, drives most missed opportunities. XRP will be the one they say they missed. You’ll hear it everywhere: “Man… I had the chance to buy it under $3.” Just like Bitcoin. Same regret. Same excuses. Same people. History doesn’t repeat, it exposes who lacked conviction. — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) January 13, 2026 XRP currently trades in a zone where conviction feels challenging rather than obvious. This environment mirrors the early stages of past market leaders, where long-term potential existed well before mass participation arrived. XRP’s Enduring Market Presence Unlike short-lived speculative tokens, XRP has sustained relevance across multiple market cycles . Its deep liquidity, global market access, and consistent trading volume continue to position it among the most actively watched digital assets. This durability supports the view that XRP remains a long-term market participant rather than a temporary trend. Coach, JV’s outlook aligns with the idea that assets with longevity often deliver their strongest moves after extended periods of doubt. XRP’s ability to remain structurally intact through varying market conditions reinforces the argument that it has not completed its broader market cycle. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Role of Psychology in Missed Opportunities History shows that regret in investing follows a predictable script. Investors often recall moments when the price felt “too risky,” or narratives seemed unclear. Later, those same price levels appear trivial. Coach, JV suggests that XRP may soon become part of that recurring dialogue, where sub-$3 levels get remembered as missed entries rather than ongoing opportunities. This psychological shift typically occurs when price accelerates, and doubt fades. At that stage, conviction no longer feels risky, but late participation limits upside. Why XRP Fits the Pattern XRP’s current positioning reflects a classic pre-consensus phase. Price remains accessible, sentiment remains divided, and long-term narratives continue to develop. These conditions historically define moments of opportunity rather than moments of excess. If the broader market continues to strengthen, XRP may transition from debated to accepted. When that happens, many investors may look back and recognize that the window for early conviction had already closed.

Unlike traditional gold storage methods where investors retain the precious metal without earning interest, on-chain tokenized gold like XAUT enables users to capitalize on gold’s upward trend while simultaneously earning yield on their holdings, combining the best of both wealth preservation and income generation. This update enables eligible Bybit users to earn up to 11% APR on tokenized gold (XAUT) holdings of 0.05 to 0.1 XAUT, with a base 1% APR applying to balances above 0.1 XAUT, effective immediately. With gold price surpassing $4,600 per ounce for the first time, Bybit Earn rises to meet global investors’ heightened safe-haven demand driven by geopolitical tensions and uncertainty. At the end of 2025, gold concluded its historic rally with a 65% increase in prices. Tokenized gold like XAUT are testament to the value of financial innovation. It provides unique benefits compared to physical gold: Yield Opportunities : In addition to potential gold price appreciation, holders can unlock earning potential on-chain lending and staking, a feature previously unavailable with physical gold. Fractional Ownership : Tokenized gold like XAUT allows ownership from as little as 0.001 XAUT, enabling accessible entry-level investing unavailable with physical gold bars or coins. 24/7 Global Liquidity : Trade or transfer instantly around the clock on blockchain platforms, without dealer spreads or banking hour limitations. No Storage Hassles : Eliminates vault fees, insurance, transportation risks, the need for physical space and thereby theft concerns, all through blockchain custody. Bybit’s XAUT Flexible Easy Earn stands out with no lock-up period, daily interest accrual, and anytime withdrawals. Its tiered APR structure also incentivizes smaller positions to broaden access to gold-backed yields. With both flexibility and maximized exposure to yield opportunities, Bybit Easy Earn helps traders capture potential market upsides and sets the gold standard for on-chain advantages for CEX users. #Bybit / #CryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 80 million users.

57159592,https://cryptonews.com/?p=474151,1768399688,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57159592.jpeg,UK Rolls Back Digital ID Plan for Work Checks Following Public Opposition,https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-rolls-back-digital-id-plan-for-work-checks-following-public-opposition/,"Britain’s government has abandoned its requirement for workers to register with a new digital ID system to prove their right to work, marking a significant retreat after public support collapsed and nearly three million people signed a petition opposing the scheme. While digital right-to-work checks will still become mandatory by 2029, workers can now use alternative verification methods, including biometric passports and commercial apps, rather than enrolling in the government’s digital ID program, according to BBC . The reversal follows months of mounting criticism since Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared in September that “ you will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. ” Prime Minister Keir Starmer. | Source: The Nation From Immigration Control to Public Services Ministers are now repositioning digital ID as a convenience tool for accessing public services rather than primarily as an immigration enforcement measure. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasized that the government remains “ absolutely committed ” to mandatory digital right-to-work checks, including biometric passports, but thatdigital ID will be optional for workers proving eligibility. The shift addresses what officials described as concerns about “ conspiracy nonsense about state control ” while attempting to rebuild support for voluntary adoption. Current right-to-work verification relies on employers checking paper documents with no central record-keeping, which the government argues enables fraud and illegal employment. The reformed system will require digital verification against government databases, but workers can meet this requirement using existing documents rather than enrolling in the new ID program. Commercial verification apps checked against Home Office data are also being explored as additional compliance methods. Political Backlash Intensifies Opposition parties seized on the policy retreat as evidence of governmental disarray. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called it “ another U-turn ” and declared “ good riddance ” to what she termed a “ terrible policy ,” while Liberal Democrat spokesperson Lisa Smart quipped that “ No 10 must be bulk ordering motion sickness tablets at this rate. “ The Prime Minister is 'turning the corner'…straight into another u-turn. Good riddance. It was a terrible policy anyway. pic.twitter.com/cWGFhhD9gv — Kemi Badenoch (@KemiBadenoch) January 13, 2026 Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed victory for “ individual liberty against a ghastly, authoritarian government, ” though his party had previously received £9 million in crypto donations, prompting separate Labour calls to ban digital currency political contributions . The climbdown adds to mounting frustration among Labour MPs who had defended controversial policies only to see them reversed, with one parliamentarian calling the latest retreat “ an absolute car crash ” and complaining that leadership “ marched the PLP up the hill only to bottle it. ” Former Home Secretary David Blunkett, who supported ID cards during his tenure, blamed poor strategic communication for allowing opposition to mobilize effectively against the proposal. Civil liberties organizations, including Open Rights Group, warned throughout the debate about inevitable “ mission creep ” forcing expanded ID use across everyday life. Their concerns drew from evidence of harms experienced by migrants already subject to digital verification through the eVisa system, where data errors and technical glitches have prevented people from proving residency status, leading to withdrawn job offers and housing denials. Keir Starmer has abandoned plans for the Digital ID to be compulsory. This is a victory for individual liberty against a ghastly, authoritarian government. Reform UK would scrap it altogether. — Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage) January 13, 2026 The government maintains that the core reform remains intact despite removing mandatory registration. A spokesperson insisted digital ID “ will make everyday life easier for people ” while delivering “ more personal, joined-up, and effective ” public services. Details of how the system will function will be outlined in a public consultation launching shortly, with implementation still scheduled for 2029 using government-built platforms, including Gov.uk One Login and Gov.uk Wallet. UK Crypto Regulation Advances Amid Digital ID Controversy The digital ID reversal comes as Britain separately moves forward with comprehensive crypto regulation, bringing digital assets under Financial Conduct Authority supervision from 2027. The government introduced legislation in December requiring crypto firms to secure formal authorization by September 2026, ending the current registration-only system that has allowed lighter-touch oversight. The rules apply transparency standards similar to traditional finance, with final requirements expected by end-2026 following industry feedback periods . UK's FCA sets September 2026 application deadline for crypto licensing as new authorization regime launches in 2027, ending current registration-only system with no automatic conversion. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/LojvG0BvPd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 9, 2026 Britain also formally recognized Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as legal property under new legislation, allowing digital assets to be owned, inherited, and recovered under property law protections. The regulatory push follows data showing crypto ownership among UK adults dropped from 12% to 8% in 2025, though remaining holders have built larger portfolios concentrated in higher-value ranges.

The warning comes as lawmakers move to bridge House and Senate regulatory proposals amid ongoing market volatility and policy uncertainty. Senate Crypto Bill Gives Treasury Broad New Powers, Galaxy Says In a research note published Tuesday, Galaxy said the Senate Banking Committee’s draft goes well beyond the House-passed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, particularly in its treatment of illicit finance. This week on Galaxy Grid — a weekly video series from @glxyresearch . @intangiblecoins , @TheThadP , @Uptodatenow , and @ZackPokorny_ unpack the stories shaping crypto — what happened, why it matters, and what’s next. Episode 13 is live now pic.twitter.com/s7pgSvYUNI — Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) January 13, 2026 At the center of the firm’s concern is a new crypto-specific “special measures” authority that would allow Treasury to label foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions, or even entire categories of digital asset transactions as primary money-laundering concerns. Once designated, Treasury could restrict or condition crypto fund transfers connected to those entities, a power Galaxy compared directly to authorities created under the Patriot Act after the September 11 attacks. Galaxy argued that, while framed as a national security tool, the authority could be applied broadly across offshore trading venues and transaction rails, materially expanding the government’s reach into crypto markets. It said that, taken together, the bill’s provisions would amount to the largest expansion of financial surveillance powers since the early 2000s, a period that remains controversial for its impact on civil liberties. The draft legislation also introduces a formal framework for temporary transaction holds. Under this mechanism, Treasury or other covered agencies could request that stablecoin issuers and digital asset service providers freeze transactions for up to 30 days, with the option to extend, without first obtaining a court order. Galaxy flagged this as a significant departure from existing processes, noting the absence of immediate judicial oversight. Another section of the bill explicitly brings crypto front ends into sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering compliance. The text defines “distributed ledger application layers,” including web-hosted interfaces used to access blockchains and decentralized finance protocols. It also directs Treasury to issue guidance requiring these tools to screen wallets, block sanctioned activity, and apply risk-based AML controls. Stablecoin Rewards Face New Limits as Senate Crypto Debate Intensifies Galaxy also pointed to language targeting so-called “DeFi in name only” protocols, which would allow regulators to impose Bank Secrecy Act obligations on teams or individuals who retain meaningful control over protocol functionality or user access. The Senate proposal is moving forward alongside intense debate over stablecoin rewards. A revised draft released ahead of the markup would prohibit digital asset service providers from paying yield simply for holding payment stablecoin balances. Banking groups have backed the restriction, arguing that yield-bearing stablecoins resemble deposits without equivalent safeguards, while crypto firms say the issue was already settled under the GENIUS Act passed last year. Industry responses have been mixed, with the Crypto Council for Innovation saying it views the Senate text as evidence of continued engagement on a critical policy priority but stressing that any final framework must preserve consumer choice and support competition. Coinbase has warned it could withdraw support if reward programs are curtailed too aggressively, even as some executives signal a willingness to accept the current compromise. The legislative path remains uncertain as the Senate Banking Committee is preparing for markup this week , while the Senate Agriculture Committee plans to release its own text by January 21, with a markup scheduled for January 27. Senate sets January 27 crypto bill markup as banking lobby secures stablecoin yield limits and Democrats demand White House ethics guardrails. #Senate #Banking #CryptoBill https://t.co/iK8utlKRhr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 14, 2026 Both versions would need to be reconciled before a full Senate vote, followed by negotiations with the House.

For Deribit customers in eligible jurisdictions, the new listing offers two daily, two weekly, one monthly, and one quarterly expiry, further expanding institutional-grade derivatives access to the TRON ecosystem.

The growing adoption of stablecoin-settled options reflects increasing demand for flexible, capital-efficient derivatives products among both institutional and professional traders. Over the past year, Deribit has seen strong growth in linear options activity, underscoring sustained interest in innovative and accessible derivatives infrastructure. This listing reflects the continued adoption of the TRON ecosystem as institutional participants increasingly incorporate TRX into established market frameworks. As institutional engagement with blockchain networks continues to evolve, TRON remains focused on maintaining a stable, scalable, and open network environment that supports long-term ecosystem development and a broad range of market-driven use cases.

SBIT is suitable only for daily tactical trades; holding longer exposes investors to compounding risk, NAV erosion, and significant losses. Recent bitcoin volatility and institutionalization may limit trading opportunities for 2026 if bitcoin price performance remains relatively flat. I assign SBIT a Hold rating, emphasizing its utility for daily trading but warning against long-term speculation due to inherent structural risks. The ProShares Ultrashort Bitcoin ETF ( SBIT ) is an inverse leveraged exchange-traded fund designed to provide -2x the daily performance of bitcoin. The strategy exhibits significant liquidity with over $104mm in share value changing hands on a daily basis, making SBIT an appealing investment vehicle for gaining amplified inverse exposure to bitcoin. Given that this is a leveraged fund, SBIT should only be utilized for daily exposure as a long-term position may present significant risks to investors, including value decay, price volatility, adverse performance, and unsalvageable losses. About ProShares Ultrashort Bitcoin ETF SBIT was launched by ProShares on April 1, 2024 on the NYSE Arca Exchange. The strategy has a net expense ratio of 95bps, making this a cost-effective leveraged strategy for those seeking to gain inverse leveraged exposure to bitcoin. An investment in SBIT is similar to taking a short position in bitcoin, providing investors with upside potential when the price of bitcoin declines. Seeking Alpha SBIT utilizes swap derivatives in order to gain exposure to -2x the daily performance of bitcoin. Swaps are derivatives that provide performance exposure to SBIT in exchange for a fixed rate. Swaps are settled at the end of each trading day, exchanging performance for the fixed rate and are reset the following trading day. This will be reflected in the performance of SBIT in which the performance of the ETF will be measured on a daily basis. As a result of this phenomenon, SBIT’s performance beyond a single trading day may result in a compounding effect beyond the indicated -2x daily performance target to both the upside and downside. Investors should be aware that the long-term performance of SBIT will not be reflective of the long-term performance of bitcoin. For example, the 1-year returns of bitcoin was -3.76% whereas SBIT declined by -34.11%. TradingView On the other hand, bitcoin declined by roughly -21% in the last 3 months with SBIT returning roughly 40%. TradingView Despite bitcoin’s decline in the last year, different holding periods may return widely differentiated returns. This is largely due to the path of the underlying asset throughout the holding period in which long stretches of bitcoin price appreciation may compound to the downside for SBIT, resulting in deeper losses despite bitcoin’s inevitable decline. For this reason, SBIT should not be utilized for long-term speculation as medium-term pricing trends may significantly impact the inevitable returns of SBIT. This is also due to how performance is calculated with respect to the underlying asset; rather than rolling returns, SBIT will experience a daily reset that can impact overall performance despite the inevitable price decline of bitcoin. Factors that may influence the price of SBIT include pricing volatility, trading momentum, and NAV erosion. Investors should consider these factors prior to making an investment decision, particularly if the intention is to hold SBIT for longer than a single trading day. In terms of my outlook, I’m expecting bitcoin to remain relatively price-constrained below $100k/bitcoin. My rationale behind this comes in two parts: Leveraged positions wiped out in October 2025. Institutionalization of bitcoin. In October 2025 , the price volatility of bitcoin led to $19b in leveraged strategies being wiped out. Though I don’t expect this to deteriorate the bitcoin trading market, particularly when considering that the coin market capitalization sits at roughly $1.8T, I expect investors to take more precaution when evaluating risky trading strategies. My second point is that bitcoin has largely become an institutional asset following the emergence of bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024. Though bitcoin spot ETFs account for roughly 6.61% of the total market capitalization for bitcoin, this percentage of the market can be impactful to the pricing of the underlying asset, particularly given that bitcoin is oftentimes traded on momentum. The use of bitcoin spot ETFs as part of an investment portfolio subjects bitcoin to standard advisory operations, including rebalances and cash raises, which may influence the perceived direction of the coin. Coinglass Though I’m not expecting any major movements to the downside for bitcoin at this point in time, traders may opportunistically trade momentum to both the upside and downside, using leveraged and inverse leveraged ETFs like the ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) and SBIT. For a tactical strategy, traders can use a variety of tools in an attempt to predict market direction, such as time squeeze, RSI, and EMA, amongst other technical indicators. Time squeeze could be an appealing tool as it presents the directional trading volumes and the directional shift. TradingView Additional Risks Related to SBIT Investors should be mindful of the risks associated with trading SBIT; the misuse of a leveraged or inverse leveraged ETF may result in adverse performance and substantial losses. SBIT is meant to be traded within a single trading day; holding SBIT for longer than a single trading day may expose investors to NAV erosion, compounded performance, and significant losses. Bitcoin has traditionally exhibited significant volatility, which may be amplified when using SBIT. Inverse leveraged strategies tend to gravitate towards $0/share over the long run as a result of long-term asset price appreciation expectations. Given the risky nature of SBIT, I recommend traders adhere to strict risk management practices with set trading parameters prior to initiating a trade. TradingView Investors should consider the total cost of trading when calculating total returns. Trading SBIT may expose investors to higher short-term capital gains, brokerage fees, and spread risk on top of the expense ratio. You can review additional risks here and the SEC bulletin here . Final Thoughts Given its significant trading volumes, SBIT can be an appealing trading vehicle for traders seeking to amplify their exposure to the inverse of bitcoin pricing. SBIT should only be utilized for daily exposure as holding the ETF may expose investors to significant risk that may result in unrecoverable losses. Given the risks involved in holding leveraged strategies, I am recommending SBIT with a Hold rating.",BITU|SBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-14 15:23:41
57161328,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261531,1768404311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Soars: Remarkable Rally Propels BTC Above $97,000 Milestone",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-soars-above-97000-milestone/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: Remarkable Rally Propels BTC Above $97,000 Milestone In a significant development for global digital asset markets, Bitcoin (BTC) has decisively broken through the $97,000 barrier, trading at $97,040.94 on the Binance USDT pairing as of late March 2025. This surge represents a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency’s ongoing market cycle, capturing the attention of investors and analysts worldwide. The move underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role within the broader financial landscape, prompting a detailed examination of the catalysts and context behind this latest price achievement. Bitcoin Price Breaches $97,000: A Market Analysis The ascent past $97,000 marks a continuation of Bitcoin’s strong performance this quarter. According to data from Bitcoin World and other major market monitors, the rally gained momentum during Asian and European trading hours. Consequently, this price level establishes a new local high and tests a critical psychological resistance zone. Market depth charts on several major exchanges, including Binance, show substantial buy-side liquidity supporting the move. Furthermore, trading volume has increased by approximately 35% compared to the weekly average, indicating robust participation. Several technical and on-chain factors provide context for this move. Firstly, the asset has remained above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages for several consecutive weeks. Secondly, network fundamentals remain strong. For instance, the hash rate—a measure of computational security—continues to hover near all-time highs. Additionally, activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, measured by daily transaction counts and settlement value, has shown consistent growth. This combination of technical strength and fundamental health often precedes significant price movements. Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Multiple macroeconomic and sector-specific tailwinds appear to be fueling Bitcoin’s current rally. Primarily, shifting expectations around global monetary policy have played a central role. As several major economies signal a potential pause or pivot in interest rate hikes, traditional safe-haven assets and alternative stores of value often see increased demand. Bitcoin, frequently characterized as ‘digital gold,’ typically benefits from such an environment. Moreover, institutional adoption continues its measured pace. Recent filings with regulatory bodies show several new fund vehicles seeking exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs, bringing fresh capital into the ecosystem. Another key driver is the continued evolution of Bitcoin’s own technological layer. The successful integration and scaling of Layer-2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, enhance Bitcoin’s utility for smaller, faster transactions. This development addresses long-standing critiques about scalability and practical use. Simultaneously, regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, though still a work in progress, has reduced systemic uncertainty for large investors. The convergence of these factors—macro conditions, institutional flows, and technological progress—creates a powerful narrative for sustained interest. Expert Perspectives on the Current Cycle Financial analysts and cryptocurrency researchers offer measured insights into this phase. “While the $97,000 level is psychologically important, the underlying market structure is what matters most,” notes a report from Arcane Research, a leading crypto analytics firm. The report highlights that open interest in Bitcoin derivatives markets has risen, but funding rates remain relatively neutral. This suggests that the rally is not being driven excessively by leveraged speculation, which is often a precursor to sharp corrections. Instead, spot market buying appears to be the dominant force. Historical data also provides valuable context. The following table compares key metrics from previous Bitcoin cycles near similar price-discovery phases: Cycle Phase (Approx.) Price Range Realized Cap Growth (30-day) Exchange Net Flow Q4 2020 $18k – $20k +12% Strong Outflow Q1 2025 $95k – $97k +9% Moderate Outflow This comparison indicates that while growth is strong, current capital inflows are somewhat more tempered than in prior bull market peaks, potentially indicating a more sustainable advance. Experts from firms like Glassnode point to the behavior of long-term holders (LTHs). Their analysis shows that the percentage of BTC supply held by LTHs has not declined significantly during this rally. This holder behavior often signals conviction and reduces immediate selling pressure. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The breach of $97,000 carries implications beyond Bitcoin’s own price chart. Firstly, it often has a positive correlation effect on the wider digital asset sector. Major altcoins and sector indices frequently experience heightened volatility and potential rallies when Bitcoin establishes a strong directional trend. Secondly, it influences corporate and institutional balance sheet strategies. Public companies with Bitcoin treasury allocations see marked-to-market gains, which can impact their quarterly financial statements and investment strategies. For retail and institutional investors, key considerations now include: Volatility Management: High prices can lead to increased short-term volatility. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors may reassess their asset allocation percentages. Regulatory Scrutiny: Significant price milestones often attract renewed attention from policymakers. Market Sentiment: Extreme bullishness can be a contrarian indicator if it becomes pervasive. Furthermore, the global adoption narrative receives a boost. News of fresh all-time highs typically drives increased searches, mainstream media coverage, and newcomer interest. This can lead to higher on-chain activity as new users create wallets and execute transactions. However, it also necessitates continued emphasis on security education to protect new participants from common pitfalls. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $97,000 represents a complex interplay of technical strength, improving fundamentals, and shifting macro winds. The current Bitcoin price action reflects growing confidence among a diverse set of market participants, from long-term holders to institutional funds. While milestones are notable, a focus on the underlying health of the network—security, adoption, and innovation—provides a more complete picture than price alone. As the market digests this move, monitoring on-chain data, regulatory developments, and global liquidity conditions will be crucial for understanding the next phase for BTC and the broader digital economy. FAQs Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price reported? The price was $97,040.94 on the Binance USDT trading pair, as reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring. Q2: Why is breaking $97,000 significant for Bitcoin? It represents a key psychological and technical resistance level, often seen as a gateway to testing higher price ranges and attracting new market attention. Q3: What are common factors that drive Bitcoin’s price up? Major drivers include macroeconomic conditions (like interest rates), institutional investment flows, regulatory news, technological upgrades, and overall market sentiment. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s current price compare to its all-time high? This information requires checking the most recent all-time high data, as it changes. The $97,000 level is a significant milestone within the current market cycle. Q5: Should investors be cautious after such a rapid price increase? All cryptocurrency investments carry risk. Rapid price increases can be followed by volatility. Experts advise thorough research, understanding personal risk tolerance, and considering a long-term, diversified strategy rather than reacting to short-term price movements.

The ominous list of tragedies linked to cryptocurrencies and their trader s ad ded a new devastating entry earlier in the week when news broke out of Hong Kong that a post-graduate student in the UK died while visiting home. It adds to the explosion in violent attacks targeting crypto investors in France, the kidnappings and murder of a crypto investor and his partner in the Middle East, as well as the death of a Ukrainian politician’s son in Vienna. Massive financial loss triggered the tragic incident Before the tragic incident, Chen’s father said his 32-year-old son had admitted to losing about $1.2 million to failed cryptocurrency investments. According to local reports , Chen’s mental health began to decline in 2022 when he lost his job during the COVID-19 pandemic and developed mental disorders. He had been receiving regular medical treatment and taking medication for his condition. In September 2023, he moved to the United Kingdom to continue his studies. While abroad, his father noticed that Chen seemed emotionally unstable, and the family persuaded him to return to Hong Kong to visit a private clinic for a psychiatric re-examination. Chen arrived at the airport on Monday and was picked up by his father, but after returning to their home at Bijiashan Garden on Lung Ping Road, Chen suddenly attempted to harm himself with a fruit knife. When his father succeeded in taking the knife away, Chen then rushed toward the apartment’s terrace and jumped. He fell from the terrace onto a first-floor platform. Emergency services were called to the scene at approximately 5:00 p.m., and Chen was rushed to Caritas Medical Centre. He was later pronounced dead. Police have stated that the case is not suspicious and have labeled it as a “fall from height.” How to handle volatility in the current market On January 2, Bitcoin prices fell below $88,000 following large sales of the token by institutions looking to de-risk at the start of the new year. Before this, the infamous “1011 crash” of October 2025 led to massive liquidations due to overleveraged positions that wiped out over $19 billion in a single day. The market struggled to fill the “liquidity vacuum” into the new year. Bitcoin has since recovered and now sits above $95,000. The October 2025 crash was reportedly triggered by new global trade tariffs and export controls on software. During that time, Cryptopolitan reported that a high-profile 32-year-old Ukrainian crypto CEO was found dead in his car following a $30 million loss. Financial Secretary Paul Chan recently spoke about the need for caution when dealing with the crypto industry. The government launched the “Fintech 2030″ program and new licensing rules for dealers to try and prevent fraud and extreme financial loss.

This sharp increase in value follows the release of US economic data , which indicates positive trends in unemployment and consumer spending. Additionally, potential regulatory changes stemming from a proposed bill are also fueling market momentum and boosting investor confidence across the sector. Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Rally Amid Positive Economic Data After consolidating for days following their last rebounds, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are surging again amid a series of recent US data reports. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers earlier on Tuesday, January 13, covering December 2025. The CPI report revealed that prices rose 0.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis last month, with the year-over-year all items index up 2.7% unadjustment. The shelter index increased 0.4% in December, making it the largest contributor to the overall rise. Meanwhile, food prices rose 0.7% both at home and away, and energy rose 0.3%. This increase in CPI data tends to affect cryptocurrency price movements, as moderate inflation often reduces fears of aggressive rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve (FED) , encouraging investors to allocate funds to alternative stores of value like BTC and higher risk assets like ETH and DOGE. In addition to the CPI data, the US jobs report , released on January 9, showed that 50,000 jobs were added in December 2025. Although this was below the revised 56,000 in November and lower than the initial forecast of 60,000, it was still a significant and positive result for investors. While changes in job reports do not directly affect cryptocurrency price action, they can influence investor sentiment by increasing the likelihood of an interest rate cut . The crypto market has also been bullish ahead of the US Senate Banking Committee’s vote on the CLARITY Act on January 15, 2026. If passed, the bill is expected to provide clearer legal frameworks for digital assets in the US. Subsequently, the regulatory progress will reduce uncertainty and encourage more institutional participation in the crypto market. Overall, the combination of the US CPI release, jobs report, and potential regulatory clarity is what’s driving the market. Traders are responding favorably to these developments, reflecting renewed optimism. How Much BTC, ETH, And DOGE Rose Today Fueled by positive economic data, Bitcoin’s price has increased by over 3% so far today, rising from around $91,000 to over $94,000 at the time of writing. CoinMarketCap data also shows that Ethereum has seen even stronger gains, surging more than 6% to trade above $3,300.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced According to figures from Coingecko, the cryptocurrency was trading at $95,250 at the time of publication, after a 4.50% gain over 24 hours. Reports have disclosed that $269 million in Bitcoin short positions were wiped out in that span, a wave of liquidations that helped add upward momentum. Spot Buying Fuels The Move Several market watchers pointed to spot purchases as the main force. Crypto analyst Will Clemente posted on X that the rally appears to be “led by spot buying.” That matters because buying the actual asset signals direct demand for Bitcoin itself, not just betting via futures or options. Short sellers were hit hard; their positions were closed out as prices jumped, and that squeeze added fuel to the advance. Seems like this rally on Bitcoin is led by spot buying and getting faded by perps as funding goes negative while open interest rises + most spot volume in days.

Based on reports from Polymarket, the prediction markets place about 51% odds on Bitcoin reclaiming $100,000 by Feb. 1 and show a 23% chance of a $105,000 print. Bitcoin last fell below $100,000 on Nov. 13, leaving a resistance level that bulls want to clear. History Gives A Mixed Signal January’s record for Bitcoin has been modest on average, delivering roughly a 4% gain since 2013. February has tended to be stronger, with an average return of 13%. These averages do not guarantee the path ahead, but they give traders a context for how the market has behaved in recent years. Market moves can be quick. They can also stall. Macro Risks And Technical Levels Traders were watching $90,000 as an important support level while Bitcoin cruised past $95k ahead of US inflation data that could shift bets about rate cuts.

The mid-$0.15 range represents a make-or-break zone that will determine whether the current bounce develops into a sustained reversal or remains a temporary relief rally. The meme coin currently trades at $0.1467 after successfully retesting key moving averages on the four-hour chart. Analysts emphasize that clearing $0.157 and establishing a new local high would confirm the end of a prolonged correction phase that has pressured the asset for months. DOGE’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex) Technical Structure Points to $0.157 as Key Resistance Kevin from Kev_Capital_TA outlined the technical requirements for confirmation of a trend reversal. Dogecoin has broken above important four-hour moving averages and successfully retested those levels. This pattern mirrors behavior seen across Bitcoin and multiple altcoins attempting to exit corrective phases. The analyst noted that Dogecoin's corrective period ended precisely where projected. A break above $0.157 would complete the textbook pattern of breakout, retest, and new high. This sequence would provide concrete evidence that selling pressure has exhausted itself. Dogecoin 4-hour chart, Source: X Historical chart data shows Dogecoin repeatedly failed at declining moving average bands during its downtrend. Recent price action differs markedly from these earlier patterns. The cryptocurrency reclaimed key averages and held them on a pullback rather than collapsing immediately. This behavior suggests market structure may be transitioning from resistance-driven selling to support-driven buying. Daily Chart Shows Bullish Engulfing Pattern Cantonese Cat highlighted a significant development on the daily timeframe. The latest candle engulfs the previous five bearish candles, a pattern that typically signals growing buyer momentum. The session high reached $0.1508 before settling at $0.1486, bringing the price into direct contact with established resistance. Dogecoin daily chart, Source: X This engulfing formation demonstrates buyers can absorb available supply and push the price higher despite recent downward pressure. However, the analyst stressed that bulls must establish a new higher high to validate the pattern's implications fully. BigCheds' daily analysis reveals why the mid-$0.15 area carries such significance. Dogecoin remains beneath substantial overhead resistance. The 34-day exponential moving average sits at $0.1828, while the 200-day simple moving average rests at $0.2212. Both indicators represent formidable obstacles beyond the immediate $0.157 level. The Bollinger Band indicator provides additional context for understanding current price action. Dogecoin bounced sharply from the lower band near $0.11, drove through the middle band around $0.135, and tagged the upper band close to $0.16. Price then retraced to the basis line, held support, and now rotates back toward the upper boundary. This technical sequence aligns with the retest pattern analysts consider essential for trend confirmation. The cryptocurrency must hold reclaimed short-term averages and push through $0.157 to complete the formation. A successful break would force price through the daily supply zone while expanding momentum in an upward direction.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market rallied over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins trading higher after encouraging US inflation data. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to an intraday high of $95,801 early on Wednesday before moving to its current level of $95,398, rising nearly 5%. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) crossed $3,300 after rallying over 7% to $3,339. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Ready For Next Price Increase Husky Inu AI (HINU) is set for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase. The price increase will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00025151 to $0.00025428. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Crypto Market Rallies After Inflation Data, BTC At $95,000 The cryptocurrency market rallied over the past 24 hours, extending its uptrend for a third consecutive day after encouraging inflation numbers and progress with the CLARITY Act. Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp jump as it reclaimed $95,000, reaching an intraday high of $95,801 before moving to its current level of $94,886, up almost 4%. The market rally was largely due to encouraging US inflation data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation data revealed that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained at 2.7%, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy products, dropped to 2.6%. The numbers suggest President Trump’s tariffs may not have had a substantial impact on inflation. Analysts believe inflation could fall further as gasoline prices and mortgage rates drop. “Monthly US CPI inflation came in as expected at 0.3% for both core and headline measures. Annual headline inflation is 2.7% (as expected) and core 2.6% (somewhat lower than expected). This data release will not change rate expectations in any significant manner -- that is to say, the Fed is on hold with the question being how long of a pause.” Visit the following links for more information on Husky Inu: Website: Husky Inu Official Website Twitter: Husky Inu Twitter Telegram: Husky Inu Telegram Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This judicial pause represents a significant development in the ongoing legal battle surrounding executive trade authority. Supreme Court Delays Critical Tariffs Decision The Supreme Court did not issue its anticipated ruling during Wednesday’s scheduled opinion session. Legal observers had expected a decision on whether the executive branch possesses constitutional authority to impose comprehensive global tariffs without congressional approval. Consequently, the existing tariff framework remains in legal limbo, affecting billions in international commerce. This delay follows nearly two years of litigation through lower federal courts. Multiple states and international trade groups originally challenged the tariffs in 2023. They argued the measures exceeded presidential authority under existing trade legislation. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice defended the actions as legitimate national security measures. Historical Context of Presidential Trade Powers Presidential authority over international trade has evolved significantly throughout American history. Congress traditionally holds constitutional power “to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” However, twentieth-century legislation granted presidents increasing discretion during emergencies. Key legislative acts include: The Trade Expansion Act of 1962: Allows tariffs for national security The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (1977): Grants emergency economic powers Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act: Specifically authorizes tariffs for national security threats Previous administrations have utilized these authorities with varying scope. For instance, President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002. Similarly, President Barack Obama used tire tariffs in 2009. However, legal scholars note Trump’s universal tariffs represent unprecedented scale and application. Expert Analysis of Judicial Implications Constitutional law experts emphasize this case tests separation of powers boundaries. Professor Elena Rodriguez of Georgetown Law explains, “The Court faces fundamental questions about congressional delegation. Additionally, they must consider whether national security justifications apply universally.” International trade attorney Michael Chen adds, “This delay suggests internal judicial deliberation. The justices likely debate whether to establish new precedent or defer to political branches.” Historical data shows the Court typically upholds presidential trade actions during perceived emergencies. Recent Supreme Court Trade Authority Decisions Case Year Ruling Presidential Power United States v. Curtiss-Wright 1936 Upheld Broad foreign affairs authority Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer 1952 Limited Rejected seizure power Dames & Moore v. Regan 1981 Upheld Emergency economic powers Immediate Economic Impacts and Market Reactions Global markets responded immediately to the judicial uncertainty. Major stock indices showed volatility during Wednesday trading. Specifically, multinational corporations with complex supply chains experienced notable share price fluctuations. Currency markets also reflected heightened uncertainty about future trade relations. The manufacturing sector faces particular challenges. Many companies implemented contingency plans during the original tariff implementation. Now they must maintain these costly adaptations indefinitely. Small and medium enterprises report difficulty securing long-term supplier contracts without legal clarity. Agricultural exporters continue facing retaliatory tariffs from trading partners. These measures originally responded to U.S. tariff actions. Without resolution, American farmers face ongoing market access challenges. Commodity prices reflect these persistent trade barriers. International Diplomatic Consequences Foreign governments monitor the Supreme Court proceedings closely. Major trading partners previously negotiated temporary agreements anticipating judicial resolution. Now diplomatic teams must recalibrate their approaches. International trade organizations also await clarity for dispute settlement mechanisms. The European Union previously filed formal complaints with the World Trade Organization. Those proceedings remain suspended pending domestic legal resolution. Similarly, Asian trading partners delayed retaliatory measures during judicial review. This delay prolongs international trade tensions across multiple regions. Legal Process and Potential Timelines The Supreme Court follows established procedures for major constitutional cases. After oral arguments concluded in October 2024, justices began drafting opinions. The Court typically releases decisions on scheduled opinion days throughout its term. However, complex cases sometimes require additional time for consensus building. Possible scenarios include: Decision next opinion day: The Court could rule within weeks End-of-term ruling: Major cases often conclude in June Per curiam decision: An unsigned opinion resolving technical issues Remand to lower court: Returning the case for additional proceedings Legal analysts note the Court’s current composition influences deliberation dynamics. Recent appointments created new judicial perspectives on executive power questions. Consequently, internal negotiations may require extended discussion periods. Broader Implications for Future Trade Policy This case establishes important precedent regardless of eventual outcome. A ruling supporting broad presidential authority could reshape future trade negotiations. Conversely, limitations might require congressional approval for significant tariff measures. Either outcome will influence how future administrations approach international economic policy. Business leaders emphasize the need for predictable trade frameworks. Global supply chains require stability for long-term investment decisions. Continued uncertainty may accelerate diversification efforts away from traditional trading patterns. Technological sectors particularly need clear rules for cross-border data and intellectual property flows. Conclusion The Supreme Court’s delay in ruling on Trump’s global tariffs creates significant uncertainty for international trade and economic policy. This judicial pause affects markets, diplomatic relations, and business planning worldwide. The eventual decision will establish crucial precedent regarding presidential trade authority. Consequently, stakeholders across sectors await clarification on this fundamental constitutional question. The Supreme Court tariffs ruling will ultimately shape American trade policy for decades. FAQs Q1: Why did the Supreme Court delay its ruling on Trump’s tariffs? The Court follows no public timeline for decisions. Complex constitutional cases often require extended deliberation, particularly when justices seek consensus or face multiple legal questions. Q2: What legal authority does the president have to impose tariffs? Presidents derive tariff authority from congressional statutes, primarily the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. These laws grant discretion during national security emergencies. Q3: How do the delayed tariffs affect ordinary consumers? Consumers may face continued price fluctuations on imported goods. Many retailers built tariff costs into pricing during litigation. Without resolution, these pricing structures likely continue. Q4: What happens to existing tariffs during the Supreme Court delay? Existing tariffs remain in effect during judicial review. The status quo continues until the Court issues a ruling, though Congress could theoretically intervene legislatively. Q5: When might the Supreme Court issue its final ruling? The Court typically completes its term in late June. Major constitutional cases often receive decisions near term’s end, though rulings can occur anytime during scheduled opinion days.

At the same time, accumulation wallets keep adding BTC and price just broke a key daily level near $95,000. Bitcoin Coin Movement Rises as Apparent Demand Slips Bitcoin’s on chain data shows more coins moving while a key demand gauge loses momentum, a mix that has often appeared near turning points in past cycles. A CryptoQuant chart tracking “Apparent Demand Growth” shows the short term, 30 day measure drifting into negative territory in recent readings, even as Bitcoin’s price line stays elevated near recent highs. Meanwhile, the longer, one year apparent demand series has rolled over from its 2024 2025 upswing, which signals slower net absorption compared with earlier phases of the rally. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Growth Over Time. Source: CryptoQuant CryptoZeno, an on chain analyst, linked the shift to a visible pickup in coin activity across the network. When older unspent outputs start moving in size, it can reflect repositioning by longer term holders rather than quick trading flows. That matters because older cohorts typically sit still during tight supply periods, so a sudden rise in movement can change the market’s supply picture. If more previously dormant BTC becomes mobile, effective supply can increase through exchange deposits or over the counter redistribution. In that setup, Bitcoin can react more sharply to marginal selling, because the market no longer relies on scarcity alone to support price. Past cycles also showed that demand weakness alongside steady price action often preceded wider daily ranges, as traders adjusted to the gap between price resilience and softer net buying pressure. The signal does not set a direction by itself. Still, the combination of higher coin mobility and cooling apparent demand suggests a market that may depend more on confidence driven flows than on expanding organic demand, which can make conditions more fragile if the pattern persists. Accumulating Bitcoin Addresses Grow Holdings Meanwhile, Bitcoin on chain data shows accumulation addresses expanding holdings over the past three years, even as price moved through repeated swings. CryptoQuant data shows accumulation addresses hold about 2.4 million BTC, valued near $218 billion at current prices. During the 2022 bear market lows, the same cohort held about 540,000 BTC, worth roughly $8 billion at the time. Accumulating Address Bitcoin Balance. Source: CryptoQuant CryptoQuant defines accumulation addresses as wallets with no historical outflows, balances of at least 100 BTC, and long transaction histories. Because these wallets do not send coins out, balance growth tends to reflect longer term positioning rather than active trading. The chart shows a gradual climb in holdings through 2023, followed by faster growth during 2024 and 2025, despite pullbacks in price. In dollar terms, the increase equals about 2,700% over three years, while the BTC count also rose sharply. As more supply moves into wallets that historically remain inactive, available liquidity can tighten, which can amplify moves when selling pressure increases. Bitcoin Breakout Puts Focus on $100,000 Level Bitcoin pushed above a key horizontal level on the daily BTCUSDT chart, as an analyst said the move fits a classic breakout setup that could keep pressure on the $100,000 area. A TradingView chart shared by Ted Pillows shows Bitcoin breaking above a prior ceiling near the mid $90,000s after weeks of choppy trading. The move followed a series of higher lows that leaned against a rising support trendline, while price repeatedly tested the same resistance band. Bitcoin BTCUSDT Daily Chart. Source: TedPillows (X) The chart places the latest price near $95,033 on Binance . That leaves the breakout level as the near term line that traders often watch for confirmation. If price holds above that former resistance, the setup shifts from range trading to trend continuation attempts, with the next major psychological level sitting at $100,000. Ted Pillows wrote that Bitcoin needs to “hold the breakout trendline,” adding that $100,000 “could happen this month.” The chart also includes a schematic showing a bullish reversal pattern forming at support inside a broader downtrend structure, which frames the current rally as a rebound that still needs follow through to prove strength.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-14 15:43:52

This substantial investment, led by Castle Island Ventures and announced on April 15, 2025, underscores the growing urgency within the crypto industry to address a potential existential threat posed by advancing quantum computing technology. The funding round, which included participation from Coinbase Ventures and Quantonation, values the specialized cryptography firm at $120 million, signaling strong investor confidence in its mission to safeguard the foundational security of digital assets. Project Eleven’s Mission for Bitcoin Quantum Resistance Project Eleven operates with a singular, critical objective: to protect Bitcoin’s core cryptographic infrastructure from the future capabilities of quantum computers. Currently, Bitcoin’s security relies heavily on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), specifically the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). This system generates the public and private key pairs that secure wallets and authorize transactions. However, experts widely acknowledge that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could one day break ECDSA, potentially exposing funds and undermining the entire network’s integrity. Consequently, Project Eleven is pioneering the development of post-quantum cryptographic standards and tools designed to integrate seamlessly with Bitcoin’s existing protocol. The company’s work is not merely theoretical. It represents a proactive engineering challenge to transition a $1 trillion-plus network before a threat materializes. The team, comprised of cryptographers and blockchain protocol engineers, focuses on creating backward-compatible solutions. Their goal is to ensure a smooth migration path for users and miners, avoiding a chaotic hard fork. This approach prioritizes network stability and consensus, which are paramount for Bitcoin’s value proposition as a decentralized, secure store of value. The Rising Threat of Quantum Computing to Cryptography Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways fundamentally different from classical computers. While promising for fields like medicine and materials science, this power poses a unique risk to current public-key cryptography. Algorithms like Shor’s algorithm, when run on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, could efficiently solve the mathematical problems that underpin ECC and RSA encryption. The timeline for such a computer is debated, but the consensus is clear: preparation must begin years, if not decades, in advance. Why Bitcoin is a Primary Target Bitcoin’s transparent ledger makes it uniquely vulnerable in a specific scenario. A user’s public key is only revealed when they spend funds from a wallet. Until then, it remains hashed, offering some protection. However, once a public key is broadcast in a transaction, a future quantum computer could theoretically derive the private key. This vulnerability, often called a “harvest now, decrypt later” attack, makes preemptive defense non-negotiable. Other systems, like traditional banking encryption, also face quantum threats, but Bitcoin’s immutable and public nature places it squarely in the crosshairs, demanding specialized solutions. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been leading a global standardization process for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Several algorithms, like CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, have been selected for standardization. Project Eleven’s task is to adapt and implement these or similar quantum-resistant algorithms into Bitcoin’s consensus rules, a complex task requiring extreme care for security and performance. Analyzing the $20M Series A Funding Round The successful $20 million raise highlights venture capital’s strategic focus on foundational blockchain infrastructure. Led by Castle Island Ventures, a firm dedicated to public blockchain networks and monetary systems, the round’s participants offer deep insight into its perceived importance. Castle Island Ventures: Brings a thesis-driven focus on Bitcoin and monetary network infrastructure. Coinbase Ventures: Represents the interest of a major exchange in ensuring the long-term viability of its primary trading asset. Quantonation: A deep-tech fund specializing in quantum technologies, providing crucial cross-disciplinary expertise. The $120 million post-money valuation reflects the high stakes and specialized knowledge required. This capital will primarily fuel expanded research and development, talent acquisition in cryptography, and efforts to build industry-wide collaboration. The funding enables Project Eleven to move from research papers to testable code and network upgrade proposals, a resource-intensive process. Comparison: Classical vs. Quantum Threat to Bitcoin ECDSA Factor Classical Computer Attack Quantum Computer Attack (Future) Algorithm Used General Number Field Sieve Shor’s Algorithm Time to Break 256-bit ECC Practically infeasible (billions of years) Potentially minutes/hours Primary Risk Private key theft via phishing/malware Mathematical breaking of public-key cryptography Defense Strategy Key custody best practices Transition to quantum-resistant algorithms The Path Forward for Quantum-Resistant Bitcoin Implementing quantum resistance in Bitcoin is a multi-stage journey that balances urgency with deliberate caution. Project Eleven’s roadmap likely involves several key phases, each requiring broad community engagement. First, extensive cryptographic review and algorithm selection must occur, building upon the work of NIST and other academic bodies. Next, the team will develop a clear implementation specification and create open-source software libraries for testing. Following that, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) would be drafted and submitted for peer review by the wider developer community. This stage is critical for achieving the decentralized consensus necessary for any protocol change. Finally, upon acceptance, a carefully coordinated activation would be scheduled, giving wallet providers, miners, and exchanges ample time to upgrade their systems. This entire process emphasizes that Project Eleven’s role is one of research, proposal, and tool-building, not unilateral enforcement. Broader Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem Project Eleven’s work has ripple effects beyond Bitcoin. Successfully navigating this transition would provide a proven blueprint for thousands of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects that use similar ECC-based security. Moreover, it positions the cryptocurrency industry at the forefront of adopting post-quantum standards, potentially influencing broader cybersecurity practices. The project also fosters collaboration between the often-separate worlds of quantum physics, cryptography, and decentralized software development, driving interdisciplinary innovation. Conclusion The $20 million investment in Project Eleven marks a pivotal, forward-looking chapter in Bitcoin’s evolution. It moves the conversation about Bitcoin quantum resistance from academic discussion to funded, practical engineering. While the quantum computing threat may seem distant, the lengthy and consensus-driven process required to upgrade a global monetary network necessitates action today. By developing the tools and standards for a secure transition, Project Eleven is working to ensure that Bitcoin’s foundational promise of sovereignty and security endures for the digital age, solidifying its resilience against the computational paradigms of tomorrow. FAQs Q1: Is Bitcoin currently vulnerable to quantum computers? No, Bitcoin is not currently vulnerable because a sufficiently powerful, fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of breaking ECDSA does not yet exist. However, the network must transition to quantum-resistant cryptography before such a machine is developed to prevent future attacks. Q2: What is Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and why is it at risk? ECC is a form of public-key cryptography that uses the mathematics of elliptic curves to generate secure key pairs. It is at risk because quantum algorithms like Shor’s algorithm can solve the underlying mathematical problem (the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem) exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. Q3: How will a quantum-resistant upgrade affect Bitcoin users? The goal for projects like Project Eleven is to make the transition as seamless as possible. Ideally, users may simply need to update their wallet software to a new version that supports the new quantum-resistant signature scheme. Their seed phrases and funds should remain secure and accessible throughout the process. Q4: Are other blockchains working on quantum resistance? Yes, several blockchain projects are researching post-quantum cryptography. Some newer blockchains have even designed quantum resistance into their initial protocol. However, Bitcoin, due to its size, age, and conservative upgrade philosophy, faces the most complex and high-stakes migration challenge. Q5: What happens if Bitcoin doesn’t upgrade before a quantum computer is built? If a quantum computer capable of breaking ECDSA emerges before Bitcoin transitions, it could compromise the security of any coins where the public key has been revealed on the blockchain (i.e., in spent transactions). This could lead to theft and a catastrophic loss of trust. Proactive upgrades are essential to mitigate this risk entirely.

Although recent trends show a dip, its current low RSI and other factors might hint at a possible rebound. Conclusion XDC proves its strength by maintaining its support. Other ISO-narrative tokens also show resilience. They continue to hold their ground despite market changes. This stability suggests a strong foundation and future potential.

They’re joining as cornerstone investors, which means they’re buying in before the shares go public and have to keep their stock for a fixed period, according to a report from Bloomberg. The listing is expected to raise about $900 million, with room for more if banks use the overallotment option. Other investors locking in early allocations include Aberdeen, Mirae Asset Securities, and UBS. Montage’s stock already trades in Shanghai and had seen a 73% rally in 2025. Orders for the Hong Kong sale will reportedly open as soon as Friday, with trading possible later this month. Montage pulled in a 1.4 billion yuan profit in 2024, which comes out to around $196 million. Analysts think that number could hit 2.3 billion yuan in 2025, and go up again to 3.3 billion yuan in 2026. China is on a mission to domesticate its chip equipment manufacturing industry The Hong Kong deal lands during a record start to the year for new listings. IPOs in the city raised $4.3 billion in the first two weeks of 2026, driven mainly by Chinese companies tied to AI. Large investors have returned as the market recovered through 2025, bringing back cornerstone deals similar to this one. By the end of 2025, China’s locally-made chip equipment made up 35% of what was used across the industry. That’s up from 25% in 2024, and it went past the 30% goal that President Xi Jinping had set earlier that year. Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment developed a 5-nanometer etching machine now in validation on TSMC advanced lines, according to SCMP. Naura oxidation and diffusion furnaces accounted for more than 60% of 28-nanometer lines at SMIC, with its order backlog running into the first quarter of 2027. Piotech doubled its share of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition tools at YMTC, lifting its share to 30%. Meanwhile, Cryptopolitan earlier reported that China has made it mandatory that all local chip projects must source at least 50% of tools locally. The country is expected to remain the world’s largest semiconductor equipment market through 2027, supported by heavy capital spending. Jinping has since offered government support via the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, which committed 2 billion yuan to core tool development, and from industry subsidies covering up to 15% of equipment purchases.

The deleveraging phase, triggered by massive liquidations, has pushed open interest below its 180-day moving average while trading activity continues surging with spot volume approaching $60 billion. On-chain analysis from Darkorst characterized 2025 as a year of unprecedented speculation, with Binance futures trading volumes alone exceeding $25 trillion. Deleveraging signal as BTC OI drops by 31% “Historically, they have often marked significant bottoms, effectively resetting the market and creating a stronger base for a potential bullish recovery.” – By @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/JkYoKfg4Ql — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 14, 2026 Bitcoin’s open interest exploded to an all-time high above $15 billion on October 6, nearly tripling the $5.7 billion peak witnessed during the November 2021 bull run when Bitcoin reached its previous all-time high. Market Reset Creates Foundation for Bullish Recovery The October 10 market crash sparked a severe deleveraging event that purged excessive leverage from the system. “This decline, amplified by massive liquidations, triggered a deleveraging phase, with OI falling below its 180-day moving average,” Darkorst explained. Source: CryptoQuant These deleveraging periods serve a vital function in market structure. “Historically, they have often marked significant bottoms, effectively resetting the market and creating a stronger base for a potential bullish recovery,” he noted. Bitcoin has responded with a 3% rally over the past 24 hours, holding firmly above $95,000 while demonstrating renewed strength across both futures and spot markets. The price action suggests the worst of the correction may be over. Futures Positioning Signals First Major Shift Since October Peak Macro analyst Axel identified a critical turning point in futures market positioning. A composite index tracking open interest dynamics, funding rates, and long-short ratios across major exchanges shows the 30-day simple moving average climbing from 2.1 to 3.5, marking the first breakout above 3 since October 6, when Bitcoin rallied toward $125,000. The daily positioning index surged to 24, entering bullish territory amid aggressive long accumulation. Source: AdlerAM Open interest grew 1.89% with positive taker delta and funding at 0.0045 as price jumped 4.58% to $95,358, pushing total open interest to $12.18 billion. Market sentiment reached a local peak of 93.15% yesterday evening at $95,061 before cooling to 70%, still well above the neutral 50% threshold and the 30-day average of 62.9%. This contrasts sharply with mid-December’s extreme bearish readings of 10-15% during the correction to $85,000, when positioning turned overwhelmingly negative. Resistance Cluster at $105k Holds Key to ATH Attempt Axel emphasized that sustained momentum requires the simple moving average to hold above 2 for one week, which would confirm the positioning shift and trigger a potential breakout above the psychological $100,000 barrier. Crypto analyst Trader Mayne assessed the probability of a bullish recovery following Bitcoin’s breakout above two-month resistance at $94,000. “If I had to handicap it, I’d say 70% chance of a lower high, 30% chance at new ATHs,” he stated. However, he outlined a clear path forward if the bulls maintain control. $BTC Attempting to close through the range highs here. I absolutely fumbled shorting the top and started longing a little too early on the way down. That said, I got back in sync with things at the $80k low and am glad I stuck to my guns and didn't puke spot into the lows.… pic.twitter.com/CLu4NMLlDD — Mayne (@Tradermayne) January 13, 2026 Holding comfortably above $94,000 would bring the next resistance cluster around $105,000 into focus, with a successful breach potentially launching Bitcoin back toward the $120,000 highs established earlier in the cycle. Low Volatility Environment Points Toward Range Expansion The Bitcoin Realized Volatility chart shows that the current market calm is approaching levels that historically precede significant price breakouts. Current volatility readings sit near the lower distribution zones for this market cycle, comparable to compression periods that preceded major moves throughout Bitcoin’s trading history. These compressed regimes rarely persist over extended timeframes. As supply-demand imbalances accumulate beneath the surface, markets characteristically break from consolidation into range expansion phases, aligning with analyst projections for a $105,000 breakout that could catalyze a strong start to the 2026 rally.

This incident marks one of the most substantial technical hurdles for the relatively young Layer-1 blockchain since its mainnet launch. Network participants immediately reported transaction processing issues across multiple platforms. Consequently, decentralized applications built on Sui faced immediate performance degradation. The team has mobilized engineers to diagnose and resolve the underlying technical problems. Sui Network Delays: Technical Breakdown and Immediate Impacts Sui’s development team issued an official statement detailing the network’s current state. They confirmed that transaction finality times have increased substantially across all network validators. Furthermore, the team identified specific bottlenecks in the consensus mechanism that processes parallel transactions. This technical issue directly affects popular decentralized applications including Slush, a prominent DeFi platform, and SuiScan, the network’s primary block explorer. Users attempting transactions through these platforms encounter extended waiting periods. Some transactions may temporarily fail to process entirely during peak disruption periods. The network’s unique parallel transaction processing architecture, normally a strength, appears to be experiencing coordination challenges between validators. This situation creates a cascading effect throughout the ecosystem. Developers report that smart contract executions are queuing abnormally. Wallet providers have implemented temporary transaction limits to manage network load. Meanwhile, exchange deposits and withdrawals involving SUI tokens face extended confirmation times. The team emphasizes that user funds remain secure despite these performance issues. Comparative Analysis: Blockchain Network Stability Network disruptions represent a common challenge across blockchain ecosystems. For instance, Ethereum experienced similar growing pains during its early development phases. Solana has faced multiple network halts requiring validator coordination for restarts. Avalanche and Polygon have also navigated congestion events that slowed transaction processing. These historical precedents provide context for Sui’s current situation. Each blockchain’s architecture presents unique vulnerabilities during high-stress periods. Sui’s Move programming language and object-centric model introduce novel approaches to scalability. However, these innovations also create unfamiliar failure modes that engineers must now address. Recent Blockchain Network Disruptions (2023-2025) Blockchain Incident Date Duration Primary Cause Solana February 2024 5 hours Validator consensus failure Avalanche November 2024 2 hours Network congestion Polygon January 2025 3 hours Bridge protocol issue Sui Current Ongoing Transaction processing delays Decentralized Application Performance During Network Stress Decentralized applications built on Sui face immediate operational challenges during this network event. Slush, a leading decentralized exchange on Sui, has temporarily disabled certain complex trading functions. The platform recommends users avoid time-sensitive transactions until network stability improves. Similarly, SuiScan displays incomplete transaction data and delayed block updates. These issues prevent users from accurately tracking their transaction status. Other affected dApps include lending protocols, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. Developers across the ecosystem are implementing contingency measures. Transaction Queuing: Most dApps now queue transactions rather than submitting them immediately Fee Adjustments: Some applications have dynamically increased gas fees to prioritize critical transactions Feature Limitations: Complex smart contract interactions face temporary restrictions User Notifications: Applications display prominent warnings about extended processing times The Sui Foundation has established a dedicated communication channel for dApp developers. This channel provides real-time updates about network restoration progress. Developers can adjust their applications based on these technical bulletins. Many teams have implemented fallback mechanisms to preserve user experience. However, certain blockchain-native functions remain unavoidably dependent on network consensus. The ecosystem’s response demonstrates both the fragility and resilience of decentralized systems under stress. Technical Response and Resolution Timeline Sui’s engineering team has deployed multiple diagnostic tools to identify the disruption’s root cause. They monitor validator performance metrics across all network participants. Additionally, the team analyzes transaction flow patterns before and during the incident. Preliminary findings suggest a synchronization issue between parallel transaction processors. This technical problem creates bottlenecks that propagate through the network’s layered architecture. The team is testing potential fixes in a controlled environment before mainnet deployment. They prioritize solution stability over speed to prevent further complications. The resolution process follows established blockchain incident protocols. First, engineers must reproduce the issue in a testnet environment. Next, they develop and validate potential solutions. Then, validators coordinate to implement necessary upgrades. Finally, network monitoring confirms restoration of normal operations. This meticulous approach minimizes risks but extends resolution time. The team provides hourly updates through official social media channels and developer forums. They emphasize transparency throughout the troubleshooting process. Network Architecture and Vulnerability Points Sui’s technical design incorporates several innovative features that normally enhance performance. The network processes transactions in parallel rather than sequentially. This approach typically increases throughput significantly. However, during synchronization failures, parallel processing can create complex dependency issues. Validators must maintain precise coordination to ensure consensus. Any disruption in this coordination manifests as network-wide delays. The current incident likely involves validator communication protocols. These protocols ensure all network participants agree on transaction ordering and finality. Blockchain security experts note that such incidents provide valuable stress-test data. Networks often emerge stronger after addressing identified vulnerabilities. Previous blockchain disruptions have led to significant protocol improvements. For example, Ethereum’s network upgrades frequently address issues revealed during congestion events. Similarly, Sui’s development team will likely implement architectural refinements based on this incident’s lessons. The blockchain community generally views such challenges as inevitable growth phases for maturing networks. Market and Ecosystem Implications The SUI token has experienced moderate price volatility following the network disruption announcement. Trading volumes increased across major cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the token’s price movement remains within expected ranges for such events. Market analysts note that blockchain networks often recover value after resolving technical issues. The incident’s duration will significantly influence market reactions. Brief disruptions typically have minimal long-term impact. Extended outages can affect investor confidence and developer adoption decisions. The Sui ecosystem includes over 200 decentralized applications across multiple sectors. These projects now face operational uncertainty until network stability returns. Venture capital firms monitoring Sui’s development will assess the team’s crisis response capabilities. Successful resolution could demonstrate engineering competence. Prolonged issues might raise concerns about network maturity. The broader blockchain industry observes these events closely. Each network disruption provides comparative data about different architectural approaches to decentralization and scalability. Conclusion The Sui network delays represent a significant technical challenge for the emerging blockchain platform. These disruptions affect transaction processing and decentralized application functionality across the ecosystem. The development team’s response will demonstrate Sui’s operational resilience and engineering capabilities. Network stability incidents provide crucial stress-test data for all blockchain platforms. Consequently, the Sui community awaits resolution updates while developers implement temporary workarounds. This event underscores the complex technical realities underlying decentralized networks despite their innovative potential. FAQs Q1: What caused the Sui network delays? The development team identified synchronization issues between parallel transaction processors within Sui’s consensus mechanism, creating bottlenecks that slowed network-wide transaction processing. Q2: Are user funds safe during this disruption? Yes, the Sui team confirms that user funds remain secure in wallets and smart contracts, with only transaction processing speed affected, not fund security or blockchain integrity. Q3: Which applications are most affected by the network issues? Decentralized applications requiring frequent blockchain interactions face the greatest impact, particularly Slush (DeFi), SuiScan (block explorer), NFT marketplaces, and gaming dApps with real-time transactions. Q4: How long will the network delays likely continue? The Sui team has not provided a specific resolution timeline, as they prioritize thorough diagnosis and stable fixes over rapid but potentially incomplete solutions, with updates provided hourly. Q5: How does this incident compare to other blockchain network problems? Similar to early challenges faced by Ethereum, Solana, and other networks, such disruptions represent common growth phases for maturing blockchain platforms, often leading to protocol improvements.

The move builds on a strong 30-day uptrend that has lifted the token by roughly 50%, though rising volatility suggests the rally may face near-term tests. This piece is brought by Outset PR , a crypto PR firm that uses data, trends, and timing to transform breakthrough moments into brand power and growth. Meme Coins Lead as Risk Appetite Improves PEPE’s advance comes amid a broader rotation into higher-beta assets. Bitcoin climbed to $95,000, posting a 3% daily gain, while Ethereum rose 6%, helping lift sentiment across the altcoin market. Meme coins were among the strongest performers, with PEPE up around 14% on the day, DOGE gaining 7%, and SHIB advancing 6%. The renewed interest in meme assets reflects improving risk appetite as traders seek higher returns during periods of market expansion. Historically, such rotations tend to favor smaller-cap tokens once Bitcoin establishes short-term directional strength. PEPE’s Key Technical Levels Source: coinmarketcap From a technical perspective, PEPE has cleared several important thresholds. The token broke above its 30-day simple moving average at $0.00000497 and reclaimed the 7-day exponential moving average near $0.00000611, confirming short-term trend strength. Momentum indicators have also turned constructive. The MACD histogram flipped positive at +0.000000021777, signaling improving bullish momentum after weeks of consolidation. However, PEPE now approaches a critical resistance zone at $0.00000779, corresponding to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This area is likely to act as a near-term inflection point, particularly given the token’s recent pace of gains. Why Visibility Matters During Meme Coin Rallies Rapid price movements in meme coins often go hand in hand with bursts of media attention. During such phases, visibility can amplify momentum, while poorly timed exposure risks being lost in a crowded news cycle. According to Outset PR, a crypto-focused public relations agency, this is where data-driven distribution becomes critical. Rather than pursuing broad coverage for its own sake, the agency analyzes where attention actually concentrates during market expansions. Outset PR developed Syndication Map , a proprietary analytics tool designed to identify which publications generate the strongest traffic and downstream syndication. This allows campaigns to focus on outlets that deliver measurable reach instead of relying on guesswork. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains that the system enables fast, cost-efficient decision-making: “If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers.” By narrowing outreach to high-impact media, Outset PR aims to reduce wasted spend on low-visibility placements. The agency’s Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , focuses on maintaining consistent, trust-based relationships with editors—an approach that supports repeat coverage and reliable syndication. As a result, campaigns often extend far beyond their initial placements. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, multiplying exposure without additional cost. This effect is illustrated by the StealthEX case , where targeted tier-1 pitching resulted in 92 republications across platforms including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating total outreach exceeding 3 billion. Upside Potential Meets Overbought Risks A decisive close above $0.00000779 would open the door toward the $0.00000825 region, where the 200-day simple moving average sits. A reclaim of this level would strengthen the medium-term recovery narrative and signal broader trend stabilization. At the same time, momentum indicators suggest caution. The RSI-14 stands at 64.91, approaching overbought territory. Without sustained volume expansion, the risk of short-term pullbacks or consolidation increases, especially if broader market momentum slows. PEPE Price Outlook PEPE’s 50% monthly rebound highlights how quickly sentiment can shift in the meme coin segment once liquidity returns to the market. While technical signals currently favor continuation, confirmation above key resistance levels will be critical to determine whether the move evolves into a sustained recovery or remains a volatility-driven bounce. For now, PEPE remains closely tied to broader market conditions, with Bitcoin’s trend and overall risk appetite likely to dictate whether further gains materialize in the near term.

However, one important indicator suggests that the bears might regain control in the short term. The Risks of an Incoming Correction Just recently, ICP pumped above $4, the highest level since the beginning of December 2025. Its market capitalization surged well beyond $2 billion, making it the 57th-largest cryptocurrency. ICP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the sharp rise, ICP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hints that a potential pullback may be approaching. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes to give traders a clearer view of whether a reversal is on the horizon. It varies from 0 to 100, and ratios above 70 signal that ICP is overbought and on the verge of a decline. On the other hand, readings below 30 are interpreted as buying opportunities and could mean that the asset is oversold. On January 13, ICP’s RSI climbed to a two-month peak of almost 80, whereas it currently hovers around 73. ICP RSI, Source: CryptoWaves Not Pushing the Brakes? Contrary to the RSI alert, crypto X is filled with analysts who believe ICP has no intention to slow down anytime soon. Earlier this month, X user Bitcoinsensus spotted a “massive bull flag” forming on the weekly chart, envisioning a potential breakout to as high as $14. For their part, the analyst using the moniker KNIGHT predicted a rally to $10 in the first quarter of the year. X user CAPT. PARA8OLIC TOBLERONE also shared an interesting forecast. They think ICP could head south in the following months and drop below $1.30. However, after that, the asset may launch a major bull run, skyrocketing beyond $65. Meanwhile, the recent exchange netflows reinforce the bullish scenario. Data from CoinGlass shows that outflows have surpassed inflows over the past several weeks, suggesting that investors have shifted to self-custody, thereby reducing immediate selling pressure. On the other hand, rising inflows mean that market participants have transferred some of their holdings into centralized platforms, which is typically seen as a pre-sale step.

Approval would mark a major shift for a token that has so far relied almost entirely on retail-driven momentum, opening the door to institutional-grade demand. GDOG has already demonstrated that meme coin appetite exists, kicking off the year with its strongest inflows after a prolonged period of stagnation. Dogecoin spot ETF weekly netflows ($).

The RSI is curling higher after cooling into more neutral territory from overbought conditions, forming a higher low that reinforces the strength of the uptrend. The MACD supports this view, narrowly avoiding a death cross below the signal line as buyers retain control of the prevailing trend. The key breakout level sits at the former demand zone around $0.0000115. If flipped back into support, a breakout move could extend 115% to $0.000024 . And as the bull market matures, a push into new price discovery could be in the cards, targeting all-time highs around $0.000042 for a 270% gain . Though the $1 milestone remains a distant dream, these recent developments are positive for BONK and the meme coin sector. Maxi Doge: Capital Rotation is Strongest Here When capital rotates back into meme coins, momentum almost always circles back to one thing: Doge. The pattern is hard to ignore. Dogecoin set the tone, Shiba Inu ran with it in 2021, followed by Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, and Neiro. Every bull cycle eventually crowns a new Doge-inspired frontrunner. This time around, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is tapping into those early Dogecoin vibes, creating a community built around sharing early alpha, trading ideas, and competitive engagement. Participation is at its core. Weekly Maxi Ripped and Maxi Pump competitions reward top performers with leaderboard recognition, incentives, and bragging rights. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.5 million, while early backers are earning up to 70% APY through staking rewards. For those who missed the Doge wave before, Maxi Doge could be the next chance to catch a meme coin breakout before it takes off.

When a token in front of its primary utility window, not after it, is discussed, large upside scenarios are usually given. One new altcoin that sells at less than $1 has already done so, and the analysts already start to simulate what a structured position could look like by the end of 2027 in case the milestones of launch and increase of usage are achieved. Vision of Presale Structure and Protocol The specified token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is creating a lending and borrowing protocol that enables individuals to contribute assets to earn interest, and others to obtain loans that are secured by collateral and risk regulations. It is concerned not only with speculative trading but with real usage too. The token offering was launched in the first quarter of 2025 with the price of $0.01. The social stock offering has passed through several stages and currently is selling at Phase 7 at the price of $0.04. The offering has received more than $19.7 million in contributions and the majority of the holders had occupied positions of more than 18,800. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 45.5% (approximately, 1.82 billion tokens) is assigned to presale allocation and more than 825 million tokens have been bought. The official listing price stands at $0.06 and this puts early buyers in a position of getting instant valuation as soon as liquidity becomes open. Utility Activation The V1 protocol launch is the primary event of Mutuum Finance. Its official channels affirmed that V1 will go to public testnet prior to mainnet. V1 presents the complete lending process: deposits, loans, yield, collateral, interest models and liquidation logic. This is where the valuation starts showing usage data. There are two interior engines that affect behaviors of tokens as well. The former is the first engine, which is a position called mtTokens that carries a yield upon payment of interest by borrowers. This forms a holding incentive other than speculation. The second model is the buy and distribute model. Part of the protocol revenue is spent to purchase MUTM on the market and repurchase those tokens to stakers. This adds buy pressure which is usage based, as opposed to hype based. According to these mechanics, analysts make a first estimation around the initial launch date. MUTM may be able to achieve $0.10 to $0.12 in the initial adoption cycle in moderate situations. Layer 2 Integration The stablecoins make credit markets more efficient. Mutuum Finance is to include stablecoins to settle loans. This eliminates volatility in the process of repaying its loans and provides predictability in borrowing behavior. The project will also extend to Layer 2 networks in order to minimise fees and maximise throughput when the user activity increases. The Layer 2 and stablecoins can support more users too. At lower charges, a large number of users will be able to lend or borrow without spending on transaction fees. In stable assets, it is easier to predict repayment schedules by the borrowers. The two upgrades have been closely associated with increased adoption stages in the lending markets. Multi-year adoption scenarios analysts have a greater potential target within the $0.25 and $0.32 range by the end of the year 2027. Security Stack and Participation Signals The lending systems demand high security levels in that all the collateral, liquidation and interest logic are automated. Mutuum Finance also underwent a smart contract audit by Halborn Security , opened a $50,000 bug bounty, and had a 90 out of 100 Token Scan rating by CertiK. These layers can be used to reduce downside risks prior to the user funds passing through the system. The inclusion of participation cues also promotes the story telling that the focus is shifting to MUTM. The project will have a 24-hour digital leaderboard, which will reward participants who are on the move over a day with $500 in MUTM. Wider onboarding has been made possible by card payment access. The discounted period after launch cost is still open with the progress of Phase 7 so this is why investors are keen on the positioning in the run up to V1. So far, analysts believe the tradeoff between early entry pricing, supply structure, usage incentives, and security preparation gives MUTM a clearer road to expansion of valuation than most of other new crypto tokens heading ahead to 2026.

57162065,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261542,1768406411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"USD/JPY Forecast: Societe Generale Questions Bullish Momentum, Suggests Strategic Short Position",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/societe-generale-usd-jpy-short-forecast/,"BitcoinWorld USD/JPY Forecast: Societe Generale Questions Bullish Momentum, Suggests Strategic Short Position Global currency markets face renewed scrutiny as Societe Generale, the prominent French multinational financial services company, raises significant questions about the sustainability of the USD/JPY exchange rate’s recent trajectory. In a detailed analysis circulated to institutional clients this week, the bank’s strategists have highlighted mounting pressures that could signal a pivotal reversal for the currency pair, which has long been a bellwether for global risk sentiment and monetary policy divergence. Consequently, market participants are now closely examining the fundamental drivers behind this potential shift. Societe Generale’s USD/JPY Analysis Questions Current Valuations Societe Generale’s foreign exchange research team, led by seasoned strategists with decades of combined market experience, has published a comprehensive report challenging the consensus view on the dollar-yen pair. The analysis meticulously examines three core pillars: relative monetary policy paths, economic growth differentials, and technical market positioning. Historically, the USD/JPY pair has been highly sensitive to interest rate differentials between the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. However, Societe Generale’s report suggests this dynamic may be approaching an inflection point as policy cycles mature. Furthermore, the bank’s analysts point to recent economic data from Japan showing unexpected resilience in wage growth and core inflation metrics. These indicators potentially provide the Bank of Japan with greater flexibility to adjust its long-standing ultra-accommodative stance. Simultaneously, signs of moderating inflation in the United States could allow the Federal Reserve to pause its tightening cycle sooner than previously anticipated. This convergence of policy outlooks forms the bedrock of Societe Generale’s questioning of the pair’s upward momentum. Monetary Policy Divergence Narrows in 2025 The primary engine behind the USD/JPY’s multi-year trend has been the stark divergence in monetary policy. For context, the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive hiking cycle beginning in 2022 to combat inflation, while the Bank of Japan maintained negative short-term rates and yield curve control. This divergence pushed the pair to multi-decade highs above 160 in 2024. Nevertheless, the landscape is demonstrably shifting. Market-implied probabilities now suggest a high likelihood of the Fed’s next move being a cut, possibly as early as the second quarter of 2025. Conversely, the Bank of Japan has already taken incremental steps toward policy normalization. It fully abandoned negative interest rates in 2024 and has since ended its rigid yield curve control framework. Analysts widely expect further, albeit gradual, rate hikes as the bank seeks to anchor inflation sustainably around its 2% target. This narrowing policy gap directly undermines a key support for the U.S. dollar against the yen. The table below illustrates the changing interest rate expectations: Central Bank Policy Stance (2024) Expected 2025 Move Key Driver U.S. Federal Reserve Restrictive Potential Easing Moderating Inflation Bank of Japan Acutely Accommodative Continued Normalization Sustained Wage-Price Cycle Economic Fundamentals and External Balances Beyond interest rates, Societe Generale’s analysis delves into underlying economic fundamentals. Japan’s current account, a broad measure of trade and investment flows, has remained structurally surplus. This surplus creates a natural underlying demand for yen as export earnings are repatriated. In contrast, the United States runs a persistent current account deficit, which typically exerts depreciation pressure on its currency over the long term. While these flows can be overshadowed by capital movements in the short term, they provide a crucial backdrop for valuation assessments. Additionally, relative growth forecasts are becoming less dollar-supportive. The International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook projects a narrowing growth differential between the two economies in 2025. As global growth momentum potentially slows, the yen’s traditional status as a safe-haven currency could also resurface, attracting flows during periods of market stress. This characteristic often provides support during risk-off episodes, a factor Societe Generale emphasizes in its risk assessment. Technical and Positioning Risks Support a Short Thesis From a market structure perspective, Societe Generale identifies several technical and positioning factors that bolster its cautious stance. Market sentiment data reveals that speculative positioning in the futures market remains heavily net-long U.S. dollars against the yen. This crowded trade presents a vulnerability; any catalyst that triggers a reversal could lead to a rapid unwinding of these positions, amplifying downward momentum in the USD/JPY pair. Technical analysis charts also show the pair testing key long-term resistance levels, where previous rallies have stalled. The bank’s report outlines specific risk factors that could accelerate a move lower: Accelerated BOJ Action: A more decisive shift from the Bank of Japan than currently priced in. U.S. Economic Softening: Data indicating a sharper-than-expected slowdown in U.S. growth or employment. Geopolitical Stress: Events that trigger a flight to traditional safe-haven assets like the yen. Intervention Rhetoric: Renewed and credible verbal or actual intervention from Japanese monetary authorities to support their currency. Historical Context and Strategic Implications Examining historical precedents adds depth to the analysis. Periods following the peak of Fed tightening cycles have frequently seen the U.S. dollar enter broad periods of weakness. The yen, in particular, has historically exhibited strong mean-reversion tendencies after prolonged trends. For institutional investors and corporate treasurers, Societe Generale’s analysis suggests a strategic review of hedging programs. Companies with exposure to yen-denominated liabilities may find current levels attractive for locking in rates, while asset managers might consider rebalancing currency exposures within international portfolios. It is crucial to note that the bank’s view represents a strategic forecast, not a short-term trading call. The path for USD/JPY will inevitably encounter volatility, influenced by each new data release and central bank communication. However, the core argument rests on a fundamental reassessment of the drivers that have powered the dollar’s strength against the yen for years. This reassessment is now gaining traction among other major financial institutions, though consensus remains divided. Conclusion Societe Generale’s detailed questioning of the USD/JPY outlook provides a compelling, evidence-based counterpoint to prevailing market optimism on the dollar. By synthesizing monetary policy trajectories, economic fundamentals, and market technicals, the analysis builds a case for a strategic short position on the currency pair. While the timing and magnitude of any reversal remain uncertain, the convergence of factors highlighted by the bank suggests the risk-reward profile for holding long USD/JPY positions has deteriorated significantly. Consequently, investors and analysts are advised to closely monitor the evolving dynamics between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, as these will be the ultimate arbiters of the USD/JPY path in 2025. FAQs Q1: What is Societe Generale’s main argument for a potential USD/JPY decline? Societe Generale’s core argument centers on the narrowing monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The Fed is expected to shift toward easing in 2025, while the BOJ continues its path of policy normalization, reducing a key historical support for the U.S. dollar against the yen. Q2: How does Japan’s current account surplus affect the yen? A current account surplus means Japan earns more from its exports and foreign investments than it spends on imports and foreign obligations. This creates a natural, structural demand for the yen as those foreign earnings are converted back, providing a fundamental layer of support for the currency’s value. Q3: What does a “crowded trade” mean in the context of USD/JPY? A “crowded trade” refers to a market situation where a large majority of speculative investors hold the same position—in this case, being long the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. This creates vulnerability because if the trend reverses, the simultaneous rush to exit these positions can dramatically accelerate the price move downward. Q4: Could Japanese government intervention impact the USD/JPY forecast? Yes, intervention by Japanese monetary authorities to buy yen and sell dollars is a recognized risk factor. While intervention rarely reverses long-term trends driven by fundamentals, it can cause significant short-term volatility and temporarily slow a decline in the yen’s value, complicating trading strategies. Q5: Is Societe Generale’s view a consensus among major banks? No, it is not yet a consensus view. The USD/JPY outlook remains a topic of active debate among financial institutions. Societe Generale’s analysis presents a clearly bearish tactical forecast, while other banks maintain neutral or still-bullish stances based on different interpretations of economic data and policy paths.

The move is due to the fact that traders are still attracted by blockchain-based infrastructures, which reduce intermediaries, lower costs, and operate around the clock, despite the fluctuating prices of tokens in the market. Source: Delphi Digital Perp DEXs allow users to trade perpetual futures contracts with leverage and no expiry date, a product that has historically been dominated by centralized exchanges and traditional derivatives desks. Perp DEXs Gain Ground as DeFi Bundles Trading, Credit, and Custody Delphi Digital’s 2026 outlook noted that this segment of decentralized finance is now positioned to take further market share from legacy financial products, driven by structural efficiencies that are difficult for traditional systems to replicate. The research firm argued that legacy finance remains fragmented and expensive to operate, while decentralized infrastructure can bundle multiple financial functions into a single on-chain stack. In a post shared on X, Delphi Digital pointed to Hyperliquid’s move toward native lending as a key signal of where the sector is heading. https://t.co/m1EcOi3uNS — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) January 13, 2026 Delphi noted that this opens the door for perp DEXs to operate as integrated financial platforms, handling trading, custody, clearing, and credit within a single on-chain system. Competing platforms such as Aster, Lighter, and Paradex are now racing to develop similar capabilities. This convergence reflects a broader trend in crypto, where trading venues are expanding beyond execution into lending, custody, and capital management. The data shows that this transition is already well underway, as Perp DEXs have steadily taken revenue and volume share from centralized exchanges over the past three years. CoinGecko data shows that perp DEXs accounted for just 2.1% of centralized exchange perpetuals volume in January 2023. By November 2025, that figure had risen to a record 11.7% , meaning nearly one in every nine dollars traded in perpetual futures was executed on a decentralized platform. Source: CoinGecko For the full year, cumulative perp DEX volume tripled to $12.09 trillion, up from $4.1 trillion at the start of 2025. About $7.9 trillion of that activity was generated during 2025 itself, highlighting how rapidly adoption accelerated over the past year. The sector now holds more than $20 billion in total value locked, with monthly volumes frequently exceeding $1 trillion and open interest hovering around $20 billion. Crypto derivatives trading accelerated sharply in 2025 as traders increasingly turned to onchain perpetual futures. #Crypto #Derivatives https://t.co/NRfJCBERpc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 DEX Spot Trading Grows Sharply as the Gap With CEXs Narrows Spot trading has followed a similar trajectory, though at a slower pace. Decentralized exchanges accounted for just 6.0% of spot trading volume relative to centralized exchanges in January 2021. By November 2025, that ratio had climbed to 21.2%, with a peak of 37.4% reached in June 2025 during a surge in memecoin speculation and activity on PancakeSwap. Source: CoinGecko At the same time, the report and surrounding data highlight how far the sector still has to go. The 12 trillion annual transaction volume that has been managed by perp DEXs is still low in comparison with the 846 trillion notional value of outstanding over-the-counter derivatives that could be reported by the Bank for International Settlement in mid-2025. Traditional banks also retain advantages in regulatory clarity, fiat integration, and services such as uncollateralized lending and consumer protections. Industry observers note that for perp DEXs to seriously challenge banks, they would need to continue expanding beyond derivatives into lending, payments, and tokenized real-world assets, while also addressing security, user experience, and compliance. Many platforms are already experimenting with on-chain order books, zero-fee models, incentive programs, and high-throughput blockchains to improve performance and accessibility.

Ripple’s successful registration signals regulatory trust and places the company in a small group of compliant digital asset firms allowed to operate within the UK’s financial system. Why the UK Matters for Global Finance The UK remains one of the world’s most influential financial hubs, hosting major banks, payment processors, and fintech innovators. FCA recognition enables these institutions to engage with Ripple’s technology without regulatory ambiguity. This clarity removes a major barrier to adoption and allows regulated entities to explore blockchain-based solutions with confidence. Rather than relying on speculative demand, Ripple’s approach aligns with how financial infrastructure evolves. Institutions adopt technology when regulators approve it, not when narratives trend on social media. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Ledger Moves Closer to Institutional Standards As Ripple strengthens its regulatory standing, the XRP Ledger continues to gain relevance as an enterprise-ready infrastructure . Institutions prioritize networks that offer efficiency, transparency, and regulatory compatibility. XRP Ledger’s design supports these requirements, particularly for cross-border payments, settlement, and tokenization use cases. X Finance Bull’s perspective frames this development as a foundational shift. Regulatory access does not create instant headlines, but it enables long-term integration that compounds over time. Licensing Over Hype Ripple’s UK approval did not arrive through marketing or speculation. It emerged through compliance, audits, and sustained engagement with regulators. These milestones often escape public attention, yet they determine which platforms institutions can legally adopt. If regulated adoption defines the next chapter of digital finance, Ripple’s position in the UK places it firmly ahead of many competitors. As institutions increasingly demand compliant blockchain solutions, XRP’s role as a standardized settlement asset may continue to strengthen through infrastructure, not hype.

The substantial investment, led by Accel Partners with participation from SV Angel, Mantis VC, and Alt Capital, signals growing venture capital confidence in AI-native security solutions as organizations worldwide grapple with threats that evolve at machine speed. AI Security Startup depthfirst Raises $40 Million in Series A Round Founded just months ago in October 2024, depthfirst has rapidly emerged as a notable player in the competitive cybersecurity landscape. The company’s rapid funding achievement reflects the urgent market demand for solutions that can match the pace of AI-driven threats. According to cybersecurity analysts, the traditional security paradigm has become increasingly inadequate against attacks that leverage artificial intelligence for automation, adaptation, and scale. Depthfirst’s platform, called General Security Intelligence, represents a fundamentally different approach to enterprise security. Rather than relying on signature-based detection or manual analysis, the AI-native suite continuously scans and analyzes codebases and workflows for subtle indicators of compromise. Furthermore, the platform provides comprehensive protection against credential exposures while monitoring threats targeting open-source and third-party components—a critical vulnerability vector in modern software development. The Escalating AI Cybersecurity Arms Race The cybersecurity landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years. Cybercriminals now routinely employ artificial intelligence to automate malicious processes that previously required significant human effort. These AI-powered attacks range from sophisticated malware generation and hyper-targeted social engineering campaigns to automated vulnerability scanning and exploitation. Consequently, defensive technologies must evolve at a comparable pace to maintain effectiveness. Last November provided a stark warning when Anthropic reported thwarting what it described as the first “AI orchestrated cyber espionage campaign.” This incident demonstrated that AI-driven attacks have moved from theoretical concerns to operational realities. Security experts now warn that defensive systems relying on traditional methods will inevitably fall behind as offensive capabilities continue to advance through artificial intelligence. Leadership with Deep AI and Security Expertise Depthfirst’s leadership team brings substantial credentials from both artificial intelligence and cybersecurity domains. Co-founder and CEO Qasim Mithani previously held positions at Databricks and Amazon, where he witnessed firsthand how automation transforms both defensive and offensive capabilities. “We’ve entered an era where software is written faster than it can be secured,” Mithani stated in the funding announcement. “AI has already changed how attackers work. Defense has to evolve just as fundamentally.” The company’s other co-founders strengthen its technical foundation. Daniele Perito served as director of security and risk engineering at Square (now part of Block), while CTO Andrea Michi brings engineering experience from Google DeepMind. This combination of practical security operations and cutting-edge AI research positions depthfirst uniquely to address the complex challenges at the intersection of these fields. Strategic Allocation of $40 Million in New Capital Depthfirst plans to deploy its newly acquired capital across several strategic areas. The company will significantly expand its applied research and engineering teams to enhance its AI detection capabilities. Additionally, investments in product development and sales will accelerate market adoption of the General Security Intelligence platform. This balanced approach between technological advancement and commercial growth reflects the company’s ambition to establish industry leadership. The funding round follows depthfirst’s development of partnerships with prominent companies including AngelList, Lovable, and Moveworks. These early adopters validate the platform’s practical value in real-world environments. The table below outlines the key investment participants and their roles: Investor Role Notable Focus Areas Accel Partners Lead Investor Enterprise Software, Cybersecurity SV Angel Participant Early-Stage Technology Mantis VC Participant Technology Innovation Alt Capital Participant Emerging Technologies The Broader Implications for Enterprise Security Depthfirst’s funding and technological approach reflect several important trends in the cybersecurity industry. First, security solutions must increasingly operate at the same speed and scale as the threats they combat. Second, the integration of artificial intelligence into defensive systems is transitioning from competitive advantage to operational necessity. Third, venture capital continues to flow toward startups addressing fundamental shifts in the threat landscape. Organizations face mounting challenges as their attack surfaces expand through cloud adoption, remote work, and software supply chain complexity. Traditional security tools often struggle with these dynamic environments. Consequently, AI-native platforms like depthfirst’s General Security Intelligence offer potential solutions through continuous, automated analysis that adapts to evolving threats without constant manual intervention. Comparative Analysis of AI Security Approaches Several distinct approaches have emerged in the AI security sector. Some companies focus primarily on threat detection, while others emphasize automated response. Depthfirst distinguishes itself through its comprehensive platform that addresses multiple vulnerability vectors simultaneously. Key differentiators include: Codebase Analysis: Automated scanning for vulnerabilities during development Credential Protection: Monitoring for exposed authentication materials Supply Chain Security: Continuous assessment of third-party components Workflow Integration: Security embedded throughout development processes This holistic approach recognizes that modern enterprises require integrated security solutions rather than point products that address isolated concerns. Conclusion Depthfirst’s $40 million Series A funding represents a significant milestone in the evolution of AI-powered cybersecurity defense. As artificial intelligence transforms both offensive and defensive capabilities in the digital security domain, startups with strong technical foundations and clear market vision are attracting substantial investment. The company’s General Security Intelligence platform addresses critical vulnerabilities in modern software development and deployment environments. With experienced leadership and strategic capital allocation, depthfirst is positioned to play an important role in helping organizations defend against increasingly sophisticated AI-powered cyber threats that continue to evolve at accelerating pace.

The decision to delay, without announcing when the next batch of rulings will arrive, has intensified speculation across legal, political, and financial circles as markets brace for what could become a landmark definition of presidential power. The dispute centers on Trump’s expansive use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law designed for national security crises, to justify a broad array of tariffs on global trading partners. Lower courts have previously ruled that the current president exceeded his authority in invoking emergency powers to impose tariffs that functioned more like long-term trade policy. During Nov. 5 oral arguments, justices from both the conservative and liberal wings signaled deep skepticism about the administration’s legal rationale. Several questioned whether IEEPA authorizes such a sweeping reconfiguration of U.S. trade relationships without explicit congressional approval, with some references to the “Major Questions Doctrine.” The Trump administration is appealing lower-court rulings that found the tariffs unlawful, and the Supreme Court’s eventual decision is expected to serve as a defining test of the limits of presidential emergency authority. But on Wednesday, the Court decided to remain silent. Missing Trump Tariff Ruling Has Global Stakes The absence of a decision has only added to mounting uncertainty. A ruling against the tariffs would have immediate and far-reaching implications. Analysts warn the federal government could be forced to unwind months of tariff collections, a process Trump has previously described as a “complete mess,” citing concerns about the logistics of refunding hundreds of billions of dollars to importers. Trade economists note that such refunds would be complex but technically feasible, with the Treasury expected to have the funds necessary to process them. Still, the administrative burden alone could create short-term disruptions across supply chains, pricing models, and corporate balance sheets. Beyond the balance sheets, the ruling may reshape long-standing assumptions about executive power. If the Court finds that Trump exceeded his authority under IEEPA, it would send a strong signal that presidents cannot unilaterally overhaul trade policy under the guise of emergency action. Market Reactions: Crypto Rallies In financial markets, the Court’s non-decision triggered a counterintuitive reaction: relief. With no ruling issued and no immediate risk of forced tariff unwinding, investors pushed risk assets higher. Bitcoin rallied sharply following the Court’s release schedule update, soaring to above $97,200 as traders interpreted the delay as a sign that the status quo will hold a little longer. The rest of the crypto market rallied off the development as well, with all of the other top 10 largest digital assets by market cap jumping in the hour after the development. That’s after fear of an adverse ruling had weighed on sentiment in recent weeks. Several macro traders warned that a surprise invalidation of Trump’s tariffs could trigger a period of volatility as markets digested the economic implications, from potential corporate tax adjustments to trade-linked inflation forecasts. Prediction markets, which have been tracking the tariff litigation closely, had priced in a meaningful probability that the Court would strike down Trump’s authority. The absence of a ruling temporarily eased those expectations, though not the underlying uncertainty.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-14 16:17:20

Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Don’t Celebrate Too Early: This Level Still Must Fall XMR recently surged past $700, marking its highest price to date and placing it among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The rally reflects a broader shift in market behavior, where demand for financial privacy is rising alongside stricter regulatory frameworks across major economies. Currently, XMR is trading near $715, up more than 55% over the past week. Trading activity has picked up sharply, with both spot and futures markets showing elevated volume as traders position around the breakout. XMR's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XMRUSD on Tradingview Regulatory Pressure Fuels Privacy Demand The latest move comes as regulators in Europe and other regions prepare new rules targeting anonymous crypto transactions. The European Union is expected to ban privacy coins and anonymous accounts by 2027, alongside tighter Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. Instead of discouraging interest, these measures appear to be driving users toward assets with built-in privacy features. Monero, which utilizes stealth addresses and ring signatures to conceal transaction details, has become a primary choice for users seeking financial confidentiality. Market data indicate that the privacy coin sector has performed well since the broader crypto market downturn in October. While some rivals, such as Zcash, experienced sharp volatility linked to internal governance issues, XMR has absorbed much of the rotation in capital from traders seeking exposure to privacy assets. Leverage And Technical Signals Raise Short-Term Risks Alongside strong spot demand, derivatives activity has increased rapidly. Futures volume has shown repeated “overheating” patterns, suggesting that leverage is chasing price rather than building from long-term accumulation zones. In past Monero cycles, similar conditions often led to sharp swings once momentum slowed. Technically, Monero remains in an uptrend, holding above former resistance in the $500–$520 range, which has now flipped into support. The price continues to form higher highs and higher lows, confirming the broader bullish structure. However, momentum indicators are stretched. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed into the mid-80s, a level that historically precedes either sideways consolidation or short-term pullbacks. Bollinger Bands are also widening, with price pressing against the upper band, a sign of elevated volatility. Key Monero (XMR) Levels to Watch Going Forward The $715–$717 area remains a major psychological and technical barrier. A sustained break above that zone could open the door toward the $730–$740 range, based on Fibonacci extension levels. On the downside, traders are watching the $650–$620 zone as a potential support area if leverage unwinds. Deeper corrections could test trend support if liquidations accelerate, though the broader structure would remain intact as long as higher lows are preserved.

Conducted over a two-week period under highly volatile market conditions, the event highlighted a clear contrast between discretionary human trading and AI-driven strategies. While individual human trader ProMint secured the top ranking with positive net profits, the human trading team as a whole recorded an overall ROI of -32.22%, reflecting significant performance dispersion across participants. In contrast, AI agents delivered materially more stable results at the aggregate level, limiting total losses to approximately USD 13,000 and achieving an overall ROI of -4.48% across all participating AI strategies. Trading Insight: Stability vs Asymmetric Opportunity Competition data highlighted a clear contrast in risk behavior between human traders and AI agents. During the event, 43% of human participants were liquidated, while all 30 AI agents completed the competition without a single liquidation, achieving a 100% survival rate. According to Aster, the results underscore the structural strengths of AI-driven strategies in stable, risk-controlled market environments, where systematic execution and disciplined risk management help mitigate large drawdowns. At the same time, the findings also suggest that in market conditions driven by human emotion, rapid market shifts, and nonlinear price dynamics, discretionary human traders with strong judgment and narrative awareness can still capture asymmetric opportunities and outperform purely systematic approaches. Future Competitiveness Lies in Collaboration, Not Replacement Competition data showed that human traders exhibited significantly wider performance dispersion, with individual gains exceeding USD 19,000 and losses in other cases approaching USD 18,000, resulting in higher overall return volatility. Aster emphasized that the “Human vs AI” showdown was designed not to determine replacement, but to clarify evolving roles. AI is becoming a foundational tool for execution and risk management, while human traders increasingly contribute judgment, context awareness, and narrative interpretation in complex market conditions. As a result, Aster believes future competitiveness will be driven by collaboration between humans and AI, rather than direct confrontation. Aster: Using the Market as a Real-World Testing Ground Aster stated that the initial goal of hosting this live trading showdown was to observe how different trading participants behave on the same decentralized infrastructure under real market conditions, rather than relying on backtesting or simulated data. As the decentralized derivatives market continues to grow, Aster will continue to explore infrastructure designs that better serve professional trading needs, enabling strategies, risk management, and execution to achieve higher certainty on-chain. “This was not a competition with a predetermined conclusion, but a starting point,” said Leonard, CEO of Aster, in the post-event summary. “As markets become more complex, traders need more than individual tools. They need integrated systems that can evolve alongside the market.” The Next Trading Showdown Begins on Jan 22 Aster has confirmed that the next live trading showdown will officially kick off on January 22 and take place on the Aster Chain Testnet. This upcoming event will open participation to a newly expanded group of traders, including professional participants from around the world, enabling live competitive trading within Aster’s testnet environment.

Aster emphasized that the “Human vs AI” showdown was designed not to determine replacement, but to clarify evolving roles. AI is becoming a foundational tool for execution and risk management, while human traders increasingly contribute judgment, context awareness, and narrative interpretation in complex market conditions. As a result, Aster believes future competitiveness will be driven by collaboration between humans and AI, rather than direct confrontation. Aster: Using the Market as a Real-World Testing Ground Aster stated that the initial goal of hosting this live trading showdown was to observe how different trading participants behave on the same decentralized infrastructure under real market conditions, rather than relying on backtesting or simulated data. As the decentralized derivatives market continues to grow, Aster will continue to explore infrastructure designs that better serve professional trading needs, enabling strategies, risk management, and execution to achieve higher certainty on-chain. “This was not a competition with a predetermined conclusion, but a starting point,” said Leonard, CEO of Aster, in the post-event summary. “As markets become more complex, traders need more than individual tools. They need integrated systems that can evolve alongside the market.” The Next Trading Showdown Begins on Jan 22 Aster has confirmed that the next live trading showdown will officially kick off on January 22 and take place on the Aster Chain Testnet. This upcoming event will open participation to a newly expanded group of traders, including professional participants from around the world, enabling live competitive trading within Aster’s testnet environment.

Spot prices firmed during the latest hours after recovering from a brief pullback, with buyers pushing gold back above the mid-$4,400 range per ounce and keeping momentum intact into the new session. Over the past few days, gold has followed a clear upward path despite short pauses. Prices dipped earlier in the week, then rebounded as demand returned, lifting the metal through prior resistance levels. The chart shows higher lows and higher highs forming into mid-January, indicating that gold’s short-term trend remains positive as it builds on gains made since late 2025. CoinCodex Forecast Points to Gold Testing the $5,000 Area CoinCodex projections show gold extending its broader uptrend into early 2026, with the forecast line moving toward the $5,000 per ounce zone. The model reflects continued strength following the steady climb that developed through the second half of 2025, rather than signaling a sharp reversal or breakdown. Gold Price Forecast. Source: CoinCodex On the chart, the projected path rises from the mid-$4,000 range and gradually approaches the $4,900 to $5,000 area. The movement appears uneven, with short pauses and pullbacks built into the forecast. However, those dips do not break the broader upward structure, which remains intact throughout the projection window. Overall, CoinCodex presents gold trading at elevated levels while gradually pushing higher. The forecast suggests consolidation near recent highs before further upside attempts, placing the $5,000 level as a key zone the model expects gold to test as the trend continues into 2026. Elliott Wave Structure Signals Further Gold Upside An Elliott Wave analysis shared by ElliottWaveStrategy outlines a continued upward structure for gold, based on the four hour XAUUSD chart. The count shows gold advancing within a rising channel, with price action respecting higher lows and pushing through successive resistance zones as the pattern develops. Gold XAU/USD, Elliott Wave Chart. Source: ElliottWaveStrategy The chart labels suggest gold is progressing through a late stage impulsive wave, following a corrective phase that held above key support levels. Short term pullbacks appear contained within the broader trend, while the structure points to continuation rather than exhaustion. The marked invalidation level near the mid $4,500 area defines where the current wave count would fail, keeping the focus on trend persistence as long as price holds above that zone. Looking ahead, the projected path on the chart points toward higher targets into the upper $4,700 area, aligned with the upper channel extension and final wave labeling. The Elliott Wave setup implies that recent consolidation represents a pause within the move, not a reversal, as gold continues to trade within a well defined upward framework.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-14 17:04:02

With thousands of matches every week and massive global liquidity, even small differences in odds can significantly affect long-term results. For serious bettors, finding the best football odds is often more important than chasing large bonuses or promotions. As cryptocurrency continues to reshape online wagering, football crypto betting has gained popularity among players looking for better pricing, faster transactions, and fewer restrictions. Crypto sportsbooks operate under different cost structures than traditional bookmakers, which often allows them to offer more competitive odds on both pre-match and live football markets. Understanding where these advantages come from — and how to identify them — is key when choosing a platform for online crypto football betting. Why Football Odds Matter More Than Bonuses Bonuses may look attractive at first glance, but football betting is ultimately a game of margins. Over time, odds quality has a far greater impact on profitability than temporary promotional offers. A difference of just a few percentage points in bookmaker margin can: reduce long-term returns limit value on accumulators make certain betting strategies unviable Many sportsbooks compensate for aggressive bonuses by increasing margins on football markets. This means bettors often pay for promotions indirectly through worse odds, especially on popular leagues and matches. For experienced players, focusing on consistently strong football odds is a more sustainable approach than relying on short-term incentives. How Crypto Sportsbooks Set Football Odds Crypto sportsbooks approach odds setting differently from traditional bookmakers. Because they rely less on banking infrastructure and third-party payment processors, their operating costs are often lower. These savings can be reflected directly in football odds. When betting on football using cryptocurrency, odds are influenced by: lower transaction and processing overhead faster settlement and balance updates reduced exposure to chargebacks and payment disputes more flexible risk management models In many cryptocurrency football betting sportsbooks, crypto is not just a payment method but part of the core betting infrastructure. This allows platforms to price markets more efficiently, particularly on high-volume football leagues and live betting markets. As a result, football crypto betting platforms are often able to maintain tighter margins compared to traditional online sportsbooks — especially during peak match hours. What Makes Football Odds Better on Crypto Platforms Crypto sportsbooks often deliver better football odds because their cost structure and execution model are fundamentally different from traditional bookmakers. With fewer intermediaries and faster settlement, platforms can keep margins tighter—especially on high-liquidity leagues. Key factors that improve odds on crypto platforms: Lower overhead: fewer banking and processing fees allow slimmer margins. Faster settlement: instant balance updates reduce operational risk. Flexible risk models: quicker adjustments during pre-match and live markets. Global liquidity: broader participation can stabilize pricing on popular fixtures. For bettors focused on value, these advantages matter most on mainstream football markets where small margin differences compound over time. Best Places for Online Crypto Football Betting Finding the best football odds isn’t about one feature—it’s about how consistently a platform prices markets across leagues, matchdays, and live action. Below are platforms that stand out for online crypto football betting, each with a distinct profile. Dexsport — Optimized for Transparent Football Odds Dexsport approaches football betting with a decentralized, crypto-native model that prioritizes execution and pricing efficiency. By reducing custodial friction and manual intervention, the platform can maintain competitive odds on both pre-match and live football markets. What stands out for football crypto betting: Lower margin pressure through decentralized execution Stable odds during high-traffic matches Real-time cash-out for active position management No-KYC access for unrestricted participation For bettors who value transparent pricing and real-time control, Dexsport fits naturally into a value-focused football betting strategy. Voltage Bet — Broad Coverage with Crypto and Fiat Options Voltage Bet offers wide coverage of major leagues and international competitions, supporting both cryptocurrency and traditional payments. Odds are generally competitive on popular fixtures, with dynamic pricing across pre-match and live markets. Best suited for: Bettors who want flexibility between crypto and fiat Mainstream football markets with standard bet types A combined sportsbook and casino environment While withdrawals can take longer than on crypto-native platforms, odds remain solid on high-profile matches. BetNow — Simple Crypto Football Betting for Casual Users BetNow focuses on accessibility and ease of use. Football markets cover major leagues with standard odds, making it suitable for recreational bettors who want straightforward cryptocurrency football betting without advanced tools. Best for: Beginner-friendly football betting U.S.-focused leagues and international competitions Lower minimums and simple navigation Live depth is more limited than on larger platforms, but pre-match odds remain competitive for popular games. Boomerang.bet — Developing Markets with Competitive Pricing Boomerang.bet is a newer platform that combines sportsbook and casino offerings with crypto support. Football markets include pre-match and live betting with competitive odds, particularly on major leagues and events. Best for: Players looking for a modern interface and rewards program Mainstream football leagues and accumulators Crypto users comfortable with Curacao-licensed platforms As the platform matures, odds depth and live market coverage continue to expand. Pre-Match vs Live Football Odds on Crypto Sportsbooks Both pre-match and live football betting can offer strong value on crypto sportsbooks, but they reward different approaches. Pre-match odds are typically sharper and more stable. They work best for bettors who: analyze fixtures in advance focus on team news, lineups, and market movement build singles or accumulators with clear pricing expectations Because crypto sportsbooks often run with lower overhead, pre-match football odds can be especially competitive on high-liquidity leagues and popular matches. Live football odds, on the other hand, favor speed and execution. They are ideal for: reacting to momentum shifts capitalizing on in-game events (goals, cards, injuries) managing risk through cash-out during the match On crypto-native platforms, live odds tend to update faster and with fewer interruptions, which can make a noticeable difference during volatile moments. How to Compare Football Odds Across Crypto Sportsbooks Comparing football odds goes beyond checking a single match line. To find consistent value, bettors should look at patterns across markets and matchdays. Practical comparison tips: check odds on the same fixture across multiple platforms compare margins on popular leagues, not niche matches review how often live markets freeze during play test cash-out behavior during active matches Platforms that consistently keep markets open and confirm bets quickly tend to offer better real-world value—even if headline odds look similar at first glance. Conclusion Finding the best football odds is about consistency, not one-off promotions. Crypto sportsbooks often outperform traditional bookmakers by maintaining tighter margins, faster execution, and fewer structural limitations. For bettors focused on football crypto betting, platforms built around cryptocurrency offer a clear advantage—especially when odds quality and long-term value matter more than bonuses. Among the available options, crypto-native models like Dexsport stand out for transparent pricing and real-time market access, while platforms such as Voltage Bet, BetNow, and Boomerang.bet provide alternative approaches depending on betting style and preferences. As online crypto football betting continues to grow, understanding how odds are set—and where real value appears—remains the key to making smarter wagers.",More News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2026-01-14 17:04:23

Instead of placing bets before a match starts, players can react instantly to what’s happening on the field — goals, timeouts, penalties, momentum shifts — and lock in live betting odds as the game unfolds. The rise of cryptocurrency has pushed live betting even further. Crypto live betting platforms allow users to place in-play bets without relying on traditional banking systems, offering faster transactions, fewer restrictions, and more flexible access to global sports markets. For many bettors, especially those focused on speed and efficiency, an online crypto betting site is now the preferred option for live sports betting. However, not all platforms are equally suited for fast in-play betting. In live environments, execution speed, odds updates, and latency matter far more than bonuses or branding. Choosing the right platform can be the difference between catching value — or missing it entirely. Why Speed Matters in Crypto Live Betting Speed is the single most important factor in live crypto betting. In fast-moving markets, even a small delay can lead to rejected bets, worse odds, or missed opportunities entirely. Traditional sportsbooks often struggle with live betting latency due to centralized risk management, manual bet approval, and payment bottlenecks. Crypto-native platforms reduce these issues by handling funds and bet execution more efficiently. When balances update instantly and bets are processed without third-party intermediaries, users gain a clear advantage in live betting environments. This is especially critical when betting on high-tempo sports like live football matches, NBA quarters, or NFL drives. Live betting odds are constantly adjusting based on real-time data. Platforms with slower infrastructure may freeze markets, delay odds updates, or void bets placed milliseconds too late. Faster crypto live betting platforms, on the other hand, are designed to keep up with in-play action — offering smoother execution and more reliable odds during critical moments of a match. Best Platforms for Crypto Live Betting 2026 Live sports betting with cryptocurrency puts extreme pressure on platforms. Odds change fast, markets pause without warning, and even a short delay can kill a profitable in-play position. That’s why not every online crypto betting sites is suitable for live betting — especially for football, NBA, or NFL markets. Below are platforms that consistently handle fast in-play crypto bets, stable live betting odds, and real-time execution. They differ in structure, custody model, and target audience — which makes the comparison especially important. 1. Dexsport — Best Overall Platform for Live Crypto Betting Dexsport is built specifically for speed, transparency, and real-time betting control. As a decentralized sportsbook and casino, it removes many of the structural bottlenecks that slow down live betting on traditional platforms. Instead of relying on custodial balances and centralized risk controls, Dexsport processes bets directly through blockchain-backed infrastructure. This makes it particularly effective for fast in-play markets, where timing matters more than bonuses or interface design. Why Dexsport works exceptionally well for live betting: Instant bet execution without custody delays Stable live betting odds even during volatile match moments Cash Out available on all in-play bets, allowing early exits or profit locking No KYC — users stay fully anonymous Multi-chain support with 40+ cryptocurrencies across 20 networks Dexsport covers a broad range of sports for live betting, including football, NBA, NFL, NHL, and horse racing, while also maintaining strong esports markets. The platform is especially appealing to experienced bettors who actively manage positions during matches rather than placing static pre-match wagers. Transparency is another standout feature. Every wager is recorded on-chain, and the public betting desk allows users to observe live bets in real time. Combined with smart contract audits by CertiK and Pessimistic, this creates a level of trust rarely seen in online sports betting. For players focused on speed, control, and anonymity, Dexsport sets the benchmark for crypto live betting in 2026. 2. Stake — Strong Live Betting Interface with Broad Market Coverage Stake is one of the most recognizable names in crypto sports betting and offers a polished live betting environment across both sports and esports. Its in-play interface includes real-time stats, live streaming, and flexible cash-out options. The platform supports over 17 cryptocurrencies and processes deposits quickly, making it suitable for active live betting sessions. Odds are generally competitive, particularly for mainstream sports like football, NBA, and NFL. That said, Stake operates as a centralized platform. While users can bet immediately after depositing, withdrawals require full identity verification, which may be a drawback for bettors who prioritize privacy. Stake fits players who value: Rich live betting visuals and stats A wide selection of sports and niche markets VIP rewards and long-term loyalty programs It is less ideal for those looking for no-KYC crypto live betting. 3. Vave — High-Performance Hybrid for Live Sports Betting Vave positions itself as a fast, modern hybrid sportsbook with deep live markets and strong mobile usability. Live betting is smooth, with hundreds of markets available for top football leagues and solid coverage of basketball and international sports. The platform supports major cryptocurrencies and integrates conversion services, making deposits straightforward. Live odds update quickly, and cash-out is available on many in-play markets. However, Vave leans closer to a traditional sportsbook model. KYC is triggered at withdrawal thresholds, and wagering requirements on bonuses are relatively high, which may limit flexibility for short-term live bettors. Vave is best suited for users who want: Deep live football and basketball markets A clean, mobile-first betting experience A balance between casino and sportsbook play 4. Thunderpick — Esports-Focused Live Crypto Betting Thunderpick is heavily optimized for esports, making it a strong choice for live betting on CS2, Dota 2, Valorant, and League of Legends. In-play esports markets are well-supported, with live streams and frequent market updates. Crypto-only payments keep transactions relatively fast, and the platform avoids fiat-related delays. For esports bettors, Thunderpick often feels more responsive than generalist sportsbooks. Traditional sports are available, but live markets outside esports can feel limited, with fewer stats and slower updates compared to dedicated sports platforms. Thunderpick works best for: Live esports betting with cryptocurrency Players focused on competitive gaming rather than mainstream sports 5. Cloudbet — High-Limit Live Betting for Serious Players Cloudbet is one of the oldest crypto sportsbooks and remains popular among high-volume bettors. Live betting markets cover major sports such as NFL, basketball, tennis, and MMA, alongside full esports support. The platform supports over 30 cryptocurrencies and offers automated withdrawals, often completed within hours. Live odds are stable, and betting limits are higher than on many newer platforms. Cloudbet focuses less on flashy promotions and more on long-term rewards, which may not appeal to casual users but works well for disciplined live bettors. 6. BetOnline — Traditional Sportsbook with Crypto Support BetOnline operates as a classic offshore sportsbook that accepts cryptocurrency alongside fiat. Live betting markets are broad, especially for U.S. sports like NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL. Crypto deposits are fast, but withdrawals and account verification follow a more traditional model. Live betting features are solid, though less flexible than crypto-native platforms, and cash-out is not available on all markets. BetOnline suits bettors who: Prefer a familiar sportsbook structure Want access to U.S. leagues with crypto payments 7. Voltage Bet — Newer Platform with Integrated Live Betting Voltage Bet combines sportsbook and casino products under one account, offering live betting across major sports and some esports markets. The interface is straightforward and accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers. While the platform supports cryptocurrency, withdrawals are slower compared to crypto-native competitors, and the operator has a shorter track record. Live markets are functional but not as deep as on established platforms. Voltage Bet may appeal to users looking for a simple, all-in-one betting environment, rather than advanced live betting strategies. Live Betting Odds: How Crypto Platforms Compare Live betting odds behave very differently from pre-match markets. During a live match, odds are recalculated constantly — after goals, fouls, timeouts, injuries, or momentum shifts. In this environment, the platform’s internal architecture matters just as much as its margins. Many online sports betting platforms advertise “competitive odds,” but in live betting the real question is not how attractive the odds look — it’s whether you can actually lock them in. What affects live betting odds the most? In crypto live betting, odds quality is shaped by several technical and structural factors: Latency — how quickly odds update after an in-game event Market freezes — how often betting is suspended during action Execution logic — whether bets are accepted instantly or manually reviewed Custody model — centralized balance control vs decentralized settlement When these elements are poorly optimized, bettors face rejected bets, sudden odds shifts, or forced market closures — especially in fast sports like football, NBA, or NFL. Centralized vs Decentralized Live Odds The biggest difference between platforms becomes visible during volatile moments of a match. Feature Centralized Crypto Sportsbooks Decentralized Platforms (Dexsport) Odds updates Often delayed during live action Near real-time updates Market freezes Frequent during goals / key plays Less frequent, smoother flow Bet execution Subject to manual risk checks Automated, on-chain execution Slippage risk Higher during fast events Reduced due to instant settlement Transparency Internal, not publicly visible Bets recorded and verifiable on-chain Centralized platforms protect themselves by freezing markets aggressively. This reduces their exposure but directly impacts the bettor’s ability to react in real time. Decentralized systems, by contrast, rely on transparent execution logic and smart contracts, allowing markets to stay open longer during live play. Why Odds Stability Matters More Than Margins Many bettors focus on headline odds — for example, whether a platform offers 1.92 instead of 1.90. In live betting, this difference is often irrelevant compared to odds stability. If a platform regularly: suspends markets mid-play rejects bets after submission recalculates odds after confirmation then even “better” odds lose their value. Crypto-native platforms built for live betting prioritize execution certainty. Being able to secure an odds line when you click “place bet” is often more important than marginal pricing advantages. Live Odds Across Popular Sports Different sports stress live odds systems in different ways: Football (soccer): frequent momentum shifts, injury time, VAR pauses NBA: rapid scoring runs and short possession cycles NFL: sudden play-by-play volatility NHL: fast transitions and power plays Horse betting: extremely time-sensitive odds near race start Platforms optimized for live crypto betting maintain smoother odds behavior across these formats, while less specialized sportsbooks often struggle during peak action windows. In live betting, odds are not just numbers — they are a reflection of how well a platform handles speed, risk, and transparency. Crypto bettors who understand this tend to gravitate toward systems that prioritize real-time execution over cosmetic pricing. Best Sports for Live Crypto Betting Not all sports behave the same way in live betting environments. Some generate rapid odds shifts every few seconds, while others offer longer windows for analysis and execution. Choosing the right sport — and the right platform — plays a major role in successful crypto live betting. Below are the sports where live betting with cryptocurrency delivers the most value, especially when speed and real-time control matter. Live Football Betting with Crypto Football (soccer) remains the most popular sport for live sports betting worldwide. Matches evolve constantly — goals, cards, injuries, substitutions — and each event triggers immediate changes in live betting odds. Crypto live betting platforms are particularly effective here. Fast execution allows bettors to react before markets overcorrect, especially during: early goals momentum swings late-match pressure phases On well-optimized platforms, live football betting with crypto offers smoother market transitions and fewer interruptions, which is critical during intense in-play moments. Platforms designed for real-time execution handle these conditions better than traditional online sports betting sites. NBA Live Betting with Cryptocurrency The NBA is one of the fastest live betting environments in sports. Possessions are short, scoring runs are frequent, and odds shift rapidly during timeouts and quarter breaks. For NBA live betting, crypto platforms provide two key advantages: Faster bet placement during active play Instant balance updates without payment delays Live betting on point spreads, totals, and player props becomes significantly more efficient when bettors don’t have to wait for deposits or confirmations. This is where crypto-native platforms gain a clear edge. Live NFL Betting with Crypto NFL live betting is driven by discrete, high-impact moments. A single drive, turnover, or fourth-down decision can completely reshape the odds. Crypto live betting works well for NFL markets because it allows bettors to: adjust positions between drives react to injuries or play-calling shifts manage exposure through cash-out during momentum changes Because NFL markets often pause during plays, execution speed between stoppages becomes critical. Platforms with reliable in-play processing offer a noticeable advantage during these short betting windows. NHL Live Betting with Bitcoin and Crypto Hockey presents a unique challenge for live betting. The pace is fast, transitions are sudden, and goals can come with little warning. Live NHL betting with cryptocurrency benefits from: rapid odds recalculations minimal market freezes during power plays quick bet confirmations during momentum swings Crypto platforms that handle real-time data efficiently tend to perform better in hockey than slower, centralized sportsbooks, where frequent suspensions can disrupt in-play strategies. Live Horse Betting with Crypto Horse betting is one of the most time-sensitive forms of live wagering. Odds fluctuate sharply in the moments leading up to a race start, leaving little room for error. Crypto betting platforms allow users to place and adjust bets quickly without dealing with banking delays. For horse racing, this speed can be decisive — especially when placing late wagers or responding to sudden odds movements. Live horse betting with crypto is best suited to platforms that: process bets instantly avoid last-second market locks maintain stable odds close to post time Different sports place different demands on live betting infrastructure. What they all have in common is the need for speed, stability, and execution certainty — areas where crypto live betting platforms continue to outperform traditional online sportsbooks. Conclusion Live sports betting with cryptocurrency is built around speed and timing. When markets move in real time, the ability to place and settle bets instantly becomes more important than bonuses or visual features. Across football, NBA, NFL, NHL, and horse betting, crypto-native platforms consistently handle in-play action more smoothly than traditional sportsbooks. Faster execution, stable live odds, and fewer market interruptions give bettors greater control during live matches. Among the available options, decentralized platforms stand out for live betting. Dexsport, in particular, fits this model by combining real-time execution, transparency, and unrestricted access to in-play markets — making it a natural choice for modern crypto live bettors.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2026-01-14 17:05:13

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-is-certain-that-xrp-is-going-to-the-next-level-heres-why/,"Crypto markets often reveal their next major moves through subtle but decisive signals long before the broader public notices. Surges in trading volume , regional market activity, and technical momentum often precede price breakthroughs, highlighting where investor conviction is building. XRP now appears to be entering such a pivotal phase, as key indicators point to a potential acceleration in both demand and price. In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Chad Steingraber highlighted XRP’s emerging bullish setup, drawing attention to both price movement and trading activity. He noted that XRP recently surged to $2.17 on Binance perpetual futures, marking a 5.78% gain within 24 hours and backed by $1.45 billion in global trading volume. Steingraber emphasized that these metrics reflect renewed market confidence following years of regulatory uncertainty, positioning XRP for a potential structural advance. I’m not sure who needs to see this… But XRP is going next level… https://t.co/hKo47rM8U1 pic.twitter.com/s2OwezhuK0 — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) January 14, 2026 Trading Volume Reflects Strong Market Conviction Steingraber’s analysis underscores exceptionally high trading activity as a key indicator of bullish sentiment. Notably, South Korea’s Upbit exchange accounted for $87.75 million in XRP volume, representing over 20% of global spot trades. Concentrated regional activity often signals robust local demand, which can act as a catalyst for wider market momentum. High trading volume also attracts follow-on activity from institutional and retail traders. When significant liquidity flows into an asset, momentum strategies frequently amplify the move, creating self-reinforcing price trends that sustain upward trajectory. Regional Market Dynamics Drive Momentum XRP’s performance in South Korea highlights the role regional markets play in shaping global price trends. South Korean investors have historically led trading surges during critical crypto cycles, often triggering cascades in other markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Upbit’s dominance in XRP trading demonstrates that this renewed momentum is underpinned not only by technical factors but also by concentrated regional demand. Regulatory Clarity Supports Growth Beyond market activity, XRP benefits from resolving regulatory uncertainty. Years of legal challenges previously suppressed confidence, but as these hurdles diminish, investor conviction strengthens. Combined with active trading and regional adoption, regulatory clarity creates a strong foundation for sustainable growth. Toward the Next Level Steingraber’s observations suggest that XRP is entering a decisive phase where technical structure, trading volume, and regional participation converge. The asset’s strong liquidity and supportive market dynamics indicate that it could surpass prior consolidation levels, potentially triggering a broader upward move. If momentum continues, XRP may capture renewed attention from global investors, driving it to the next level and solidifying its position as a leading crypto asset.

In 2028, it will range between $19.33 and $25.91, with an average price of $20.18. In 2030, it will range between $79.95 and $99.65, with an average price of $82.60. The Aptos blockchain has aggressively attracted capital into its ecosystem, with its total value locked ( TVL ) rising above $400 million. Aptos is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain with a mature ecosystem comprising a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Aptos network continues to build decentralized applications and tools for developers. But how about APT’s performance? How high will it go? Is APT a good investment? Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2026 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Aptos Symbol APT Current price $1.95 Aptos crypto market cap $1.49B Trading volume $136.32M Circulating supply 749.87M All-time high $19.90 on Jan 30, 2023 All-time low $1.42 on Dec 18, 2025 24-hour high $1.99 24-hour low $1.86 Aptos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.44 (High) 50-day SMA $1.83 200-day SMA $3.62 Current APT crypto sentiment Neutral Green days 14/30 (47%) Fear and Greed Index 48 (Neutral) Aptos price analysis At press time, January 14, Aptos traded at $1.93, up 3.07% in the previous 24 hours and 20.41% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 40.96% over the previous 24 hours to $139.48M. Aptos 1-day chart price APTUSD chart by TradingView Aptos formed a bearish harami candle pattern in October last year, resulting in a major 24-hour drop to $0.747 from $5.12. It then made a quick correction above the $2.50 support level. The coin, however, maintained a bearish stance and continues to drop. In 2026, it fell below $2.0. The histograms (0.0417) indicate positive market momentum. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is dropping. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis APTUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart, unlike the daily chart, shows a bullish market with high volatility. The chart has formed green MACD histograms, indicating bullish momentum. Traders, however, are waiting to see if it breaks the $2.00 resistance level.

According to the technical indicators, APT is neutral. On the charts, its momentum is positive, and its volatility is rising. The move comes as APTs’ drop slows from 2025’s bear run. Why is Aptos up? Aptos achieved record-breaking on-chain application revenue for two consecutive weeks (Dec 22-Jan 4), peaking at $1.07M daily on Dec 31. This revenue stems from transaction/protocol fees, indicating genuine user activity rather than incentive-driven transactions. Recent news Grayscale added Aptos to its “Assets Under Consideration” list for future investment products on Jan 12, positioning APT alongside major smart-contract tokens like SOL and ADA for potential institutional adoption. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos will rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market corrects to previous highs. Will Aptos reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach the $100 mark in 2032. Will Aptos reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains unlikely that Aptos will get to $1000 before 2032. What is the long-term price prediction for Aptos? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, Aptos will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. How high can Aptos coin go? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach a high of $145 in 2032. Is Aptos worth investing in? APTOS’s design prioritizes scalability, reliability, and upgradeability. It is notable for using the MOVE programming language, developed by Facebook and now META. While the current trend is bearish, predictions paint a different narrative.

Aptos historic price sentiment APT price history by CoinGecko Aptos raised seed funding in January 2022, led by a16z. Series A funding included Apollo, Dragonfly, Franklin Templeton, and others. Some members previously worked on the Diem blockchain proposed by Facebook. The Aptos mainnet launched in October 2022 with an initial supply of 1 billion tokens. After the launch hype, Apt fell to its lowest in December 2022, at $3.09. A month later, the tables turned, as it peaked at a time high of $19.90 on January 30, 2023. It pumped, partly driven by the NFT market. Collections such as Aptos Monkeys and Aptomingod have attracted more users. On June 6, it fell below its initial listing price and extended the losses in the preceding months. In October, it started correcting, rising as high as $8.47 in November. In 2024, it broke above $10, reaching $18 in March. From April, it reversed, falling below $10. By September, it had fallen as low as $6. It recovered in October, rising above $7.50.

It replicates the underlying BTC-USD well net of fees, with a linear performance relative to peers. I am looking with interest at the divergence that has formed relative to the performance of US equities. Especially in a context of prospective monetary expansion: an element that typically works in favor of assets like Bitcoin. From a technical perspective as well, it is trading within a range that, in my opinion, allows risk to be managed strategically. Today something is happening on Bitcoin that I haven’t seen for quite some time. Something that naturally is also reflected in the ETFs that replicate its performance, in this sense also on the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ). I am referring to 2 very interesting divergences: the one with the S&P 500 the one with global liquidity. These are 2 elements that can easily be interpreted negatively: as a relative weakness of Bitcoin. And yet, personally, I interpret them positively. And before explaining why … What is BTCO BTCO is a spot Bitcoin ETF , with the objective of replicating the spot price of Bitcoin, net of costs. BTCO - Profile (Seeking Alpha) These amount to an expense ratio of 0.25%, fairly competitive, if one considers a bid/ask prem/disc of -0.02% and a bid/ask spread of 0.08%, a sign of positive liquidity . BTCO - liquidity grade (Seeking Alpha) In this sense, naturally, the number of bitcoins per share decreases over time , even if Bitcoin rises. This is because each Sponsor Fee is paid by selling bitcoin, generating an effect of structural economic dilution and inevitable underperformance vs BTC spot in the long term. BTCO - expense grade (Seeking Alpha) For replication it uses the Lukka Prime Reference Rate ( USD ) mechanism; essentially it has prices aggregated from multiple exchanges to determine a fair value and then the NAV that moves synchronously with the underlying. It then uses an external custody mechanism at Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. Peer comparison For completeness, I’m also sharing my peer table, although I want to point out that, after several comparative analyses, I’ve come to the conclusion that the key decision lever should be fees. BTCO - peer comparison (Seeking Alpha) Specifically, BTCO does not have fees that are clearly higher than peers with larger AUM, such as FBTC in this respect , and IBIT . For this reason, in terms of performance there are no major deviations. To go deeper, I invite you to read here . BTCO - peer comparison (Seeking Alpha) Something is happening that I didn’t expect Those who follow me know that I usually analyze Bitcoin’s performance in comparative terms. I don’t appreciate the maximalist dynamic that sees Bitcoin as “the asset that will save us all no matter what.” Simply, it is an asset that, by following this narrative, is achieving great results, and as an analyst, I simply go along with it. To enter the market through ETFs, in the past I have oriented myself by following two parallels that have always brought me great satisfaction . 1. Bitcoin & S&P 500 Bitcoin, therefore the ETFs that use it as the underlying (in this case BTCO), for me is a high beta solution of the S&P 500 (and of the Nasdaq index). It means that it amplifies rises and falls in the same way as a technology stock (basically). Or rather … this is what has guided my research over the past years. But look at what happened today. BTCO - SPY - price (Seeking Alpha) There has been a strong divergence between Bitcoin and the performance of traditional markets. And this, in my experience, and in my opinion, can be read in 2 ways: A positive gap between prices that will facilitate Bitcoin’s growth. A negative gap that anticipates a collapse of the S&P 500. But let’s move on to the second … 2. Bitcoin and global liquidity Bitcoin has a strength (not so common): it has a limited, or better said, predefined supply . Being therefore a “fixed-supply” asset, and freely accessible, it means that if liquidity in circulation increases, the price undergoes (in my opinion) a natural revaluation. For this reason there is a tight correlation between Bitcoin and money in circulation M2 (as is also the case for the S&P 500). US M2 money supply (ycharts) And it so happens that this is at all-time highs, while the price of Bitcoin instead is declining. Well … in my opinion, this is an important asymmetry to consider. My opinion on BTCO Does it make sense to expect a decline in the S&P 500? Certainly, the “unpredictable” exogenous shock is always around the corner, but if as an analyst I had to simply rely on today’s expectations, I don’t see the reason. Revenues and earnings are expected to grow strongly according to FactSet . S&P 500 revenue growth CY 2026 (FactSet financial data and analytics) In the same way, liquidity is expected to expand on multiple fronts: Fed cutting rates, especially after the DOJ accusations against Powell . The unconditional QE of the US government with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . And the resumption of monthly expansions of the Fed’s balance sheet. And if these 2 elements are considered sufficient drivers to describe Bitcoin’s performance (as has been the case in the recent period), I think it is more likely that the gap anticipates potential recoveries by Bitcoin, rather than a contraction of the general market. Risk Naturally, this is a forecast based on two arbitrary, and not absolute, conventions. In the sense that it is assumed that Bitcoin maintains an anchoring to these correlations, simply because in the past it has been so: this also means assuming that market habits never change. But this in itself is inconsistent with the very nature of the market. Just think of when Bitcoin was instead called “digital gold” and reacted positively to systemic shocks and geopolitical risks; which is completely inconsistent with the “new conception” of Bitcoin (the one I presented here). In fact, exactly the opposite would happen. So? The risk is that Bitcoin simply changes its conception. BTCO - price (Seeking Alpha) How do I manage this risk? well, I work on the technical side. BTCO today is in a price range on which I can try to set accumulation strategies with controlled risk. Quite simply, in the area below 50 RSI points within the range and slightly below it, I can try to accumulate a position, to be managed with controlled risk. Conclusion These 2 divergences encourage me to maintain a positive rating (BUY) on BTCO. Why? Looking at the nature of the ETF, I consider it competitive in the market. Looking at intermarket analysis, it seems it can be positively influenced by the S&P 500 and the liquidity boom. Looking at the chart, it is located in an area where I can try to work.",BTC-USD|BTCO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-14 17:09:54

This aligns with Musk’s desire to see X morph into an “ everything app ” where messaging and financial services like trading and investing happen. Changpeng had shared his opinions on the topic, asking important questions and highlighting reasons he believes could complicate the endeavor. What does CZ thinks about X becoming a financial rail? During the Chinese AMA, CZ shared what he thought about the possibility of X launching on-chain transactions and handling KYC should it expand into crypto trading. During the AMA, CZ pointed out potential challenges X may have with user identification, noting that platforms like Binance Square and Binance rely heavily on strict KYC measures in compliance with regulations and to prevent issues like money laundering. Observers have pointed out in the past couple of days, since the topic started circulating, that X is still just a social media platform and as such would face significant hurdles if it attempts to implement robust KYC. Those hurdles, which mostly have to do with the potential regulatory pressure it will face, could make seamless crypto trading difficult or risky, especially if there are no proper verification processes. Is crypto trading feasible on X? Musk has been nursing an ambition to make X an everything app since he bought the app in 2022. He even shared the ambition on X around that time, claiming that the Twitter purchase would accelerate his goal of creating X, the everything app. Years have passed since then, and now he is looking to make good on his promise by wading into the financial industry by making X support crypto trading. The platform has already become a hub for financial conversations, with Nikita Bier, head of product at X, claiming X as the best source for financial news. “Hundreds of billions of dollars are deployed based on things people read here,” Bier claimed in a post. The biggest and most recent development regarding the topic is the soon-to-launch Smart Cashtags feature that Bier announced was in the works on January 11. The feature is designed to allow users to directly tag exact assets or smart contracts in X post. “We’re building Smart Cashtags that allow you to specify the exact asset when posting a ticker,” Bier wrote. “From Timeline, users will be able to tap them to see its real-time price along with all mentions of that asset. We’re aiming to collect feedback as we iterate toward a public release next month.” The update is expected to lay the foundation that X will build on as it inches towards becoming a hub that merges on-platform financial data and conversation, with live market intelligence. Once the update goes live, any user who taps on a cashtag will get a live, real-time display of prices and charts, access to related discussions, news and sentiment surrounding the tag, as well as on-chain data for the token. This will turn the X timeline into a powerful real-time market dashboard that could ultimately benefit crypto traders and enthusiasts. There is even speculation that the update will provide buy or sell buttons, which could result in in-app trading or redirects to platforms partnered with X.

We asked four of the most popular AI chatbots to assess whether a further rise to $1,000 could occur as early as this month. What are the Chances? According to ChatGPT, such a pump is possible given the huge interest in XMR as of late. However, it warned that hitting the $1K milestone will depend heavily on several key catalysts, including hype surrounding the privacy coin sector, potential FOMO, and backing from leading exchanges. Recall that Binance delisted XMR at the beginning of 2024, triggering a short-term price collapse. Renewed support from the biggest crypto exchange would significantly improve the asset’s liquidity and availability while strengthening its market credibility, setting the stage for a rally. In conclusion, ChatGPT estimated that the odds of reaching the depicted target sometime this month are in the 20-30% range. Google’s Gemini was much more optimistic, stating the current momentum is “extraordinarily strong.” It reminded that XMR has surged by almost 60% over the past week alone, arguing that an additional jump of 42% until the end of January is very much in the cards. Grok and Perplexity, on the other hand, are nowhere near that bullish. The AI chatbot integrated into X predicted that Monero’s native token can stretch to as high as $800-$900 “in a strong Q1 scenario,” rejecting the possibility of reaching $1,000 this month. Perplexity shared a similar forecast, envisioning a further rise to $800, followed by a substantial retreat. This Trader Joins the Craze Several hours ago, veteran trader Peter Brandt added his name to the list of people who jumped on the Monero bandwagon lately. He revealed on X that he purchased XMR after finding similarities between its performance and that of paper silver (a term that refers to all financial instruments that track the price of the precious metal). Brandt even described the token as “crypto silver.” “But do not tell anybody that. It should never be known that I have profited every so often. The trolls must believe I am not successful in trading,” he added.

BitGo IPO Exceeds $201 Million Target Recent financial reports confirm that BitGo’s initial public offering has surpassed its publicly stated goal of raising $201 million. Consequently, this oversubscription indicates robust investor appetite. The company, founded in 2013, provides secure storage and management for digital assets. Furthermore, its technology serves a wide range of clients, including exchanges, institutions, and high-net-worth individuals. This successful funding round follows a period of intense regulatory clarification and market maturation. Therefore, analysts view the event as a critical bellwether. Historically, the path for crypto-native companies to access public markets has been complex. For instance, Coinbase’s direct listing in 2021 set an early precedent. However, a traditional IPO for a pure-play custody firm like BitGo represents a different milestone. It specifically validates the business model of institutional-grade security services. The offering’s structure likely involved listing on a major U.S. exchange, though specific details remain under wraps pending official filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Rising Demand for Digital Asset Custody The overwhelming response to the BitGo IPO is not an isolated incident. Instead, it reflects a broader, data-driven trend. Institutional investment in cryptocurrencies has accelerated dramatically since 2023. A recent PwC report estimated that over 80% of traditional financial institutions have explored or implemented digital asset strategies. This surge creates an acute need for qualified, regulated custodians. Custody acts as the foundational layer of trust, enabling further investment and product development. Expert Analysis on Market Implications Financial analysts point to several key factors behind the offering’s success. First, BitGo’s established track record and regulatory compliance provide a trust advantage. The firm holds a New York Trust Charter and other global licenses. Second, the growing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) necessitates robust intermediaries. “BitGo’s IPO success is a clear market signal,” noted a fintech analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence. “It demonstrates that investors are betting on the infrastructure enabling the next phase of asset digitization, not just on speculative token prices.” The following table compares key custody-focused entities that have approached public markets: Company Market Event Year Core Focus Coinbase Direct Listing 2021 Exchange & Retail Platform Bakkt SPAC Merger 2021 Exchange & Custody BitGo IPO 2025 Institutional Custody & Security Moreover, the current macroeconomic environment plays a role. With interest rate cycles shifting, investors seek growth in technological transformation sectors. Digital asset infrastructure, particularly security, presents a compelling long-term narrative. BitGo’s technology, including its multi-signature wallets and qualified custody solutions, addresses the paramount concern of asset safety. Regulatory Tailwinds and Industry Impact This financial milestone occurs alongside significant regulatory progress. For example, frameworks like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provide clearer operating guidelines. In the United States, legislative efforts continue to define custody requirements. This clarity reduces operational uncertainty for firms like BitGo. Subsequently, it makes them more attractive to institutional capital. The IPO’s success will likely catalyze further investment and competition in the sector. Key impacts of this development include: Increased Capital Inflow: More venture and public market funding will flow into crypto security startups. Higher Standards: Competition will drive innovations in insurance, audit transparency, and compliance technology. Mainstream Adoption: Robust custody solutions enable pension funds, endowments, and ETFs to safely hold digital assets. Furthermore, the event strengthens the entire blockchain ecosystem. Secure custody is a prerequisite for many financial products. These products include spot Bitcoin ETFs, tokenized real-world assets, and institutional DeFi. Therefore, BitGo’s validation as a public company supports the infrastructure for these evolving markets. It also sets a performance benchmark for rivals like Anchorage Digital, Fireblocks, and Fidelity Digital Assets. Conclusion The BitGo IPO offering, exceeding its $201 million target, marks a definitive moment for cryptocurrency integration into global finance. Ultimately, it reflects deep institutional confidence not in speculation, but in the essential infrastructure of security and trust. This successful public offering validates the custody business model and paves the way for the next wave of institutional capital entering the digital asset space. As regulatory landscapes solidify, the demand for qualified, auditable, and secure custody solutions will undoubtedly continue its upward trajectory, with BitGo’s public market debut serving as a key reference point for the industry’s maturation in 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What does BitGo’s IPO success mean for the average cryptocurrency investor? While primarily an institutional service, a stronger, well-funded custody ecosystem increases overall market security and stability, benefiting all participants by setting higher industry standards. Q2: How does BitGo’s custody model work? BitGo uses multi-signature wallet technology, requiring multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This approach, combined with offline cold storage and extensive insurance, mitigates the risk of theft or loss. Q3: Why is custody so important for institutional adoption? Institutions like hedge funds and banks have strict fiduciary and regulatory duties to safeguard client assets. Professional custodians provide the security, audit trails, and regulatory compliance these entities require before allocating capital. Q4: Could this IPO lead to more crypto companies going public? Analysts believe a successful BitGo IPO could encourage other infrastructure-focused blockchain companies, particularly in areas like compliance, security, and settlement, to consider public market listings. Q5: What are the main risks associated with cryptocurrency custody? The primary risks include cybersecurity threats, internal fraud, operational failure, and private key management. Reputable custodians address these through technological safeguards, insurance, independent audits, and strict operational procedures.

Source: TradingView The breakout comes after weeks of Bitcoin lagging behind traditional assets, with QCP Capital noting that the digital asset has pushed through the $95,000 resistance level that capped rallies since November. The move higher reflects a strengthening risk-on environment driven by stable U.S. inflation and a resilient job market, creating what QCP describes as a “ Goldilocks environment ” where investors are piling into everything from stocks to precious metals and now crypto. Despite geopolitical tensions in Venezuela and Iran, markets have remained resilient, interpreting U.S. involvement as a reassertion of global leadership rather than a source of instability. Trump’s Economic Agenda Fuels Market Confidence QCP believes political calculations are driving the rally, arguing that President Trump is focused on achieving new equity market highs ahead of the midterm elections this year. “ The market is convinced that Trump will do anything to Make America Great Again, with his measure of success being new highs in equity markets, ” QCP stated in its analysis. The firm sees flush liquidity and renewed American leadership as Trump’s primary tools, naturally leading to U.S. outperformance and a global risk-on environment. However, traditional markets showed cracks on Wednesday as Wall Street declined for a second straight session. The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 182 points, weighed down by mixed bank earnings that disappointed investors. Wells Fargo plunged 4.6% on weaker-than-expected revenue, while Bank of America declined 3.8% despite beating profit estimates, highlighting how elevated valuations have left little room for disappointment. Meanwhile, precious metals continued their explosive start to the year, with gold, silver, copper, and tin all hitting record highs as investors embraced the so-called debasement trade. Source: YahooFinance Silver jumped 6.1% to top $92 per ounce, while gold notched another all-time peak above $4,620, capping a remarkable 65% gain in 2025. “ When gold moves first, it usually signals declining trust in fiat currencies, ” Hao Hong, chief investment officer at Lotus Asset Management, told Bloomberg . “ Everything is measured against gold, then most assets look cheap right now. “ Political Turmoil Amplifies Safe-Haven Demand The precious metals rally accelerated after deadly protests in Iran killed over 500 people, with Tehran warning it could target U.S. military bases if President Trump intervenes. Political uncertainty intensified when the Justice Department served Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with grand jury subpoenas over Senate testimony, pressuring the dollar and raising questions about central bank independence. Fed Chair Powell accuses Trump administration of using criminal threats to pressure rate cuts after DOJ grand jury subpoenas over renovation testimony, triggering bipartisan backlash. #Fed #Trump #DOJ https://t.co/nKiwflcFWg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 12, 2026 Farzam Ehsani, CEO of crypto exchange VALR, warned that the situation creates a paradox for digital assets. “ On the one hand, weakening confidence in dollar policy traditionally increases interest in decentralized assets as a hedge against political and currency risk, ” he said. “ On the other hand, abrupt political maneuvers and aggressive polarization within the government are increasing instability, triggering short-term outflows from risky assets. “ Ray Youssef, CEO of the crypto app NoOnes, also noted that capital rotation, rather than panic, appears to be driving market moves. “ The US market is slightly down, but this is more likely due to capital rotation, as investors are shifting capital from riskier to more predictable sectors, ” he explained, adding that gold and Bitcoin are increasingly treated as refuges from macro chaos. QCP sees Bitcoin’s recent underperformance relative to precious metals as creating opportunity, suggesting that “ the relative cheapness of Bitcoin relative to precious metals at this point may spur a rotation to digital assets. ” The firm acknowledged risks remain, particularly around pending Supreme Court decisions on tariffs (which have also been delayed again), and potential escalation in Venezuela or Iran, but believes these concerns are already priced in.

According to its outlook, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could potentially rally to $30,000 by 2029 while outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ) through 2026. The target implies a roughly 790% gain from ETH’s press-time value of $3,371. At that level, Ethereum would command a market capitalization of about $3.6 trillion, positioning it as the world’s largest digital asset, assuming Bitcoin records minimal growth over the same period. ETH one-week price chart. Source: Finbold The forecast reinforces the bank’s long-standing optimism on ETH, even as it acknowledges that previous targets have not always aligned with market outcomes. The multinational bank’s latest outlook sees Ethereum reaching $7,500 by the end of 2026, with a longer-term trajectory that places the asset at $30,000 within the next three years. The analysis is led by the bank’s digital assets research team and is built around Ethereum’s structural role in the crypto economy rather than short-term market momentum. Ethereum’s dominance Standard Chartered argued that Ethereum’s strength lies in its dominance across key blockchain use cases. The network remains the primary settlement layer for stablecoins , hosts a large share of tokenized real-world assets, and continues to underpin most decentralized finance activity. According to the bank, these factors give Ethereum the potential to decouple from periods of Bitcoin weakness and sustain independent growth. The report also reiterated a recurring theme in Standard Chartered’s research: Ethereum’s ability to outperform Bitcoin during phases when blockchain utility and adoption matter more than pure store-of-value narratives. In this view, ETH’s role as programmable financial infrastructure positions it to benefit from institutional adoption, particularly as traditional assets increasingly move on-chain. At the same time, the bank’s latest projections reflect a more tempered stance than some of its past calls. The $7,500 target for late 2026 is lower than the $8,000 level the bank once expected Ethereum to reach by the end of 2024. Despite that recalibration, Standard Chartered remains one of the most bullish major banks on Ethereum.

According to the lawsuit, highly leveraged borrowing, insider control and collusion with repeated fund flows led to the loss of over US$16,200,000 of the investors’ funds. The forensic report shows ICHI lending scheme’s flaws were exploited by insiders to withdraw crypto assets belonging to other investors before its collapse for financial gain. The investigation traces the funds from the suspicious wallets to central exchanges pointing to attempts for liquidation and concealment, and identifies accomplices in the scheme. NEW YORK, Jan. 15, 2026 /PRNewswire/ — SUMMARY – HASH Asset Management (the Plaintiff), a crypto venture capital firm, brought a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against DMA Labs Inc. (DMA), ICHI Foundation (ICHI), their founders Bryan Gross and Nick Poore, and their associates Tyler Christian Pintar and Julian Brand aka Julian Finch-Brand (the Defendants). According to the Verified Complaint, filed on 8 April 2025, the Defendants executed a fraud scheme which caused the investors to lose over $16,200,000. – The Amended Verified Complaint, filed with the same Court on 23 May 2025, is an action for fraud, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and piercing the veil and alter ego liability. It seeks to pierce the corporate veil of DMA to hold the individual defendants Poore and Gross liable, in addition to also asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty and other claims against them. It clarifies and updates the lawsuit revealing more evidence on the associates in the alleged fraudulent scheme. – The new, updated forensic expert declaration by Paul Sibenik, a certified blockchain forensics investigator, filed with the Court on 21 August 2025, gives further specific and detailed evidence, providing an in-depth analysis of the “pump-and-dump” scheme in supporting the Plaintiff’s claims. – According to the investigation, which employed blockchain forensic tracing to identify wallet ownership and transaction flows, the collapse of the liquidity pool “Rari Pool 136” was the result of collusion, insider trading and manipulation by individuals associated with ICHI and DMA, pointing to the insiders, namely Julian Brand and Tyler Pintar, profiting from the collapse of “Rari Pool 136”. – The findings indicate the scheme had design flaws and was exploited by ICHI insiders to borrow and withdraw assets immediately before its collapse for their own financial gain. The report asserts that highly leveraged borrowing, insider control and apparent collusion with insider-controlled wallets, and unauthorized movements of funds led to the loss of over $16,200,000 of the investors’ funds. – The lawsuit and the expert declaration describe the alleged fraud scheme in forensic detail. As one of the lead investors who participated in the lending program by providing crypto for others to borrow, the Plaintiff brought the complaint to hold the Defendants accountable and personally liable so as to recover for their losses resulting from their misconduct and to protect the crypto community in future. LAWSUIT: THE FRAUD SCHEME According to the lawsuit, the Defendants issued their own cryptocurrency, ICHI, and offered a yield earning “liquidity pool” opportunity for investors. As alleged in the complaints, they perpetrated a fraud by deceitfully enticing investors to deposit crypto assets as collateral into their “Community Treasury” in return for issuing “oneTokens” (ICHI-designed “stablecoins” each worth US$1). The Defendants promised that their offering was safe and “decentralized,” and that any changes to it would be subject to a “community vote.” These representations were false. After the Plaintiff invested millions of dollars’ worth of the stablecoins into the liquidity pool called “Rari Pool 136”, the Defendants, contrary to their pledge, exerted full control over it, made unilateral decisions, removed the liquidity protections to protect their own crypto at the expense of the Plaintiff’s crypto assets, and executed a series of transactions that ultimately caused its collapse. As a result, the Plaintiff lost over US$16,200,000. According to the filings with the Court, the sustainability of “Rari Pool 136” was possible due to an increasing price of ICHI tokens, while ICHI crypto price increase relied on continued borrowing. As soon as there was not enough buying demand for ICHI crypto to sustain the inflated price, it led to cascading liquidations in “Rari Pool 136” of which a large portion of assets had become ICHI crypto. It caused the price of ICHI to collapse by 99%, from nearly US$142 to US$1.79. When ICHI dropped in value, the Defendants executed a series of trades to protect themselves, which caused the rapid collapse of “Rari Pool 136” and the loss of nearly all the Plaintiff’s investments. The lawsuit states that Bryan Gross, the self-appointed ICHI Foundation “steward” admitted to transferring the “Community Treasury,” with the millions of dollars’ worth of the investors’ deposits, without the required community vote. It asserts that the scheme intended to protect the Defendants’ assets and increase the price of their cryptocurrency, ICHI, at the expense of the crypto assets belonging to the investors, while the liquidity protections the Defendants touted were, in fact, illusory and false. The “Community Treasury” crypto with nearly all the Plaintiff’s investments was lost. According to the lawsuit, together with Poore and Gross, Pintar and Brand operated two primary wallets involved in the fraudulent, “pump-and-dumb” scheme and were direct participants in it. According to the filings, HASH as a fund was only a lender in the liquidity pool, which deposited stablecoins and collected the interest payments. The Plaintiff did not buy the risky ICHI but earned the cryptocurrency as “yield” for providing “stablecoins” to “Rari Pool 136” for others to borrow. INVESTIGATION: INITIAL FINDINGS The Plaintiff commissioned a crypto tracing investigation by a reputable blockchain forensics and cybercrime investigative firm, Cryptoforensic Investigators, led by crypto tracing expert Paul Sibenik, which advises various cryptocurrency exchanges, and law enforcement and regulatory agencies. The investigation firstly identified significant apparent defects of the lending scheme: a) an extremely high loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of 85% of “Rari Pool 136” (meaning that someone pledging US$100 worth of collateral could borrow the equivalent of US$85 in the “stablecoins”), b) it allowed borrowers to use unlimited amounts of ICHI crypto (which is not a “stablecoin”) as a collateral to borrow other crypto, including “stablecoins”, and c) there was no supply cap on the amount of assets to be deposited into “Rari Pool 136”. The depositions note that the “Angel Vault,” a liquidity protection device that the Defendants touted as a protective “buy wall” to stabilize the value of ICHI, also failed. According to the report, the focus of the Defendants’ scheme was to: 1) displace the “stablecoin” and other valuable cryptocurrencies from “Rari Pool 136” in exchange for the highly risky ICHI, 2) to use borrowed “stablecoins” or other cryptocurrencies to purchase more ICHI, which would drive up the price of ICHI, and 3) to use that purchased ICHI as a collateral in “Rari Pool 136” to borrow more “stablecoins” and other cryptocurrencies and to continuously repeat this cycle. This scheme was possible as ICHI could be used as both the collateral for borrowers and the proceeds of the loan from “Rari Pool 136”. As a result, while the Plaintiff reasonably thought that “oneTokens” and other safer cryptocurrencies were protected, “Rari Pool 136” was completely reliant on the price of ICHI. The investigation identified that the key transactions which caused the collapse of “Rari Pool 136” were executed by digital addresses linked to the ICHI Foundation and DMA insiders. MORE INSIGHT INTO SCHEME TRANSACTIONS AND ACCOMPLICES According to the Amended Verified Complaint (which exposes and scrutinizes activities of the associates of ICHI founders), Julian Finch, also known as Julian Brand or “BlueJay”, and Tyler Christian Pintar, were involved in a coordinated scheme to extract significant funds from the ICHI protocol’s treasury through insider access and manipulation of system parameters. Both individuals appear to have played key roles in the use of recursive leverage and unauthorized borrowing that led to the destabilization of the protocol and contributed to the collapse of the “Rari Pool 136” platform. As alleged, Julian Brand and Tyler Pintar are believed to have executed large borrowing transactions shortly after treasury funds were moved – often within minutes – indicating potential coordination or foreknowledge of internal decisions. These activities involved borrowing “stablecoins”, purchasing ICHI tokens to influence price movement, and using those tokens as a collateral to further increase borrowing. During this time, the protocol settings such as loan-to-value ratios were modified, and liquidity was removed or dispersed in a manner that hindered liquidations and amplified systemic risk. The filing points to the fact that Julian Brand had previously served in a business development role at ICHI and continued to be publicly associated with crypto-related initiatives after his departure, while Tyler Pintar, similarly, maintained active involvement in decentralized finance through various accounts and projects. Their past activity, including the wallets’ behavior and their public affiliations, appears to align with the patterns observed during the collapse of the ICHI protocol. NEW FORENSIC REPORT: EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION AND INSIDER TRADING The forensic investigation aimed to assess whether ICHI founders and their associates, including DMA Labs., were likely behind or played a role in the collapse of “Rari Pool 136” for their own financial gain, and whether there is any indication of insider trading by individuals that were part of or associated with the ICHI Foundation. In particular, the investigation identified the key wallets tied to insiders, including 0xd415 (Tyler Pintar, $13.09M of bad debt) and 0xfb06 (Julian Brand, $12.21M of bad debt), 0x4fe (ICHI Team, $5.644M of bad debt) and 0xc8b5 (Unknown, but with link to ICHI Team, the largest bad debt holder of $15.46M), and other linked addresses apparently operated or influenced by ICHI associates, which points to insider trading. The expert report suggests that the users with a large amount of bad debt (in the millions of dollars) knew that they were exploiting design flaws in “Rari Pool 136” and that it would likely collapse as a result of continuing to leverage ICHI and borrowing “stablecoins”. The report identifies that on 6 April 2022, when Julian Brand borrowed $1.8M USDC, the ICHI team transferred $5M USDC and 43 wBTC from the “Community Treasury” without the required “community vote”. It points to other transactions between April 7 and 9 by Brand and Pintar borrowing millions of dollars’ worth of USDC and other crypto assets, just days before ICHI price collapsed. Overall, it shows evidence of transfers from the “Community Treasury”, totalling $9M, which evidently allowed insiders to profit while depleting the collateral reserves meant to protect investors. The report notes that the funds from the identified suspicious wallets were traced to centralized exchanges (including Binance, Kraken, BTCTurk, and stake.com), indicating attempts for liquidation and concealment, while the pattern of repeated fund flows demonstrates collusion and insider trading. In his conclusion, Paul Sibenik specifies that, based on the analysis of blockchain data and events: 1) a small number of users were likely involved in the exploit of “Rari Pool 136”, while some of the other addresses might also be controlled by individuals that were part of or affiliated with the ICHI Team; 2) the ICHI Team directly transacted numerous times with multiple suspicious addresses with significant bad debt “which is suggestive of insider trading by the ICHI Team multiple individuals, some known and others unknown, who played a critical role in the collapse of Rari Pool 136”, 3) Julian Brand and Tyler Pintar attempted to borrow as much as they could from Rari Pool 136 in the days prior to the collapse, and during the collapse itself, while at the same time the ICHI team moved assets from the “Community Treasury” to “Rari Pool 136” “without the required community vote, allowing insiders, including Brand and Pintar to profit more and more from the inherent flaws in the protocol”, 4) “insiders were able to deplete Rari protocol of the limited USDC available before other users could redeem, possibly due to inside information that insiders like Brand and Pintar may have had”. The findings document the scheme had design flaws exploited by ICHI insiders to borrow and withdraw assets immediately before its collapse for their own financial gain. The report shows the evidence disproving ICHI’s claims of “decentralization” such as the unauthorized movements of funds without the community vote (while the community voting system systems are meant to protect against centralized bad actors making unilateral decisions that harm stakeholders). The report evidences that highly leveraged borrowing, insider control and collusion with insider-controlled wallets, and identified unauthorized movements of funds – led to the loss of over $16,200,000 of the investors’ funds.

MUTM is modeled on a utility-driven ecosystem. In its continued presale, MUTM has moved from an initial price of $0.01 to $0.04 in Presale Phase 7. The project now has over 18,800 unique holders, and over $19.75 million raised, indicating widespread early adoption in the marketplace. MUTM is set to launch a V1 DeFi Protocol for lending and borrowing, with Peer to Contract (P2C) and Peer to Peer (P2P) Markets for lending, and a set of features aimed at providing an organic demand mechanism. This characterizes the project, in the early stages, as a utility-driven ecosystem. This model gives it an edge over Dogecoin ahead of the 2026 bull run and in the long-run. Dogecoin Momentum Is Cautious Dogecoin performance suggests that there is the likelihood of recovery where the currency is trading above the 50-day moving average having been in a downward moving channel over extended periods of time. The price appreciation objectives ranging between $0.153 and $0.280 that are being closely observed by technical analysts are as a result of unchanging support and market conditions. Despite the appeal to this technical analysis as a trading opportunity, Dogecoin is still in a high sentiments status. MUTM Presale: Timing is Everything Mutuum Finance presale gives an advantage to early bird investors. Phase 7 tokens are priced at $0.04 and will be followed by Phase 8 at $0.045. This means an instant 20% profit. These price increases will continue until MUTM enters the market at $0.06. The model allows early birds to establish themselves ahead of the market and enjoy enormous returns upon mass adaptation. If for example an investor enters the presale with a $10,000 buy, they will have accrued a $5,000 profit by the time of launch to hit $15,000. This makes MUTM one of the best cryptos to invest in. Creating Value through Staking and Scarcity The total supply of MUTM tokens is set at four billion, with no plans to mint more. This ensures rarity. The fees generated through lending and borrowing are used for buybacks, which are subsequently paid out to the stakers. This ensures a positive feedback loop, whereby increased activity results in increased buybacks, which in turn results in increased rewards. If for example, fees hit $3 million and 10% was committed to buybacks, this would see $300,000 worth of MUTM go to community members. With these mechanisms, MUTM positions itself as the next crypto to explode with a sustainable model. Resilient & Multi-Chain DeFi Security is one of MUTM’s core focus areas. It has successfully passed an audit conducted by Halborn Security and incorporated all recommendations for improvement. Coming soon to the Sepolia testnet is the V1 protocol that will allow interaction between users and liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as a liquidator bot for under-collateralized positions. It will support ETH and USDT during testnet, but it is to expand to other assets. Passive Income while Maintaining Exposure MUTM allows its users to lend and borrow without the need to sell their assets. Through a P2C lending service, users can receive competitive returns on their deposits, including an 8-12% APY. It also gives the user the option of accessing overcollateralized loans without the need to sell their assets. At 80% LTV, $10,000 collateral can access an $8,000 loan at a favorable interest rate. Stakeholder Relations as a Growth Engine Mutuum Finance supports community participation in terms of incentive programs to stress on participation and loyalty.

This blockchain-based platform enables direct issuance and lending of real-world stocks without traditional intermediaries, potentially reshaping equity market infrastructure for years to come. The announcement, made from San Francisco on March 15, 2025, represents one of the most significant integrations of blockchain technology into mainstream finance to date. Understanding the OPEN Platform’s Revolutionary Approach Figure Technologies’ OPEN platform represents a fundamental departure from existing tokenized stock solutions. Unlike synthetic assets that merely track share prices, OPEN directly issues stocks with verifiable ownership on its proprietary blockchain. This distinction creates genuine legal ownership rights for investors rather than derivative exposure. Consequently, shareholders can exercise voting rights and receive dividends directly through the blockchain infrastructure. The platform eliminates numerous traditional intermediaries including brokerage firms, custodians, and clearing houses. This streamlined approach potentially reduces settlement times from the standard T+2 cycle to near-instantaneous transactions. Moreover, the system enables direct peer-to-peer lending and collateralization of shares without requiring third-party facilitation. Financial technology analysts note this could dramatically reduce costs while increasing market accessibility. Technical Architecture and Security Framework OPEN operates on Figure’s proprietary Provenance Blockchain, specifically designed for financial applications with enterprise-grade security protocols. The network employs a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism optimized for regulatory compliance and transaction finality. Each stock issuance undergoes rigorous verification processes to ensure accurate representation of underlying corporate ownership structures. The platform incorporates multiple security layers including multi-signature wallets, institutional-grade custody solutions, and real-time monitoring systems. Furthermore, all transactions maintain complete audit trails on the immutable ledger. This transparency potentially reduces fraud risks while providing regulators with unprecedented visibility into market activities. Industry experts emphasize that this architecture addresses previous concerns about blockchain’s suitability for regulated securities markets. Comparative Analysis: OPEN vs. Traditional Tokenized Stocks The financial technology sector has witnessed various approaches to digitizing traditional assets. To understand OPEN’s innovation, consider this comparative analysis: Feature Traditional Tokenized Stocks Figure OPEN Platform Ownership Structure Synthetic derivatives tracking prices Direct legal ownership of shares Intermediaries Required Multiple (custodians, brokers, exchanges) Minimal direct issuance Settlement Time Typically T+2 business days Near-instantaneous on-chain Lending Mechanism Through prime brokers or lending desks Direct peer-to-peer on platform Regulatory Compliance Varies by jurisdiction and structure Built into blockchain protocol This comparison highlights OPEN’s distinctive value proposition within the evolving digital assets landscape. The platform essentially creates a parallel market infrastructure rather than merely digitizing existing processes. Market Implications and Industry Impact The introduction of OPEN carries profound implications for equity markets globally. First, it potentially democratizes access to securities lending, traditionally dominated by institutional investors. Retail investors can now lend shares directly to borrowers, earning additional income from their holdings. Second, the platform could increase market efficiency by reducing friction in capital allocation processes. Financial institutions face both challenges and opportunities from this development. Traditional intermediaries must adapt their business models while blockchain-native firms gain new avenues for innovation. Additionally, regulatory bodies worldwide must develop frameworks for this hybrid financial infrastructure. Early indications suggest regulatory interest in OPEN’s compliance-focused design, particularly its transparent audit trails and ownership verification mechanisms. Market analysts project several potential outcomes from OPEN’s adoption: Reduced transaction costs through eliminated intermediary fees Increased liquidity in equity markets through easier share lending Enhanced market transparency via immutable transaction records New financial products leveraging programmable equity features Global market integration through borderless blockchain infrastructure Regulatory Landscape and Compliance Considerations Figure Technologies has engaged extensively with regulatory authorities during OPEN’s development phase. The platform incorporates compliance features directly into its blockchain protocol, including automated regulatory reporting and investor verification systems. This approach addresses concerns about anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements in decentralized finance applications. The Securities and Exchange Commission has monitored blockchain-based securities platforms for several years. OPEN’s design appears responsive to previous regulatory guidance about investor protection and market integrity. However, full regulatory acceptance will require demonstrated performance under real market conditions. International regulatory coordination presents additional challenges given varying securities laws across jurisdictions. Expert Perspectives on Market Transformation Financial technology experts emphasize OPEN’s potential to bridge traditional and decentralized finance. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Director of Blockchain Research at Stanford University, notes: “This represents the most sophisticated integration of blockchain technology into regulated securities markets to date. The direct ownership model addresses fundamental limitations of previous tokenization approaches.” Industry practitioners highlight practical implications. Michael Chen, Chief Investment Officer at Horizon Capital, observes: “The ability to collateralize shares directly on-chain could transform margin lending and portfolio financing. This creates new opportunities for both investors and borrowers while potentially reducing systemic risks through transparent leverage tracking.” These expert insights underscore OPEN’s significance beyond technological novelty. The platform addresses genuine market inefficiencies while maintaining regulatory compliance—a balance that has challenged previous blockchain financial applications. Implementation Timeline and Adoption Prospects Figure Technologies plans a phased rollout of OPEN throughout 2025. Initial implementation focuses on select blue-chip stocks with gradual expansion to broader market indices. The company has partnered with several financial institutions for testing and validation before full public availability. This cautious approach reflects lessons from previous fintech launches that moved too quickly without adequate infrastructure. Adoption will likely follow a pattern observed with other financial innovations: institutional early adoption followed by gradual retail accessibility. The platform’s success depends on multiple factors including regulatory approvals, market participant acceptance, and technological reliability. Historical parallels with electronic trading adoption in the 1990s suggest potential resistance from established intermediaries alongside enthusiastic embrace from innovative market participants. Conclusion Figure Technologies’ OPEN platform represents a transformative development in on-chain stock issuance and lending infrastructure. By enabling direct ownership and peer-to-peer transactions without traditional intermediaries, the system potentially increases market efficiency while reducing costs. The platform’s compliance-focused design addresses regulatory concerns that have hindered previous blockchain financial applications. As financial markets continue evolving toward digital infrastructure, OPEN provides a compelling model for integrating blockchain technology with regulated securities. The coming months will reveal whether this innovative approach gains sufficient adoption to reshape equity market fundamentals permanently. FAQs Q1: How does OPEN differ from cryptocurrency exchanges offering tokenized stocks? OPEN issues direct legal ownership of shares on its blockchain, unlike synthetic tokens that merely track prices. This provides genuine shareholder rights including voting and dividends rather than derivative exposure. Q2: What security measures protect investors on the OPEN platform? The platform employs enterprise-grade security including multi-signature wallets, institutional custody solutions, and real-time monitoring. All transactions maintain immutable audit trails on the Provenance Blockchain. Q3: Can retail investors participate in stock lending through OPEN? Yes, the platform potentially democratizes securities lending by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions without minimum size requirements typically imposed by traditional lending desks. Q4: How does OPEN ensure regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions? The platform incorporates compliance features directly into its blockchain protocol, including automated regulatory reporting and investor verification systems designed to meet international standards. Q5: What happens if Figure Technologies experiences financial difficulties? The platform’s decentralized architecture means the blockchain network operates independently from the company’s financial status. Ownership records remain secure on the distributed ledger regardless of corporate developments.

Volume surged to $36.4 billion, up more than 82%. Price looks healthy, yet it still lags the explosive growth under the hood. Ethereum now faces a familiar question. Does usage eventually force price to catch up? Right now, that gap looks impossible to ignore. Network Activity Reaches Record Highs Ethereum’s on-chain metrics just printed historic levels. Santiment data shows 393,500 new wallets created in a single day. That marks an all-time high. Over the past three weeks, wallet creation averaged more than 327,000 per day. Nansen data confirms the trend. Monthly active addresses jumped 45% to 12.4 million while transaction counts climbed 23% to over 55 million. Only Linea grew faster over the same period. Ethereum also tightened its grip on high-value sectors: 76% dominance in DeFi 63% dominance in real-world assets This happened despite growing competition from Layer 1s and Layer 2s. The Fusaka upgrade, rising stablecoin usage, and renewed RWA demand all played a role. Two more upgrades, Glamsterdam and Hegota, sit ahead and both aim to boost speed and security. Usage looks alive, and price still plays catch-up. CLARITY Act Could Change the Game The next catalyst comes from Washington. The U.S. Senate is set to mark up the CLARITY Act this week. The bill aims to draw a clear line between the SEC and CFTC. Many see it as a path to classify ETH as a digital commodity. That matters. For years, Ethereum lived under regulatory fog. Unclear rules capped institutional conviction, and clarity could flip that script. Would large capital finally treat ETH like digital infrastructure rather than a legal risk? Markets rarely wait for certainty. They front-run it. Institutions and Corporations Load Up on ETH Capital already moves quietly. Bitmine Immersion Technologies now holds 4.168 million ETH. That equals about 3.45% of total supply. Nearly 1.26 million ETH sits staked and Bitmine aims for 5% supply ownership in months, not years. The company also holds nearly $14 billion in crypto and cash. Tom Lee urges shareholders to support a strategy focused on growing ETH per share. Bitmine remains the largest fresh-money buyer of ETH globally. Between Jan 5th and Jan 11th, Bitmine bought 24,266 $ETH($75.59M) , marking its lowest weekly purchase on record. This trend mirrors Bitcoin’s corporate phase, and Ethereum now enters its own version. Technical Structure Sets the Tone Technicals matter more than headlines. ETH trades near a $3,350 known supply zone. A recent CPI-driven rally helped ETH reclaim rising trend support and now, higher lows remain intact. Key levels define the roadmap: Break and close above $3,350 opens $3,600 Holding $3,600 sets sights on $4,000 Failure keeps ETH range-bound Source: TradingView Standard Chartered sees ETH at $40,000 by 2030. That sounds extreme, but the logic hinges on capital retention, staking growth, and long-duration holding. Without that, price spikes fade, but with all that, supply tightens . $ETH Price Prediction Table Year Min Price Avg Price Max Price 2026 $3,800 $5,200 $7,500 2027 $5,500 $7,200 $9,800 2028 $7,800 $10,500 $14,000 2029 $11,500 $16,000 $22,000 2030 $18,000 $28,000 $40,000 2040 $95,000 $140,000 $220,000 Final Thoughts on ETH’s Long-Term Outlook Ethereum does not lack demand. It lacks price recognition. Record activity, regulatory momentum, and aggressive corporate accumulation change the equation, and the CLARITY Act could remove the final mental barrier.

This announcement, made from Wilmington, Delaware, on February 14, 2025, marks a critical step in the protracted bankruptcy proceedings of the former cryptocurrency giant. Furthermore, the estate has concurrently submitted a pivotal revised proposal to the bankruptcy court. This proposal seeks to reduce the substantial reserve currently held for disputed claims, a move that could potentially unlock hundreds of millions of dollars for creditor distribution if approved. FTX Creditor Repayment: The March 31 Distribution Details The FTX debtor estate has provided clear parameters for the upcoming distribution. Only creditors formally registered on the estate’s official claims ledger as of the February 14, 2025, announcement date will qualify for this specific payment round. This cutoff ensures administrative clarity for the complex distribution process. The estate will utilize the established claims reconciliation data to calculate individual payout amounts. Consequently, creditors should expect communications regarding their specific distribution calculations in the weeks preceding the March 31 date. This repayment phase follows earlier, smaller interim distributions and represents a more substantial wave of returned capital. The process involves converting recovered assets—which include a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies, venture investments, and cash from asset sales—into a distributable format. Importantly, distributions are typically made in U.S. dollars based on asset valuations at specific petition date prices, not current market values, a standard practice in bankruptcy cases. Understanding the Revised Disputed Claims Proposal Parallel to the repayment announcement, the FTX estate filed a critical motion with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This motion proposes a strategic reduction to the multi-billion dollar reserve fund specifically earmarked for contested or disputed creditor claims. In any large bankruptcy, estates must set aside capital to cover potential validations of claims that are initially challenged. The FTX estate, advised by restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal, now argues that the initial reserve is excessively conservative. The estate’s analysis, based on months of claim reviews and negotiations, suggests a significant portion of disputed claims lack merit or are vastly overstated. By refining the methodology for estimating potential liabilities, the estate seeks court permission to reallocate a portion of this reserved capital to the general creditor repayment pool. A successful approval would directly increase the total dollar amount available for all creditors in this and future distributions. The court is expected to review this proposal in a hearing scheduled for early March 2025. Expert Analysis on the Bankruptcy Strategy Bankruptcy and restructuring experts view these twin announcements as a coordinated strategy to accelerate creditor recoveries. “The concurrent filing of the repayment date and the reserve reduction motion is a classic, efficient restructuring tactic,” explains a veteran bankruptcy attorney familiar with mega-cases, who spoke on background. “It signals to the court and creditor body that the estate is progressing from the reconciliation phase to the meaningful distribution phase. Reducing the disputed claims reserve is often a point of negotiation, but it’s a necessary step to free up liquidity for paying accepted claims.” Historical data from other major financial bankruptcies, such as Lehman Brothers or MF Global, show that successful reserve adjustments often lead to increased interim payout percentages. For FTX creditors, many of whom are retail investors, this proposal represents a tangible hope for improved recovery rates beyond initial pessimistic projections. The estate’s previous communications estimated a potential recovery range, and this motion aims to push actual distributions toward the higher end of that spectrum. The Broader Context: Timeline of the FTX Collapse and Recovery To fully grasp the significance of the March 31 date, one must consider the lengthy timeline since FTX’s collapse in November 2022. The exchange’s catastrophic failure, triggered by a liquidity crisis and allegations of massive misuse of customer funds, initiated one of the most complex and watched bankruptcy cases in financial history. Under the leadership of CEO John J. Ray III and his restructuring team, the estate embarked on a global asset recovery mission. Key milestones leading to this point include: November 2022: FTX files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 2023: Intensive asset recovery, including sale of venture holdings (like Anthropic shares) and liquidation of crypto assets. Late 2024: Court approval of a finalized customer claim reconciliation process and the first interim distribution plan. February 2025: Announcement of the March 31 repayment date and disputed claims reserve motion. The estate’s efforts have recovered a surprisingly large portion of assets, though the final recovery percentage for creditors remains dependent on ongoing asset sales, litigation recoveries, and the resolution of government claims. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Industry and Regulatory Landscape The FTX bankruptcy continues to cast a long shadow over the cryptocurrency industry. Each procedural step, especially one as creditor-focused as a repayment date, is scrutinized for its implications on market confidence and regulatory policy. Successful, orderly distributions help demonstrate that even in a catastrophic failure, legal bankruptcy frameworks can function to protect some creditor interests. This process is being watched closely by regulators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as they formulate new rules for digital asset exchanges. Moreover, the case underscores the critical importance of exchange transparency, asset segregation, and robust corporate governance—lessons the entire industry is still internalizing. The fact that creditor repayments are proceeding, however slowly, provides a stark contrast to earlier eras where similar collapses resulted in total loss for users. Conclusion The announcement of the March 31, 2025, FTX creditor repayment date is a pivotal moment in the long and arduous journey toward resolution for over a million claimants. It represents the transition from theoretical recovery estimates to actual capital distribution. The accompanying court proposal to reduce the disputed claims reserve further highlights the estate’s focus on maximizing creditor returns. While the process remains complex and recoveries will be partial, this scheduled distribution is a concrete step toward financial redress. The entire cryptocurrency ecosystem will observe this FTX creditor repayment as a benchmark for post-collapse accountability and the efficacy of bankruptcy proceedings in the digital asset age. FAQs Q1: Who is eligible for the FTX repayment on March 31? Only creditors whose claims were officially registered and recorded on the FTX estate’s claims ledger as of February 14, 2025, are eligible for this specific distribution round. Q2: How will the disputed claims reserve proposal affect my repayment? If the bankruptcy court approves the estate’s motion to reduce the reserve fund for disputed claims, the freed-up capital will be added to the total pool available for distribution. This could potentially increase the dollar amount or percentage that every eligible creditor receives. Q3: Will I be repaid in cryptocurrency or U.S. dollars? Based on the approved bankruptcy plan, distributions are made in U.S. dollars. The value of your claim is calculated based on the asset values as of the petition date in November 2022, not current market prices. Q4: What happens if I missed the February 14 claims registration deadline? If you have a claim but did not register by the February 14, 2025, bar date set for this distribution, you will not be included in the March 31 payout. You may need to file a late claim petition with the court, which is subject to approval, for inclusion in future distributions. Q5: Where can I find official updates about my FTX claim status? All official communications and claim details are managed through the court-appointed claims agent, Kroll. Creditors should refer to the official FTX bankruptcy website (cases.ra.kroll.com/FTX) for portals, updates, and formal notices. Avoid unofficial sources for sensitive claim information.

Blockchain security firm BlockSec Phalcon disclosed the second attack on X , revealing that attackers had exploited a new vulnerability in the same contract they had targeted just days earlier. The security firm noted that “while the loss is not large, the interesting part is that a new attack surface appeared: a reentrancy vulnerability.” The attacker employed a two-step process involving Futureswap’s mandatory three-day cooldown period to systematically drain funds. According to Phalcon, BlockSec’s threat detection platform, the attacker first re-entered the 0x5308fcb1 function before the contract updated its internal accounting. Then the “attacker minted an excessive amount of LP tokens relative to the assets actually deposited.” After waiting out the withdrawal cooldown, the attacker burned the illicitly minted tokens to redeem the underlying collateral, effectively siphoning assets from the protocol along with the profit. Futureswap is hacked for the third time in one month The latest attack comes a few days after the platform lost over $395,000 in an exploit that popped up BlockSec’s Phalcon’s radar. The attackers that participated in that exploit stole the funds through multiple changePosition operations. That incident appeared related to unexpected stableBalance accounting changes during position updates that later allowed USDC to be released when removing collateral. Futureswap also suffered a governance attack in December 2025 that netted attackers at least $830,000. In that incident, hackers used a flash loan to temporarily borrow governance tokens, gaining voting power to pass a malicious proposal that transferred funds from the protocol. Futureswap has so far lost over $1 million cumulatively across three separate attacks that have leveraged different vulnerabilities on the platform. Legacy DeFi protocols under siege The Futureswap incidents form part of the over $27 million lost to hackers who continue to target legacy DeFi platforms into 2026. Other Arbitrum-based protocols have suffered similar fates in recent weeks. In early January, USDGambit and TLP lost $1.5 million when attackers gained admin access and deployed malicious smart contracts. TMX Tribe suffered a $1.4 million exploit, while the IPOR Fusion USDC vault lost $336,000 through a legacy contract vulnerability, though it has pledged to fully reimburse affected users. Despite the security breaches that have hit protocols based on Arbitrum, the layer-2 blockchain still holds over $3.1 billion in total value locked in DeFi, which some analysts may say is part of what makes it an attractive target for attackers. The network has remained near the top position among Ethereum Layer-2 solutions in terms of total value locked since launching in 2021. What’s going on at the Futureswap camp? Nobody on the Futureswap team has released a statement concerning the exploits. The last post on the platform’s X account dates to 2023, and the protocol is said to have been last audited in 2021. The case raises difficult questions about responsibility when protocols are abandoned but continue to hold user funds. Security experts recommend that teams either properly deprecate and sunset legacy contracts or conduct fresh security audits and verify source code. Users, meanwhile, are advised to withdraw assets from older contracts showing signs of abandonment.

A breakout above $14.25 could lead to further gains, with $14.50 as the next target. LINK’s consistently higher highs and lows signal a strong short-term bullish trend. On 14 January 2026, Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $14.24, marking a 4.85% increase. The price is approaching resistance at $14.25, with support at $13.53, signaling strong bullish momentum and the potential for further gains. Traders are closely watching the $14.25 level for a possible breakout or retracement. Chainlink daily price chart: LINK bullish momentum strengthens as price approaches key resistance The recent 4.85% increase indicates strong buying pressure, and the asset’s ability to remain above the $13.53 support level signals the strength of the bullish trend. The $14.25 resistance is now the key level to watch, as breaking above it could open up further gains. LINK’s daily price movement shows that the asset is gaining traction, with significant interest from buyers pushing the price closer to the resistance. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The RSI shows that LINK is not yet overbought, which could indicate more room for upward movement. The MACD remains in positive territory, confirming that the momentum is still favoring the bulls. A successful break above $14.25 may propel LINK to the next resistance at $14.50, providing a clearer path for further gains. However, traders should watch for any signs of weakness at these levels, as a rejection near $14.25 could lead to a correction. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK eyeing $14.25 resistance as bullish momentum continues The 4-hour chart of Chainlink reveals a clear ascending pattern, with LINK recently breaking above the $13.80 mark, which was acting as a significant short-term resistance. The recent uptrend is supported by consistent buying volume, and LINK is now testing the $14.25 resistance area. The price action shows a clean upward movement, with higher highs and higher lows, suggesting a strong bullish trend in the short term. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The RSI is in the middle of the neutral zone, indicating that LINK has not yet reached overbought conditions. The MACD shows bullish momentum, confirming that the current trend is likely to continue, barring any sudden reversals. If LINK can break above the $14.25 resistance on the 4-hour chart, the next immediate target would be $14.50, with support at $13.80. Any pullbacks would likely find support around the $13.53 level.

Chainlink is positioned at a decisive level as price action tightens near the $14.25 resistance. Sustained buying interest and the ability to hold above the $13.53 support zone suggest that bulls remain in control, keeping the near-term bias tilted to the upside. A confirmed move above resistance could allow LINK to extend gains toward the $14.50 area. However, failure to break through $14.25 may trigger short-term consolidation or a pullback, with $13.80 and $13.53 acting as key downside buffers. Market participants are likely to remain cautious at these levels, watching whether momentum is strong enough to support continuation or if profit-taking emerges near resistance. Is Chainlink a good investment? Chainlink’s current bullish momentum and its ability to hold above key support levels suggest a positive outlook in the near term. The price has consistently shown strength by breaking above short-term resistance levels, and a potential breakout above $14.25 could signal further growth, targeting $14.50 or more. The asset’s solid technical foundation, backed by increased buying pressure and a favorable market environment, makes it a promising candidate for traders looking for short-term gains. However, it’s important to consider the risks. A failure to break through the $14.25 resistance could lead to consolidation or a retracement, with key levels at $13.80 and $13.53 acting as downside support. Investors should monitor price action closely and be prepared for potential fluctuations. For those with a higher risk tolerance, Chainlink could be a strong investment in the short term, but caution is advised in case the price fails to break resistance and experiences a pullback. Why is the LINK price up today? The recent 4.85% increase in Chainlink’s (LINK) price can be attributed to strong market sentiment and sustained buying pressure. Traders and investors are showing increased confidence in LINK as it holds above key support levels, particularly the $13.53 mark. The price movement suggests that there is significant interest from buyers, driving the price closer to the critical $14.25 resistance. Additionally, the bullish trend is supported by the broader market conditions, with Chainlink positioning itself well for potential gains in the short term, especially if the resistance at $14.25 is broken. This upward movement is also likely driven by positive sentiment in the crypto market and Chainlink’s continued role as a key player in the decentralized oracle network. Recent news Bitwise has secured approval to list its spot Chainlink ETF (CLNK) on NYSE Arca, set to launch this week and offer direct LINK exposure without token custody.

This decision concludes a nearly two-year probe that began in 2023 and provides crucial regulatory clarity for privacy-focused digital assets. The SEC’s conclusion marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for projects emphasizing transactional privacy and regulatory compliance. SEC Zcash Investigation Concludes with Regulatory Clarity The Securities and Exchange Commission formally notified the Zcash Foundation of its decision this week. Consequently, the regulatory agency will not pursue enforcement actions against the organization. This development follows extensive documentation reviews and multiple communications between foundation representatives and SEC officials. The investigation initially examined whether Zcash transactions or the foundation’s activities violated federal securities laws. However, regulators ultimately determined that enforcement action was unwarranted in this specific case. Industry analysts immediately recognized the decision’s importance. “This represents a meaningful precedent,” noted cryptocurrency legal expert Dr. Amanda Chen of Stanford University. “The SEC’s approach demonstrates careful consideration of technological nuances rather than blanket application of existing frameworks.” Furthermore, the decision arrives during ongoing global debates about cryptocurrency regulation. Many countries currently struggle to balance innovation with consumer protection concerns. Background and Timeline of the Regulatory Examination The SEC initiated its examination of the Zcash Foundation in early 2023. This action followed increased regulatory scrutiny of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies globally. Zcash, launched in 2016, utilizes zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKs. This technology enables transaction verification without revealing sender, receiver, or amount details. The foundation, established in 2017, supports protocol development, research, and community initiatives. Key investigation timeline points include: March 2023: SEC opens preliminary inquiry into Zcash Foundation activities August 2023: Foundation receives formal document requests from regulators January 2024: Foundation submits comprehensive response addressing regulatory concerns October 2024: SEC conducts follow-up interviews with foundation leadership March 2025: SEC concludes investigation with no enforcement action recommendation Throughout this period, the foundation maintained transparent communication with regulators. They consistently emphasized their non-profit, research-focused mission. Additionally, they highlighted their commitment to lawful operation within existing regulatory frameworks. Comparative Analysis of Cryptocurrency Regulatory Actions The SEC’s decision contrasts with other recent cryptocurrency enforcement actions. This comparison reveals evolving regulatory approaches to different blockchain technologies. The table below illustrates key differences between recent SEC cryptocurrency cases: Case/Project Year SEC Action Primary Concern Zcash Foundation 2025 No enforcement action Privacy technology implementation Ripple Labs 2020-2023 Ongoing litigation Securities classification of XRP Telegram TON 2019 Emergency action, settlement Unregistered securities offering Coinbase lending 2021 Wells notice, then closure Lending product registration This comparative analysis suggests regulators increasingly differentiate between various cryptocurrency aspects. Specifically, they distinguish between token distribution methods and underlying technology implementations. Legal scholars observe this nuanced approach may signal more sophisticated regulatory understanding. Implications for Privacy-Focused Cryptocurrency Projects The SEC’s decision carries substantial implications for privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency technologies. First, it provides regulatory breathing room for legitimate privacy research and development. Projects implementing zero-knowledge proofs and similar technologies may find clearer operational pathways. Second, it establishes that privacy features alone do not automatically trigger securities law violations. The technology’s implementation context and organizational structure appear more significant to regulators. “This outcome validates responsible development approaches,” explained Zcash Foundation Executive Director Josh Swihart. “We’ve consistently prioritized transparency with regulators while advancing privacy technology.” The foundation’s structure as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization likely influenced the SEC’s assessment. Unlike for-profit entities, the foundation doesn’t control Zcash’s monetary policy or token distribution. Industry reactions have been predominantly positive. Major cryptocurrency exchanges reported increased Zcash trading volumes following the announcement. Meanwhile, privacy technology developers expressed renewed confidence in their research directions. However, compliance experts caution against overgeneralization. “This isn’t a blanket approval of all privacy coins,” warned former SEC attorney Michael Selig. “Each project faces unique regulatory considerations based on specific facts and circumstances.” Technical and Legal Distinctions in Privacy Implementations The investigation’s closure highlights important technical distinctions regulators now recognize. Zcash’s selective disclosure capability differentiates it from fully anonymous systems. Users can provide viewing keys for audit or compliance purposes while maintaining default privacy. This functionality addresses legitimate regulatory concerns about illicit financial flows. Additionally, the foundation’s focus on protocol development rather than token promotion proved significant. Legal experts identify several factors contributing to the favorable outcome: Non-profit status: The foundation’s educational and research mission Transparent engagement: Proactive communication with regulators Technology design: Built-in compliance features like viewing keys Historical context: Zcash’s established track record since 2016 Industry cooperation: Collaboration with compliance technology providers These elements collectively demonstrated the project’s commitment to lawful operation. They also distinguished Zcash from projects primarily focused on token speculation. Global Regulatory Context and Future Implications The SEC’s decision occurs within a complex global regulatory landscape. Various jurisdictions approach privacy cryptocurrencies differently. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, implemented in 2024, includes specific provisions for privacy assets. Meanwhile, Japan’s Financial Services Agency maintains strict registration requirements for all cryptocurrency exchanges. These international approaches create a patchwork of regulatory standards. Financial technology analyst Rebecca Torres observes broader implications. “This decision may influence international regulatory discussions,” she noted. “Other jurisdictions often consider SEC actions when formulating their own policies.” Indeed, several Asian financial regulators previously expressed concerns about privacy technologies. The SEC’s measured approach could encourage similarly nuanced evaluations elsewhere. Looking forward, the decision may accelerate institutional adoption of privacy technologies. Financial institutions have historically hesitated to engage with privacy-focused assets due to regulatory uncertainty. Clearer guidelines could facilitate responsible integration of these technologies into traditional finance. Banking compliance departments particularly value Zcash’s selective disclosure features for audit trails. Conclusion The SEC’s conclusion of its Zcash Foundation investigation without enforcement action represents a landmark moment for cryptocurrency regulation. This decision provides much-needed clarity for privacy-focused blockchain projects operating within legal frameworks. It demonstrates regulators’ growing sophistication in evaluating complex cryptographic technologies. Furthermore, it validates the importance of transparent engagement between cryptocurrency projects and regulatory agencies. The SEC Zcash investigation outcome suggests a path forward for innovative technologies that prioritize both privacy and compliance. As the cryptocurrency industry matures, such regulatory clarity becomes increasingly essential for sustainable growth and mainstream adoption. FAQs Q1: What was the SEC investigating regarding the Zcash Foundation? The SEC examined whether the Zcash Foundation’s activities or Zcash transactions violated federal securities laws, focusing particularly on how the privacy technology was implemented and whether it constituted an unregistered security. Q2: Why did the SEC decide against enforcement action? Regulators determined enforcement was unwarranted after reviewing the foundation’s non-profit structure, transparent engagement, technology design with compliance features, and established track record since 2016. Q3: How does this decision affect other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies? While not creating binding precedent, the decision suggests regulators may evaluate privacy technologies based on their specific implementations and organizational structures rather than applying blanket prohibitions. Q4: What are zk-SNARKs and why are they important to this case? zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) are cryptographic proofs that allow transaction verification without revealing sensitive data. This technology enables Zcash’s privacy features while permitting selective disclosure for compliance. Q5: Will this decision make Zcash more accessible on U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges? Many exchanges previously limited Zcash trading due to regulatory uncertainty. The SEC’s decision may encourage more platforms to offer Zcash services, though each exchange will conduct its own compliance assessment.

Pi Drops & SHIB Slips",https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-0-003-window-closes-on-january-26-with-1566-upside-potential-pi-drops-shib-slips/,"Early 2026 is drawing a sharp line across the crypto space, separating projects with momentum from those losing strength. The pi coin price is now near $0.209 after falling roughly 87% from its previous high, while the shiba inu price sits close to $0.00015 even as supply reduction efforts continue. These figures show how difficult it has been for some well-known names to regain steady trust and price strength. Many holders are now watching closely, unsure which direction these assets will move next. On the other side of the market, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining attention as its presale approaches a fixed end date on January 26 at a price of $0.003. With more than $442 million already secured and a confirmed future price of $0.05, the numbers are clear. For anyone searching for the best crypto to buy today, BlockDAG offers a rare setup with defined pricing, known timing, and a clear difference between today’s cost and future market value. Pi Network Faces Pressure After Sharp Decline Recent months have been difficult for Pi Network following its appearance on major exchanges. At present, the Pi coin price is around $0.209, far below its February 2025 high of $2.98. This steep 87% drop has raised serious questions about whether Pi can regain stability in the near term. Many holders remain cautious as the price struggles to hold firm support. Compared with other digital assets, Pi has shown weak reactions to broader market moves. During periods when Bitcoin moves higher, Pi often fails to keep pace. When the wider market turns down, Pi tends to slide even faster. This uneven behavior has made some people rethink whether it fits their search for the best crypto to buy today. Further concern comes from a large scheduled coin release expected in January, which could add extra pressure on price levels. While the Pi Core Team has shared plans stretching into 2026, many details are still missing. For now, the $0.209 area acts as an important support zone. Supporters continue to argue that real use and adoption may define Pi’s future value more than short-term price action alone. Shiba Inu Relies on Supply Cuts to Spark Interest Shiba Inu entered 2026 with a major supply reduction move, removing over $172 million worth of coins in a single day. This action pushed the burn rate up by more than 10,700%, lowering total supply to about 585.29 trillion. The goal behind this effort is simple: reduce supply in hopes of lifting the shiba inu price over time. Despite these aggressive cuts, SHIB is still trading near $0.00015. Even with fewer coins available, price movement has remained limited. While the team’s actions show commitment, higher prices will only follow if demand increases. With hundreds of trillions of coins still in circulation, the path forward depends on whether this strategy can attract steady buying interest and long-term confidence. BlockDAG Final Countdown as Presale Ends January 26 Momentum around BlockDAG continues to build as its presale reaches its final stage. The current price of $0.003 will end permanently on January 26, with no resets, no extensions, and no second chances. More than $442 million has already been raised, and only about 3.2 billion coins remain at this level, making the closing window very clear. The math behind BlockDAG is easy to understand. At $0.003 today and a confirmed future price of $0.05, the gap equals a 16.67× difference. That works out to a +1,566% move from the current presale price to the future market price. For those reviewing numbers while searching for the best crypto to buy today, this kind of fixed upside with a known deadline is uncommon. Another key factor is BlockDAG’s exchange rollout plan. More than 20 platforms are already confirmed, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com. These platforms are prepared to activate shortly after the presale closes, allowing access across many regions right away. Additional large and US-focused platforms are also lined up behind the initial group. Having multiple exchanges active from the start offers clear benefits. It supports smoother trading, broader reach, and faster access for buyers around the globe. Many presales leave people waiting for weeks without clarity. BlockDAG avoids that delay by locking in its exchange access as the presale ends. With January 26 approaching fast and the $0.003 price disappearing for good, the remaining time is limited. Anyone weighing the best crypto to buy today using clear data, fixed pricing, and confirmed structure can see how quickly this window is closing. Final Say At $0.209, the Pi coin price remains under pressure from future coin releases and an unclear near term path. The shiba inu price near $0.00015 depends heavily on whether supply cuts can turn into lasting demand. Both options carry open questions and ongoing uncertainty. BlockDAG offers defined figures instead of guesses. The current $0.003 presale price shifts to $0.05 after the presale ends, creating a known 16.67× difference supported by more than 20 confirmed exchanges. While Pi and SHIB holders wait for change, BlockDAG buyers are acting on fixed numbers and a firm deadline. With the presale ending January 26 and only 3.2 billion coins left, those seeking the best crypto to buy today are moving quickly before this chance disappears forever.

57164671,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1425881,1768413757,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/57164671.jpeg,"Ethereum Sets Record With 393,600 New Wallets in One Day",https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-sets-record-with-393600-new-wallets-in-one-day/,"On Sunday, January 11, 2026, the Ethereum network saw an unprecedented 393,600 new wallets created in a 24-hour period, setting a new all-time high for daily user growth. This historic spike in network adoption came even as Ethereum’s native ETH token is trading below its 2025 peak, suggesting a powerful wave of new users is being driven by utility and upgrades rather than speculative price action alone. A Network Activity Explosion According to data from Santiment, Ethereum averaged more than 327,000 new addresses daily across the past week, culminating in Sunday’s record. The analytics firm linked the rise to a mix of technical upgrades, practical usage, and shifting market mood. According to them, one major factor is the Fusaka upgrade, deployed in early December 2025. The update changed how data is processed on Ethereum and lowered the cost for Layer-2 networks to post data back to the main chain. Lower fees and smoother interactions made it easier for users to engage with decentralized apps, rollups, and on-chain services, often starting with the creation of a new wallet. Stablecoin usage has also played a central role. Santiment noted that Ethereum processed about $8 trillion in stablecoin transfers during the fourth quarter of 2025, the highest quarterly figure on record. Such volumes point to the blockchain’s role in payments and settlement, drawing in users who need wallets to hold or move dollar-pegged tokens. Social data suggests fresh participants have been entering the ecosystem since December, even while ETH traded sideways. Santiment added that sentiment among holders shifted from negative to neutral or slightly positive in mid-December, a change that often lines up with increased retail onboarding around the turn of the year. Price Action Firms Up as Traders Rebuild Positions At the time of writing, ETH was trading around $3,300, up about 6% in the last 24 hours and more than 2% over seven days. However, the move trails the wider crypto market, which gained close to 4% in the same weekly window, showing the asset has not led the latest market bounce. Meanwhile, on a 30-day view, ETH is up about 6%, while it remains roughly 33% below its all-time high near $4,900 set in August 2025. Traders on X have focused on nearby technical levels. Ted Pillows wrote that ETH clearing $3,300 puts attention on $3,450, while warning that failure there could pull prices back. Another analyst, CW, flagged sell pressure near $3,700. Derivatives data has also added context to the move. Analysis firm Arab Chain reported that Ethereum open interest on Binance climbed to about $8.6 billion, the highest since October 9, 2025. The rise follows a steep reset in the same month, when liquidations pushed open interest below $7 billion. That backdrop lines up with a previous analysis that highlighted a bullish crossover on Ethereum’s higher-timeframe charts and growing attention on the ETH/BTC pair. Together with record wallet creation, the data paints a picture of an ecosystem seeing deeper engagement, even before a clear breakout in price takes shape.

XRP appears to be entering one of those pivotal phases, where structural price action, volume dynamics, and investor sentiment converge. Observers now point to a medium-term target that, until recently, many considered ambitious—but evolving market conditions suggest it may soon become attainable. In a recent post on X, crypto commentator CRYPTO CAPTAIN highlighted an institutional investor’s medium-term projection of XRP reaching $12 . He emphasized that technical patterns, combined with supportive market fundamentals, now validate this outlook. The confirmation of the $12 target underscores growing confidence in XRP’s trajectory, signaling that the asset could soon test new levels of market interest and price discovery. Technical Structure Supports the Target XRP has maintained critical support zones while forming higher lows, a pattern that technical analysts recognize as a foundation for sustained upward momentum. Volume trends reinforce this narrative, showing persistent accumulation across major exchanges and derivatives platforms. BOOM #XRP 12$ confirmed https://t.co/WhJkXsULn1 — CRYPTO CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) January 13, 2026 According to CRYPTO CAPTAIN, the confluence of these patterns now provides a structural basis for the $12 medium-term target , suggesting that XRP has cleared key obstacles for further appreciation. Historically, XRP has demonstrated rapid price acceleration once it consolidates above essential support levels. These consolidation phases reset momentum indicators and prepare the asset for subsequent rallies, particularly when trading volumes rise alongside market interest. Institutional Engagement Adds Credibility The institutional investor cited by CRYPTO CAPTAIN highlights the growing role of large-scale participation in XRP’s trajectory. Institutional activity tends to bring market stability and signals confidence in both technical structure and long-term viability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By evaluating liquidity, regulatory compliance, and market infrastructure, institutional participants often set benchmarks that retail and algorithmic traders follow, amplifying price movement once critical levels are approached. XRP’s adoption in regulated markets, combined with its liquidity and network depth, positions it as an attractive option for medium- to long-term institutional strategies. This involvement increases the likelihood of upward follow-through, particularly as broader market sentiment remains constructive. Market Conditions Align XRP’s price action occurs amid a broader bullish environment for altcoins, where positive sentiment, regional demand, and regulatory clarity converge. These conditions enhance the probability that XRP will sustain momentum, supporting ambitious medium-term targets. The $12 projection aligns with prior cycles where XRP leveraged structural consolidation and market breadth to deliver outsized gains. Looking Ahead CRYPTO CAPTAIN’s analysis confirms that XRP’s technical and institutional signals now align with the $12 medium-term price target. While markets never guarantee outcomes, the convergence of price structure, trading volume, and institutional engagement strengthens the bullish thesis. XRP’s next critical phase may be defined by its ability to maintain momentum as it approaches these elevated levels.

57165022,https://invezz.com/?p=3032025,1768413926,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Will Bitcoin soon breach the $100K mark? What the signs are saying,https://invezz.com/news/2026/01/14/will-bitcoin-soon-breach-the-100k-mark-what-the-signs-are-saying/,"Bitcoin prices were trading around $97,000 on Wednesday after posting a sharp rally in the previous session, supported by improving risk appetite, strong institutional inflows, and a constructive technical setup. The world’s largest cryptocurrency rose more than 4.5% on Tuesday, closing above a key resistance zone as investors responded positively to softer-than-expected US inflation data. The move helped revive demand for risk assets broadly, with Bitcoin benefiting alongside equities and other higher-beta investments. Institutional interest has also strengthened meaningfully this week. According to data from Farside Investors, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded net inflows of $753.73 million on Tuesday, marking the largest single-day inflow since October 6. The surge in ETF demand followed several weeks of choppy flows and suggests that large investors are once again increasing exposure to Bitcoin. Market participants said that if this pace of inflows continues, it could provide sustained support for prices and help extend the current rally. The renewed demand from ETFs adds to the view that institutional participation remains a key driver of Bitcoin’s medium-term trajectory. Macro backdrop improves risk sentiment The rally followed the release of US consumer price index data on Tuesday, which showed inflation cooling more than expected. The data bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve could have greater room to ease policy later this year, a backdrop that typically supports risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. At the same time, analysts at K33 Research highlighted a series of upcoming macro and policy-related events that could act as catalysts for Bitcoin. In a report published Tuesday, the firm pointed to developments around tariffs, Federal Reserve independence, and crypto regulation as potential drivers of increased volatility. The report noted that Bitcoin’s price has lagged US equities in recent months, even as the S&P 500 continued to rally. The BTC/SPX ratio has remained locked in a three-month consolidation range, suggesting that Bitcoin’s relative performance versus stocks has been stagnant. According to K33 Research, the cluster of upcoming macro events could prompt a sharp directional move if that relationship breaks. Bitcoin’s technical indicators turn bullish From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s recent price action has improved notably. After finding support around $90,000 on January 8 — a level corresponding to a previously broken consolidation zone — the cryptocurrency stabilised and began to recover through the start of the week. On Tuesday, Bitcoin climbed more than 4% and closed above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $94,253. That retracement is measured from the April low of $74,508 to the October all-time high of $126,199. As of Wednesday, Bitcoin was trading near $95,000 to $97,000, consolidating gains above that key technical threshold. If the rally continues, traders say the next major psychological target sits at $100,000, a level Bitcoin has failed to reclaim since slipping below it on Nov. 13 last year. Momentum indicators support the bullish case. The Relative Strength Index on the daily chart stood at 65, above the neutral 50 level and trending higher, signalling strengthening bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator continues to show a bullish crossover, with rising green histogram bars above the zero line, reinforcing the positive outlook. Market participants eye $100,000 test Some market participants are increasingly confident that a test of six-figure prices could be imminent. MN Trading Capital’s Michaël van de Poppe said in a post on X on Tuesday that it was “quite clear that this is going to run to $100K in the coming week and that dips are for buying.” He added that “the bull market hasn’t died, it’s about to start.” Prediction markets also reflect growing optimism, though expectations remain mixed. According to Polymarket, Bitcoin has a 60% probability of reclaiming $100,000 by February 1 and a 23% chance of reaching $105,000. Historically, January has been a modest month for Bitcoin, delivering an average gain of 4.18% since 2013. February, by contrast, has tended to be much stronger, with average returns of 13.12%. Crypto analytics firm Santiment said that a move back toward $100,000 could reignite retail interest. “There will likely be retail FOMO creeping in if crypto’s top asset begins teasing $100K in the next few days,” the firm said in a post on X.

This development comes just days before the committee’s scheduled Thursday vote, potentially reshaping the trajectory of comprehensive crypto regulation in the United States. Digital Asset Market Clarity Act Faces Jurisdictional Challenge Senator Tim Scott articulated a clear jurisdictional position during his recent CoinDesk interview. He emphasized that the Banking Committee’s primary responsibility involves establishing market structure frameworks rather than adjudicating individual ethics matters. Consequently, Scott maintains that inserting specific ethics language about Trump’s crypto business would create an inappropriate precedent. The committee instead focuses on creating regulatory clarity for all market participants. Furthermore, Scott suggested the Senate Ethics Committee represents the proper venue for such discussions. This separation of concerns aims to preserve the legislative integrity of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. The senator acknowledged potential future discussions but stressed the current provision’s incompatibility with the bill’s core objectives. Market observers note this position reflects broader congressional debates about appropriate regulatory boundaries. Understanding the Proposed Legislation’s Framework The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act represents one of Congress’s most comprehensive attempts to establish clear cryptocurrency regulations. Lawmakers designed the legislation to address several critical areas that currently lack definitive guidance. These areas include: Jurisdictional clarity between the SEC and CFTC Consumer protection standards for digital asset exchanges Market integrity provisions preventing manipulation Innovation pathways for blockchain development Proponents argue the bill would provide necessary certainty for both industry participants and regulators. They emphasize that clear rules encourage responsible innovation while protecting investors. Conversely, critics express concerns about potential regulatory gaps or excessive burdens. The scheduled committee vote this Thursday will determine whether the legislation advances to the full Senate. Historical Context of Crypto Legislation Challenges Congressional efforts to regulate cryptocurrency have faced numerous obstacles over the past decade. Previous legislative attempts often stalled due to jurisdictional disputes, technical complexity, or political considerations. The current bill emerges amid increased regulatory scrutiny following several high-profile crypto industry failures. These events heightened congressional urgency to establish clearer frameworks. Additionally, the executive branch has pursued parallel regulatory actions through agencies like the SEC and CFTC. This creates a complex landscape where legislative clarity could resolve ongoing uncertainties. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act specifically aims to address these overlapping jurisdictions. Its progress through committee represents a critical test for bipartisan crypto regulation. Ethics Provisions and Legislative Process Complexities Senator Scott’s position highlights broader challenges in crafting targeted legislation. Ethics provisions typically require careful consideration of several factors. These factors include constitutional questions, enforcement mechanisms, and potential unintended consequences. Legislative experts note that narrowly tailored ethics rules often face constitutional challenges regarding specificity and applicability. The table below illustrates typical considerations for ethics provisions in financial legislation: Consideration Legislative Challenge Potential Solution Specificity Avoiding overly broad language Clear definitions and scope limitations Enforcement Determining appropriate oversight body Designating specific committee jurisdiction Constitutionality Meeting legal standards for legislation Judicial review and constitutional analysis Practicality Creating workable compliance mechanisms Phased implementation and guidance Scott’s insistence on separate ethics consideration aligns with traditional legislative practice. This approach maintains focus on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act’s primary market structure objectives. However, it also delays potential ethics discussions to a different legislative track. Expert Perspectives on Regulatory Separation Legal scholars and policy analysts generally support maintaining clear jurisdictional boundaries. Professor Elena Rodriguez, a financial regulation expert at Georgetown University, explains this perspective. “Legislative efficiency suffers when committees exceed their designated expertise areas,” Rodriguez notes. “The Banking Committee appropriately focuses on market structure, while ethics committees handle conduct standards.” This separation prevents legislative overreach and ensures specialized consideration of complex issues. Furthermore, it allows each committee to develop deeper expertise within its domain. The current debate exemplifies this institutional division of labor in practice. Observers will monitor whether this separation withstands political pressures as the bill advances. Political Dynamics and Bipartisan Cooperation The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act represents a rare bipartisan initiative in a divided Congress. Both Republican and Democratic committee members have contributed to the legislation’s development. This cooperation reflects growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s economic significance. However, introducing controversial ethics provisions could jeopardize this fragile consensus. Senator Scott’s position likely considers these political realities. Maintaining committee focus on technical regulatory matters preserves bipartisan support. Meanwhile, potentially divisive ethics discussions move to a different forum. This strategic separation may represent the most viable path forward for substantive crypto legislation. The coming days will reveal whether this approach succeeds in advancing the bill. Market Implications and Industry Response Crypto industry representatives have closely monitored the legislation’s progress. Many express support for regulatory clarity while advocating for innovation-friendly frameworks. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act generally receives positive feedback from major industry associations. These groups emphasize the importance of predictable rules for long-term investment and development. However, industry voices also caution against overly restrictive provisions. They advocate for balanced approaches that address legitimate concerns without stifling innovation. The current debate about ethics provisions illustrates how ancillary issues can complicate core legislation. Market participants generally prefer clean bills focused specifically on regulatory frameworks rather than broader political matters. Conclusion The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act stands at a critical juncture as Senator Tim Scott maintains his opposition to incorporating Trump-focused ethics provisions. This position emphasizes proper jurisdictional boundaries between legislative committees. The Banking Committee’s scheduled Thursday vote will determine whether the legislation advances with its market structure focus intact. This development highlights ongoing challenges in crafting comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation while navigating complex political and procedural landscapes. The outcome will significantly influence the future of digital asset regulation in the United States. FAQs Q1: What is the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act? The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act represents proposed legislation establishing comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations in the United States. It addresses market structure, jurisdictional clarity between regulators, and consumer protection standards. Q2: Why does Senator Scott oppose the ethics provision? Senator Scott believes ethics matters fall outside the Banking Committee’s jurisdiction. He argues such provisions should receive separate consideration by the Senate Ethics Committee to maintain legislative focus and integrity. Q3: When will the Senate Banking Committee vote on the bill? The committee scheduled its vote for this Thursday. This vote will determine whether the legislation advances to the full Senate for further consideration and potential amendments. Q4: How might this legislation affect cryptocurrency markets? The legislation could provide regulatory certainty that many market participants seek. Clear rules might encourage institutional investment while establishing consumer protections that build broader market confidence. Q5: What happens if the ethics provision remains in the bill? Including controversial ethics language could complicate bipartisan support and potentially delay the legislation. It might also raise constitutional questions about narrowly targeted provisions in broader regulatory frameworks.

This statement from one of the U.S. central bank’s most prominent crypto skeptics reignites crucial debates about digital currencies’ practical value and regulatory future. Consequently, his remarks arrive at a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency adoption and oversight. Neel Kashkari’s Cryptocurrency Criticism Explained Neel Kashkari articulated his position clearly during a banking symposium last week. He argued that cryptocurrencies fail to deliver meaningful benefits to ordinary consumers. Specifically, Kashkari highlighted several perceived deficiencies in digital asset design and function. For instance, he pointed to volatility, complexity, and limited acceptance as primary barriers. Moreover, he contrasted these shortcomings with established payment systems’ reliability and convenience. Kashkari’s perspective stems from his extensive financial regulatory experience. Previously, he served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis. This background informs his cautious approach to financial innovation. Additionally, his current role involves monitoring economic stability risks. Therefore, his skepticism reflects institutional concerns rather than personal bias alone. The Minneapolis Fed president’s comments align with his longstanding positions. He has consistently questioned cryptocurrency’s value proposition since Bitcoin’s early popularity. However, his latest remarks represent his most definitive statement yet. They also come amid growing regulatory scrutiny of digital assets nationwide. Federal Reserve’s Evolving Stance on Digital Assets The Federal Reserve System maintains diverse views on cryptocurrency among its regional presidents. For example, some officials acknowledge potential benefits in blockchain technology. Others express concerns similar to Kashkari’s. This internal diversity reflects the complex nature of digital asset evaluation. Recent Federal Reserve research provides context for Kashkari’s position. A 2024 study examined cryptocurrency usage patterns among American households. Key findings included: Limited adoption: Only 8% of U.S. adults reported using cryptocurrency for purchases Speculative dominance: 72% of cryptocurrency holders identified investment as their primary motivation Technical barriers: 41% of non-users cited complexity as their main deterrent Security concerns: 33% referenced theft and fraud risks as adoption obstacles These statistics support arguments about cryptocurrency’s limited consumer utility. However, they also reveal evolving usage patterns that merit continued observation. Historical Context of Central Bank Digital Currency Debates Kashkari’s criticism emerges alongside ongoing central bank digital currency (CBDC) discussions. The Federal Reserve has researched digital dollar possibilities for several years. Notably, this research accelerated following cryptocurrency market developments. Many central bankers distinguish between private cryptocurrencies and potential CBDCs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed this distinction recently. He emphasized that CBDCs would represent sovereign currency in digital form. Conversely, private cryptocurrencies operate outside traditional monetary systems. This fundamental difference explains varying regulatory approaches. The timeline below illustrates key Federal Reserve cryptocurrency positions: Year Development Significance 2017 First Fed research papers on blockchain Initial institutional engagement with technology 2021 Digital dollar discussion paper release Formal CBDC exploration begins 2023 FedNow instant payment system launch Traditional infrastructure modernization 2024 Enhanced cryptocurrency regulatory guidance Response to market developments and risks 2025 Kashkari’s consumer utility criticism Ongoing debate about digital asset roles Consumer Cryptocurrency Utility Analysis Evaluating cryptocurrency’s consumer value requires examining multiple dimensions. Payment functionality represents one crucial area. Currently, traditional systems process transactions more efficiently than most blockchain networks. For instance, credit card networks handle thousands of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitcoin processes approximately seven transactions per second. Transaction costs present another comparison point. Digital asset transfers sometimes incur substantial fees during network congestion. Conversely, established payment methods offer predictable, often lower costs for consumers. Additionally, consumer protections differ significantly between systems. Store of value represents cryptocurrency’s second proposed utility. Proponents argue digital assets hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. However, extreme volatility undermines this function for everyday financial planning. Consumer financial stability typically requires predictable value preservation. Financial inclusion arguments also merit examination. Some advocates suggest cryptocurrencies empower unbanked populations. Nevertheless, practical barriers like digital literacy and internet access persist. Traditional banking innovations may address these challenges more effectively. Expert Perspectives on Digital Asset Evolution Financial technology researchers offer nuanced views on cryptocurrency development. Dr. Sarah Johnson, MIT Digital Currency Initiative director, acknowledges current limitations. However, she emphasizes technological evolution potential. “Early internet protocols seemed impractical initially,” Johnson notes. “Technological maturation often follows nonlinear paths.” Consumer advocacy organizations present additional considerations. The National Consumer League recently published cryptocurrency guidance. It advises caution while acknowledging innovation possibilities. This balanced approach reflects many consumer advocates’ positions. Industry representatives counter Kashkari’s assessment differently. Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith highlights developing use cases. She references cross-border payments and digital ownership models. “Technology adoption curves typically show gradual then rapid acceptance,” Smith observes. Regulatory Implications and Future Developments Kashkari’s statements influence ongoing cryptocurrency regulation debates. Policymakers frequently reference central banker perspectives when crafting legislation. Therefore, his criticism may shape future regulatory approaches. Several jurisdictions already implement comprehensive digital asset frameworks. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides one model. It establishes consumer protection standards and operational requirements. Similarly, Japan and Singapore developed detailed regulatory regimes. These approaches balance innovation facilitation with risk management. United States regulatory development proceeds more incrementally. Multiple agencies claim cryptocurrency oversight authority. This fragmented approach creates compliance challenges. However, legislative proposals seek to clarify jurisdictional boundaries. Kashkari’s comments may inform these congressional discussions. Technological advancements could address some utility concerns. Layer-2 solutions and alternative consensus mechanisms improve scalability. Additionally, regulatory clarity might encourage responsible innovation. Therefore, cryptocurrency’s consumer value proposition remains dynamic rather than static. Conclusion Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari’s cryptocurrency criticism highlights fundamental questions about digital assets’ consumer utility. His perspective reflects institutional concerns about financial stability and consumer protection. However, technological evolution and regulatory development continue shaping cryptocurrency’s role. Consequently, ongoing evaluation remains essential as digital finance evolves. The debate between skeptics like Kashkari and innovation advocates will likely influence financial system development for years. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Neel Kashkari say about cryptocurrency? Neel Kashkari stated that cryptocurrency is fundamentally useless to consumers during a recent policy forum. He emphasized its failure to provide meaningful benefits compared to established payment systems. Q2: Does Kashkari’s view represent the entire Federal Reserve’s position? No, Federal Reserve officials maintain diverse perspectives on cryptocurrency. While some share Kashkari’s skepticism, others acknowledge potential technological benefits or support continued research into digital assets. Q3: What evidence supports the argument that cryptocurrency lacks consumer utility? Research indicates limited adoption for everyday transactions, with most holders treating cryptocurrency as speculative investments. Technical complexity, volatility, and limited merchant acceptance present additional practical barriers. Q4: How might cryptocurrency become more useful to consumers in the future? Technological improvements addressing scalability and usability, combined with clearer regulations and broader merchant acceptance, could enhance cryptocurrency’s consumer utility over time. Q5: What are the implications of Kashkari’s statements for cryptocurrency regulation? As an influential central banker, Kashkari’s views may inform legislative discussions and regulatory approaches, potentially encouraging stricter consumer protection measures in digital asset markets.

The company disclosed a $36 million in-kind convertible note agreement with institutional investor Hivemind Capital Partners, marking one of the largest Solana-denominated treasury moves by a U.S. public company this year. The deal reinforces Upexi’s strategy of building shareholder value through disciplined exposure to Solana rather than cash-based financing. Besides strengthening liquidity, the structure limits balance-sheet risk by relying on locked SOL instead of fiat proceeds. Solana Treasury Grows Past 2.4 Million Tokens Under the agreement, Upexi receives locked Solana in exchange for a 24-month convertible note with a fixed conversion price above recent market levels. Consequently, the company expects its Solana holdings to rise by roughly 12% once the transaction closes. That increase lifts the treasury above 2.4 million SOL, further separating Upexi from peers pursuing smaller or more diversified crypto allocations. Additionally, the note carries a 1% annual interest rate paid quarterly, keeping financing costs relatively low. The SOL backing the note also serves as collateral, which significantly reduces credit exposure tied to market swings. Management views this approach as a way to compound Solana exposure without immediate dilution. The conversion price of $2.39 per share sits above the stock’s prior close, aligning investor incentives with longer-term equity performance. Moreover, the private placement structure allows Upexi to avoid underwriting fees and public offering volatility. Accretion Strategy Targets Per-Share Growth Upexi continues to frame treasury expansion around per-share metrics rather than absolute token counts. The company reported a 34% rise in adjusted Solana per share during 2025, setting a benchmark for future capital actions. Hence, leadership believes the new note supports further accretion if conversion occurs. Allan Marshall, CEO of Upexi, stated, “This transaction improves Upexi’s market position in the Solana treasury space, is accretive to our adjusted Solana per share should the Note convert to equity, and has limited credit risk given the in-kind nature of the transaction.” Institutional Confidence in a Public Solana Vehicle Hivemind described the investment as a long-term conviction play on both Solana and Upexi’s execution model. The firm emphasized disciplined capital markets strategy and treasury management as key factors. Significantly, the deal required no underwriter or placement agent, reducing transaction complexity. The Solana used in the transaction will join Upexi’s treasury immediately after closing. Consequently, the company gains direct exposure without relying on synthetic instruments. Besides strengthening reserves, the structure aligns investor incentives with long-term network growth.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-14 18:21:25
