53914536,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88347,1762027525,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Solana Says Ripple and XRP Are Not On Its Level, Litecoin Responds",https://timestabloid.com/solana-says-ripple-and-xrp-are-not-on-its-level-litecoin-responds/,"A routine promotional post from Ripple has turned into one of the most talked-about exchanges in crypto this week. What started as a corporate update about institutional custody evolved into a heated debate over which blockchain deserves institutional recognition — Ripple’s XRP Ledger or Solana’s high-performance network. Ripple Prepares for Swell 2025 Ripple’s official X account announced that Swell 2025 will host top global finance leaders to discuss secure institutional custody in a tokenized world. The company confirmed speakers from Citi, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and FTI_US, all of whom will explore the growing link between blockchain and traditional finance. The post was meant to highlight Ripple’s growing influence among financial institutions and its role in tokenization. Instead, it became the spark for a public debate about status and institutional relevance in the crypto ecosystem. Jackson Knox Ignites Ripple (XRP) vs. Solana Supremacy War Crypto community figure Jackson Knox responded to Ripple’s post with strong admiration for Ripple and XRP. Correct, not on the same level: Sandy Kaul from Franklin Templeton on how to talk crypto with Solana: https://t.co/N3iqTOkWus Sandy Kaul on LinkedIn says Solana ""serve[s] as a unifying digital-era layer that can provide investors around the world with real-time, 24/7 access to… pic.twitter.com/Hps3UiK6pQ — Solana (@solana) October 31, 2025 He wrote, “If there is any!!! And I mean any doubt! That Ripple the company and XRP the asset are not on your level… Solana and Western Union.” His statement directly addressed Solana and Western Union, implying that Ripple and XRP stand far above both in institutional class and credibility. Knox’s comment may not be unconnected to recent Western Union’s choice of Solana over XRP . The post gained momentum, drawing immediate attention from Solana’s official team. Solana Counters with Institutional Backing Solana’s official handle swiftly replied, stating, “Correct, not on the same level.” The response referenced respected voices from global finance, including Franklin Templeton executives who have publicly praised Solana’s institutional readiness. Sandy Kaul, Franklin Templeton’s Head of Digital Asset Strategy, recently described Solana as “a unifying digital-era layer that provides investors 24/7 access to previously unreachable assets.” Jenny Johnson, the firm’s CEO, also called Solana “one of the first institutionally focused chains.” Solana used these endorsements to reinforce its claim of leadership in blockchain adoption among traditional finance players, presenting itself as the preferred infrastructure for institutional tokenization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Litecoin Turns Up the Humor Moments later, Litecoin’s official X account joined the discussion with a playful meme. It showed two women labeled “Solana” and “XRP” fighting, captioned “Fight, fight, fight, fight.” The humorous post quickly went viral, symbolizing the constant rivalry among crypto projects competing for relevance. Litecoin’s comment lightened the mood but also emphasized how social engagement fuels visibility and brand power across crypto networks. Fight, fight, fight, fight! pic.twitter.com/XthucNAgpo — Litecoin (@litecoin) October 31, 2025 Institutional Credibility and the Battle Ahead Beyond the memes, the exchange highlights the ongoing competition for institutional trust in blockchain finance. Ripple continues to focus on bank partnerships and tokenized settlements, positioning itself as the bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Solana, meanwhile, emphasizes speed, scalability, and validation from global asset managers. Its strategy focuses on real-time financial applications and high-performance token infrastructure. As Swell 2025 approaches , the crypto industry is watching closely. Will Ripple’s enterprise-grade strategy continue to attract banks and payment providers, or will Solana’s institutional narrative win broader acceptance among asset managers? In the modern crypto landscape, technology, partnerships, and perception now share equal weight. The latest online clash between Solana, Ripple, and Litecoin proves that influence in blockchain is no longer won only by innovation — but by the story each network tells.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3195 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility, ensuring that the total supply remains accessible to users. Pi Network is reaching one of the most crucial phases in 2025; as the market is still suspicious, the on-chain activity and the Pi ecosystem continue to develop. Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. Passkey Update enhanced the security of the Pi Wallet with Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN ahead of the Mainnet launch. New DeFi tools Pi DEX and AMM on Testnet allow users to transact Pi and explore decentralized finance in a Web3-aligned way. Meanwhile, Pi Network Ventures partnered with OpenMind AI to build a decentralized AI infrastructure, and a recent system process enabled 3.36 million Pioneers to complete identity verification pi network on Pi Network. With the Pi Hackathon 2025 and Sign Protocol partnership ongoing, the network price prediction suggests a resilient ecosystem still focused on utility and long-term growth within the declining exponential model that defines its supply and mining rewards In this article on Pi price prediction and Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2473 Price Change 24h 0.5% Market Cap $2.06B Circulating Supply 8.29B PI Trading Volume 24h 8.29B PI All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2473 Price Prediction $ 0.1860 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 33 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.61% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2672 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 56.56 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi trades at $0.2473, up by 0.09% in the past 24 hours, following a brief rally to $0.252 earlier in the day. Pi Network’s price has shown a moderate recovery after recent crypto market turbulence that drove it to a new monthly low earlier last month. Resistance lies between $0.26 and $0.28, while support zones remain at $0.24 and $0.226. As of November 1, 2025, Pi Network’s price analysis shows muted movement after recent volatility, with a current price average reflecting stability in the market. The coin is trading around $0.2473, down slightly from the previous session’s high of $0.252, as consolidation continues near the $0.24 support zone. Price action remains range-bound, with minor pullbacks indicating fading momentum but no major breakdown. Resistance levels stand at $0.26–$0.28, while support is holding near $0.24 and $0.226, suggesting Pi is stabilizing after a modest recovery phase. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart for Pi Network (PI) price shows a moderate consolidation phase after last week’s short-term recovery. Pi traded between $0.2443 and $0.2524 during the session before stabilizing around $0.2473, indicating sideways momentum as the market digests prior gains. The pattern suggests Pi is forming a neutral base near the $0.24 zone following a failed attempt to break higher. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56.00, cooling slightly from earlier highs but still above its signal line at 43.69. This positioning signals balanced market conditions with modest bullish bias, implying that selling pressure is subsiding. If RSI continues trending above 50, it could confirm early accumulation and a potential breakout continuation toward the $0.26–$0.28 resistance area. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) shows the main line at –0.0006 crossing above the signal line at –0.0090, with the histogram turning positive. This crossover indicates fading bearish momentum and the likelihood of short-term stabilization. Immediate resistance levels stand at $0.26, aligning with the 50-day moving average, while support remains near $0.24 and $0.226. A close above $0.26 could extend gains toward $0.28, while a slip below $0.24 may invite a retest of the $0.22 area. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.2472, over the past 4 hours, as the price consolidates near the $0.25 mark. The coin traded between $0.2467 and $0.2495, reflecting tight range-bound movement with reduced volatility. Bulls are attempting to defend the $0.24 support region, while sellers maintain pressure below the $0.26 resistance zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 49.71, hovering close to its signal line at 50.81. This near-neutral setup indicates a balance between buyers and sellers, with neither side dominating. RSI readings around 50 suggest consolidation after earlier volatility, signaling that momentum is stabilizing. A break above 55 could reintroduce mild bullish momentum, while a dip below 45 may expose further downside toward $0.23. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator supports this neutral stance. The MACD line –0.0014 is slightly below the signal line 0.0017, while the histogram shows fading red bars and an early hint of decreasing bearish pressure. If the MACD crosses back into positive territory, it could confirm renewed buying interest. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3019 SELL SMA 5 $0.2744 SELL SMA 10 $0.2451 BUY SMA 21 $0.2286 BUY SMA 50 $0.2672 SELL SMA 100 $0.3262 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2387 BUY EMA 5 $0.2571 SELL EMA 10 $0.2897 SELL EMA 21 $0.3235 SELL EMA 50 $0.3764 SELL EMA 100 $0.4668 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi price is expected to remain in a consolidation phase between $0.20 and $0.24 over the short term. The token is still oversold, suggesting fewer pi in circulation, limited buying momentum but potential for a rebound if demand increases. However, bearish pressure persists. Unless Pi breaks above $0.25 resistance, sideways trading with a weak bias is likely, while a drop below $0.20 could trigger further bearish momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? PI’s price dropped after traders took profits from last week’s 19% rally to $0.291, as retail-driven momentum faded and volume fell 40% to $30.7M. The token also faced rejection at the $0.26 Fibonacci resistance, with RSI divergence signaling weakening bullish momentum and a possible correction toward $0.209. Added pressure comes from a looming 120M token unlock in November, which could expand supply and heighten volatility despite long-term optimism around Pi’s AI and DeFi ecosystem. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline.

This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72.

Across the global gaming industry, more studios are seeing workers’ demand for rights to form unions, especially after years of criticism over “crunch” periods often required to meet production deadlines. Rockstar Games is now facing allegations that it does not support employee demands for organized action. Rockstar Games accused of deliberately targeting union efforts Rockstar Games , the studio behind the Grand Theft Auto series, is facing allegations of union-busting after it fired dozens of employees across its UK and Canadian offices. According to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), the game developer abruptly dismissed between 30 and 40 workers on Thursday in what the union describes as a deliberate attempt to disrupt efforts to form a union inside the company. The union referred to the company’s actions as one of the most “blatant and ruthless” acts of union busting in the gaming industry. Alex Marshall, the president of the IWGB, said the studio’s actions showed “flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions.” He also criticized Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for showing disregard toward their employees and the gaming community that supports their work. Union representatives are urging an investigation into the dismissals because they believe the timing and scale of the layoffs are suspicious and don’t seem to be for valid reasons. The IWGB is reportedly exploring legal means to get the dismissals overturned. In a statement, the IWGB said that a major company like Rockstar getting away with antagonizing union organizers sends a “chilling message to workers everywhere who want to organize for fair treatment.” Take-Two denies accusations Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., denied all of IWGB’s accusations. The company insists that the layoffs were due to “gross misconduct” by the employees and not related to any union activities, but it has so far failed to provide any details of the supposed misconduct. Alan Lewis, a spokesperson for Take-Two, said the company “fully supports Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.” Despite the backlash, Rockstar has not indicated any plans to reverse the firings. This isn’t the first time Rockstar has faced employee relations controversy. In early 2024, the company was heavily criticized for asking workers to return to the office five days a week. The IWGB criticized that decision, saying it ignored workers’ well-being and family responsibilities. Rockstar defended the return-to-office directive as a necessary step to beef up security after a major leak revealed dozens of video footage from the unfinished Grand Theft Auto VI in 2022. Rockstar is still preparing to release the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI video games on May 26, 2026.

However, the stock has risen by over 3% in the last five days. Meanwhile, this development follows the recent emergence of Ripple-backed Evernorth , which plans to build the largest treasury. XRPScan data shows that the treasury company currently holds 388.7 million XRP worth nearly $1 billion, making it the largest XRP treasury. The company had earlier announced plans to raise over $1 billion from investors such as Ripple, Kraken, Pantera Capital, and GSR. This comes ahead of the company’s debut on the Nasdaq. The treasury company plans to list on the stock exchange through a business combination agreement with Armada II. Armada notably recently changed its ticker to XRPN as part of the business agreement. More Institutions Set To Accumulate The Altcoin More institutional investors are set to accumulate the token with the imminent launch of the Canary Capital XRP ETF . The asset manager filed an amendment to its fund to remove the delaying amendment, allowing it to launch on November 13. This will be similar to how the firm launched its Hedera and Litecoin ETFs earlier this week.

This proposal, approved in July, includes a rewards plan based on price targets. According to the proposal, if the VIRTUAL token price reaches $10, $20, and $40, respectively, it will trigger a token allocation equivalent to 2% of the total supply to the Virgen Labs team. If all targets are met, the team will earn a total reward of 6% (60 million VIRTUAL tokens).

However, if all targets are met, the share of the DAO treasury will decrease from 34% to 28%. This will only apply if the VIRTUAL price reaches $40.

It was also the first time the monthly trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) exceeded $1 trillion, evidence of them gaining ground on rival centralized exchanges (CEXs). The open interest (OI) in perps was recorded to be approximately $17.9 billion. According to DeFi data analytics platform DeFiLlama , on-chain perpetuals’ monthly trading volume for September was over $738 billion. DEX perps futures nearly doubled September’s figures, hitting $1.3 trillion in October. Source: DeFiLlama Perps go from niche experiment to trillion-dollar engine Perpetual futures, crypto derivatives that let traders bet on prices without expiry, have long been the domain of big centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. But as those exchanges have tightened their risk controls and compliance rules over the past year, a growing share of liquidity has started to move on-chain. Decentralized platforms such as Hyperliquid , Lighter, EdgeX, and those built on Ethereum and Arbitrum have stepped in to fill the gap, handling more than a trillion dollars in notional trading volume last month. Sentora researcher Juan Pellicer wrote that the shift to on-chain trading is being driven by the tighter risk and reduced market-making activities on CEXs. On-chain protocols have developed new execution models that cater to niche and slower-moving traders, the “long tail” of the market, while offering transparency and composability. “On-chain derivatives are no longer a sideshow,” the Sentora report noted. “They’re now the marginal venue for leverage in crypto, shaping how risk transmits through the system.” Fed rate cuts add fuel to leverage demand The U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut , its second this year, has lowered the cost of dollar funding, indirectly boosting leverage appetite across risk assets. By reducing short-term interest rates, the Fed has made holding fully funded spot positions less attractive relative to leveraged exposure via perps. With lower base rates, the shadow value of collateral is lifted, and this also reduces “USD funding alternatives,” effectively making “perp exposure cheaper relative to holding fully-funded spot.” The October 10 market turbulence played a major role Other reports say this record volume may not be unconnected to the brief market crash that occurred on October 10. The incident, which was sparked by President Donald Trump’s announcement of more tariffs on China, saw the crypto market power through the largest liquidation event on record to date. Some major CEXs experienced some downtime and saw glitches due to the volumes and pressure of users, prompting more traders to utilize DEXs more. Hyperliquid, the leading perpetual DEX, saw the liquidation of more than 1,000 wallets on October 10. That day saw “on-chain perpetual markets hit a record single-day trading volume of $78 billion,” and it showed observers that decentralized platforms have evolved and are ready to play in the same field as their centralized counterparts.

Every rise and fall leaves a trace that often repeats in reverse. For traders who grasp this rhythm, emotions fade, and patterns become clear. This deep understanding of time and symmetry defines Egrag Crypto’s latest XRP analysis — a perspective built on structure, rhythm, and patience. Egrag Crypto’s Theory of Market Reflection In his most recent update, Egrag Crypto revisited his “As Above, So Below” thesis. The model suggests that XRP’s market structure mirrors itself across different timeframes. According to Egrag, the same sequence that shaped previous moves now appears to be unfolding again. The updated chart shows matching highs and lows across two 89-bar cycles. These cycles, he says, reveal the market’s “universal rhythm,” a balance between resistance and support that often determines price direction. His analysis suggests an 80% probability of rejection from the current resistance area, and only a 20% chance of a confirmed breakout. #XRP – As Above, So Below (UPATED CHART): Just 4 days ago (October 27), I shared a post showing an 80% chance of rejection and only a 20% chance of penetration… and guess what? Nothing has changed. It’s still the same universal rhythm , “As Above, So Below.” … https://t.co/vZ1EGPbeIw pic.twitter.com/CzF717OPbG — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 1, 2025 Current XRP Price Outlook As of report time, XRP trades in the mid-$2 range. This zone aligns closely with Egrag Crypto’s highlighted resistance band. The market recently attempted a breakout, but the price action shows hesitation near the same structural level that capped gains in earlier phases. Analysts note that holding above the key Fibonacci levels around $2.40 to $2.60 remains essential. Failure to sustain this range could open the path toward lower retracement zones near $2.20. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios The bullish path requires XRP to break and close above the current resistance area with strong volume. That move could confirm renewed momentum toward targets around $3.00 and beyond. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, the bearish outlook remains valid if XRP fails to maintain support . A breakdown below $2.30 could invite further correction, aligning with the “As Below” reflection Egrag identifies in his chart. Other technical indicators, such as declining volume and moving-average crossovers, could reinforce this downside scenario. Time, Patience, and Market Alignment Egrag emphasizes that timing governs every market movement. To him, patience is not passive waiting — it is alignment with time. Traders who understand this principle can detach from emotions and follow market structure with precision. The idea reflects his belief that success in trading depends on synchronization with market rhythm, not impulsive reaction. In conclusion, Egrag Crypto’s “As Above, So Below” framework remains one of the most thought-provoking XRP analyses today. It connects time, symmetry, and emotion into a unified approach to reading markets. Whether XRP confirms a breakout or mirrors another rejection, his message is clear — understanding time is the key to understanding price.

A strong triangle support structure and a developing inverse head and shoulders pattern are signaling a potential bullish reversal. Momentum is tightening, suggesting that a breakout could be closer than it seems. Massive Triangle Formation Holds Firm Amid Market Shakeouts Batman, a well-known crypto analyst, recently highlighted that Bitcoin has been consolidating for several weeks within a massive descending triangle formation. Despite multiple shakeouts attempting to push the price lower, the key support level has consistently held firm, signaling underlying strength in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Key Retest: Bounce Or $98,000 Next? He noted that the current setup represents a classic, textbook pattern often seen before an explosive breakout in price. Each test of support has been met with strong buying interest, showing that bulls are actively defending the lower boundary of the structure. The classic textbook formation suggests that Bitcoin’s price is coiling up energy for a potential breakout once momentum returns. Batman remains highly optimistic about Bitcoin’s next move, stating that his target remains clear at $126,000. He cautioned traders not to underestimate the setup, emphasizing that the current price action could mark the calm before a major surge. In his view, this represents a big opportunity for those watching closely, as the market prepares for what could be the next explosive leg higher. Technical Setup Hints At Shift From Consolidation To Expansion According to GandalfCrypto in a current update, Bitcoin is currently forming a potential inverse Head & Shoulders pattern, which often signals a major trend reversal in technical analysis. The structure has been developing over the past few weeks, with clear left and right shoulders forming, while the neckline sits around the $115,000–$116,000 range. This area has become a key zone to monitor, as it represents the boundary between continued consolidation and a potential bullish breakout. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Market Dynamics Are Evolving As New Developments Surface Overnight GandalfCrypto explained that if Bitcoin successfully breaks above this neckline with strong volume, it would validate the reversal pattern and likely trigger a surge toward the $130,000 target. Such a move would confirm renewed strength among buyers and could mark the beginning of a sustained bullish phase after weeks of sideways movement and uncertainty. He further noted that momentum indicators are coiling tightly, reflecting a buildup of energy beneath the surface. GandalfCrypto emphasized the importance of patience and precision, waiting for a confirmed breakout rather than preempting the move, as this will distinguish traders who capture the next leg higher from those caught in false starts.

Abagnale, the real-life inspiration for Leonardo DiCaprio’s leading role in the crime comedy-drama film, lectured attendees of the conference this week in an exclusive meeting with members of the finance and crypto industries. American con artist talks cybersecurity at Russian crypto forum In his presentation, the once convicted felon, who forged bank checks and other documents in his youth while faking identities, provided a thorough analysis of modern digital fraud schemes and vulnerabilities in common online practices, sharing his recommendations for protecting personal data. The lecture, titled “Catch the Legend,” gathered around 100 representatives of business circles, finance, and the crypto sector, including major digital asset exchanges, the Russian business news outlet RBC reported on Saturday. Abagnale was invited as the speaker in the first of the new RBC Global Talks, a format meeting guests with world experts and opinion leaders in various fields. It was organized as a side event of the international Blockchain Life 2025 forum, held in Dubai. This was the 15th anniversary edition of the conference, Russia’s most significant international crypto gathering, which aims to connect Russian-speaking and global crypto communities. Among the headlines it produced this year was Pavel Durov ’s unveiling of a new decentralized computing platform called Cocoon, meant as an alternative to centralized cloud services such as Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. According to the tech entrepreneur, founder and owner of the popular in the crypto space messenger Telegram, the AI services of today are heavily dependent on centralized providers that can access, collect, and exploit users’ personal data. Abagnale doesn’t keep cryptocurrency and has no social media accounts For his part, Frank Abagnale touched on the subject of personal cybersecurity, too. During a discussion following the lecture, he stated he does not use cryptocurrency and doesn’t have any social media accounts either, as part of his safety strategy. Abagnale spent over an hour answering questions in an informal setting. Participants in the meeting received copies of a new edition of his book, specially printed for the event. No video recording was allowed. The screenplay for Spielberg’s movie, which made his story world famous, is based on a semi-autobiography with the same title that he co-authored with writer Stan Redding. The book details his criminal exploits. During his time as a con man, Abagnale allegedly cashed $2.5 million worth of forged checks while also impersonating a doctor, a professor, an attorney, and even a Pan Am pilot, flying millions of air miles as a deadheading employee. Some of his claims have been challenged, leaving the impression he might have faked, or at least exaggerated, even his own biography. But others are likely true, to one degree or another, as he has been arrested on multiple occasions, for an array of crimes and offences in the 1960s and 70s, when he was in his teens and 20s. He also spent time in prison in the United States, Sweden, and France, of which he is a citizen, too. Eventually, Abagnale transitioned into a career of a security consultant, advising various organizations, including companies and banks. He gave numerous speeches, lectures, and interviews, making a great number of public appearances, including in Talks at Google and popular talk shows. Among the most controversial claims he introduced into his repertoire in the early 80s is that he was granted a parole from prison so that he could work for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He has continuously maintained his involvement with the FBI. Besides RBC, which is Blockchain Life’s main media partner this year, Abagnale’s appearance at the conference was sponsored by the A7A5 platform. The latter is the issuer of a ruble-pegged stablecoin with the same name, which accounts for almost half of the market cap of all non-dollar stablecoins, as reported by Cryptopolitan.

A monumental XRP transfer , totaling 300 million tokens, has moved from an undisclosed wallet directly to Ripple. This transaction, valued at approximately $751 million, sparks immediate questions and ignites discussions across the crypto community about its implications. The Unprecedented XRP Transfer – What Just Happened? On [Insert Date if available, otherwise keep general], the renowned blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert, flagged an extraordinary movement of digital assets. An astonishing 300,000,000 XRP tokens were transferred from an unknown wallet. The destination? None other than Ripple, the blockchain company behind the XRP ledger. This single XRP transfer represents a substantial amount of capital, equivalent to over three-quarters of a billion dollars. Such a large-scale transaction naturally draws scrutiny, especially when involving a major player like Ripple. It prompts us to consider the underlying reasons and potential ripple effects (pun intended) this could have on the market. Understanding the dynamics of these large whale movements is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. They often precede or indicate significant strategic decisions by the entities involved. This particular event is no exception, demanding a closer look at its potential impact. Why Does a Large XRP Transfer to Ripple Matter? When an entity like Ripple receives such a colossal XRP transfer , several possibilities emerge. These transactions are rarely random; they usually serve a strategic purpose. Here are a few reasons why this specific transfer is significant: Treasury Management: Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP in its treasury. This transfer could be part of an internal restructuring or a consolidation of funds from various controlled wallets. Liquidity Provision: The incoming XRP might be intended to bolster liquidity for Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors. ODL uses XRP to facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border payments. Strategic Sales or Partnerships: While less common for direct transfers to Ripple, a large influx could prepare for future strategic initiatives, perhaps involving new partnerships or even potential over-the-counter (OTC) sales to institutional clients. Escrow Management: Ripple periodically releases XRP from its escrow accounts. This transfer could relate to re-escrowing or managing those released funds. These large movements are often a window into the operational health and strategic direction of a major crypto enterprise. They indicate active management of assets rather than dormant holdings. Analyzing the Market Impact of This XRP Transfer Any substantial XRP transfer , especially one involving Ripple, can generate considerable market discussion. While such a transfer doesn’t automatically mean an immediate price surge or drop, it certainly influences market sentiment. Investors and traders closely watch these whale movements for clues about future market activity. Transparency in blockchain transactions, even with “unknown wallets,” allows for this level of scrutiny. However, the lack of explicit context from Ripple itself often leads to speculation. This particular event highlights the dual nature of crypto: unparalleled transparency in transactions combined with potential opacity regarding the motives behind them. It is important for market participants to differentiate between a transfer and a sale. A transfer to Ripple’s known wallets doesn’t automatically imply an imminent sale onto exchanges. Instead, it suggests internal asset management or preparation for a specific strategic use. What’s Next for Ripple and XRP Holders After This Transfer? For XRP holders and those following Ripple, monitoring official announcements and further on-chain activity becomes paramount. This significant XRP transfer could be a precursor to several developments. Ripple continues to expand its global presence and ODL network. Such a large influx of XRP could empower them to further scale these operations, potentially increasing XRP’s utility. Keeping an eye on Ripple’s partnerships and quarterly reports can offer more context. Actionable Insight: While it’s tempting to react to large transfers, a balanced approach involves observing broader market trends and Ripple’s strategic communications. Don’t base investment decisions solely on single whale alerts; instead, consider them as one piece of a larger puzzle. In conclusion, the recent 300 million XRP transfer to Ripple is a compelling event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact motives remain unconfirmed, it points towards active strategic management by Ripple, potentially impacting its operational capabilities and the broader XRP ecosystem. These significant movements remind us that the crypto landscape is constantly evolving, driven by the actions of its major players. Staying informed and understanding the potential implications of such large transactions is key for navigating this exciting space.

A1: An XRP transfer refers to the movement of XRP digital tokens from one wallet address to another on the XRP Ledger. These transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be tracked by services like Whale Alert. Q2: Who is Whale Alert? A2: Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions (often referred to as “whale movements”) across various blockchains. It provides real-time notifications about significant transfers, helping to increase transparency in the crypto market. Q3: Why would an “unknown wallet” transfer XRP to Ripple? A3: An “unknown wallet” could be an address controlled by Ripple itself, used for internal treasury management, or an address belonging to an institutional partner or client making a large payment or contributing to a liquidity pool. Without specific announcements from Ripple, the exact nature remains speculative. Q4: Does this XRP transfer mean Ripple will sell the tokens immediately? A4: Not necessarily. A large XRP transfer to Ripple’s known wallets often indicates internal asset management, such as preparing for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) operations, consolidating funds, or managing escrow releases. While sales are always a possibility, the transfer itself doesn’t guarantee an immediate market dump. Q5: How does this affect the price of XRP? A5: Large transfers can sometimes create market speculation, but their direct impact on price is not always straightforward. While some might interpret it as a bearish signal (potential sale), others might see it as a bullish sign of strategic activity or increased liquidity. The actual price movement depends on broader market sentiment and Ripple’s subsequent actions. Q6: Where can I track these large XRP transfers? A6: You can track large XRP transfers and other cryptocurrency movements using blockchain explorers specific to the XRP Ledger or through services like Whale Alert, which aggregates and reports on significant transactions across multiple chains.

A staggering 200,000,000 XRP transfer , valued at approximately $500 million, has been reported moving from an unknown wallet directly to Ripple. This kind of significant movement always captures attention and prompts questions among investors and market watchers alike. What Just Happened with This XRP Transfer? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert recently flagged a colossal transaction involving Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP. The report indicated that 200 million XRP tokens were sent from a wallet identified only as ‘unknown’ to Ripple. Scale of the Transfer: This particular XRP transfer represents a substantial amount, making it one of the larger single transactions observed recently. Valuation: At current market prices, this transfer is valued at around half a billion dollars, underscoring its financial significance. Destination: The recipient, Ripple, is the company closely associated with XRP, leading to immediate speculation about the purpose of such a large influx. When an ‘unknown wallet’ is involved, it typically means the address is not publicly associated with a known individual, exchange, or institution, adding a layer of mystery to the transaction. Why Do Large XRP Transfers Spark Market Interest? Significant cryptocurrency movements, often dubbed ‘whale transfers,’ frequently draw attention because they can signal potential market shifts. A massive XRP transfer like this one can be interpreted in several ways: Potential Selling Pressure: Sometimes, large transfers to exchanges precede a sell-off, which could impact price. However, a transfer directly to Ripple itself might suggest internal management. Strategic Moves: It could indicate a strategic decision by the sending entity or by Ripple to consolidate assets or prepare for a specific initiative. Liquidity Management: Ripple often uses XRP for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solutions. This transfer could be related to bolstering liquidity for these services. Understanding the context behind such transfers is crucial for market participants. The sheer volume of this particular XRP transfer makes it a notable event for the entire crypto community. What Could This XRP Transfer Mean for Ripple’s Operations? A direct XRP transfer to Ripple itself opens up several possibilities regarding the company’s internal operations and strategy. Ripple holds a significant portion of XRP in escrow, releasing it periodically for various purposes. This incoming transfer could potentially be: A Buyback: Ripple might be repurchasing XRP from a large holder. Strategic Partnership: The transfer could be part of an agreement with a partner or institution. Internal Reallocation: Perhaps it is a movement between Ripple-controlled wallets for treasury management or operational needs. Historically, Ripple has been transparent about its escrow releases and sales, aiming to maintain market stability. This particular incoming XRP transfer suggests a different kind of interaction. Navigating the Impact of Significant Crypto Movements For investors, understanding these large transactions is part of staying informed. While a single XRP transfer doesn’t always dictate immediate price action, it contributes to the overall market sentiment and narrative. It’s a reminder of the dynamic nature of digital assets and the importance of on-chain analytics. Monitoring reputable sources like Whale Alert provides valuable insights into the movements of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales.’ These insights can help individuals make more informed decisions, rather than reacting to unverified rumors. The recent 200,000,000 XRP transfer to Ripple is undoubtedly a significant event in the cryptocurrency landscape. While its exact purpose remains undisclosed by Ripple, it highlights the constant activity within the digital asset space. Such large-scale movements underscore the growing maturity and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies like XRP. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these substantial transfers will remain a key aspect of understanding potential future developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in crypto transfers? An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly identified or linked to a specific individual, exchange, or institution. These wallets are often used by large holders, sometimes called ‘whales,’ who prefer to remain anonymous. Why is this 200,000,000 XRP transfer significant? The significance lies in the sheer volume and value of the transaction ($500 million) and its destination – Ripple. Large transfers can influence market sentiment, signal strategic moves, or indicate changes in liquidity management for the asset. Does this XRP transfer mean Ripple is selling XRP? Not necessarily. While transfers to exchanges can sometimes precede sales, a direct transfer to Ripple could indicate a buyback, an internal reallocation, or part of a strategic partnership. It is an incoming transfer to Ripple, not an outgoing one to an exchange for sale. How can I track large crypto transfers like this? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. These platforms provide real-time updates on large movements, helping the community stay informed. What impact could this have on XRP’s price? The immediate impact on XRP’s price is not always clear-cut. While large transfers can sometimes create short-term volatility due to speculation, the long-term effects depend on the actual purpose of the transfer and Ripple’s subsequent actions. It’s important to consider broader market trends. Did you find this analysis helpful?

There has been massive investment in ETFs related to Bitcoin and Ethereum in the last quarter, marking renewed faith in cryptos with the onset of economic change. Solana, being a strong altcoin, has numerous times been arrested at the $203 and $212 mark due to selling pressures from persons who took profits in the altcoin. This is because it emphasizes the importance of making informed decisions on the best crypto to invest in, with the key aspect being growth and sustainability in these volatile markets. On the other hand, there is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , one of the most prominent DeFi cryptos that has garnered intense attention from over 17,660 investors since the onset of its presale event, with $18,270,000 in funds raised so far. Solana Resistance Challenges Solana has resisted key areas around $203 and $212 for weeks now, while market players observe ETF injection-related growth in the crypto market without resulting in higher prices for Solana. The bears have completely controlled these areas, resulting in Solana crashing after short periods of rises in prices, thereby disappointing Solana investors who seek to benefit instantly from it despite it being known for high speed and an exciting network. On the other hand, these challenges highlight why investors are turning to more dependable opportunities such as the best crypto to buy, in which steady progress beats intermittent rallies. Therefore, while SOL remains in limbo, new projects with real-world value are gaining importance because they avoid volatility pitfalls. Mutuum Finance Presale Activity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rushed the presale in Phase 6, with 85% of the tokens sold, giving it immense hype in the DeFi crypto space currently. The earlier investors have booked the current price of $0.035, marking an increase of 250% from Phase 1, where it was $0.01 to join the space. As Phase 6 is nearing the point of being sold out, investors lock in purchases ready to yield returns of as much as 420% after the initial launch price of $0.06. Also, the team has launched a dashboard with the 24-hour leaderboard where the highest depositor takes home the $500 bonus for MUTM every day after making one transaction with the rewards being reset at 00:00 UTC. For enhanced community sentiment, Mutuum Finance maintains a $100,000 prize give out in an attempt to distribute $10,000 prizes among the 10 lucky individuals, resulting in the current holders reaching 17,660 with the current motivation mixture making MUTM the best cryptocurrency to buy currently in light of Phase 7 approaching with a near 20% increase to $0.04 while leaving others to pay higher prices. Dual-Market Lending Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its multi-tiered loan model combining the best of pool-based efficiency with direct flexibility, making it one of the best cryptos in DeFi. The process involves users staking funds such as ETH or USDT in peer-to-contract pools, where borrowers access automatically, earning steady returns in the process. Where less frequently used tokens tend to not have deep enough pools of liquidity, peer-to-peer solutions allow the lender to set terms, encouraging them to make the most of the returns without the middlemen in the process increasing the rewards’ after-take fee risks, either directly in terms of rising to higher altcoins if geared towards mass altcoin users or to simple altcoins if catering to users unsatisfied with altcoins’ same old story each time they pull out. Hence, it is the best cryptocurrency to invest in for users who are fed up with one-note altcoins. Looking Back at Smart Choices Those who have participated in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during the current surge in the presale can now own a stake in the DeFi crypto that has been designed with longevity in mind, reaching far beyond the temporary resistance fights involved in altcoins such as SOL. Its perfect blend of community spirit and good fundamentals provides further reasons why one should own the best crypto to buy in the current market uncertainty – start now in the presale before Phase 6 ends.

The document titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” was first posted on October 31, 2008. Bitcoin Hits Its 17th Year The network itself went live when the genesis block was mined on January 3, 2009. That first block carried a headline embedded in its code that referenced a major banking bailout story, a move that many say set the tone for the crypto’s original message. The market has changed a lot since then. Based on reports , BTC’s market value is now being measured in the trillions, with some outlets citing a roughly $2 trillion market cap as part of the broader picture of adoption by institutions and governments. Today marks the 17th anniversary of the Bitcoin Whitepaper. Read it today: https://t.co/w5GI7OilDH pic.twitter.com/fahFRbSMmY — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) October 31, 2025 Traders and investors watched prices closely on the anniversary. According to market snapshots, Bitcoin traded around $110,500 on the day, reflecting both recent gains and ongoing volatility. Why The Date Matters Analysts say anniversaries like this are both symbolic and practical. They give a moment to check how the technology and the money around it have changed. Supporters point to Bitcoin’s continuous operation since the genesis block as proof of its durability. Political figures also used the date to weigh in: US Treasury officials and other public voices highlighted that the network has stayed “always on,” and some compared that to government operations. Adoption Has Been Gradual And Uneven According to reports, adoption was slow initially before picking up as products were developed, new exchanges opened and investment funds became available. Now, some countries and companies have begun holding Bitcoin directly. Others are establishing rules and limits. So, in total, a mixed status. Policy decisions will continue to have an impact on the level of adoption with Bitcoin. Traders are tracking support levels near $105,000 and watching for fresh momentum that could push prices higher or trigger pullbacks. Markets have seen large swings this year, and experts say those swings will likely remain. Looking Ahead Reports have disclosed mixed forecasts for price and policy in the months ahead, but many industry voices agree on one point: Bitcoin’s first 17 years have moved it from a technical experiment into a broad public debate about money, policy and investment.

This move, reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a large transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver with potential implications for the XRP ecosystem. For those tracking the pulse of digital assets, understanding the nuances of such an action is crucial. What Does XRP Locked in Escrow Truly Mean? When we talk about XRP locked in escrow, it refers to a specific mechanism Ripple employs to manage the supply of its native cryptocurrency. Escrow acts like a digital vault, holding a predetermined amount of XRP for a set period or until certain conditions are met. This isn’t a new practice for Ripple; they have been utilizing escrow accounts for years to ensure transparency and predictability in the release of XRP into the market. Transparency: The escrow schedule is public, allowing the community to anticipate future releases. Supply Management: It prevents a sudden flood of XRP onto exchanges, which could potentially destabilize its price. Investor Confidence: It signals a commitment to long-term stability and responsible asset management. Why is This XRP Locked Development So Significant? The locking of 500 million XRP is a substantial amount, representing a considerable portion of the circulating supply. This action directly impacts the available supply of XRP on exchanges, which can influence market dynamics. Less available supply, assuming consistent demand, can lead to interesting price movements. Furthermore, it reinforces Ripple’s ongoing strategy to maintain a structured release schedule. Consider the broader context: Ripple’s vision for XRP Ledger (XRPL) involves facilitating fast, low-cost international payments. Managing the supply of XRP is a key component of this vision, ensuring the asset remains viable and attractive for institutional adoption. This latest XRP locked event underscores that commitment. The Broader Implications of XRP Locked Funds This move isn’t just about supply and demand; it also speaks to Ripple’s strategic positioning within the global financial landscape. By consistently locking up large sums of XRP, Ripple demonstrates its long-term belief in the asset’s utility and its ecosystem’s growth. This can be a powerful signal to potential partners and investors who are looking for stability and foresight in the volatile crypto market. Moreover, the continuous locking of XRP in escrow highlights a proactive approach to managing market sentiment. In an industry often swayed by news and speculation, predictable actions like these can foster a sense of security. It shows that Ripple is not just reacting to market conditions but actively shaping the environment for XRP’s sustained development and adoption. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for XRP Locked Assets? The question many are asking is, what happens next with these XRP locked funds? Typically, Ripple’s escrow system releases a portion of XRP each month. Any unspent XRP from these monthly releases is then re-escrowed. This cyclical process ensures a continuous, managed flow of XRP into the market, aligning with Ripple’s operational needs and ecosystem development efforts. For investors and enthusiasts, monitoring these escrow releases and re-escrows provides valuable insight into Ripple’s financial health and its ongoing commitment to the XRP Ledger. It’s a transparent mechanism that allows for a degree of predictability in an otherwise unpredictable market. As the crypto space evolves, such structured approaches become increasingly important for establishing trust and stability. The recent report of 500 million XRP locked in escrow at Ripple is a clear indicator of the company’s deliberate strategy to manage its digital asset. This consistent approach to supply management, through transparent escrow releases, aims to foster stability and confidence within the XRP ecosystem. It underscores Ripple’s long-term vision for XRP as a key player in global finance, reinforcing its commitment to a predictable and robust digital asset environment. For anyone interested in the future of digital payments and blockchain technology, these strategic moves by Ripple are certainly worth watching. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when XRP is locked in escrow? When XRP is locked in escrow, it means a specific amount of XRP is held in a secure digital account for a predetermined period or until certain conditions are met. This prevents it from being sold or moved freely on the market, helping to manage supply. Why does Ripple lock XRP in escrow ? Ripple locks XRP in escrow primarily to manage its supply and ensure market stability. This transparent process prevents a sudden influx of XRP onto exchanges, which could negatively impact its price and investor confidence. How often does Ripple release XRP from escrow ? Ripple typically releases a portion of XRP from escrow on a monthly basis. Any unspent XRP from these monthly releases is then re-escrowed, maintaining a controlled and predictable supply flow. Does XRP locked in escrow affect its price? Yes, the amount of XRP locked in escrow can affect its price by influencing the circulating supply. A larger amount of XRP locked generally means less available on the open market, which can, in theory, support its value if demand remains consistent. Where can I track XRP escrow movements? Platforms like Whale Alert often report significant XRP escrow movements. Additionally, Ripple’s official channels and various crypto analytics sites provide information on the escrow schedule and releases.

A substantial amount of XRP locked in escrow has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This isn’t just a minor transaction; it’s a strategic move with potential ripple effects across the market. Let’s dive into what this means for the digital asset and its community. What’s the Buzz About 200 Million XRP Locked ? According to a report from Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, a staggering 200 million XRP has been placed into Ripple’s escrow. This isn’t the first time such an event has occurred, but each instance brings renewed discussion about Ripple’s strategy and XRP’s market dynamics. For those new to the term, “escrow” in the crypto world generally refers to funds held by a third party or, in this case, a smart contract, until certain conditions are met. Ripple utilizes this mechanism to manage the supply of XRP, ensuring a predictable release schedule. Significant Volume: 200 million XRP represents a considerable portion of the circulating supply. Transparency: These transactions are publicly verifiable on the XRP Ledger. Market Impact: Locking up such a large amount can influence supply-demand dynamics. Understanding Ripple’s Escrow Strategy for XRP Locked Ripple’s escrow system is a cornerstone of its economic model for XRP. Back in 2017, Ripple locked 55 billion XRP in a series of escrows, designed to release 1 billion XRP each month over 55 months. The purpose was to provide predictability and stability to the market, preventing a sudden flood of tokens that could depress prices. When we see XRP locked , it typically means these tokens are moved into an account that cannot be accessed until a predetermined time or condition is met. Any unreleased XRP from the monthly allocations is usually returned to the escrow queue, further ensuring a controlled release. This systematic approach aims to: Boost Investor Confidence: By providing clarity on future supply. Reduce Volatility: Mitigating the risk of large, unpredictable token dumps. Support Ecosystem Growth: Allowing Ripple to strategically use XRP for partnerships and development without immediate market pressure. How Does XRP Locked Affect Market Dynamics? The locking of 200 million XRP can be interpreted in several ways by the market. On one hand, it reduces the immediate circulating supply, which, in theory, could be seen as a bullish signal. A lower available supply, coupled with consistent demand, often leads to upward price pressure. However, it’s also a reminder that Ripple holds a significant portion of XRP and manages its release. While this provides stability, some critics point to it as a centralized aspect of the asset. Nevertheless, the transparency of the escrow system allows market participants to track these movements. Consider these points: Supply Constraint: Fewer tokens available for immediate sale. Psychological Impact: Can create a sense of scarcity, potentially encouraging buying. Long-Term Vision: Reinforces Ripple’s commitment to a structured distribution plan. What’s Next for the Future of XRP Locked and Ripple? The consistent locking and releasing of XRP from escrow is part of Ripple’s long-term strategy to build out the utility of the XRP Ledger and the XRP token. As Ripple continues to pursue partnerships and develop its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, the controlled release of XRP is crucial for funding these initiatives without disrupting the market. Investors and enthusiasts should monitor these escrow movements as they offer insights into Ripple’s operational rhythm. While 200 million XRP locked is a notable event, it fits within a broader pattern of strategic supply management. The ongoing legal landscape also plays a role, but these escrow actions demonstrate business as usual for Ripple’s tokenomics. In conclusion, the locking of 200 million XRP in escrow by Ripple is a significant but not unprecedented event. It underscores Ripple’s commitment to a structured supply management strategy, aiming to foster stability and long-term growth for the XRP ecosystem. This move provides transparency and predictability, which are vital for investor confidence in the volatile crypto market. Keep an eye on these developments, as they often hint at the future trajectory of one of the most talked-about digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when XRP is locked in escrow? A: When XRP is locked in escrow, it means a specific amount of tokens is held in a secure, smart-contract-controlled account. These tokens are inaccessible until predetermined conditions, such as a specific date or event, are met. This mechanism is used by Ripple to manage the circulating supply of XRP. Q2: Why does Ripple lock XRP in escrow? A: Ripple locks XRP in escrow primarily to provide predictability and stability to the market. By controlling the release of a large portion of its XRP holdings, Ripple aims to prevent sudden supply shocks, boost investor confidence, and strategically fund its operations and ecosystem development over time. Q3: How often does Ripple lock or release XRP from escrow? A: Historically, Ripple established a system in 2017 to lock 55 billion XRP in escrow, with 1 billion XRP typically released each month. Any unreleased XRP from the monthly allocation is usually returned to escrow. Specific locking events, like the recent 200 million XRP locked , are part of this ongoing, dynamic management strategy. Q4: Does 200 million XRP locked affect the price of XRP? A: The locking of a significant amount of XRP locked can potentially affect its price by reducing the immediate circulating supply. In economic terms, if demand remains constant or increases while supply decreases, it can create upward pressure on the price. However, many factors influence crypto prices, so this is just one component. Q5: Is Ripple’s escrow system transparent? A: Yes, Ripple’s escrow system is designed for transparency. All transactions, including the locking and release of XRP locked , are recorded on the public XRP Ledger, allowing anyone to verify these movements. This public record helps maintain trust and accountability within the ecosystem. Did you find this deep dive into XRP locked in escrow insightful?

The latest data shows 440 million DOGE being offloaded as selling pressures intensify. Amidst this sharp decline in whale holdings, the meme coin’s price has experienced significant volatility, falling to $0.18 after recording weeks-long losses. Dogecoin Whales Trim DOGE Holdings En Masse According to on-chain data from crypto analytics platform Santiment, wallets holding between 10,000,000 and 100,000,000 DOGE have sold off roughly 440 million tokens within 72 hours. This large-scale distribution marks one of the most significant short-term liquidations from mid-level whale wallets in recent weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Crashes 50% From October Highs, Volume Is Worse, What’s Going On? Notably, on Thursday, October 29, these wallets accounted for approximately 15.51% of the total DOGE supply, but that figure dropped to 15.31% the following day. Moreover, it declined again on October 31 to 15.17%, and now stands at a low of 15.15%, at the time of writing. As whales abruptly reduced their exposure, the market also responded quickly. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Dogecoin’s price plummeted about 5.76% this last week, following its 27% crash over the past month. As selling pressure increases for Dogecoin, Santiment’s data further reveals that whale transaction counts for holders managing DOGE worth $100,000 and above spiked to 119 transactions on October 30, before plunging to 15 at the time of writing. This sharp decline suggests a rapid transition from distribution to dormancy among short-term high-volume traders. Interestingly, there have been signs of a redistribution, indicating that not all large holders are exiting the market. Santiment reports that whales with holdings exceeding 100,000,000 DOGE have increased their balances from 19.28% to 19.46% over the same period, implying accumulation from even larger players. Meanwhile, investors with holdings between 100,000 and 10,000,000 DOGE have maintained a steady position, signaling a neutral stance amid market uncertainty. Analysts Eye $0.33 And Beyond As Technical Patterns Align Despite widespread whale dumping, analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s medium to long-term price trajectory. Crypto market expert Ali Martinez identified Dogecoin’s current price at $0.18 as a critical support level. Based on his analysis, maintaining this price floor could spark a recovery wave targeting $0.26 and potentially $0.33. His chart illustrating Dogecoin’s ongoing consolidation within an Ascending Channel highlights a potential upward break aligning with previous recovery phases. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resurrection To $0.5 Could Be Imminent If This Level Breaks Adding to the bullish outlook, Bitcoinsensus has released a long-term projection, suggesting an explosive continuation of DOGE’s cyclical uptrend. The analysis compares past rallies, showing gains of 300% and 500%, and now points toward a potential 800% surge that could propel the meme coin to approximately $1.70 in the current market cycle.

The analyst pointed out that while market observers are focused on Western Union’s stablecoin partnership, the broader financial positioning of Ripple remains largely overlooked. According to Kwok, the focus on billion-dollar payment systems fails to capture the scale at which Ripple is now operating. He argues that recent strategic acquisitions by Ripple position the company to engage with trillions of dollars in institutional liquidity and settlement activity, making its market exposure far larger than that of traditional remittance firms. Ripple’s Expanding Financial Network Ripple’s recent acquisitions have attracted particular attention from analysts who see them as indicators of a deeper structural shift. These deals extend Ripple’s reach far beyond its previous partnerships with banks and payment providers. many of you have asked for my thoughts on the western union x solana announcement, so here they are. TLDR: billions are cool, but trillions are cooler. while western union handles billions of dollars each year, ripple is on its way to handling trillions of dollars each year.… — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 29, 2025 Among the most notable of Ripple’s recent acquisitions are Hidden Road , a global prime brokerage that clears around $3 trillion in transactions annually. GTreasury , a multinational treasury management company that facilitates trillions in yearly payment flows across more than 160 countries. Ripple also acquired Rail, a rapidly expanding payments platform responsible for approximately 10% of all stablecoin-based transactions worldwide. Analysts view these purchases as more consequential than traditional corporate partnerships, as they give Ripple direct ownership and operational control over platforms that already manage vast liquidity volumes. This distinction is significant because acquisitions allow Ripple to influence infrastructure design and settlement mechanisms, key factors that could eventually determine whether XRP becomes the default asset used within these systems. XRP’s Role in Ripple’s Long-Term Vision Kwok highlighted that the company’s broader goal appears to center on integrating XRP as a settlement layer within this expanding ecosystem. By owning companies that already handle multi-trillion-dollar transactions, Ripple gains both the technological and strategic leverage needed to gradually embed the XRP Ledger into high-value financial processes. This perspective contrasts sharply with the public narrative surrounding Western Union’s recent collaboration with Solana. Western Union’s stablecoin, USDPT, will launch in 2026 to facilitate global money transfers and digital cash-outs, potentially managing over $100 billion in annual flow. While this development is noteworthy, Dom Kwok and other XRP advocates argue that it represents a much smaller scale compared to Ripple’s institutional ambitions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Broader Industry Context Market commentator Scott Melker recently questioned whether XRP still holds relevance in the global payments market, noting that Western Union opted for Solana after earlier experiments with Ripple’s network. In response, Dom Kwok and other analysts urged observers to evaluate Ripple’s expanding control over institutional payment infrastructure rather than individual partnerships. Supporting this view, Flare Network CEO Hugo Philion has previously stated that Ripple’s direction points toward trading and asset management infrastructure, citing the acquisitions of Hidden Road and GTreasury as examples of this strategic evolution. Philion also emphasized that Flare’s interoperability and decentralized finance features complement Ripple’s broader ecosystem rather than compete with it. The takeaway from Kwok’s analysis is that Ripple is repositioning itself to participate in global financial systems measured in trillions, not billions. While public attention may gravitate toward headline-grabbing collaborations like Western Union’s, Ripple’s recent business moves suggest a deliberate effort to secure influence over the institutional frameworks that facilitate large-scale liquidity and cross-border settlements. In the analyst’s words, the market should not confuse short-term developments with long-term positioning. Ripple’s acquisition-driven strategy signals a transition from partnership-based collaboration to ownership of key financial pipelines, potentially placing XRP at the core of high-value global payment systems.

These massive withdrawals coincided with the exchange’s chief strategy officer’s public apology for mishandling a situation with a user with the pseudonym The White Whale. Earlier in July, The White Whale claimed that MEXC froze over $3.1 million worth of his personal funds without any terms of service violations. The crypto user later launched a $2 million social media pressure campaign against the exchange, claiming that the trading platform had requested a 12-month review period before unfreezing their funds. The White Whale said the “vague review” allowed the exchange to hold customers’ money hostage despite having completed the platform’s most advanced KYC (Know Your Client) process. MEXC Apologizes For Withholding Users’ Personal Funds On Friday, MEXC Chief Strategy Officer Cecilia Hsueh took to X to apologize to White Whale on behalf of the exchange. After revealing that the user’s money has been released, and “he can claim it at any time,” the exchange’s executive said that she got emotional communicating with White Whale when she shouldn’t have. Hsueh added in the post on X: Since I joined MEXC 2 months ago I’ve been fighting behind the scenes to get MEXC to change. We grew really fast—a few years ago, we were a very small exchange, but given our current scale, our risk, operations, and PR teams have not kept up. Furthermore, the exchange’s CSO clarified that her statement was not limited only to the White Whale’s case. Hsueh said other users with unresolved account issues will also be attended to, as they look to implement changes that will improve their transparency. Is Another FTX Fiasco Looming? A few minutes after this apology was posted on the X platform, pseudonymous on-chain analyst Maartunn revealed that exchange withdrawal transactions on MEXC were on the rise. It appeared at the time that users were moving their funds off the cryptocurrency platform. Burak Kesmeci, another prominent on-chain analyst, also noticed the big outflows from the MEXC exchange, likening this situation to that of the now-defunct FTX exchange. However, the crypto pundit later revealed that the exchange’s Bitcoin reserves are still intact . It’s worth mentioning that FTX’s Bitcoin reserves were found to have hit zero days before the exchange declared bankruptcy. Hence, if there is to be a repeat of such an incident, the Bitcoin reserves might be worth watching over the next few days.",MEXC|crypto|crypto exchange|crypto news|FTX,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 23:30:40

In recent weeks, XRP has traded within a narrow band between $2.20 and $2.60, attempting to recover from the October 10 market decline . After touching $2.69 on October 27, the token has since retreated to about $2.49 , recording three consecutive daily losses. During this pullback, XRP’s market capitalization declined by more than $8 billion, even though its unit price fell by only $0.14. While such fluctuations are meaningful to traders operating on short-term timeframes, Van Code emphasized that long-term investors should avoid focusing on minor price changes. His position reflects a broader investment mindset within the XRP community, one that prioritizes the potential for large-scale gains over short-term volatility. I used to wing about having to pay $0.80 for XRP when I bought for $0.20 or less. I knew one day it wouldn't matter, and I am even more confident that a 0.60 price difference won't matter at $100 — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 26, 2025 Small Price Gaps Become Meaningless Over Time Van Code recalled that he once felt uneasy about purchasing XRP at $0.80, having previously accumulated the token at prices near $0.20. At the time, paying more for the same asset seemed like a poor decision. However, his perspective changed as he began evaluating the market with a longer-term outlook. He noted that when an asset appreciates significantly, small differences in the initial purchase price fade in importance. For example, if XRP were to achieve a future value of $100, the difference between buying at $0.20 or $0.80 would hardly matter. In both cases, the investor would still see exponential gains. Historical data provides some context for this argument. XRP traded for as little as $0.21 in January 2021 before climbing to $1.96 by April that year. After the broader market downturn in 2022, it fell to $0.29, only to rebound above $0.90 by mid-2023. As of today, the asset trades at roughly $2.55, maintaining steady performance despite market uncertainty. Long-Term Confidence in XRP’s Future Van Code’s optimism stems from the belief that XRP could one day reach valuations similar to early Bitcoin levels. In 2011, Bitcoin fluctuated between $3 and $12; now it trades above $110,000. For those early investors, the difference between buying at $3 or $12 became irrelevant once the price increased more than ten thousandfold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Using this logic, Van Code suggested that if XRP were to climb to $100, minor differences in entry prices today would have little bearing on eventual returns. For instance, an investor spending $50,000 at $2.18 would obtain 22,935 XRP, while another buying at $2.55 would acquire 19,607 XRP. If XRP reached $100, those holdings would be valued at $2.29 million and $1.96 million, respectively. Although the two investors would see different absolute gains, both would achieve life-changing profits. In Van Code’s view, this underscores the importance of long-term conviction rather than obsessing over short-term entry points. While Van Code’s scenario assumes that XRP could reach $100, a target that remains speculative, his broader argument centers on investment discipline. He maintains that price fluctuations within a small range should not distract holders from the potential long-term value of the asset. For now, XRP’s short-term movements continue to capture market attention, but voices like Van Code’s encourage investors to evaluate the asset through a longer lens. Whether XRP reaches those projected highs or not, his remarks highlight a growing maturity in how parts of the crypto community assess value beyond short-term trading cycles.

On-Chain Data Says ‘Possibly’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-investors-in-accumulation-mode/,"After the market-wide downturn on October 10, the Bitcoin price showed no definite direction for the rest of the historically bullish month. At the moment, the premier cryptocurrency is struggling to gather any significant momentum to the upside. However, recent on-chain evaluation suggests that this period of relative silence could represent a springboard for the cryptocurrency’s sustained upswing. Sender/Receiver Ratio Falls To One-Year Low In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, pseudonymous analyst CryptoOnchain shared an interesting insight into Bitcoin’s future trajectory, leaning towards a bullish hypothesis in the report. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the Bitcoin Sender/Receiver Address Ratio, which compares the number of active sending (selling) addresses to receiving (buying) addresses. This metric acts as a means to gauge the prevalent market sentiment within a period of time. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Loading: Bullish Factors That Point To A Massive Surge A high ratio (with a reading above 1) indicates that there are more sending addresses compared to the buying addresses. As a result, there is expectedly greater selling pressure in this market condition. On the other hand, a low ratio (a reading approaching 1 and levels below) reflects the preponderance of buying addresses. CryptoOnchain reported that Bitcoin’s Sender/Receiver ratio on Binance has recently fallen to 1.34 — its lowest level in the past year. As previously explained, when this ratio falls to levels such as it currently reads, it usually indicates that there are more buying addresses relative to the amount of selling addresses in the market. This shift in investor leanings typically signals an accumulation phase, where more investors are willing to acquire Bitcoin on exchanges. Interestingly, the analyst also referenced historical evidence, explaining that periods where this shift in market sentiment occurred often preceded the establishment of local price bottoms. As of late 2024, the Sender/Receiver ratio fell to levels around 1.3, with significant upward movement following suit, and a similar pattern was seen in early 2023. According to CryptoOnchain, this current consolidation phase could signal that the market’s foundation is gaining strength. Thus, if history is anything to go by, Bitcoin’s price could see an immense upward boost in the days to come — one which could sponsor the world’s leading asset to see a fine amount of growth in the mid-term. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth approximately $109,899, reflecting no significant movement in the past day. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is down by nearly 2% in the past seven days.

His post on X invited XRP community members to join a “facts-only” debate, urging participants to rely on verifiable on-chain metrics rather than speculation. The move reflects growing tension between advocates of Solana’s expanding ecosystem and Ripple’s supporters, who often emphasize long-term institutional growth. Vibhu Questions XRP’s Network Activity Vibhu argued that many XRP supporters avoid discussing measurable on-chain trends. He said he respects Ripple’s innovation but believes its community should face data showing minimal progress. According to metrics he cited, XRP Ledger’s daily active accounts have hovered near 25,000 for about three years. “The numbers don’t lie,” Vibhu said, noting that XRP’s network has not kept pace with market developments. He contrasted this stagnation with Solana’s rapid growth, reporting more than 2.5 million active accounts daily. Consequently, he pointed out that Solana’s network processes far more real activity than XRP, highlighting a significant gap between both ecosystems. Vibhu stressed that low fees exist on both blockchains, so the disparity reflects user demand, not cost advantages. Comparing Volumes and Ecosystem Growth Besides user counts, Vibhu compared transactional and payment data to demonstrate Solana’s growing dominance. XRP Ledger reportedly handles 1 million to 1.5 million daily transactions, while Solana records roughly 100 million. Moreover, he noted that Solana’s stablecoin transfer volume hit nearly $2 trillion in October, while XRP’s monthly transfers remain between $50 billion and $60 billion. However, Ripple continues to expand its ecosystem through acquisitions and new initiatives. Its purchase of GTreasury and launch of Evernorth on Nasdaq show a push toward broader enterprise adoption. Additionally, Ripple’s upcoming DeFi roadmap aims to increase tokenization and stablecoin activity on the XRP Ledger, signaling potential recovery in future usage metrics. Live Debate to Settle the Data Dispute Vibhu invited Ripple executives to join a public debate where both sides present verifiable data. “I’ll bring facts,” he said, emphasizing that the event should remain factual and transparent. Former Ripple Director of Developer Relations Matt Hamilton accepted the challenge, while community figure King Solomon offered to host the debate. The upcoming discussion could reveal contrasting views on blockchain growth and user engagement, shaping how investors perceive Solana’s and XRP’s network strength in the evolving crypto landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|SOL|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-02 00:40:48

Pundit Shows What To Expect,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-facing-a-bear-market/,"Shiba Inu appears to be repeating a familiar market structure, according to a recent technical analysis shared by crypto trader IncomeSharks on X. The analyst highlighted how SHIB’s price history over the past two years reflects a cyclical pattern of short-lived rallies followed by prolonged downturns. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.00001007, showing little momentum to break free from its extended bearish grip. Is Shiba Inu’s Market Structure Looking Bearish? The analyst’s daily candlestick timeframe chart, which tracks Shiba Inu’s daily price action since early 2024, presents a visual timeline of its repeated boom-and-bust movements in recent years. The first major phase came in early 2024 when SHIB experienced a rapid one-month surge, its biggest move during the observed period. This move took place in just one month and saw the Shiba Inu price break above $0.00004. However, this bullish stretch was quickly followed by a six-month decline between March and September 2024 that erased much of the gains. The analyst noted that the next significant recovery phase lasted about three months, starting around September 2024 and ending in December, after which SHIB again entered a long-term bearish trend up until the time of writing. This recurring pattern of brief rallies and extended downturns paints a picture of the Shiba Inu price struggling to sustain upward momentum when compared to other cryptocurrencies. What To Expect If The Pattern Continues In his post, IncomeSharks summarized this cycle as “basically a two-year-long bear market that started with a wild pump and one little relief rally.” The statement echoes what the chart above shows: one sharp upward move followed by an extended sequence of red candles. As it stands, Shiba Inu is now into about 11 months of downward price action, making this one of its longest bearish phases to date. If SHIB’s current trajectory remains consistent with the pattern identified by the analyst, the token could face additional months of consolidation or decline before any significant rebound occurs. It also implies that traders hoping for a repeat of any parabolic surges may have to wait longer. Furthermore, Shiba Inu’s biggest uptrend within the two-year frame lasted just one month. This means that the next major bullish movement, whenever it happens, could arrive quickly but fade just as fast within a month if selling pressure resumes. This behavior is not limited to Shiba Inu; it reflects a wider sentiment that has gripped the entire meme coin market over the past year. Even Dogecoin, the king of meme coins, has struggled to maintain its momentum above $0.2 despite multiple attempts to reclaim its earlier highs. Each failed breakout has sent ripples across the meme coin sector, dampening enthusiasm and pulling other tokens like SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI into similar patterns of prolonged correction. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001007, up by 2.8% in the past 24 hours but down 20% in a 30-day timeframe.",Shiba Inu|dogecoin|Floki|IncomeSharks|Pepe|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 01:00:00

With institutional demand toward Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) benefiting from speculative hype, people are focusing fast on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency invading the DeFi space and now widely regarded as which crypto to buy today for short-term gains. At present in Phase 6 of the presale, MUTM is more than 80% sold out, and more than $18.27 million has been raised at $0.035 per token. Its dual-lending mechanism, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending, offers early investors the advantage of optimizing capital efficiency and profit in a market where liquidity is presently booming. As the Fed lowers rates, projects like MUTM, in its nascent stage, will be helped by increasing market demand for risk, allowing it to outshine mature altcoins. With only limited presale tokens available, this is a limited entry opportunity for investors deciding which crypto to buy today for short-term profits before a project that can potentially experience 10x or more growth as 2025 goes by. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Coiling for Its Next Giant Move as Volatility Squeezes Shiba Inu (SHIB) is revealing signs of a future massive volatility squeeze since price action is constricting in an increasing wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart. Consolidating at the moment within $0.0000108–$0.0000110, SHIB is poised well around its midline support level, meaning there is increasing tension prior to a breakout. The build-up from the $0.0000090 base, with an obvious pattern of higher highs and higher lows, creates a constructively technical setup. If bulls can break out above $0.0000115 on decent volume, the way is clear for a possible rally to $0.0000125–$0.0000135, or a fall below $0.0000098 would provoke a pullback to the $0.0000090–$0.0000088 accumulation range. With its technical foundations solidifying and traders watching expectantly, SHIB’s next move will be the impetus for high short-term volatility. In the meantime, while SHIB holders await the breakout, most are quietly looking away from the ball and onto Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new cryptocurrency with strong early momentum that many experts now say is the answer to the question which crypto to buy today for short-term profits. Solana (SOL) Attempts Key Neckline Support, Breakdown on the Horizon? Solana (SOL) is flashing warning signs as it takes shape in a Head & Shoulders pattern on the 1-hour chart, usually a sign of short-term reversals. The left shoulder has been created around $198, the head touched almost $205, and the right shoulder has been created around $202, while $192–$193 is still the crucial neckline support. Now, SOL is slightly higher in this area, and a confirmed breakdown from here would trigger an immediate decline toward $185–$180, which is in line with the entire measured move target. If bulls can hold the neckline and retrace to $200, though, the pattern will be broken, and there will be a relief rally to $205+. While short-term momentum is cautiously bullish, traders are optimistic that institutional demand can lead the trend of SOL to remain stable in the coming future. However, with uncertainty, most investors are quietly positioning themselves in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new cryptocurrency with rapidly growing presale traction that has been repeatedly labeled as which crypto to buy today for short-term gains due to its impressive early performance. Mutuum Finance: Shaping the Future of Decentralized Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly becoming one of the most innovative and dynamic new cryptocurrency projects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Operating well above all initial estimates, the venture has already captured the interest of over 17,660 investors and raised over $18.27 million in its current presale. This stellar performance has impressed investors and analysts as well, so Mutuum Finance is now at the top of every list for which crypto to buy today for short-term results and future stability. Early investors are expecting possible returns of almost 2x since the first launch of MUTM. Every earlier presale round has finished in record time, reflecting gigantic investor trust and building a solid early liquidity foundation before the mainnet launch. This continued organic demand is a clear reflection of the confidence that Mutuum Finance is not just another speculative bubble but a next-gen DeFi protocol with long-term sustainability and real-world application. Redefining Borrowing: Mutuum Finance’s Clear and Stable DeFi Model At the heart of Mutuum Finance is an innovative lending mechanism that aims to bring higher predictability, stability, and fairness to all in the DeFi lending market. Advance repayment fees can be negotiated by borrowers, and interest rates are dynamically adjusted to reflect market conditions. While fixed-rate models might appear higher at first glance versus floating rates, they provide a critical layer of security, safeguarding users from unexpected rate spikes and volatility risks. With the introduction of fixed-rate lending in decentralized communities, Mutuum Finance provides a more equitable, transparent, and user-friendly process for borrowing. It’s a first step toward building decentralized finance on protection, clarity, and long-term trust. Mutuum Finance is not only revolutionizing how DeFi functions; it is establishing new standards for how decentralized finance can engage with global users in a stable and predictable manner. With the Fed rate cut, shareholders are looking for high-upside assets. Mutuum Finance, currently at $0.035 and more than 80% sold in Phase 6, has already achieved $18.27M. With real-world applications in DeFi and robust demand, MUTM is clearly which crypto to buy today for short-term, and it stands tall as the new cryptocurrency leading the next wave of financial innovation before 2025’s bull trend.

53922874,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88357,1762045234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Projection If Ripple Cuts Escrow Supply by 20%,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-projection-if-ripple-cuts-escrow-supply-by-20/,"The possibility of Ripple reducing the XRP escrow by a significant percentage has been a recurring topic among community members. Many investors believe that a supply cut could potentially drive the token’s value higher, while others question whether such an event would produce any measurable market impact. Currently, XRP’s total supply stands at 99.9 billion tokens, with approximately 60 billion in circulation and 35 billion locked in escrow under Ripple’s control. The escrow system was created to release XRP into the market gradually, ensuring a predictable supply and limiting excessive liquidity. However, some community members argue that the large reserve continues to create uncertainty and concerns. Evaluating a Hypothetical Supply Reduction To better understand the potential outcome, Google’s Gemini model was asked to simulate a scenario in which Ripple removes 20% of XRP’s total supply through token burns. The model emphasized that the market response to such a move would ultimately depend on broader factors, including investor sentiment, adoption trends, and regulatory clarity. Under this theoretical case, a 20% reduction would eliminate roughly 19.98 billion XRP, decreasing the total supply to about 79.92 billion tokens. If this burn were applied solely to the escrow holdings, Ripple’s reserve would shrink from 35 billion to about 15 billion XRP, while the circulating supply would remain constant at 60 billion tokens. Short-Term Versus Long-Term Effects According to Gemini’s analysis, the immediate market effect of such a burn would likely be limited because no change would occur in the number of tokens currently traded. However, reducing the future available supply could create favorable long-term dynamics. If market demand for XRP remains steady or grows, a smaller total supply might apply upward pressure on the asset’s valuation over time. Gemini explained that similar patterns have been observed in traditional asset markets, where supply reductions can enhance value provided there is consistent or rising demand. Yet, it also noted that macroeconomic factors, competition among blockchain networks, and investor confidence would heavily influence the outcome. Modeling a Bullish Outcome Gemini further developed a theoretical “high-optimism” case to demonstrate potential price effects under ideal market conditions. This model assumes several supportive factors, sustained adoption of the XRP Ledger, favorable regulatory developments, and broad investor enthusiasm following the burn. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In this scenario, Gemini estimated XRP’s total market capitalization could rise to approximately $4 trillion, representing nearly a 28-fold increase over its current valuation of about $144 billion. Based on a circulating supply of 60 billion XRP, this would translate to an indicative price near $66.67 per token, an increase of over 2,600% from the current price level of around $2.53 Gemini emphasized that these figures are theoretical calculations meant to illustrate potential outcomes rather than actual forecasts. The platform noted that market reactions to supply burns are unpredictable and depend on sentiment and adoption momentum. Supporting this caution, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz previously commented that reducing the total supply might not necessarily raise the token’s price. He referred to the Stellar (XLM) supply burn in 2019, which had little lasting impact on market valuation. While a 20% reduction of Ripple’s escrow could theoretically strengthen XRP’s long-term outlook by lowering available supply, the actual effect would depend on demand-side factors, overall market conditions, and investor behavior. The hypothetical price of $66.67 represents an optimistic case under perfect circumstances rather than a guaranteed projection. Ultimately, analysts agree that although supply mechanics are important, the key drivers of XRP’s value will remain adoption, real-world utility, and broader confidence in the asset’s role within the digital payments ecosystem.

CEO David Baszucki said the plan is to finish the rollout by the end of the year. In his words:- “We’re going to use AI to estimate the age of every single person on Roblox. We expect to have this done all by the end of this year.” This is aimed at dealing with ongoing concerns about minors on the platform and how they interact with others. Investors did not react positively. Roblox stock fell on Friday after the company presented this safety push along with comments about increased spending planned for 2026. Even with that drop, shares are still up more than 93% this year. In the third quarter, Roblox reported revenue of $1.36 billion, which was a 48% jump compared to last year and above estimates of $1.09 billion. But the company also posted a net loss of $257.4 million, compared to $240.4 million last year. Bookings grew 70% year over year, and daily active users were also up 70%. Even with that growth, management warned that higher capital expenses are coming, and that the new facial age estimation system may create what they described as “engagement friction.” Wall Street did not like the sound of that. Analysts highlight risk to engagement metrics JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter rates Roblox Overweight. He said the new facial estimation feature may reduce player usage as users get used to the process. Carpenter wrote, “Facial estimation is the primary safety initiative that could impact engagement next year. Mgmt thinks it’s prudent to expect some initial friction, but it’s hard to quantify at this point.” Roblox has built its model around players spending long periods of time inside its worlds. Any slowdown is something investors will watch closely. Baszucki described the system as part of Roblox’s broader safety framework. He said the company wants to create what he called a “gold standard for communication safety on the internet,” pointing to strict text filters and bans on image or video sharing in chats. He added that the AI age system has already been tested internally. “It’s really quite elegant,” he said. “I’m very optimistic that any friction that we might see from this is actually beneficial to us in the long run.” The company is also under legal pressure. A lawsuit in Florida claimed Roblox did not do enough to prevent minors from encountering harmful content. Roblox has denied these claims. Regulators and lawmakers are also pushing all major platforms to improve age verification and safety tools. Other platforms are moving too. Instagram applies PG-13 restrictions to users under 18. Verification process may create user pushback A third of Roblox’s 150 million daily active users are under 13. That makes safety changes more urgent, but also more complicated. The facial estimation process takes about 30 seconds and requires players to turn on their camera and rotate their head. This could be harder on consoles and mobile devices. Carpenter noted that Roblox users spend an average of 2.5 hours per day on the platform, and any feature that interrupts that routine could weaken engagement. Roblox currently runs more than 400 AI systems across the platform, including systems for generating new game content, moderating chat, and translating languages. The company is also building new data centers to support its AI work. Baszucki said new 4D generative tools are coming that will let users create objects simply by talking. Even with short-term concerns, Carpenter remains positive on the business.He expects bookings to grow 20% next year and believes margins will start improving again by 2027. Carpenter did, however, cut his 2026 price target from $160 to $145. He wrote, “There’s no debate around the near-term platform momentum.” Get seen where it counts.

Based on reports, the analyst used a two-month chart to compare current price action with the buildup that preceded a breakout in March 2017. Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 20% – But Some Think This Is When The Real Gains Start Back then, DOGE climbed from about $0.0003 to $0.0194 by January 2018, a rally of 7%. Traders pointing to that episode say the current narrowing range looks familiar and could set the stage for a notable move. Market Moves This Month DOGE is trading at around $0.18 at the time of writing after a 20% drop so far this October. That decline contrasts with recent Octobers: a 40% rise in October 2024, a 10% gain in October 2023, and a 100% jump in October 2022. Prices have been compressing inside the triangle since late 2024, and the tighter range has increased talk among chart watchers that a breakout may be near. $DOGE/2-month#Dogecoin is following its first cycle 🚀 pic.twitter.com/FNFJo3C59I — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) October 30, 2025 Targets After A Breakout Analysts who favor the pattern point to a first target near $3.90, which would represent about a 2,000% gain from current levels if reached. Other, much bolder projections are also being shared. One chart shown by bulls extends toward $48 — a 26,500% rise — which, if circulating supply stayed near 151 billion tokens, would imply a market value near $7 trillion. That number would dwarf most global asset classes and is widely seen as highly unlikely. Reports have also referenced an $18 forecast last month, a level that would make many holders wealthy if it materialized, but it remains a long shot. Technical Patterns Versus Broader Forces Pattern recognition can offer a clear rule for traders, but charts do not capture everything that drives price. Liquidity levels, investor interest, moves in Bitcoin, and shifts in social attention all affect how far any rally can run.

Why the $NNZ Stage BURN Confirms Noomez Is on the 1000x Path,https://timestabloid.com/next-crypto-to-explode-why-the-nnz-stage-burn-confirms/,"Every cycle has that one token everyone talks about before it takes off. This time, traders say Noomez ($NNZ) could be it. With Stage 2 of its presale now live and the first automatic Stage Burn already underway for unsold tokens, the countdown has started. The project’s mix of deflation, rewards, and transparent mechanics has investors asking a single question: could this be the next crypto to explode before the next market rally begins? Why Noomez ($NNZ) Is Being Called the Next Crypto to Explode Noomez ($NNZ) has entered Stage 2 of its meme coin presale , and momentum is building fast. The project runs on the Binance Smart Chain with a fixed supply of 280 billion tokens , of which 140 billion are reserved for the presale. Prices rise across 28 stages , starting from $0.00001 and ending at $0.0028 , creating a clear, transparent path that rewards early buyers. Each stage lasts up to seven days or until sold out, and any unsold tokens are automatically burned , reducing the circulating supply. One wallet per stage also wins the Stage X Million Airdrop , matching the stage number in millions of $NNZ, for example, 2 million $NNZ in Stage 2 or 28 million in Stage 28 . With this level of structure and deflation, many traders now believe Noomez could answer the question of which crypto will explode in 2025. Stage Burn System: How Noomez Turns Unsold Tokens Into Value One of the most unique features of Noomez ($NNZ) is its Stage Burn system , a built-in mechanism that removes unsold tokens at the end of every stage. This constant reduction in supply keeps the token deflationary and helps strengthen price stability as the presale advances. The Noom Gauge visually tracks progress, lighting up with each completed stage and adding to community excitement. Core mechanics: Automatic burns after each stage closes. Transparent seven-day stage cycle. Fixed rising price curve from $0.00001 to $0.0028. Burn data displayed publicly for verification. By removing excess supply and maintaining a clear structure, Noomez keeps the focus on scarcity and fairness. These mechanics have led traders to call it the next crypto coin to explode , as every stage completion tightens the path toward higher valuations. Vault Events, Stage X Airdrops, and Real Rewards for Holders Vault Events At Stage 14 and Stage 28 , Noomez unlocks special Vaults that deliver massive $NNZ rewards, surprise bonuses, and additional burns. The Stage 28 Vault marks the presale finale, closing with a live one-hour countdown and the biggest prize pool of the campaign. Each Vault also removes a significant portion of tokens from circulation, strengthening the deflationary model. Stage X Airdrops Each presale stage gives one buyer a reward equal to the stage number in millions of $NNZ. This creates 28 total airdrops , ranging from 1 million in Stage 1 to 28 million in Stage 28 , all chosen transparently through random draws. Referral Rewards Noomez also offers a 10% bonus for both the referrer and the buyer on every verified referral. This system rewards community growth, motivates sharing, and ensures that early supporters gain consistent value throughout the presale. Why $NNZ’s Deflationary Design and Staking Model Signal Long-Term Growth The real strength of Noomez ($NNZ) comes after the presale ends. Its staking program allows holders to lock tokens for 30 to 365 days , with higher rewards for longer commitments. These pools are fueled by the Noom Stake reserve and reinforced by the Noom Engine , which will send partner token drops directly to $NNZ holders after launch. Each element is designed to keep activity flowing and discourage early selling. This system connects presale momentum with post-launch value, creating steady engagement instead of short-lived hype. With multiple income streams, a shrinking supply, and an expanding reward base, traders are starting to treat Noomez as more than just a meme coin. Many now see it as the strongest contender for what is the next crypto to explode heading into the next market cycle. Pro Tip: Locking $NNZ in staking pools early may maximize rewards and align you with long-term presale growth.

It’s the classic setup before the next big rally. As Bitcoin ETFs continue attracting inflows and the overall market sentiment turns bullish again, 2025 is gearing up to be a pivotal year for digital assets.

Despite recent indecisive candles, the setup suggests that one strong bullish move could quickly shift sentiment and reignite momentum toward higher targets. Chainlink Faces Mixed Signals As Monthly Candle Closes Bearish In his Chainlink daily technical outlook, crypto analyst CryptoWzrd began by reviewing the higher timeframes, noting that the monthly candle for LINK closed slightly bearish. Additionally, the LINK/BTC pair closed its monthly candle indecisively, reflecting a lack of clear momentum against Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the daily candles for both closed indecisively, setting an ambiguous tone for the near term. Related Reading: Chainlink Eyes 300% Upside As Road To $46 Forms – Analyst CryptoWzrd emphasizes that the LINK/BTC pair must move upside to inject meaningful momentum. For this to happen, LINK/BTC needs to hold above the $0.000170 BTC resistance level, which would generate the initial bullish sentiment required for Chainlink to begin its ascent toward the first major target. If the necessary bullish sentiment is secured, the altcoin is expected to be pushed toward the $20 daily resistance target. The analyst highlights that achieving a healthy bullish breakout above $20 is the critical event that will trigger the next major upside rally and confirm a stronger directional trend. On the other hand, CryptoWzrd identifies the $16 level as the main daily support for the current structure. This price point must hold to prevent a deeper correction that would jeopardize the current bullish targets. The analyst has stated that his focus for the immediate future will shift to the lower timeframe chart formations tomorrow. This micro-analysis will be crucial for identifying the best scalp opportunities as the market continues to consolidate near these critical structural levels. Choppy Intraday Action Keeps Traders On Edge CryptoWzrd went further to reveal that LINK’s intraday chart has been choppy and slow, reflecting bearishness in the market. Despite the lack of strong momentum, the price is still holding above the $16.90 level, which remains a positive sign for the bulls in the short term. Also, the analyst emphasized that a further upside move is necessary to confirm a constructive chart formation and create a potential long opportunity. Related Reading: Chainlink To $100? Analyst Says This Breakout Could Be The Trigger Without that breakout, the structure remains fragile, and traders could face difficulty finding reliable entry points for bullish setups. A drop below $16.90 could trigger a deeper decline, putting additional pressure on Chainlink. CryptoWzrd concluded that patience remains key in navigating the current indecisive phase, as it’s best to wait for the next clear signal or trading setup before making any major moves.

The premier cryptocurrency dropped beneath the psychological $110,000 level despite the interest rate cut decision by the United States Federal Reserve on Wednesday, October 29. The tame reaction of the Bitcoin price—and other large-cap assets—has raised concerns about the viability of the crypto market in the current cycle. Nevertheless, a prominent blockchain firm CEO has predicted that, although the bull cycle might be coming to an end, the market leader might just be days away from a new all-time high price. BTC Could Peak Between $143,000 – $146,000: CEO In an October 31st post on the X platform, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson revealed that the price of Bitcoin could run up to a new all-time high in the short term. The crypto expert put the potential cycle peak for the flagship cryptocurrency at a price between $143,000 and $146,000. This evaluation revolves around the Max Intersect SMA Model (the blue line), which has accurately identified the price peaks of previous BTC cycles. Wedson’s analysis expects the Bitcoin price to soon reach a new all-time high (and the cycle peak), as the cycle is currently in its final stage (the distribution phase). According to the Alphractal CEO, the Bitcoin Smart Model price (the blue line) recently jumped from around $60,000 and now stands at $62,664. Wedson noted that once this Smart Model price gets close to the $68,000 region, that could represent the exact day of a new all-time high for the Bitcoin price. Furthermore, Wedson highlighted the current sideways movement of the Bitcoin price as a result of the market hunting for liquidity up and down during the current distribution phase. “Now, many are afraid to sell, confident we’ll shoot straight to $250K — which, historically, is the classic signature of a distribution phase,” the crypto founder said. Ultimately, Wedson warned that the bear market could arrive sooner than expected; hence, investors should approach the market with caution. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $110,120, reflecting a mere 0.1% increase in the past 24 hours. While the premier cryptocurrency seems to be recovering fairly, the last day’s slight jump is not enough to cover the past week’s loss. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is down by over 1% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 02:30:49

However, this perspective overlooks a more profound truth, and there are two distinct and complementary manifestations of the same enduring monetary revolution. How Bitcoin And Gold Perform Under Different Conditions The narrative behind the ongoing Bitcoin and gold war is often missed. In an X post , Ayni Gold has offered an insightful perspective on the matter, arguing that both assets are value rails with different powers and have been winning in their lanes. Ayni Gold highlighted that adoption is broad on both sides. The Bitcoin network has evolved into a multi-trillion-dollar asset class, with its market capitalization hovering around $2.2 trillion, powered by record ETF inflows this month. Meanwhile, the gold role is strengthening, not fading. Central banks have accumulated heavily through Q3 2025, and expect to continue increasing their reserves over the next five years. Furthermore, the tokenized gold led by XAUT and PAXG has surpassed $2.5 billion in market value . This digital evolution of gold will lower frictions for transfer and fractional access relative to many legacy rails. While it doesn’t erase custodians, it effectively compresses the intermediary stack for more users. The core of this is to stop picking tribes to manage risk . Ayni Gold advocates acquiring both assets and letting them do their job. This suggests a balanced portfolio, with BTC for permissionless, high-beta digital scarcity and global settlement, and gold for durability through macro cycles. Both are different instruments, yet they share the same goal of preserving and maintaining purchasing power. However, Ayni Gold mentioned that they are building practical rails between physical gold and Ethereum so more people can access gold-linked rewards transparently. BTC And Gold As Pillars Of Financial Resilience While Bitcoin and gold have long shared a deep macro correlation, an investor in crypto and blockchain, Batman, has noted that when analyzing Bitcoin and gold performance cycles closely, there tends to be a time lag before BTC catches up with gold. Meanwhile, a closer look at the data over the past two years reveals that the time lag of BTC and gold has consistently ranged between 77 and 98 days. Presently, data shows that gold has rallied for nine weeks straight and is showing signs of topping out after a sustained surge in prices. According to the expert, this move also marks 77 days from when gold started rallying. If the longest time observed lag is around 98 days, then it won’t take long before BTC catches up to gold.",Bitcoin News|Ayni Gold|Batman|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Central Banks|gold|PAXG|xaut,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 04:00:39

Serving as the current head of Product Marketing at the Solana Foundation with a broad experience in web3 technology, Vibhu made this invitation via the X platform, motivating any individual from the XRP community to engage in a “facts-only” discussion. Vibhu criticizes the community for ignoring existing data on the XRP network Norby said his goal is to confront what he views as widespread misconceptions about the XRP network’s actual performance metrics . According to him, he is optimistic about Ripple and XRP succeeding in the ecosystem. However, Vibhu criticized the community for ignoring existing data that illustrates limited growth. He acknowledged that although it is fine to believe in future adoption, the current on-chain information implies otherwise. The crypto leader’s remarks noted years of stagnation in XRP’s network activity, in contrast to fast-growing blockchains such as Solana. Citing data from XRPScan, Vibhu highlighted that the total number of daily active accounts on the XRP Ledger over the last three years has remained around 25,000. His statement followed a recent announcement that Evernorth, a new venture in the crypto industry backed by digital asset firm Ripple, has been listed on Nasdaq. Following this announcement, analysts believe the listing will expand XRP’s footprint among institutional investors. Meanwhile, in contrast to XRP’s daily active accounts, Solana reportedly has over 2.5 million daily active accounts, illustrating a notable difference. Based on Vibhu’s argument, this situation has sparked heated debates, as XRP has been in the market for a long time and has a valuable ecosystem. The CEO also shared statistics illustrating the XRP Ledger’s daily transactions, which showed that the blockchain processes approximately 1 million to 1.5 million transactions daily. Sources commented that this figure has only surged slightly over time. When comparing the transaction figure with that of Solana, the sources that wished to remain anonymous mentioned that Solana’s daily transactions amount to about 100 million. Regarding the results, Vibhu argued that this comparison underscores how much more active Solana’s network has become in real-world applications. Vibhu expresses optimism about Ripple and XRP succeeding in the ecosystem In an X post dated November 1, Vibhu expressed that he wants Ripple and XRP to achieve a remarkable milestone, allowing the entire industry to progress. Afterwards, he stated that the community usually ignores facts even when the data is easily accessible. He admitted finding this frustrating as someone who has served as an engineer for a long time and is seeking the truth. In the meantime, after researching, analysts discovered that XRP transfers total approximately $50 billion to $60 billion monthly. In comparison, data from Blockworks, cited by Vibhu, showed that Solana’s stablecoin transfer volume nearly reached $2 trillion in October. Despite these figures, XRP Ledger’s native token, XRP, ended the third quarter on a strong note as it closed at an all-time high of $2.85, up 27.2% quarter-over-quarter. Its circulating market capitalization rose 29% to $170.3 billion, outperforming the combined 13.3% gain in market cap posted by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana over the same period. Nonetheless, the token’s momentum cooled in October as broader market sentiment turned negative following hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. XRP has plunged by 12% over the past month, dropping to around $2.50 amid heavy selling pressure. This event fueled discussions on the reasons underpinning XRP’s value and utility in the real world. Popular trader and analyst Scott Melker, also known as The Wolf of All Streets, questioned the purpose of the crypto. Then the analyst obtained information that SWIFT and Western Union do not employ this currency, which implies that it is not a crucial alternative. However, XRP defenders appear to be unaffected by the bearish warning, describing the coin as a “neutral bridge” for use in audits. In brief, Melker recognized the currency as a temporary structure but did not believe in its long-term potential.

The company highlighted the development in a brief post. The data showed a sharp rise in institutional participation in a market launched only months ago. The surge in volume demonstrates that interest in regulated XRP derivatives has moved beyond novelty and into active market use. When CME first introduced XRP futures in May 2025 , initial trading was measured in the thousands of contracts. By the first month, over 24,000 contracts had been traded . Within five months, that figure has scaled significantly, suggesting that the product has found consistent liquidity and a growing pool of counterparties willing to engage through regulated infrastructure. 9.9K XRP futures contracts traded on October 27, a new record.

These contracts clear through CME Clearing, ensuring that all counterparties trade within a regulated, risk-managed environment. The exchange has also expanded its offering with options on XRP futures, introduced in October. This addition enables more sophisticated trading strategies, providing flexibility for institutions seeking to manage volatility or hedge positions tied to XRP. The inclusion of both futures and options makes XRP one of the few cryptocurrencies with a complete derivatives suite on a U.S.-regulated exchange.

The availability of regulated derivatives often signals that institutional traders are treating the asset as a legitimate market instrument rather than a speculative token. The strong performance of CME’s XRP futures also indicates that the market is ready for spot XRP ETFs . Their steady volume, transparent pricing, and institutional participation demonstrate sufficient maturity, liquidity, and oversight to justify the approval of a regulated spot product. CME’s expansion into XRP derivatives has created a gateway for traditional financial institutions to engage with the asset class in a compliant manner. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF is already making waves in the market, and with CME’s XRP futures breaking records, the SEC may find growing justification to advance approval for additional spot XRP ETF applications awaiting review.

Leaves fall, chart lines climb, and portfolios wake up like they had a triple espresso. Every cycle, there is a moment when the market stops yawning and starts itching like a mosquito bite you cannot ignore. That moment looks like right now. Traders are scanning charts, crypto Twitter is cooking, and whispers are growing louder around one tiny mosquito-themed memecoin sneaking toward the next 100x crypto in Q4 crown. Meanwhile, familiar meme heavyweights stretch their paws, wings, and feathers as the market heats up. This list is not for the weak pockets or sleepy fingers. It is for those who track sentiment, meme momentum, community traction, and real token mechanics. In Q4 2025, one thing is clear. Dogs may bark, frogs may ribbit, but the mosquito is buzzing and wallets are itching. So buckle up. Time to walk through 10 coins to watch and La Culex , with one tiny troublemaker flying ahead as the next 100x crypto in Q4 contender that nobody wants to swat away. 1. La Culex: The Tiny Biter With Big Plans and a Swarm Growing Fast While other memes roar, La Culex hums in the shadows and bites where it counts. The project positions itself as the mosquito of crypto and leans into the identity with comic power and practical mechanics. The La Culex presale comes packed with staking, referral rewards, and token burns, creating a combo of humor and economic value. That blend gives the Culex presale a unique sting. Instead of depending only on memes and vibes, the La Culex price structure rewards early conviction and provides a model that encourages long-term participation. That formula is how strong meme runs often begin. This buzzing token sits in Stage 3, the Bug Spray Dip, with a La Culex price of $0.00002274. Over 50 holders already joined the swarm and more than 400 million tokens are sold with a presale tally above $8,000. A scheduled jump of roughly 8.091 percent takes the price to $0.00002458 soon. With a projected listing price of $0.007, La Culex currently stands at a staggering 30,683 percent theoretical upside from where it sits today if its targets hit. Early support already shows 16.8 percent growth before full public expansion. A $5,500 allocation unlocks nearly 241,890,000 CULEX tokens, and at listing those tokens translate to roughly $1,692,960 potential based on projected price. That level of upside is why traders are whispering about this mosquito and calling it the next 100x crypto in Q4 before the swarm becomes too large to stop. 2. Dogecoin: The Meme Grandfather That Still Wags Strong Dogecoin still stands as the original crypto comedian. It built culture before culture became a metric in token valuation. Despite years in the arena, it keeps surprising markets with renewed strength during bull phases. Dogecoin’s community behavior has proven time and time again that memes do not lose power. They mature. The dog continues to run with the pack, but with a golden-retriever type of confidence that says: “Relax. We bark when it counts.” Beyond its humor, Dogecoin benefits from massive brand trust and global awareness. Every cycle, new traders rediscover its charm and buy in, while long-time holders celebrate a familiar pattern. The coin does not pretend to be anything but itself. In a market full of over-engineered promises, the simplicity becomes its strength. Dogecoin may not be the next 100x crypto in Q4, but it still plays like a veteran striker who knows exactly when to attack the goal. 3. Shiba Inu: The Pack Leader With an Ecosystem Mindset Shiba Inu holds community power like few others. The ShibArmy built a culture that feels more like a digital nation than a token group. From decentralized applications and DeFi tools to layer expansion and burning strategies, Shiba Inu evolved into a serious ecosystem in the meme world. The passion behind the project creates consistent momentum, especially when market sentiment turns bullish. As traders gear up for seasonal runs, SHIB positions itself as a reliable force that charges hard when momentum flows. The community amplifies market moves and rallies with conviction. Shiba Inu may not race toward the next 100x crypto in Q4, but it could lead the early marches and ignite wide meme participation. When retail enthusiasm returns, Shiba typically sits near the front of the parade. 4. Pepe: The Frog With Wild Market Reflexes Pepe entered the market like a meme predator emerging from the bushes. It jumped, leaped, and croaked its way into massive liquidity storms early in its lifecycle. The internet culture gave it wings, and traders gave it markets. This token represents raw Web3 humor and unpredictable acceleration potential during high-sentiment phases. Pepe fits the mold of a meme with bite, not bark. Even now, traders watch it closely because Pepe has a knack for surprising the charts when attention spikes. Its brand sticks across platforms and communities, making it a reliable volatility play in the right environment. Pepe may not take the next 100x crypto in Q4 crown, but it stays ready to sprint the second meme volume rises. 5. Official Trump: The Nothing-Is-Calm Coin Official Trump rides the digital energy of politics, and politics never sleeps. Controversy fuels engagement, and engagement fuels crypto moves. Whether someone loves or hates the theme, they still talk about it, share memes about it, and debate the sentiment around it. That alone broadcasts strong viral fuel for market activity. Every election cycle or major policy moment creates more conversation around this token. In a space where eyes equal liquidity, Official Trump sits positioned for narrative bursts. It may not chase the crown for the next 100x crypto in Q4 , but it certainly will not sit quietly in a bull cycle. It is built for engagement, and engagement runs markets. 6. Bonk: Solana’s Hyper Mascot With Speed Bonk thrives on Solana’s velocity and community rhythm. Where the Solana ecosystem pumps, Bonk follows, powered by culture and chain loyalty. The mascot energy gives this token personality, and personality matters in meme market psychology. Bonk shows stamina across cycles while pushing fresh bursts during bullish sentiment. Two things make Bonk compelling. First, Solana continues climbing in developer and trading adoption, according to reports from Electric Capital and Messari. Second, chain loyalty rallies often start with mascot tokens. Bonk stands strong, and while it may not match the next 100x crypto in Q4 potential of La Culex, it continues to swing loud in meme season. 7. Floki: Branding Muscle Everywhere You Look Floki made marketing a personality trait. Billboards, sponsorships, sports ads, social campaigns, and global visibility made the mascot recognizable far outside crypto echo chambers. It carries structured branding power while still holding meme personality. The mix turns Floki into an evergreen meme option when markets heat. Floki’s push toward utility and expansion, according to updates shared on its documentation and dev channels, gives long-term holders reason to stay confident. The token does not need chaos to rally. It needs attention, and Q4 is rarely slow on attention. While it might not take the next 100x crypto in Q4 crown, it has one of the strongest public brand foundations in meme culture. 8. Dogwifhat: The Hat That Became Iconic Dogwifhat rose as an aesthetic token. A dog in a hat sounds simple, but it formed a visual identity that stuck online. In crypto, identity is half the battle. This meme thrives on creative energy and Solana enthusiasm. As momentum builds, traders often rotate into this type of playful yet strong-culture coin. In bull conditions, social image tokens shine. Dogwifhat holds that advantage. And while La Culex builds utility and narrative to chase the next 100x crypto in Q4 , Dogwifhat holds its hat proudly waiting for markets to heat and memers to assemble again. 9. Pudgy Penguins: The Web3 Plush King Pudgy Penguins bring real-world crossover strength. Toys, partnerships, physical brand presence, and online identity blend into a hybrid crypto-retail movement. That allows this token to perform even outside pure crypto volatility cycles. The penguin community loves storytelling and creative culture, making it unique in the list. This token does not chase chaotic meme swings. It builds presence. That stability gives it long-term staying power. While not the wild candidate for next 100x crypto in Q4, Pudgy Penguins still slide into bull seasons with smooth confidence and brand charm. 10. Brett: The “I Came to Cause Chaos” Coin With Cult Volume Brett stormed its way into the meme arena with pure attitude and relentless conviction from its fanbase. It did not arrive shy or polite. It rolled in like someone kicked open the digital door and yelled “vibes only” before dancing across charts. Traders gravitated to Brett because it embraced chaos with personality, not confusion. It knew it was a meme, but it carried itself with confidence like a humorous heavyweight. With every new volatile stretch of the market, attention naturally comes back to Brett, because unpredictable tokens with personality tend to shine hardest when the market starts heating. Conclusion: Swarms Win Markets, and New Blood Moves Fast Crypto bull seasons turn into stampedes. Coins run, traders sprint, and memes evolve into million-dollar stories. The list above highlights every flavor of momentum: classics, mascots, culture builders, chaos magnets, and one mosquito with a sharp stinger. Each coin brings fire when market heat returns, but only one is still in presale positioning itself to become the next 100x crypto in Q4 with swarm momentum and structured token mechanics. La Culex does not try to bark louder than dog memes or dress in silly hats. It takes a different route: bite first, reward believers, burn tokens for strength, and stack referral swarm mechanics like a mosquito hive taking over a summer lake house. With price stages rising every few days and the La Culex presale filling faster than ankles during camping nights, timing matters more than hype. The La Culex price sits at mosquito-size but dreams in swarm scale. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official CULEX Website Telegram: Join the CULEX Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow CULEX ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About the Next 100x Crypto in Q4 What makes La Culex different from other meme coins? La Culex stands out due to actual token mechanics including staking rewards, referral incentives, and planned burns. Instead of relying only on memes, it builds loyalty loops and supply reduction, allowing early swarm members to stack position strength before full market attention arrives. Why do meme coins gain momentum during bull markets? Bull runs trigger increased retail participation and viral investor behavior. Meme coins thrive when culture meets liquidity. When sentiment rises, humor spreads, communities pile in, and speculative capital flows into tokens that offer story plus emotional energy. Is La Culex early in its journey? Yes. The La Culex presale is still in early stages with stage-based price jumps. This means early buyers receive lower entry points before the La Culex price increases and the public listing approaches. Early networks usually create higher upside potentials. Glossary Meme Coin A cryptocurrency driven by community and internet culture instead of traditional financial fundamentals. Presale A token sale before public listing where early participants enter at lower price stages. Token Burns Permanent removal of tokens from supply to increase scarcity and strengthen economics over time. Staking Locking tokens to earn rewards, support network activity, or participate in ecosystem incentives. Community Momentum Market power generated by active meme culture, social media participation, and viral appeal. Summary This editorial compares La Culex with leading meme coins and highlights why it may rise as the next 100x crypto in Q4. The article describes bull market behavior, meme coin psychology, and cultural power in crypto cycles. It explains La Culex token mechanics including staking, referrals, burns, and presale stage growth. It also analyzes Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Official Trump, Bonk, Floki, Dogwifhat, Pudgy Penguins, and Brett through meme momentum, brand strength, and liquidity behavior while positioning La Culex as the only early-phase entry with utility plus viral branding. Tone stays fun, meme-centric, and energetic while maintaining clarity and investment transparency. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

She used this sentiment to convey that the soon-to-be-launched central bank digital currency would be a powerful tool to promote financial independence and facilitate payments within the European Union. According to the statement, the ECB would guarantee that anyone in Europe could have access to public money, now that payments are more digitized. The full text of her remarks was published online. She explained that the digital euro would coexist with physical cash rather than replace it. According to Lagarde, the currency forms would be used together to ensure maximum payment coverage and inclusion. The digital euro would enable citizens across the continent to make instant online and offline payments, either quickly or at no charge, in all member states. According to the ECB, the initiative aims to provide a publicly owned alternative to private payment providers such as Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Pay. ECB pushes digital euro for unity and trust The president emphasized that Europe should establish a timetable that enables it to maintain its position in the digital world and reduce its reliance on non-European banking and other systems. In the latter part of October 2025, the Governing Council of the ECB convened and decided to proceed with the “preparation phase,” where the technical blueprint for the E-euro will be created. Such activities, according to the president, involve setting up computing systems, securing infrastructure, and implementing robust privacy safeguards, which allow individuals to transact freely and securely. At a related news conference on Wednesday, Fabio Panetta, an ECB Executive Board member in charge of the project, emphasized that the digital euro will offer privacy at least as strong as that of existing electronic payments. There is no reason to be concerned that the currency would remove liquidity from commercial banks, according to the bank. The ECB has stated that the digital euro may supplement private banks by providing a secure means of digital central bank money for everyday use. At that time, the ECB aims to launch the digital euro by 2027, with full deployment possible by 2029, depending on lawmakers’ ability to pass the necessary legislation. During the pilot project, alternative scenarios will be played. These scenarios include transfers from one individual to another, offline transactions, and cross-border transactions, all of which will be carried out within the Eurozone. According to the initial estimates on pricing, the project could be worth approximately €1.3 billion to develop and test, with annual operating costs of around €320 million. Currently, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are considering a bill that would enable the ECB to issue its own digital currency. Despite skepticism about privacy, security, and financial stability, Lagarde believes that stringent data security measures, combined with the public’s trust in the ECB, will support the integrity of the system. Most importantly, Lagarde argues that the digital euro will support user preferences rather than regulation. Critics challenge the ECB over digital control Critics in the crypto space argue that such systems run counter to the decentralization ethos, and that creating a central bank digital currency enables real-time surveillance of your payments. Analysts believe that totalitarian governments will soon emerge, possessing excessive control over their citizens’ ability to spend money. Last week, French conservative Éric Ciotti submitted a bill to ban the e-euro and advocate for Bitcoin as a moneyless alternative. Similarly, Alternative für Deutschland called on aficionados to e-petition Parliament to designate Bitcoin a vital national priority. Lagarde said the bank’s goal is to offer users an option to make and receive euro-based payments that are inclusive, confidential, and distinctly European.

Wallets can wait,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/web3-gaming-without-barriers-starts-instantly-with-sachi-fun-comes-first-wallets-can-wait/,"[Dubai, UAE] For years, one of the single biggest hurdles to the mainstream adoption of Web3 gaming has been the wallet setup stage. Many attempts to pick up token-based games stalled at this stage for many reasons. The combination of seed phrases, extensions, and token transfers can quickly become overwhelming for newcomers, who are immediately overloaded with some of these wallet operations. In most cases, some never even make it as far as actually playing the game, getting turned off by the wall of technicality guarding the game. SACHI, the immersive Web3 competitive gaming universe, is helping users scale this barrier completely using an onboarding system designed to seamlessly transition users to Web3 proficiency using a completely invisible bridge that appears no different from the Web2 interface they are familiar with . Instead of asking players to connect a wallet before they play, SACHI flips the script: jump in first, enjoy the game, and only connect when you’re ready. This seamless approach puts fun ahead of friction, making “try SACHI” a realistic and inviting option for anyone, even those unfamiliar with crypto. Play Now, Wallet Later In SACHI, players can open the platform instantly thanks to pixel streaming . No installs, no downloads, and no wallet required. Whether on a phone, laptop, or tablet, players are greeted with polished Unreal Engine 5 gameplay from the moment they start the game.

Of course, players who enjoy the game and want to unlock the full range of the SACHI Web3 ecosystem, including social features and token rewards, can then choose to connect their crypto wallet. This mainstream-friendly onboarding design makes SACHI more accessible to: Casual gamers who want to enjoy the game before any commitments. Curious Web2 users who need the right opportunity to be onboarded into crypto. Partners and creators who want to share instant “click-to-play” experiences with their communities. By removing complexity from the entry point, SACHI positions itself as the most mainstream-friendly Web3 platform on the market. Web3’s Next Big Onboarding Event Hamster Kombat was all the rave in 2024 because it delivered on the simplicity that mainstream gamers could get down with. It doesn’t get more straightforward than click, play, enjoy. SACHI is taking it even further, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry and exponentially ramping up the Web3 rewards. For the first time, the focus switches from the unnecessary technicality barriers limiting Web3-based gaming to the token benefits and governance rewards users can unlock when they’re ready to explore blockchain technology. Beyond Web3-curious players who are drawn to SACHI’s technicality-free game model, players without any Web3 interests can simply enjoy smooth gameplay built on Unreal Engine 5 on their phones, laptops, or tablets. “Our goal was simple: make Web3 as inconspicuous as possible,” said Jonas Martisius, CEO of SACHI. “Players should feel the magic of SACHI first. The wallets, tokens, and on-chain mechanics can come later, when they’re ready to explore deeper. This is how Web3 gaming grows mainstream.” Start playing SACHI in seconds, no wallet, no setup, just instant entrance into the Immersive Gaming World. When you’re ready, your Web3 journey will be waiting.

Aljarrah’s statement suggested that XRP’s evolution is already beyond retail market speculation. It now focuses instead on its institutional trajectory. Aljarrah wrote, “For the IMF to adopt an asset, sovereign nations must adopt it first.” He followed this with a reference to Ripple’s future holdings, adding that once the company lowers its XRP below the “Clarity Act threshold,” it would “open the door for global use without risk.” He concluded, “That’s how XRP becomes a global reserve asset where its price isn’t discovered, it’s set.” For the IMF to adopt an asset, sovereign nations must adopt it first. Once Ripple lowers its $XRP holdings below the Clarity Act threshold, it opens the door for global use without risk. That’s how $XRP becomes a global reserve asset where its price isn’t discovered, it’s set. https://t.co/SqnKPXlqt1 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 31, 2025 The Shift from Speculation to Systemic Use Aljarrah’s post builds on ideas he expressed in 2022, asserting that XRP’s value had already been determined . He argued that global financial institutions and central banks had agreed on XRP’s role long before retail markets understood its purpose. The logic follows the model of traditional markets, where institutional investors negotiate valuations before a company goes public. In XRP’s case, Aljarrah drew parallels to a “pre-IPO” stage that occurred behind the scenes with major banks and financial authorities. He maintained that XRP, as a bridge currency and liquidity instrument, was already being positioned within global financial frameworks. This process, according to him, extends beyond speculation and enters the realm of structured financial planning among sovereign and institutional participants. Institutional Control and the Next Phase Aljarrah tied XRP’s role to the World Economic Forum’s concept of Stakeholder Capitalism, a system in which central banks and large financial entities coordinate to shape the monetary order. He claimed that these institutions have already integrated Ripple’s technology within early-stage systems across several regions, suggesting that XRP’s price and utility are linked to global liquidity needs rather than market volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The central point of his latest post is that global adoption depends on regulatory clarity and Ripple’s reduced control over XRP’s supply. Ripple’s holdings dropping below the threshold that defines significant influence would allow the asset to function within the same frameworks governing sovereign monetary systems. What This Means for XRP’s Future If Aljarrah’s assessment proves accurate, XRP’s next phase would mark a transition from market-driven valuation to institutional utility pricing. The “set” price he references implies a model in which central banks and transnational entities determine XRP’s value through contractual use rather than open-market discovery. Aljarrah’s argument reinforces the notion that XRP’s future will be decided by policy and integration, not by retail sentiment. He sees this evolution as a necessary step toward establishing XRP as a neutral settlement layer for cross-border finance.

Yet, Bitcoin’s next move will depend on whether it can confirm a breakout above the 100-day MA or hold the 200-day MA as structural support. Until one side of this equilibrium breaks, the market remains in accumulation and consolidation mode, with volatility compression likely preceding the next major impulse move. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin has been oscillating between the 100-day MA near $114K and the 200-day MA around $109K, creating a well-defined equilibrium zone. The repeated rebounds from the 200-day MA signal that the $108K–$109K area continues to attract institutional demand, while the $114K–$116K range serves as a strong distribution zone. This structure highlights the market’s current state of balance between buyers and sellers. The ongoing stabilization phase could represent an accumulation pattern, as shown by the clustered price action between the two key moving averages. A confirmed daily close above the 100-day MA would likely trigger a breakout toward $120K–$122K, while a breakdown below $108K could expose the $102K–$104K institutional demand zone once again. Improving macro sentiment from the FOMC’s dovish policy pivot and the U.S.–China cooperation framework could support a bullish continuation if on-chain and volume metrics confirm accumulation. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour timeframe reinforces the range-bound nature of Bitcoin’s recent behavior. The price has repeatedly reacted from the $108K–$109K support zone, forming higher lows and attempting to reclaim short-term structure. However, the $115K–$116K resistance band remains a ceiling that has capped multiple upward attempts. This setup outlines a symmetrical consolidation within an ascending structure, suggesting that volatility is tightening before a potential breakout. A bullish breakout above $116K could mark a structural shift toward $120K–$122K, while a failure to hold the $108K area would confirm a deeper retest toward the $102K liquidity pocket. Until either side of the range is breached, the market is expected to oscillate between these levels, with low volatility preceding the next expansion. On-Chain Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin Active Addresses offers an important signal about market participation and network health. Over recent months, the number of active addresses has gradually declined, even as Bitcoin’s price maintained its position near record highs. Historically, such a decline in on-chain activity often reflects market fatigue or short-term distribution, particularly following extended rallies. However, the current level of activity, while subdued, remains above the 2024 accumulation baseline, implying that the market is not experiencing full capitulation. Periods of reduced address activity near key support levels have often preceded large-scale accumulation and trend reversals, as seen in late 2023 and mid-2024. If active address growth stabilizes while price holds the $108K–$110K support range, it would strengthen the case for an accumulation-driven bottom formation, aligning with the macro environment of increased global liquidity and improving investor sentiment after the Fed’s rate cut.

While the recent bounce from support suggests short-term buyers are still present, the price remains trapped in a range without clear bullish conviction. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair On the USDT pair, XRP is hovering around $2.50, still below the confluence of the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. After the sharp liquidation wick into the demand zone, the asset bounced quickly but failed to break back above the key resistance near $2.60. The RSI has also flattened out around 45, reflecting weak momentum and a lack of strong bullish drive. Unless the price reclaims the moving averages and breaks above the $2.60–$2.75 zone with volume, the path of least resistance remains sideways to slightly bearish. Regardless, a return to the support level around $2.20 would offer a better risk-reward for buyers. The BTC Pair Looking at the XRPBTC chart, the price remains under pressure after multiple failed attempts to reclaim key resistance levels. It’s currently trading around 2,270 sats, stuck below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. This entire structure has been a prolonged accumulation or distribution range, depending on how it resolves. While the bounce off the 2,000 sat zone shows buyers are still defending key long-term support, there’s little follow-through to suggest strength. The RSI at 47 indicates a neutral momentum, but unless a clean break above 2,500 sats with high volume occurs, XRP continues to lag against Bitcoin.

However, there are some warning signs on the DOGE horizon, such as whales disposing of large quantities of the asset. $0.18 looks like a strong buy-the-dip zone for Dogecoin $DOGE before a potential run toward $0.26 or $0.33. pic.twitter.com/LltHHiRFMR — Ali (@ali_charts) November 1, 2025 Ali Martinez has repeatedly outlined the significance of the $0.18 support. It doubled down earlier today, indicating that it could serve as a price propeller if DOGE remains above it and could actually be used as a “strong buy-the-dip zone.” The analyst with over 161,000 followers on X predicted another price surge to $0.26 or even $0.33 if this support holds. It’s worth noting that DOGE exceeded the first target twice in September and October but hasn’t reached the second since January. Its latest rejection came during the October 10 bloodbath when it plunged from $0.23 to $0.15 within hours. It has since maintained a value above $0.18, despite testing it on a couple of occasions. However, the resistance at $0.22 has capped its progress. What’s particularly worrisome about DOGE’s perspective is whales’ behavior. These large market participants sold 440 million DOGE in just three days last week, intensifying the immediate selling pressure and potentially signaling market capitulation to smaller investors. Dogecoin’s RSI, a metric showing the underlying asset’s overbought or oversold condition, doesn’t offer much insight into its next move. It’s currently at 46, which is essentially a neutral zone, without any significant indication of what’s to follow.

The agreement was reached during a high-level meeting between the Bank of Korea and the People’s Bank of China in Seoul. South Korea’s presidential office stated that it would now exchange its national currency, the won, and the Chinese yuan within the existing limits. The swap line was developed to stabilize the financial market, trade transactions, and ensure liquidity during times of crisis. It replaces a previous agreement that expired in October 2025. Seoul authorities believe the strategic swap line would help reduce the usage of the US dollar in Asian deals. The move aligns with a broader trend across Asia, where countries are seeking to reduce their reliance on the US dollar in trade and financial transactions. Similar initiatives have been observed between China and other BRICS members, as well as between ASEAN economies, in their efforts to strengthen regional payment frameworks. Such patterns are emerging due to growing confidence in their national currencies and concerns that external monetary turbulence may harm their national economies. Analysts say this is a vital agreement, as all countries globally face multiple global economic challenges, including differences in energy costs, declining growth, and currency fluctuations. Through more substantial yuan-won connections, Beijing and Seoul wish to integrate their economies more effectively and foster assurance between their central monetary authorities. Leaders pledge broader cooperation The currency swap was one of the six memorandums of understanding signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to South Korea, his first since taking office 11 years ago. State President Lee Jae-myung welcomed Xi in Seoul on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, to expand economic cooperation beyond their four-day-long meeting, which also sought to bolster mutual trust. These agreements encompass economic and trade, services and digital economy, agriculture and related sectors, as well as amendments to quarantine policies concerning Korean produce. Additionally, they will accelerate their collaboration in combating online and telecom fraud and prioritize collaboration within the silver economy. President Xi hailed the collaboration as marking a new phase of mutual trust and shared development. At the same time, President Lee added that a closer partnership would help build a stronger foundation for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. The two leaders also discussed ways to revitalize the Korea-China Free Trade Agreement, which has performed poorly compared to other trade agreements, while expanding their joint investments in clean energy, green technology, and semiconductor production. For South Korea , the currency swap also adds stability to its foreign exchange reserves, which have been shaky due to global monetary contraction. The Bank of Korea explained that the agreement would eliminate the possibility of temporary liquidity shortages and promote financial cooperation in the region. Economists agree that this agreement broadens Asia’s financial safety net and creates conditions for similar trade agreements within the region. In such a context, last year’s agreement by Seoul to renew the $10 billion won-dollar swap line with Tokyo is a positive sign. Region faces shifting strategic dynamics The revitalization of economic partnership with China comes at a time when regional geopolitics is shifting in a new direction. This has left Seoul straddling between age-old ties with China, its largest trading partner, and a deepening strategic partnership with Washington and Tokyo. Park Sung-hoon, an economist at Korea University, said the swap was a genuine response from the South to maintain multilateral financial routes. The analyst suggested that it served as a “plan B” in case of a deterioration in relations with China or the United States. He said the agreement demonstrated economic independence and strategic thinking, keeping in mind that the dollar “does not have Korea in chains” anymore. For China, meanwhile, flawed regional economic performance and the need to consolidate its regional role encourage pragmatic diplomacy. The revival of Chinese exchange lines, for example, is one component of enhanced integration into Asian economies amid slowing exports and persistent pressure on the property sector.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-locks-700-million-xrp-back-in-escrow-heres-what-is-next/,"Ripple’s monthly escrow routine has again captured the attention of market participants. According to on-chain tracking platform Whale Alert, 700 million XRP, worth roughly $1.75 billion, was locked in escrow within hours following the release of 1 billion XRP on November 1. The alerts showed two separate transactions. The first transaction involved 500 million XRP, and the second locked 200 million XRP. These transactions occurred after Ripple moved 500 million XRP to unknown wallets in quick succession. Another notable part of this sequence is that Ripple has yet to perform its monthly escrow release. The company typically unlocks 1 billion XRP from escrow at the start of each month, a pattern it has maintained for years. As of press time, that release has not occurred, creating speculation among market observers about whether the schedule will proceed as usual. How Ripple’s Escrow System Works Ripple introduced its escrow system in December 2017 to ensure transparency and predictability in the XRP supply. The company placed 55 billion XRP, which is just over half of the total supply, into a series of escrow accounts on the XRP Ledger. Each month, 1 billion tokens are released automatically , providing Ripple with liquidity for partnerships, institutional sales, and ecosystem incentives. Any unused XRP from these monthly releases is customarily returned to new escrows, extending the overall timeline. This mechanism limits the amount of XRP entering circulation at any given time while maintaining confidence that Ripple cannot suddenly flood the market. The locking transactions reported by Whale Alert align with this long-standing process. However, the absence of the usual 1 billion unlock so far has prompted attention within the community. The escrow system has faced delays , but Ripple usually makes up before the end of the month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? XRP’s price has traded steadily despite the escrow developments. The asset is trading at $2.51, up 0.41% from yesterday, and holding strong despite the recent decline . The company’s practice of re-locking unused XRP has helped prevent sudden liquidity shocks, and the transparency of these escrow movements remains a key aspect of investor trust. Many experts believe Ripple’s escrow system protects XRP’s price , and sticking to the schedule by unlocking 1 billion tokens could help reinforce the confidence of market participants. For now, the company’s decision to lock 700 million XRP with the delayed release stands out as one of the more interesting recent shifts in its long-running monthly cycle.

The figure represents an 85.7% fall from September’s $127.06 million total. Garden Finance, Typus Finance, and Abracadabra suffered the heaviest blows, contributing $16.2 million to the overall losses. As a result, the report indicates that October was one of the less tumultuous months for crypto-related breaches, reflecting improved protocol security. Hackers stole over $10 million from Garden Finance Garden Finance’s team announced on October 30 that attackers had stolen over $10 million through a solver breach . Though the hack was isolated to the solver’s inventory, it still bumped October’s overall losses. Without that incident, the tally would have stayed around $7.18 million — the lowest monthly loss since early 2023. By contrast, earlier months of 2025 saw multiple multi-million-dollar attacks targeting decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and cross-chain protocols, driving the year’s cumulative total losses past the $1 billion mark by mid-year. Sui-based yield platform Typus Finance was also the victim of an oracle manipulation attack , which drained off as much as $3.4 million on October 15th. The exploit was later linked to a flaw in a TLP contract, causing its native token to tumble by 35%. Around the same time, Abracadabra, a DeFi lending platform, was hit by yet another exploit — its third overall — which cost it about $1.8 million in MIM tokens. The attack was down to a smart contract bug that allowed the thieves to bypass capital verification. Although the number of hack losses fell in October, analysts believe it is too early for the industry to be complacent. They noted that hackers are still perfecting new techniques, and some attacking groups, especially those linked to North Korea, are even trying to insert malware directly into blockchain systems. By early October, North Korean hackers had already stolen more than $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency this year, according to Elliptic. Intelligence agencies disclosed that at least some part of this could well be slated for the country’s nuclear and missile programs. More traders trust crypto as much as traditional banks Despite ongoing incidents of crypto losses, user confidence in digital assets continues to rise. The latest survey from the National Cryptocurrency Association found that 76% of participants now trust cryptocurrency as much as, or even more than, traditional banks. However, while public confidence in cryptocurrencies has undoubtedly been on the rise, many analysts still doubt their value as investments. Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, likened purchasing crypto to placing an NFL bet. He said the assets were all made out of thin air and that their value depended largely on popular interest in the technology itself. Amanda Fischer, COO of Better Markets, also expressed concern over the absence of the kind of market oversight that governs traditional investments. She cautioned that even when crypto ETFs are purchased through banks or brokerages, the underlying assets themselves remain unregulated. She asked crypto traders to: “Treat any cryptocurrency investment like you would any sort of budget for sports betting or gambling; only put up what you can afford to lose.” She also warned that crypto is an “attractive honeypot for hackers,” given how easily it can be stolen and subsequently laundered. Following a turbulent year of high-value exploits, October’s steep drop in crypto hack losses is a promising development for the industry; yet, it remains to be seen whether this decrease represents long-term stability or temporary respite.

However, analysts are now cautious. They warn that Bitcoin (BTC) could face a 20% correction before the next major altcoin boom. While short-term sentiment looks cautious, experts believe this pullback could fuel capital rotation into high-utility projects like Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi solution that’s fast becoming a top contender for 2025’s biggest breakout. Bitcoin Price Prediction Signals Pre Altcoin Boom Correction The BTC price today sits around $110,000, with analysts warning that a deeper correction could be on the horizon before the next major rally. Despite a supportive rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bitcoin price action remains sluggish, ending October down 3.7% — its weakest “Uptober” since 2018. ETF outflows totaling over $670 million last week show institutions reducing exposure, dampening bullish momentum. Many experts believe the current weakness could precede a healthy reset before an altcoin boom, with projects like Remittix (RTX) poised to benefit from renewed retail capital. Technical indicators show tightening Bollinger Bands, signaling an explosive move is imminent. Analysts warn that a decline to the levels of around $95,000–$100,000 would be consistent with a healthy 20% correction in bullish markets. In the meantime, long-term traders are still hopeful about the broader cycle. They believe that Bitcoin price prediction targets in the $150,000 range will stay intact once the pullback is over. Remittix Leads Altcoin Buzz As Bitcoin Pullback Looms While Bitcoin prepares for what analysts warn could be a 20% pullback before the next altcoin boom, investors are already identifying the projects set to benefit most, and Remittix (RTX) tops that list. The PayFi project is redefining digital payments by making it possible to send crypto directly to any bank account in seconds. Unlike XRP and Stellar, which focus on crypto-to-crypto transfers, Remittix simplifies real-world spending through instant fiat deposits. Experts believe this gives RTX a massive advantage heading into the next market rotation, where utility-based tokens could lead the charge. BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing for RTX, with LBank joining soon after. The Remittix Wallet beta is live, allowing users to test crypto-to-bank payments. A 15% USDT Referral Program rewards users daily through the Remittix dashboard. The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway continues to attract global participation. Now verified by CertiK and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens, Remittix is proving that true adoption, not speculation, drives long-term growth.

This New Crypto Coin Could Lead Q1 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-cryptocurrency-to-25x-this-new-crypto-coin-could-lead-q1-2026/,"The search for the next high-growth cryptocurrency is intensifying as 2025 comes to a close. With the market showing signs of recovery and investors repositioning portfolios for the next bull run, many are focusing on early-stage tokens that combine use cases with strong presale traction. One name that keeps surfacing among analysts is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a DeFi crypto that could become one of the top cryptocurrencies heading into Q1 2026. The project has already raised millions, achieved a top-tier audit rating, and confirmed the upcoming testnet launch of its lending protocol. With its unique model for yield generation and token demand, some experts now predict that MUTM could deliver up to 25x token appreciation within the next major crypto cycle. Dual Lending Model, Yield System, and Presale Data Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol that aims to make digital asset lending more secure and efficient. It operates through two complementary systems: a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pool for popular assets like ETH and USDT, and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace for more specialized tokens. Together, these models create flexibility and depth in liquidity — allowing users to lend or borrow under transparent, smart contract conditions. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $18 million, attracting over 17,600 holders — a strong sign of growing investor confidence. The project’s Phase 6 presale is now around 80% complete, with over 785 million tokens sold so far. Each stage has sold out faster than the one before it, reflecting accelerating demand as the launch date approaches. Currently, tokens are priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, with the next stage set to increase to $0.04. The confirmed launch price is $0.06, giving early investors an opportunity for roughly 100-500% potential growth by listing. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) are allocated specifically for the presale — a clear and transparent structure that has helped build trust around the project’s long-term vision. V1 Launch and Security Measures Mutuum Finance is preparing to launch its V1 protocol on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, a key milestone that will transition the project from development to product delivery. This version will introduce the protocol’s core components: a Liquidity Pool, mtTokens for yield generation, Debt Tokens representing borrowed amounts, and a Liquidator Bot that automatically manages under-collateralized loans. The testnet will initially support ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral use — two of the most stable and liquid assets in crypto. Once testing is complete, more assets and stablecoins will be added. Mutuum Finance’s commitment to security has been one of its biggest strengths. The project successfully completed a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 Token Scan Score, a strong indicator of smart contract reliability. Additionally, the team operates a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage external testing and ensure robust defense against potential vulnerabilities. Token Utility, Buy-and-Distribute Model, and Analyst Forecasts Mutuum Finance’s utility extends far beyond a typical DeFi token. Its buy-and-distribute model is designed to create continuous buying pressure on the MUTM token. A portion of the protocol’s revenue — generated from borrowing fees and platform activity — is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This model effectively ties token demand to the platform’s activity, meaning the more users lend and borrow, the more tokens are purchased and redistributed. It’s a long-term sustainability mechanism that helps prevent supply dilution while rewarding loyal holders. To further enhance the platform’s reliability, Mutuum Finance plans to use oracle integrations, such as Chainlink, for accurate real-time pricing. This ensures that all lending, borrowing, and liquidation processes reflect true market conditions — a crucial feature for maintaining a stable ecosystem. Analyst projections for MUTM vary, but several independent forecasts suggest that the token could increase by 20x to 25x from its presale price once the mainnet is fully launched and exchange listings follow. This growth projection is based on current adoption rates, presale velocity, and the platform’s advanced revenue model. Why Analysts Compare MUTM to Early Aave and Solana Several market researchers have drawn parallels between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and early-stage success stories like Aave and Solana. Both of those projects combined strong utility with early community growth, which led to significant price appreciation once their products went live. Like Aave, Mutuum Finance is focused on real DeFi functionality — generating yield through a transparent lending model rather than speculation. Like Solana, it aims to deliver technical scalability and cross-chain compatibility over time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a new crypto with strong fundamentals, real product delivery, and measurable demand. With its V1 launch on the horizon, $18 million raised, and Phase 6 nearing full allocation, the project is already proving it can execute. The token’s combination of utility, transparency, and security sets it apart from typical presales. If analyst predictions hold true and MUTM delivers on its roadmap, it could become one of the few early-stage cryptos capable of 25x returns in the next cycle — making it one of the top cryptos to buy now ahead of Q1 2026.

However, it couldn’t maintain its run and quickly dropped to the current $2.52 even after the positive news on a macro level, such as the Fed’s interest rate cut. Now, popular analyst Ali Martinez has outlined the most significant support and resistance lines for the asset that might determine the next big move. For $XRP , resistance stands at $2.80 and $3, while support holds at $2.15. pic.twitter.com/ODv0X9sWhh — Ali (@ali_charts) November 2, 2025 XRP’s current price tag means that it’s a low closer to the upper boundaries of its channel, especially the first one at $2.80. If broken, then the asset could challenge the coveted $3.00, which has been a distant dream for almost a month. On the downside, $2.15 will serve as the first meaningful line of defense if Ripple’s token reverses its trajectory and heads south once again. The XRP Army expects more volatility in the following weeks due to several factors. A spot XRP ETF might launch in less than two weeks after Canary Capital’s latest update in its filing, which could bypass the typical approval process. If it indeed hits the markets on November 13, the underlying asset could go on a wild price ride. On the bearish side is the current investor behavior. As previously reported , whales have been disposing of XRP tokens for weeks, but there’s more. Glassnode data shows that long-term holders who accumulated before the price run that began a year ago had “ramped up their spending by 580%, from $38m/day to $260m/day.” The analytics platform warned that this is a “clear sign of seasoned traders exiting and adding pressure to [the] price action.” Since early August, XRP price has dropped from $3.3 to $2.4 (-27% ).

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/this-expert-says-do-this-asap-if-you-hold-xrp-heres-why/,"As the cryptocurrency market experiences another round of volatility, investor and crypto expert Levi Rietveld believes this is precisely when serious participants should be paying attention. In a recent video, Rietveld argued that instances of heavy selling pressure often present the best opportunities for accumulation. His comments come amid a pullback across digital assets, including XRP, which has faced short-term declines . Rietveld’s message was straightforward. He said that most investors fail to make real gains in crypto because they act on emotion rather than strategy. “The only people that actually do well investing are the people that are buying on the red days and selling on the green days,” he said. According to him, the recent dip should not be seen as a reason to panic but rather as a chance to lower one’s average entry price before the next upward move. IF YOU’RE HOLDING #XRP DO THIS ASAP #Ripple #crypto #cryptonews pic.twitter.com/bqukXfx9Pg — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 31, 2025 Market Timing and Investor Behavior Rietveld emphasized that retail investors tend to buy at the wrong times. He pointed out that many are quick to chase rallies rather than position during corrections. “All of the money you’re gonna make is on the way back up,” he explained, adding that the best strategy involves adding to positions when the market temporarily turns against them. To illustrate his point, Rietveld referenced a recent example from October. He referenced XRP’s shared decline in early October , which the asset quickly recovered from. For him, that kind of move shows why reacting to fear-based declines is often a mistake. He said investors should remember that large sell-offs tend to create temporary inefficiencies that long-term holders can leverage. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why His Message Resonates Now The timing of Rietveld’s remarks is notable, as the current market environment resembles previous consolidation phases that preceded significant rallies. XRP’s recent movements have drawn renewed attention from investors evaluating long-term value prospects. His comments add to a growing view that experienced market participants are treating current weakness as an opportunity rather than a setback. For holders seeking guidance, Rietveld advised leveraging fear-driven dips instead of reacting to them. He cautioned that waiting for total clarity or perfect timing often results in missed chances. As he put it, “You want to lower your average entry, not raise it by following into every single pump that happens.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Hougan argued that ETH has experienced short-term challenges but retains its long-term structural advantages: “Ethereum is poised to reach $5,000 by the end of this year and at least double by the end of the decade.” Overshadowed by the strong performance of rivals like Solana in recent months, Ethereum has struggled with low transaction volumes and weak market sentiment, particularly throughout 2024. As the growth of Layer-2 networks reduces economic activity on the main chain, some analysts have claimed that Ethereum has become “overvalued and uninvestable.” Related News: Major Cryptocurrency Exchange Responds to Claims of “Financial Difficulties” According to Hougan, ETH's biggest advantage is that it sits at the heart of the stablecoin ecosystem. “All payments will be made with stablecoins,” Hougan said, “and the vast majority of these stablecoins run on Ethereum.” According to DefiLlama data, 53% of the $307 billion in circulating stablecoin supply resides on the Ethereum network. The two largest stablecoins in the market, USDT and USDC, are primarily issued on the network. In comparison, Solana's share is only around 4%. *This is not investment advice.

Recent market monitoring indicates that the Bitcoin price has made a significant move, surging above the $111,000 mark. This impressive rally has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a period of renewed optimism in the digital asset space. According to Bitcoin World market data, BTC is currently trading around $111,000 on the Binance USDT market, reflecting strong buying pressure. What’s Driving This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? When the Bitcoin price climbs so dramatically, it’s natural to wonder about the underlying causes. Several factors often contribute to such a powerful upward trajectory. Understanding these drivers can offer valuable insights into market dynamics and help anticipate future movements. Increased Institutional Adoption: A growing number of institutional investors are allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class and a hedge against inflation. This influx of large-scale investment provides substantial liquidity and confidence. Positive Macroeconomic Outlook: Global economic conditions, including inflation concerns and interest rate policies, can influence investor sentiment towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Technological Advancements: Continuous developments in the Bitcoin network and the broader crypto ecosystem, such as improved scalability solutions and increased utility, can boost investor confidence. Market Sentiment and FOMO: As the Bitcoin price rises, a ‘Fear Of Missing Out’ (FOMO) often kicks in, encouraging more retail investors to enter the market, further fueling the rally. This latest surge above $111,000 highlights the volatile yet potentially rewarding nature of cryptocurrency investments. It serves as a reminder that Bitcoin remains a key player in the financial landscape. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Price Landscape For both seasoned traders and new entrants, the current market presents unique opportunities and challenges. While a rising Bitcoin price is generally positive, it’s essential to approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, regulatory developments, and technological updates that could impact Bitcoin. Reliable sources like Bitcoin World can provide timely information. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. The cryptocurrency market, despite its growth, can experience rapid price fluctuations. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin. While BTC is dominant, other cryptocurrencies may also offer growth potential. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide whether your investment strategy is geared towards short-term gains or long-term holding. This will influence your trading decisions. The journey of the Bitcoin price has been marked by significant milestones, and this latest climb is another chapter in its evolving story. Investors are keenly watching to see if this momentum can be sustained. What Could Be Next for the Bitcoin Price? Predicting the exact future trajectory of the Bitcoin price is challenging, given the numerous variables at play. However, analysts often consider various scenarios. A sustained period above $111,000 could solidify this level as new support, potentially paving the way for further gains. Conversely, market corrections are always a possibility, especially after rapid surges. It is important to remember that market movements are influenced by a complex interplay of supply and demand, investor psychology, and global economic indicators. Therefore, continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies are crucial for navigating the dynamic crypto market. The excitement around Bitcoin’s performance underscores its enduring appeal and its potential to reshape traditional finance. In conclusion, the surge of the Bitcoin price above $111,000 is a significant event, sparking optimism across the crypto community. While the future remains uncertain, this milestone reaffirms Bitcoin’s position as a leading digital asset.

Key Takeaways: Thodex founder Faruk Fatih Ozer was found dead in his prison cell while serving an 11,196-year sentence. Ozer’s death ends one of Türkiye’s largest crypto scandals, involving the loss of over ₺356 million ($12.5 million) in investor funds. Authorities have launched an investigation as his case continues to shape Türkiye’s tightening stance on crypto regulation. Authorities said Ozer was discovered hanging in his bathroom during an inspection, with early reports pointing to suicide as the likely cause, according to a recent report by local news outlet Türkiye Today . Thodex Founder Was Serving 11,196-Year Sentence Ozer had been serving a historic sentence of 11,196 years , 10 months, and 15 days after being convicted of multiple charges, including establishing and leading a criminal organization, aggravated fraud, and money laundering. His siblings, Guven and Serap Ozer, were convicted on similar charges and received identical sentences. The case remains one of Türkiye’s largest crypto-related fraud scandals. Founded in 2017, Thodex once ranked among the country’s leading crypto exchanges before abruptly halting operations in April 2021, citing a “temporary suspension.” Shortly after, Ozer fled to Albania, allegedly taking investors’ funds with him. He was arrested in Albania in August 2022 following an international manhunt and extradited to Türkiye in April 2023. Prosecutors accused him of defrauding over 400,000 investors, alleging that ₺253.7 million ($8.9 million) worth of crypto assets were transferred to wallets controlled by Ozer and his associates, including accounts in Malta.

Thodex’s collapse triggered widespread outrage, marking a turning point for Türkiye’s crypto oversight and leading to calls for tighter regulation of the industry. In the indictment prepared by the Anadolu Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, authorities outlined how Thodex lured users with promotions before abruptly freezing withdrawals. Twenty-one defendants were tried in the case, seven of whom were detained, while sixteen were acquitted for lack of evidence. Ozer’s death brings a grim end to a saga that shook Türkiye’s crypto landscape and left thousands of investors without recourse. Officials have launched a formal investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death. Turkey Tops MENA Crypto Market With $200B in Annual Transactions As reported, Turkey has cemented its position as the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East and North Africa , recording nearly $200 billion in annual transactions, according to new data from Chainalysis. The figure is roughly four times that of the United Arab Emirates, which ranked second with $53 billion. Analysts say much of Turkey’s activity remains driven by short-term trading rather than long-term adoption. The Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Adoption Report highlights how crypto has become both a financial refuge and a speculative outlet for Turks facing high inflation and a weakening lira. Since 2021, Turkey’s total inflows have exceeded $878 billion, making it one of the world’s most active markets. Despite this growth, retail participation is cooling, with small and large retail transactions declining slightly as institutional investors dominate.

This development was communicated by Burkhard Mühl, the head of Europol’s European Financial and Economic Crime Centre (EFECC). He made these comments at the just-concluded Global Conference on Finances and Crypto Assets. The event was organized jointly by Europol, the Basel Institute on Governance, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). During the event, Mühl mentioned that the misuse of digital assets for criminal activities has become widespread and more sophisticated while pledging continued investment from Europol to support member states in complex and international investigations. “Investigating these crimes places a significant burden on the law enforcement agencies of EU member states,” he said. Europol raises alarm over misuse of digital assets for criminal activities The conference focused on the ways that digital assets and blockchains have evolved and how scammers are taking advantage of them to carry out their sophisticated crimes. In the 2025 crypto crime report released by Chainalysis in January, the firm mentioned that illicit crypto addresses received about $40.9 billion across 2024. The figure only represented a small segment of the overall proceeds of financial crime, and excludes traditional crimes such as drug trafficking, where crypto is used for payments. Europol has initiated and completed several major takedowns since the beginning of this year. This includes dismantling the cybercrime network in Latvia, which authorities claimed laundered more than $330,000 through digital assets. It also carried out an operation targeting the clandestine hawala banking network that laundered over $23 million using several digital assets. In addition, it smashed a crypto investment fraud ring that profited more than $540 million from more than 5,000 victims. Europe has been hit with a series of so-called wrench attacks, where criminals turn to physical assaults to compel digital asset holders to hand over their digital assets or, in some instances, their private keys. In particular, over the course of the year, France has witnessed more than 10 separate incidents. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the growing rate of these attacks forced crypto enthusiasts in the country to call for crypto data security as a way to safeguard wealthy crypto personalities. Challenges of cross-border enforcement Some of the challenges for police forces across the world when it comes to crypto-related crimes are their global nature. In addition, the need for cross-border cooperation in operations also makes it difficult at other times. For example, victims of a hack or scam in the United States could be targeted by operators located in another continent. Challenges also remain in how law enforcement and the private sector approach investigating these crimes. Diana Pātrut, project manager at the Block Intelligence Professionals Association (BIPA) mentioned that different analytics companies often produce inconsistent results. “Our stakeholders have articulated that different blockchain analytics firms produce different results when tracing transactions. There has also been no standardization for wallet attribution, methodology, training, and formatting, making cross-border investigations especially challenging,” Pătruț said. Pātrut also added that training is still an area that needs work. “The biggest issue we see at the moment is that blockchain intelligence training appears to be primarily driven by private sector solutions, and this creates the confirmation bias, herding trainees to specific commercial solutions and methodologies, without necessarily understanding or appreciating their underlying application,” she explained. She also added that investigators and financial institutions need to develop their critical assessment capabilities. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

As SHIB debates burns and usage, a PayFi upstart with a live wallet beta keeps showing up on analyst shortlists. That is where anticipation builds, because when utility starts shipping, money follows. This piece sets clear levels for SHIB and then explains why many traders now preview Remittix for the next leg. Expect urgency. Expect numbers. And expect a clear path for readers who are done waiting on memes. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Levels, Flows, and What Matters Next The immediate Shiba Inu price prediction range is $0.0000095 to $0.0000105. A decisive daily close above that band could open $0.0000115 early in November, while a rejection risks retesting recent lows. Today, SHIB trades near $0.000010 on a modest relief bounce. On-chain context is mixed. Community trackers flagged multi-month lows in Shibarium transactions late October, followed by brief spikes that faded. That inconsistency keeps the multiple in check. The most honest Shiba Inu price prediction remains simple: watch usage first, price second. If activity stabilizes, the door to higher levels reopens. If not, rallies look fragile. For many desks, that is the signal to rotate. Remittix (RTX): Utility First, Built for Payouts Here is the shift. Remittix focuses on sending crypto to real bank accounts with live FX quotes, merchant-grade APIs, and a wallet already in public testing. Community testers are using the beta today, and the team is pushing updates based on feedback. Security has been treated as a first-order job, with top-tier verification that puts the project at the front of pre-launch rankings. Numbers matter. RTX is available around $0.1166. More than 30,000 investors have already participated. Over $27.7 million has been raised and 681 million tokens are spoken for. Access is set to broaden on centralized exchanges, which can drive discovery and depth. When supply tightens and access improves, price steps tend to follow. Why buyers act now The wallet beta is live, which removes guesswork and shows product velocity in real time. Payment coverage targets many countries so users can move value like money, not just trade. Listings roadmap expands liquidity on major venues that the wider market trusts. Independent security validation by Certik gives institutions and funds a green light to engage. Shiba Inu price prediction may find a bounce, but the market is voting with flows. Utility is beating noise. If you want exposure to real payments, the window while RTX sits near $0.1166 will not stay open forever.

Key Takeaways: Prince Andrew arranged a private Buckingham Palace visit for crypto businessmen tied to a failed £1.4M deal with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. Ferguson earned over £200,000 from Pegasus Group Holdings, whose Bitcoin mining venture collapsed. The revelations come as Buckingham Palace moves to strip him of remaining royal titles. The meeting took place in June 2019 while Queen Elizabeth II was in residence, raising fresh questions about Andrew’s use of royal privileges for private dealings. Prince Andrew Welcomed Crypto Executives Linked to £1.4M Deal at Palace Event The businessmen, Jay Bloom and Michael Evers, co-founders of the Arizona-based Pegasus Group Holdings, were chauffeured through the palace gates in the Duke of York’s car before attending Andrew’s Pitch@Palace business event later that day. Ferguson, who was employed by Pegasus as a “brand ambassador,” joined the pair for dinner that evening with Andrew and their daughter, Princess Beatrice. Pegasus claimed to be building a large-scale Bitcoin mining operation powered by solar energy in the Arizona desert, but the project collapsed within a year, leaving investors millions out of pocket. Court filings later revealed that only 615 of 16,000 planned generators were ever purchased, producing just £25,000 worth of Bitcoin. US investors eventually won a $4.1 million arbitration award after accusing the company of misusing funds, a ruling Bloom is appealing. Documents obtained by the BBC show Ferguson was paid more than £200,000 for her work with Pegasus, with a contract entitling her to an additional £1.2 million bonus and shares in the firm. Her agreement required first-class travel, five-star accommodation, and professional styling services but stated she bore no responsibility for the company’s technical claims. The revelations reignite concerns about Andrew and Ferguson’s financial ties and the blurred lines between their royal status and private ventures. Buckingham Palace confirmed on Thursday that formal steps are underway to strip Andrew of his remaining titles and his Windsor residence amid ongoing scrutiny of his past associations, including his links to Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew stripped of all titles. King Charles formally removes Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew. Done with immediate effect. He will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. Also, he's kicked out of Lodge too. pic.twitter.com/JA3XpBLzxE — Dina Shakti (@Dina_Shakti) October 30, 2025 Pegasus co-founder Bloom denied meeting the late Queen during his palace visit but admitted thanking Andrew and Ferguson for arranging the tour. UK Crypto ETN Fee War Erupts After Regulator Reopens Retail Access As reported, a price war has broken out among UK crypto exchange-traded note (ETN) issuers after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year ban on retail participation . The decision, effective October 8, allows everyday investors to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked ETNs through tax-free accounts such as ISAs, marking a major shift in the UK’s regulatory approach to digital assets. The move triggered immediate fee cuts across major issuers. Bitwise slashed its Core Bitcoin ETP fee from 0.2% to 0.05%, while 21Shares lowered its Bitcoin and Ethereum products to 0.1%. Fidelity, Invesco, and BlackRock joined the fray with temporary discounts, and CoinShares continued to lead the ether market by offering zero management fees, offset through staking rewards. Trading volumes on the London Stock Exchange surged following the policy change, with daily Bitcoin ETN turnover rising from $2.1 million to $7.2 million.

The cloud mining-as-a-service (MaaS) offering, called “Cloud Miner”, an ICT infrastructure, aims to pioneer sustainable crypto innovation. “Cloud Miner” is designed exclusively for UAE residents in line with du’s commitment to transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. Customers can bid through an online auction that will be hosted on the Online Auction website, starting from the 3rd to the 9th of November. As per du, the cloud-as-a-mining service will offer a cloud-based solution that simplifies traditional processes. Clients will be able to mine, benefit from potential Bitcoin rewards, and participate in the blockchain ecosystem without the burdens of hardware management, electricity costs, or maintenance concerns, and operations can commence immediately after subscription. Jasim AlAwadi, CICTO at du, noted that the telecom operator aims to offer an easy entry point into the world of cryptocurrency while leveraging du’s reputation, reliability, transparency, and security. He explained, “The service embodies our commitment to innovation, leveraging our robust data center skills & ICT infrastructure to secure a sustainable future for digital finance in the UAE.” The telecom operator distinguishes its Cloud Miner with competitive pricing and a transparent, no-hidden-fee contract available for 24 months, allowing clients to conveniently enjoy 250 TH/s capacity, where subscribers can access crypto mining through a straightforward web application. Furthermore, du ensures adherence to KYC/AML compliance for high-value transactions with the use of UAE Pass and by bolstering account security with two-factor authentication, demonstrating its commitment to providing a secure and trustworthy service. “The launch of Cloud Miner under sub-brand du Tech highlights du’s rich heritage in telecom. With du’s Cloud Miner, entering the cryptocurrency market has never been easier or more secure,” added Jasim AlAwadi at du. Bitcoin mining is spearheaded by corporates in the UAE There is already strong corporate mining activity in the UAE , with entities such as UAE Phoenix Group, which launched its IPO last year, and Marathon Digital, which in 2023 partnered with Zero Two, a subsidiary of the UAE sovereign wealth fund, for a Bitcoin mining facility in Abu Dhabi. However, this is the first time a telecom entity offers such a service in the UAE. Globally, for example, Deutsche Telekom subsidiary MMS, in collaboration with Bankhaus Metzler, is launching a pilot project to operate a Bitcoin mining infrastructure using surplus energy.

Data from on-chain analytics platform Sentora, formerly known as IntoTheBlock, shows that exchange balances for both leading cryptocurrencies have dropped notably over the past week. Prices are holding steady without much bullish momentum, but these massive withdrawals may hint at a subtle change in investor sentiment going into November. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashback: Mirror Move Hints At Record-Breaking Surge Bitcoin And Ethereum Witness Billions Of Outflows From Exchanges According to data from Sentora, Bitcoin recorded more than $2 billion in outflows from centralized exchanges over the course of the week. This is interesting, as it is one of the largest weekly movements of Bitcoin from exchanges so far this quarter. Furthermore, this trend is interesting because it is coming off an unfavorable month for the crypto industry in general, considering the crash that happened in the middle of the month. The outflow numbers can be interpreted as a sign of confidence among whale addresses choosing long-term storage over trading. On-chain data from whale transaction tracker Lookonchain supports this trend, showing two newly created wallets withdrawing 2,000 BTC worth about $260 million from crypto exchange Binance toward the end of the week. Ethereum also witnessed a similar trend to Bitcoin. Data from Sentora shows that the leading altcoin saw major outflows during the week, coming to a total of about $600 million. Bitcoin and Ethereum Weekly Key Metrics. Source: Sentora What Could This Signal For Bitcoin And Ethereum? The massive exchange outflows are somewhat confusing, considering the fact that both Bitcoin and Ethereum ended October with negative monthly closes and broke the long-running Uptober trend that has shaped the crypto market for years. For six straight years, October had been one of Bitcoin’s most dependable bullish months that set the stage for strong year-end rallies. That streak has now ended with Bitcoin closing October 2025 about 4% below its monthly open, its first red October since 2018. Ethereum also followed a similar path and recorded a more notable monthly close of about 7.15% below its open. Data from Sentora, as shown above, points to reduced activity in these blockchains that suggests the required bullish activity may not be there yet. The total fees on the Bitcoin blockchain come out to be $2.03 million, an 8.6% reduction from the previous week. The Ethereum network also saw a 13.2% fall in fees, coming out to $5.05 million. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters The Big Leagues — Stadium And Jerseys Get A Crypto Makeover Nonetheless, the outflows from exchanges are a bullish place to start. It eases selling pressure in the market, as fewer coins on exchanges mean fewer assets immediately available for sale. This, in turn, can tighten supply and gradually build a foundation for higher prices leading up to November. Whale traders might already be positioning themselves for the possibility of a bullish November.

The plan sets out pilots and proof-of-concepts that regulators and industry will run together over the next few years. Malaysia: Digital Asset Innovation Hub Moves Into Action Based on reports, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and the Securities Commission have created a Digital Asset Innovation Hub and an Industry Working Group to guide projects. The hub will host pilots on things like supply-chain finance for small and medium sized enterprises, Shariah-compliant finance, and green or ESG-linked instruments. These are the first use cases BNM has highlighted. The goal is to test ways tokenized assets might improve access to funds and make settlement clearer for smaller firms.

Industry consultation is open until one March 2026, giving firms a chance to send feedback on rules and technical designs. Regulators are studying how tokenized deposits, stablecoins , and even linkages to a wholesale central bank digital currency might fit into existing systems. How those pieces will work together has not been fixed yet. There are practical questions that remain. Will tokenized assets trade on public blockchains or in permissioned systems? How will legal ownership be recorded when an asset is split into tokens? Based on reports, regulators want to protect retail investors while still letting firms test real use cases. That balancing act will be crucial. Focus On SMEs And Shariah Finance While Monitoring Risks The push could open new funding routes for SMEs, help make cross-border settlements easier, and offer Islamic finance structures in token form. But it also carries risks. Market integrity, consumer protection, and operational resilience will need close checks. Regulators are expected to set guardrails before any large rollouts. Some observers say the move is Malaysia positioning itself alongside other regional centers that have been exploring tokenization. Regulated firms, fintech startups, banks, and asset managers are being invited to take part. Based on reports, the initiative will run pilot projects, collect data, and then shape formal rules. That process could take the whole three years, depending on results and feedback.

Market data analyst Dom (@traderview2) highlighted the development, noting that “it looks like some type of TWAP was also turned on for XRP about an hour ago on Coinbase.” The analyst shared a chart to back up his claims, comparing XRP prices and cumulative volume deltas across major exchanges. The data showed Coinbase’s XRP price (represented in yellow) trading at a visible premium compared to Binance, Bybit, and Kraken, beginning roughly an hour before Dom’s post. This divergence coincided with a large number of repetitive transactions. According to Dom, “638 XRP buys repeated 4,287 times over the last hour.” The repetition and precision of the order sizes suggest that an algorithmic trading strategy known as a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) may have been used. It looks like some type of TWAP was also turned on for $XRP about an hour ago on Coinbase? Look at premium develop compared to the other exchanges (yellow starts trading higher) 638 XRP buys repeated 4,287 times over the last hour Pretty bizarre https://t.co/WAX9I5NINN pic.twitter.com/leJD44uLDV — Dom (@traderview2) October 31, 2025 Evidence of Sustained Buying Pressure A TWAP is designed to minimize market disruption by dividing a large order into smaller transactions evenly spread over time. In this case, the pattern of identical buy orders and the resulting Coinbase premium point to sustained spot demand. The corresponding chart supports this interpretation. While XRP prices across exchanges moved in alignment, Coinbase’s price line gradually rose above others, reflecting increased local demand or a deliberate accumulation pattern . The right side of the chart, showing cumulative volume delta (CVD), further reinforces this view. CVD represents the difference between buying and selling pressure over time. Coinbase’s CVD line rose sharply, while Binance, Kraken, and Bitstamp showed smaller or flat movements. The divergence between Coinbase’s CVD and other exchanges indicates concentrated buying activity originating from that venue. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Dom had previously reported a similar automated accumulation process for Ethereum on Binance, and the XRP data now appears to show a comparable approach, though on a smaller scale. Potential Outcomes for XRP Such patterns often emerge when institutional or high-volume traders aim to build a position without triggering price volatility. If this were indeed a TWAP, it may signal that a whale is entering a sizable XRP position in a measured way. That could sustain upward momentum in the short term, as the consistent demand supports price stability. However, artificial order flow of this nature can also create temporary price imbalances . Once the automated buying ends, the absence of constant bid support may allow prices to retrace if organic demand fails to maintain the same intensity. Traders monitoring spreads between exchanges often interpret these moments as opportunities to arbitrage or test market depth.

The widely tracked Crypto Fear & Greed Index showed only a small improvement, rising from 33 to 37 on Sunday, still firmly in “Fear” territory. Essentially, a low value of the observed sentiment index indicates that traders and investors do not trust the current breakthrough in the geopolitical sphere. A count below 50 indicates a lack of euphoria, and the increase in value reflects the growing trust of participants in the trading community. Despite an increase in Saturday’s value, 37 is not a reassuring level. It shows that the trading community has lost confidence in the industry after the global economic superpowers’ conflict has calmed down. Traders are still processing the deal. US-China relations have been shaping both digital and traditional sectors for months, with tariff threats, supply chain disruptions, and tech restrictions fueling concerns about global economic growth. This agreement has been a significant step forward, but without clarification and sanctions, investors remain cautious. Upcoming political shifts could introduce even stricter rules on intellectual property and information security, adding another layer of uncertainty. US and China reach trade truce, but confidence stays low The US-China deal will roll back a significant share of the tariffs imposed during the previous disputes. Washington agrees to reduce some tariffs on Chinese goods from about 57 to 47 percent. Ultimately, Beijing agrees to restart large purchases of US agricultural goods and significantly reduce restrictions on the export of rare earths to the US markets — the materials vital for technology and energy production. It is therefore no surprise that the White House claimed the accord to be a massive victory for American workers, farmers, and families, and a critical stride towards restoring US economic power and national security. Chinese officials also lauded the pact as a positive step in the right direction that would bring back certainty to global commerce . Initially, the financial markets were positive. US shares, for example, all soared, and the dollar gained momentum against all major currencies. On the contrary, significant changes were not observed in the cryptocurrency market, where it is believed that traders’ hopes have yet to materialize. The public has indeed considered the agreement as more of a ceasefire. Notably, various points — including tech access and commitment clauses — remain far apart or have not been addressed. Thus, cryptocurrency market prices are projected to fluctuate, just as they did in previous rounds of negotiations. Crypto market holds back despite improved clarity All in all, the modest gains in the crypto industry suggest that investors are more apprehensive than optimistic. Market observers highlight the serious losses that occurred earlier in October, following Trump’s threat of 100% tariffs against China, which triggered the biggest panic in international markets. The event resulted in around $19 billion worth of crypto positions being liquidated in less than 24 hours. Recovery has been shaky. Analyst Michael van de Poppe of MN Capital says that the current phase is challenging, but it could, in hindsight, represent one of the market’s bottom days. He still notes that the overall momentum remains at the early stages of a potential bull cycle for both altcoins and Bitcoin. Others echo the sentiment. More experienced traders stated that the deal is the perfect prerequisite for a slow recovery and is “bullish for markets in the medium term.” In other words, the majority is under the impression that while traders should remain hopeful, they should not expect bull activity anytime soon. For now, fear and hope are equally responsible for determining prices. Traders are likely awaiting the signs that the trade war is indeed over, and global markets will be alright long enough for the market to recover. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Many analysts believe 2025 could mark a comeback year for the token as institutional adoption accelerates and confidence in its long-term use case strengthens. Emerging payment systems like Remittix (RTX) , designed to enable faster and more affordable crypto-to-fiat transfers are quietly gaining traction and could eventually rival established tokens such as XRP in the global payments space. XRP Market Snapshot XRP is currently selling at $2.50 following a loss of 1.4% over the last 24 hours with a market capitalization of $150.31 billion, while trading volume has fallen by nearly 40% to $3.04 billion, suggesting reduced speculative interest. Analysts suggest that XRP’s recent price action shows growing sensitivity to ongoing ETF discussions and evolving regulatory expectations. Although there is still a lot of interest in XRP, rivals that provide physical transaction utilities are becoming more well-known. Remittix stands out because of its active user adoption and practical payment options. Why Remittix Is Gaining Ground Due to the high initial demand for its PayFi service, Remittix has raised more than $27.7 million in private funding. With over 681.9 million RTX tokens distributed and a current price of $0.1166 per token, a substantial early community has been established. In contrast to conventional cryptocurrency initiatives, it concentrates on useful applications, such as real-time foreign exchange conversion, support for over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, and quick crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries. More community testers can now participate in the platform’s wallet beta program, confirming its potential for adoption. CertiK has fully validated the Remittix team and RTX is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens. Remittix has announced upcoming centralized exchange listings on BitMart and LBANK, which should improve liquidity and accessibility. Key Features and Utilities of Remittix Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Built for practical payments, not just speculation Security Verified: Audited by CertiK, top blockchain auditor Community Rewards: $250,000 giveaway and 15% referral rewards in USDT Cross-Chain DeFi: Supports multiple tokens and low gas fee transfers Remittix: The Alternative Payment Leader As XRP gains headlines from ETF speculation, Remittix quietly delivers a measurable impact on global payments. Its practical use cases, growing community, and secure infrastructure suggest it could become a major alternative in cross-border transactions. Investors looking for the next 100x crypto with real-world applications may find Remittix to be a compelling addition alongside traditional XRP positions. With the $27.7M private funding milestone, ongoing wallet beta, and upcoming exchange listings, Remittix is emerging as one of 2025’s most promising crypto projects.

While speculative projects often dominate headlines, analysts are increasingly favoring Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto that’s proving itself as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch heading into 2026. Currently in an advanced stage of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already attracted thousands of investors and raised millions in funding. With its mainnet test launch approaching, industry experts believe MUTM has the structure, timing, and momentum to potentially deliver up to 800% token appreciation over the next market cycle. Presale Momentum Shows Strong Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to gain momentum in its presale, which has already raised over $18 million and onboarded more than 17,600 holders. The sale is now in Phase 6, with each token priced at $0.035 and nearly 80% of this stage already sold out. The next phase will lift the price by nearly 20% to $0.04, ahead of the confirmed launch price of $0.06, meaning those joining now could see around 100% token appreciation while phase 1 participants are positioned for 500% MUTM value. From the total 4 billion supply, 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) are dedicated to the presale, offering a transparent and structured model that has strengthened investor confidence. Momentum has accelerated with every round selling out faster than the last, as growing awareness and strong fundamentals continue to attract new participants. The presale’s clear tokenomics, defined pricing system, and organized allocation structure have helped distinguish Mutuum Finance from less transparent early-stage crypto projects. What Mutuum Finance Is Building At its core, Mutuum Finance is a non-custodial, decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that aims to make digital asset markets more transparent, secure, and efficient. The system allows users to lend their crypto to earn passive yield or borrow against their existing holdings — all powered by smart contracts that automate and secure every transaction. When users deposit assets into the platform, they receive mtTokens, which are interest-bearing receipt tokens. For example, a user depositing 50 USDC receives 50 mtUSDC, which accrues interest over time as loans are repaid. This provides a continuous source of yield without the need for manual management. The protocol also plans to implement a buy-and-distribute model, where a portion of platform fees are used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This mechanism builds direct, organic buying pressure into the ecosystem and ties the project’s success to tokenholder rewards. V1 Launch and Upcoming Milestones One of the biggest upcoming catalysts for Mutuum Finance is its V1 protocol launch , scheduled for the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This release marks the transition from presale hype to a working product, often the turning point for serious DeFi protocols. V1 will introduce core components including the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot that automatically manages under-collateralized positions. The testnet will initially support ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral, with plans to expand support to additional cryptocurrencies and stablecoins after testing. Analysts say that this stage will be crucial for building investor confidence and could act as the first major trigger for post-launch growth. As one market strategist commented, “When a DeFi token moves from presale to active use, that’s when value shifts from promise to proof.” As long as Mutuum Finance successfully launches and scales its lending pools, analysts estimate that MUTM could surge 700–800% from its presale price within its first full year of trading, driven by increasing adoption and token buybacks. Stablecoin and Layer-2 Plans Add Depth Beyond its lending model, Mutuum Finance has also outlined plans to launch an on-demand, USD-pegged stablecoin that will be overcollateralized by active loans within the platform. This design not only provides an additional yield opportunity but also enhances long-term sustainability. The stablecoin will be minted and burned on demand, keeping supply aligned with lending activity and maintaining peg stability. Another key feature in development is Layer-2 expansion, which will allow Mutuum Finance to deploy across multiple blockchains for faster transactions and lower fees. This cross-chain capability could help MUTM capture liquidity from various ecosystems, expanding its user base and trading volumes. The project also plans to rely on oracle networks, such as Chainlink, to deliver accurate market data and ensure fair pricing for assets within the protocol. These oracles play a critical role in liquidation events, keeping the system stable even during market volatility. Taken together, these upgrades are why analysts see Mutuum Finance as a long-term growth play rather than a short-term presale trend. Multiple independent reports forecast a potential 8x to 10x increase within the first two years after launch, especially if adoption follows a curve similar to early lending protocols like Aave. Security, Transparency, and Community Engagement Mutuum Finance has already completed a CertiK audit, one of the most respected security assessments in crypto, achieving a 90/100 Token Scan Score. To further ensure safety, the project operates a $50,000 bug bounty program, encouraging external developers to identify vulnerabilities before launch. The team has also built a 24-hour leaderboard system, where the top daily contributor earns $500 worth of MUTM tokens. This adds transparency and community engagement during the presale, rewarding participation while keeping activity visible in real time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a rare combination of strong utility, transparent presale progress, and near-term product deployment. With its V1 launch confirmed for Q4 2025, $18 million raised, and 80% of Phase 6 already allocated, the project has proven its traction before even going live. For investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance might just be the opportunity that defines Q1 2026 and beyond.

According to the Romanian regulator, the prediction website has been operating in the country, carrying out gambling activities without an active license from the required agency. “The decision to include Polymarket on the blacklist is not related to technology, but to the law,” ONJN President Vlad-Cristian Soare said in a statement. “Regardless of whether you bet in lei or crypto, if you bet money on a future result, under the conditions of a counterpart bet, we are talking about gambling that must be licensed.” Soare added that the regulator will not allow platforms to use the transformation of blockchain into a screen to carry out illegal betting activities. Launched in 2020, Polymarket is a polygon-based prediction market with its headquarters in Manhattan, New York. It allows individuals to place bets on future events, including economic indicators, awards, and political and legislative outcomes. The platform allows users to deposit USDC through the Polygon blockchain network. The platform became more popular after it accurately predicted Donald Trump as the winner of the United States presidential elections. It accrued over $3.3 billion in wagers on the election. Romanian regulator blacklists Polymarket According to the Romanian regulator, while it understands that Polymarket is often regarded as an “event trading platform” and meets the definition of what it considers a “counterparty betting,” users still put up stakes against other users, and a future event determines the outcome. “Accepting the idea that a ‘counterparty betting’ system can be called ‘trading’ would create a dangerous precedent, whereby any operator could ‘reinterpret’ the counterparty betting activity as a stock exchange activity – circumventing strict gambling or capital markets regulations,” the regulator wrote . The Romanian regulator was particularly concerned about the increased prediction market activity during the Romanian local elections. For example, the regulator claimed that the market on Polymarket, where it asked users to predict the mayor of the capital city of Bucharest, has seen more than $16 million in volume. Earlier this year, an electoral market on the platform also generated more than $370 million in total volume. International scrutiny and POLY token launch Polymarket has garnered scrutiny across the world for similar reasons. Last year, France’s National Gaming Authority announced plans to ban the platform after an investigation into its compliance with French gambling legislation. “The regulator is currently examining [Polymarket’s] operation as well as its compliance with French gambling legislation,” a report from French news outlet The Big Whale said at the time. The platform had also been effectively banned in the United States following a fine from the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) back in 2022. However, in July, it acquired derivatives exchange QCX, which has received a no-action letter from the regulator, essentially allowing the prediction platform to resume its activities in the United States. Polymarket recently received a $2 billion investment from the New York Stock Exchange owner, Intercontinental Exchange. Meanwhile, Polymarket is planning to launch its POLY token and an airdrop. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, Polymarket CMO Matthew Modabber confirmed plans in an interview. “There will be a token, there will be an airdrop We could have launched a token whenever we wanted, and it’s just how thorough we want to be about it. We want it to be a token with true utility, longevity, and to be around forever, right? That’s what we expect from ourselves, and that’s what I think everyone in the space expects from us,” he said.

According to data from on-chain tracking platform Whale Alert , the company unlocked 1 billion XRP, valued at approximately $2.5 billion, as part of its long-standing monthly escrow routine on November 1. Shortly after the unlock, Ripple relocked 700 million XRP, worth about $1.75 billion, back into escrow through two separate transactions, one of 500 million XRP and another of 200 million XRP. XRP unlocks by Ripple. Source: Whale Alert Additionally, 500 million XRP was moved to unknown wallets, a step that typically precedes market-related operations such as institutional transfers or liquidity management. Notably, the XRP escrow system ensures transparency and predictability in supply, with Ripple releasing about 1 billion XRP each month for operations, partnerships, or liquidity purposes. Attention now shifts to whether XRP’s price will react to the newly available tokens. Notably, past unlocks have had little impact on the asset, which is currently consolidating around the $2.50 level after a period of significant capital outflow. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.53, having rallied almost 1% in the past 24 hours, while on a weekly basis the asset has dropped more than 4%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Meanwhile, on-chain data from Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on November 2 shows that XRP is currently consolidating below major resistance levels at $2.80 and $3.00, with significant supply clustering near those price points. Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap. Source: Glassnode The heatmap indicates that many holders acquired positions in this range, suggesting potential selling pressure if prices retest those levels. On the downside, support remains strong around $2.15, where accumulation has been more pronounced, hinting that buyers may step in to defend that zone. The pattern reflects a broader consolidation phase for XRP as investors weigh market direction following months of volatility. A breakout above $3 could signal renewed bullish momentum, while a drop below $2.15 might invite further downside risk.

Stellar, its long-standing parallel in cross-border utility, introduced limited inflation-based rewards early on, but never expanded into dynamic yield systems. XRP Tundra is changing that equation. The project’s new Cryo Vaults introduce on-ledger staking for XRP holders, allowing users to earn verifiable yields while maintaining custody of their assets. Instead of relying on validator inflation or third-party custodians, rewards are distributed through transparent smart contracts governed by TUNDRA-X — the project’s governance token on XRPL. This marks the first functional staking structure that directly connects XRP ownership with yield potential inside the XRPL ecosystem. Native XRPL Staking Redefines What Stellar Couldn’t Stellar’s staking equivalent operates through network inflation and validator incentives, rewarding those who delegate to consensus nodes. It’s stable, but static — capped, predictable, and centralized in practice. XRP Tundra’s Cryo Vaults instead introduce a variable model where holders can lock XRP or TUNDRA-S for yields up to 20% APY, secured through multi-signature Frost Keys. The rewards are algorithmic and transparent, visible on-ledger rather than determined by network governance votes. Investors have taken notice. Analyst coverage, including Ben Crypto’s review , highlights that XRP holders now gain a route to passive income without leaving XRPL — something previously impossible. The upcoming Cryo Vault activation effectively transforms XRP from a transactional asset into a yield-bearing one, bridging the functionality gap that Stellar’s inflation model never fully addressed. Dual-Chain Efficiency Versus Stellar’s Single-Layer Framework At the structural level, XRP Tundra’s architecture breaks away from traditional single-chain logic. Its dual-token system — TUNDRA-X on the XRP Ledger for governance and reserves, and TUNDRA-S on Solana for utility and liquidity — creates separation of function that Stellar’s design never implemented. This separation ensures governance and execution can scale independently, minimizing token inflation and allowing yield flows to remain predictable. The market response underscores confidence in the model. The project’s Phase 9 presale offers TUNDRA-S at $0.147 with an 11% token bonus, paired with free TUNDRA-X allocations at a $0.0735 reference price. With confirmed listing prices of $2.5 and $1.25 respectively, and over $2 million raised, XRP Tundra has already attracted more measurable investor traction than comparable multi-chain DeFi projects in early-stage fundraising. Stellar’s simplicity remains valuable for remittance infrastructure, but Tundra’s modular system delivers what traditional cross-border chains have lacked — composability and reward scalability. Dynamic Liquidity Design That Ends DeFi’s Volatility Cycle The contrast becomes sharper when Tundra’s liquidity design is compared with mainstream DeFi staking models. While many decentralized exchanges promise high yields through token emissions, those returns often rely on inflationary incentives that collapse when trading volume falls. Volatility and impermanent loss dominate ecosystems such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, leaving liquidity providers exposed when token prices fluctuate. XRP Tundra takes a different route using Meteora’s DAMM V2 liquidity pools. These introduce dynamic fees that start high — near 50% — and decrease over time, making it prohibitively expensive to front-run or dump tokens immediately after launch. That model replaces the “farm-and-dump” cycle typical of traditional DeFi with what developers call a “race to stake,” redirecting trading profits into Cryo Vault rewards. It’s a liquidity architecture built for token longevity, not speculative churn. Transparency and Security: Verifiable Trust Versus Institutional Centralization Stellar has long maintained its reputation through institutional partnerships — MoneyGram, Circle, and cross-border pilot programs that emphasize compliance. XRP Tundra’s approach is not a rejection of that framework but an evolution of it. Every layer of the system is verifiable through public documentation: audits from Cyberscope , Solidproof , and FreshCoins , alongside Vital Block KYC certification . This transparency aligns Tundra more closely with regulated DeFi frameworks than anonymous liquidity farms. It allows institutional-grade visibility — not through centralization, but through open verification. Stellar operates within regulated ecosystems; Tundra extends that assurance to retail participants through public auditability, bridging traditional compliance culture with transparent DeFi mechanics. Why XRP Tundra’s Model Outpaces Stellar and DeFi Counterparts Across function, architecture, and transparency, XRP Tundra’s system advances beyond both major comparison points. Compared to Stellar, it replaces inflation-based validator logic with programmable, user-level staking directly on XRPL. Compared to traditional DeFi, it substitutes inflationary reward farming with audited, dynamic-yield mechanics that maintain token value integrity. This convergence of institutional-grade transparency and decentralized execution redefines how staking operates on established chains. Tundra effectively upgrades XRP’s utility layer while addressing the weaknesses of both centralized and permissionless staking ecosystems.

Every cycle brings a wave of new tokens promising quick profits, but only a few deliver sustained results. The strongest projects are those that combine innovation with actual use. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such name now emerging as a hidden gem among early-stage defi projects. It is designed to power decentralized lending, staking, and passive income in one secure system. At its current low presale price, it stands out as the most strategic crypto to buy now before the next market upturn. Presale Strength and the Last Chance to Buy Cheap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, already attracting impressive attention from the defi community. The total supply is 4 billion tokens, and about $18.35 million has been raised across all phases. The current token price is $0.035, with 85% of this phase sold out from a 170 million supply. Once the phase closes, the price will rise to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. More than 17,750 holders have already joined, showing solid early confidence in the project’s direction. This is the last opportunity to buy at the $0.035 mark before the price moves higher. The process is simple, with direct card payment options that make participation fast and easy. As the crypto fear and greed index begins to lean toward optimism again, many investors see this as a rare window to enter early before the next bullish wave. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will redefine decentralized lending through a dual-model system that balances safety and profit potential. The first mode, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), will allow users to deposit major assets such as USDT and ETH into audited lending pools and earn dynamic yields based on utilization. The second mode, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), will enable users to negotiate direct lending deals for higher-risk tokens like DOGE, or TRUMP, earning greater returns in exchange for increased exposure. Both models will be powered by mtTokens, which represent users’ share in the lending pools and form the base for staking rewards. This structure ensures transparent participation while maintaining strong collateralization and liquidity. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its synchronized launch approach. The platform and token will go live together, allowing lending and staking to start immediately after listing. This feature will transform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from a presale token into a working defi product from day one, offering tangible yield rather than speculative hype. Buybacks and Passive Rewards for Long-Term Participants Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reward its long-term supporters through a structured buy-and-distribute system. A portion of the platform’s revenue, collected from borrowing interest, will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as regular rewards. This cycle will generate steady buying pressure while strengthening the token’s long-term value. The direct link between revenue and rewards makes the system sustainable. Every lending transaction will contribute to MUTM’s demand, creating an ecosystem where growth supports both price stability and staker income. Early participation in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already shows how strategic timing can multiply returns. An investor who bought $5,000 worth of MUTM during Phase 2 at $0.020 received 250,000 tokens. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, that same holding is now valued around $8,750, representing a 75% gain. When the token reaches its upcoming target of $0.15 after launch, the same investment will grow to $37,500, which equals a 650% increase. This is not a speculative projection but a result driven by utility, staking rewards, and constant buyback activity designed to support value. Launch, Expansion, and Long-Term Vision The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform will launch alongside the token listing, allowing users to lend and stake from the first day. Recently Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced through its official X handle that its V1 protocol rollout is scheduled for the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This version will include the platform’s foundational components, such as the liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot designed to maintain efficiency and security. During this phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and utilize ETH or USDT as collateral. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) treats security as a foundation for trust. The project has completed a CertiK audit with a score of 90, confirming the reliability of its smart contracts. A $50,000 bug bounty program is also in place to ensure continuous safety improvements. To strengthen community engagement, the project has launched a $100,000 giveaway for ten winners who will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. These initiatives show the team’s focus on building a transparent, secure, and rewarding environment for early supporters. The Final Word Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines real defi functionality with audited security and sustainable tokenomics. With Phase 6 nearly sold out and the next price increase approaching, this is the last opportunity to secure MUTM at $0.035 before it climbs to $0.040 and beyond. It is a functioning, yield-generating protocol designed for lasting adoption rather than speculation. As market sentiment shifts and the crypto fear and greed index moves toward confidence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the crypto to buy now. For investors who want to add a real utility token to their portfolio, this low-cost entry could become one of 2026’s biggest success stories.

People familiar with the talks say that senior Trump officials in the administration have convened a series of high-level meetings since August to explore how the United States can persuade more foreign countries to use the US dollar as their primary currency or reserve currency. Discussion participants include the Treasury, the White House, and the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, as well as outside experts such as Steve Hanke, a Johns Hopkins University economist best known for his work on currency stabilization and currency denomination. Hanke reported that the policy discussions concerned were not to be mentioned, but rather that the matters were deliberative in nature. He added that Washington was becoming increasingly concerned over China’s de-dollarization aspirations, which entail using the yuan and other currencies for foreign commerce, thereby challenging the dollar’s global dominance. A spokesperson for the White House confirmed that the meetings with experts had indeed taken place and stated that the administration routinely receives input on significant economic issues. Nonetheless, the spokesperson stated that the administration had yet to make a final decision on the strategy. Beijing’s currency diplomacy alarms Washington China’s intention to oppose the US dollar persists as the country accelerates its global campaign to promote the yuan. This includes signing currency-swap agreements with its main trading partners and promoting local currency settlements to limit the dollar’s clout. Most recently, Beijing extended and doubled the size of its 360 billion yuan swap line with South Korea, a move analysts view as an essential aspect of wider efforts to promote the yuan internationally and create financial reserves against Western sanctions. Moreover, China has also expanded Chinese yuan oil and gas trading with Russia and the Gulf as another indicator of Beijing’s ambition to undermine the dollar’s primacy in world energy pricing. Bank for International Settlements data show that the yuan accounts for over 5% of global payments, its highest share to date. In Washington, the phenomenon raises concerns. Administration officials call it a “slow erosion” of one of America’s most valuable instruments: the unrivaled function of the dollar in the global financial order. A senior official with experience in the field stated that the issue was not merely economic, warning that the United States could lose many of its key tools and a significant portion of its influence in areas such as sanctions, trade, and diplomacy. Targeting dollar adoption in struggling economies Some in the administration explore ways to counter China’s economic influence by promoting “dollarization” in finance-vulnerable states. According to Hanke, they identified several emerging markets as likely candidates for the US dollar, comprising Argentina, Lebanon, Ghana, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. In particular, Argentina remains a focal point. The country is currently facing another wave of currency instability , with the annual inflation rate exceeding 200% at the start of the year. Argentina had a currency limit in place for over a decade, from 1991 to 2002, when it was abandoned during an unprecedented economic collapse. According to well-known economist Jay Newman, a former partner at Elliott Management, full dollarization of the Argentine economy may finally “break the cycle” of constant devaluations and massive capital flight. Nevertheless, critics, such as the International Monetary Fund, warn that eagerness for dollarization puts a foreign policy issue into the hands of Washington. Moreover, in addition to physical currencies, the United States resumed its interest in the dollar’s global application in digital finance. Those close to the talks claim this administration deems the dollar-backed stablecoins and blockchain-based payment systems a convenient modern tool to secure the US dollar’s central international role. Hanke clarified that the Treasury is also researching how some of the recent advancements can assist the US in controlling the growing national digital currencies that have emerged in recent years.

With ongoing developments in cross-border payments, institutional liquidity solutions, and the increasing relevance of tokenized finance, market participants are looking ahead to how XRP might perform by the end of the year. To gain a clearer perspective, we asked ChatGPT to provide a price projection for XRP on November 30, 2025. The model’s analysis considered fundamentals, liquidity data, historical patterns, and the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets. Market Context and Timing According to ChatGPT, the outlook for XRP aligns with what it described as the “late-2025 leg of the crypto bull cycle.” Altcoins tied to real utility rather than purely speculative demand tend to outperform during this phase. The model referenced Bitcoin’s April 2024 halving , noting that altcoin rallies typically follow twelve to eighteen months later, positioning the fourth quarter of 2025 as a key performance window. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Utility and Regulatory Drivers ChatGPT emphasized the influence of utility-driven growth , pointing to the broader adoption of Ripple’s XRP-powered technology across institutional corridors. It noted that pilots involving real-world asset tokenization and central bank digital currencies are likely to be more visible toward the end of the year. If a measurable share of international settlement traffic uses the XRP Ledger for liquidity, the model suggested that such activity could support higher valuations. The AI also referenced legislation like the GENIUS Act, which was passed into law, and the CLARITY Act . According to the model, these developments could help establish XRP as a regulated commodity, allowing for institutional participation through vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and settlement products. ChatGPT’s Targets for XRP In its technical breakdown, ChatGPT identified an accumulation pattern between $2 and $3.5, based on observed trading depth and algorithmic buying behavior. It also highlighted a projected Fibonacci extension near $4.7, which marks a potential resistance point. After compiling its models and data inputs, ChatGPT set a base-case forecast for XRP at $4.85 by November 30, with an expected range within $3.7 and $6.1. It further outlined three potential outcomes: a bullish case of $6.5 to $9 if global adoption expands rapidly, a base case of $4 to $5 with a gradual rise in institutional demand , and a bearish case of $1.8 to $3.

Key Takeaways: Arca’s Jeff Dorman criticized Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for referencing prediction market bets during the company’s earnings call. Armstrong mentioned crypto buzzwords like “Bitcoin” and “Web3” that users had wagered would appear. The incident reignited debate over market integrity. Dorman said Armstrong’s comments “mocked the industry” and undermined efforts to build institutional trust in crypto. Coinbase CEO Drops Bitcoin and Web3 Mentions After Tracking Prediction Market Bets At the end of the call on Thursday, Armstrong admitted he had been “tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call.” He then added the words “Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Staking, and Web3” – terms that users on Polymarket and Kalshi had wagered would be mentioned. His remark effectively allowed some bettors to win. Bloomberg reported that more than $84,000 was staked on whether those keywords would be said during the call. The moment quickly spread across social media, sparking debate over whether Armstrong’s actions were simply playful or potentially manipulative. Dorman wasn’t amused. “You need your head examined if you think it’s cute or clever or savvy that the CEO of the biggest company in this industry openly manipulated a market,” he wrote on X. He added that such behavior damages credibility, especially as firms like Arca work to position crypto as a serious, institutional asset class. I’m tired of dumping on Clownbase, but you need your head examined if you think it’s cute or clever or savvy that the CEO of the biggest company in this industry openly manipulated a market. It’s not fun working tirelessly for 8 years trying to educate institutional investors on… https://t.co/7XCJ8tYhMb — Jeff Dorman (@jdorman81) October 31, 2025 Polymarket, one of the platforms hosting the bets, reacted in jest, calling Armstrong’s actions “diabolical work.” However, the incident underscored how lightly regulated “mention markets” can be influenced when public figures knowingly reference their outcomes. Coinbase later clarified that its employees are barred from participating in prediction markets involving the company. Notably, Coinbase has invested in both Polymarket and Kalshi, and Armstrong used the same call to promote the firm’s new “Everything Exchange,” which may eventually support prediction markets. Responding to the backlash, Armstrong posted on X, “lol this was fun – happened spontaneously when someone on our team dropped a link in the chat.” lol this was fun – happened spontaneously when someone on our team dropped a link in the chat https://t.co/tQiV3B9jUj — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) October 31, 2025 Coinbase Rejects Senator’s Claim of Ties to Trump’s ‘Corruption Factory’ Coinbase has denied allegations from Senator Chris Murphy , who accused the exchange of being part of what he called President Donald Trump’s “corruption factory.” Murphy cited Coinbase’s donations to Trump’s inauguration and a new White House ballroom project, as well as its political spending through Fairshake, a crypto-backed super PAC that supported pro-crypto candidates. In response, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad called the claims “ridiculous,” saying the senator ignored “basic facts.” Shirzad clarified that Fairshake is a non-partisan PAC that supported both Republicans and Democrats, including several of Murphy’s Senate colleagues. He added that corporate donations to presidential inaugurations have been standard practice for decades and fully disclosed under campaign finance law. Addressing concerns over the ballroom donation, Shirzad said Coinbase’s contribution was part of a broader corporate effort through the Trust for the National Mall, alongside firms such as Apple, Google, and Ripple. The White House confirmed the ballroom’s $300 million cost is funded privately.

Meme tokens are showing fresh signs of life, and analysts say PEPE could be gearing up for another significant move. The latest Pepe Price Prediction suggests a possible breakout in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, as the frog-themed favourite prepares for action, attention is shifting quietly to Remittix (RTX) . This rising payments-focused cryptocurrency, some traders believe, could outperform meme tokens by a wide margin this year. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: Signs of a Breakout PEPE is currently trading at about $0.00000670, with support at $0.000010. In the last 48 hours, Pepe’s trading volume has increased by almost 20%, according to analysts, indicating a fresh surge in retail activity. Many anticipate a surge toward $0.000009–$0.000012 if PEPE closes above the resistance at $0.0000008. Although technical analysts warn that meme coins like PEPE frequently rely strongly on momentum and that sustained growth can be difficult in the absence of wider market support, the bullish scenario looks encouraging. The Meme Coin Fatigue Factor Even as meme coins recover, many investors are now diversifying into tokens with real-world utility. The last two cycles were dominated by hype, but this one is shifting toward projects offering practical use cases, DeFi, payments, and cross-chain integrations. That’s why growing sections of the market are calling PEPE “a short-term play,” while looking elsewhere for longer-term growth. Remittix: The Token Set To Outpace Meme Coins in 2025 This is where Remittix (RTX) enters the conversation. Built on Ethereum and expanding to Solana, Polygon, and Avalanche, Remittix isn’t another speculative DeFi project; it’s a cross-chain payments system designed for real-world use. The platform enables users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, instantly converting it to fiat with low gas fees and no involvement from centralised exchanges. The Remittix wallet beta is now live, with over 40,000 holders already testing the system. The project has raised $27.7 million, earned the #1 ranking on CertiK Skynet, and confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank. This combination of functionality and adoption is why analysts believe Remittix (RTX) could outperform many meme coins, with some projecting potential gains of up to 50x through 2025. While PEPE’s community keeps it relevant, Remittix’s real-world payments utility gives it staying power, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments of the cycle. Pepe Looks Promising, But Remittix Promises Real Utility Meme coins like PEPE may experience a short-term bounce as traders return to riskier plays. Still, long-term investors are starting to favour projects like Remittix (RTX) that combine real-world adoption with early growth potential. The Pepe Price Prediction shows room for upside; yet, the smarter bet might be balancing speculation with sustainability, and that’s precisely where Remittix shines.

Notably, analysis of on-chain data indicates that these assets are primarily within the privacy-focused sector. Despite the momentum, the overbought condition suggests that traders may need to wait on the sidelines, as such moves could trigger a price correction. Zcash (ZEC) Zcash ( ZEC ) has been one of the strongest-performing privacy coins in recent weeks, but its technical indicators now signal caution. As of press time, ZEC was trading around $417, down 0.09% in the last 24 hours and 3.51% over the past week, suggesting that short-term momentum may be cooling. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ), which measures market momentum, shows ZEC nearing 70, typically considered overbought. According to the latest RSI data, ZEC’s 15-minute RSI sits at 51.39, one-hour at 53.09, four-hour at 61.98, 12-hour at 72.51, and 24-hour at 77.07, placing it solidly in the overbought zone across longer time frames. ZEC RSI readings. Source: Coinglass Dash (DASH) On the other hand, Dash (DASH) IS displaying an even more aggressive overbought profile. The token is trading at $89.78, up 1.05% in the past 24 hours and an impressive 30.53% for the week, reflecting strong speculative buying. The RSI readings highlight this momentum: 15-minute at 63.06, one-hour at 78.76, four-hour at 91.45, 12-hour at 83.59, and 24-hour at 82.57, all deeply overbought. Dash RSI readings. Source: Coinglass Such elevated RSI levels suggest that DASH has entered an overheated zone where prices have surged much faster than underlying fundamentals can justify. Just like ZEC, the coin’s sharp rally follows renewed attention on privacy assets and a technical breakout above key resistance, but the probability of a pullback or consolidation phase is high. Despite these recent gains, DASH faces structural challenges, particularly from tightening global regulations on privacy coins, which could impact liquidity and exchange access.

The former exchange CEO was sentenced in 2023 to 11,196 years in jail for various financial crimes. Thodex CEO Might Have Committed Suicide: Turkish Minister On Saturday, November 1, Bloomberg reported that Ozer died in his prison cell in the F-Type High Security Closed Prison in the Western Turkish city of Tekirdag. Citing Turkish broadcaster TRT, Bloomberg revealed that the authorities are investigating the founder’s death, with a focus on the possibility of a suicide. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said in a statement: An investigation has been opened on this matter and is ongoing. The exact cause of death will be determined as a result of the investigation. But currently, the initial findings indicate that it was a suicide. Ozer was found hanging in the bathroom of his single-person prison cell, which led the investigative speculations on the cause of death being a suicide. However, the Tekirdag F-Type High Security Closed Prison has been called out in the past by some human rights organizations for its use of solitary confinement and small-group isolation. Ozer, who established the cryptocurrency exchange Thodex in 2017, fled to Albania after the abrupt collapse of his firm in 2021. Following his extradition from Albania in 2022, the former crypto CEO, along with his two siblings, was found guilty by an Istanbul court for various crimes, including aggravated fraud, money laundering, and running a criminal organization. Ozer revealed in a statement released shortly after the implosion of Thodex that he had thought of surrendering to law enforcement or committing suicide. However, the former exchange boss chose instead to flee Turkey for Albania in order to “stay alive and fight, work and repay my debts.” In the initial case brought against Ozer, the prosecutor estimated the total losses incurred by investors to be around $24 million after Thodex’s collapse. However, the Turkish media put the figures as high as $2 billion, while a data analytics firm reported a $2.6 billion loss. Crypto Total Market Cap At $3.66 Trillion As of this writing, the cryptocurrency total market capitalization stands at around $3.66 trillion, reflecting a 0.39% jump in the past 24 hours. However, a broader look shows that the market is on a downward trend, falling by nearly 10% in the past month.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto exchange|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|Faruk Fatih Ozer|Thodex,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 11:00:06

According to supporters of XRP, that headline misses a bigger picture: Ripple has been buying firms that touch much larger pools of money. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Shaves $5 Billion From Satoshi Nakamoto’s Untouched Fortune Western Union’s deal could steer over $100 billion in annual cross-border flow to Solana. But some say that sum is small compared with the pipelines Ripple is tying into. Trillions Not Billions Based on reports, Ripple has added firms that already sit inside massive payment and liquidity systems. Hidden Road, a global prime brokerage, clears about $3 trillion a year. GTreasury provides treasury tools that move trillions in payments across 160+ countries. Rail handles roughly 10% of all stablecoin-based payment volume worldwide. Those figures matter because ownership gives a different kind of access than a short-term partnership does. many of you have asked for my thoughts on the western union x solana announcement, so here they are. TLDR: billions are cool, but trillions are cooler. while western union handles billions of dollars each year, ripple is on its way to handling trillions of dollars each year.… — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 29, 2025 Market Comment And Skepticism Market voices pushed back. Scott Melker questioned XRP’s current role after Western Union chose Solana, noting Western Union had tested the XRP Ledger for years. That choice has prompted debate about whether XRP still matters for big global payments right now. At the same time, Ripple’s backers argue a deeper story exists beyond which chain a single company picks for its stablecoin. XRP As The Settlement Layer According to Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, the proper lens is scale. He says the conversation should not center on deals worth billions but on the trillions Ripple now touches through acquisitions. Kwok and others suggest those companies could be steered to use the XRP Ledger for settlement over time. Ripple’s own technology and business moves are being framed as the plumbing that could let XRP settle large, institutional flows. Supporters Speak Up Flare CEO Hugo Philion has also downplayed the Western Union news, saying it does not undercut Ripple’s strategy. Based on reports from community figures, some engineers and analysts now say XRP could shift from a bridge token to a place people hold value. There will come a time where XRP and XRPL is just where you keep most of your wealth. That is called Treasury. Hint hint. — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 17, 2025 Vincent Van Code told followers that “a time will come when XRP and the XRP Ledger are just where you keep most of your wealth,” a view which mirrors comments by Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz about users acting as their own banks. Ownership Vs. Partnerships When a company owns a platform, it can choose how that tool grows. Reports show acquisitions give Ripple a steadier role in payments and trading services than a single contract would. Yet ownership does not guarantee instant change. Moving institutional flows onto a specific ledger is complex and can take time. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters The Big Leagues — Stadium And Jerseys Get A Crypto Makeover What This Means Going Forward For now, the debate will track two threads. One asks whether wins like Western Union’s Solana deal signal broader market preference. The other watches whether Ripple’s purchases translate into actual settlement volume for XRP. Numbers such as $3 trillion, trillions across 160+ countries, and 10% of stablecoin payments give weight to the second view. But adoption at scale is not automatic, and observers will be looking for clear signs that those trillions are truly shifting toward the XRP Ledger.

The latest headline-maker came from Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , who took to X (formerly Twitter) to warn of a “massive crash” that could “wipe out millions.” Kiyosaki’s post, seen by 4.6 million users, urged investors to seek safety in silver, gold, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. MASSIVE CRASH BEGININING: Millions will be wiped out. Protect yourself. Silver, gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum investors will protect you. Take care — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 1, 2025 While his warnings echo broader concerns about overvalued markets, Bitcoin’s steady price suggests traders are not panicking. Instead, many are positioning around technical consolidation patterns that hint at a potential breakout. Bitcoin’s Technical Picture: A Tightening Triangle On the technical front, Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC’s price action shows a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic sign of narrowing volatility before a breakout. The cryptocurrency has found consistent support along its ascending trendline near $106,375, while overhead resistance remains capped at $111,675. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin trades close to its 50-period EMA, indicating equilibrium between bulls and bears. The RSI around 49 signals neutrality, while a series of higher lows points toward cautious accumulation. If Bitcoin closes decisively above $111,700, momentum could lift prices toward $116,350 or even $119,750, according to Fibonacci projections. Conversely, a dip below $106,000 could trigger a short-term correction toward $103,500, but technical support zones suggest downside risk remains limited. Key short-term signals traders are watching: Breakout confirmation above $111,700 to target $116,000+ Support holding at $106,000 to preserve bullish bias Increasing trading volume to confirm directional breakout Market Sentiment: Fear or Foundation for a Rally? While Kiyosaki’s warning adds a layer of uncertainty, it may also signal rising investor skepticism—a sentiment often seen before strong recoveries. Historically, Bitcoin has performed best when fear peaks but technical support holds firm. With its market cap above $2.2 trillion and a circulating supply nearing 19.94 million BTC, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. The asset continues to benefit from institutional inflows and post-halving optimism heading into 2025. If Bitcoin breaks above its tightening range, a rally toward $120,000 could unfold in the coming weeks, fueled by renewed risk appetite and speculation that the worst of market fear is already priced in. As volatility builds, the key question remains, will Kiyosaki’s crash warning mark the beginning of panic, or the perfect contrarian signal for Bitcoin’s next major breakout? Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $25.5 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013205 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

This comes as the parent company saw increased visibility across UFC matches, leading to an uptick of combat sports fans in crypto. Announced Thursday, $FIGHT, a combat sports utility token helping fans build digital identities on-chain, has raised $183 million in its Phase 2 Presale, surpassing the initial target of $1.5 million. The $FIGHT presale Phase 2 completed today on Holoworld, a Solana launchpad, showing increased demand for fan tokens in the MMA world. As a result, FIGHT, the app, reported more than 500K app sign-ups with Fight ID, topping up to the successful funding round. Fight ID provides fans and fighters a portable, on‑chain identity that helps them identify in the community, build a reputation, and own the sport. The token is developed by Fight Foundation, in conjunction with FightFi, to build an ecosystem that unites combat sports fans. Following the end of Phase 2 presale, participants will share 1% of the total $FIGHT supply (100 million tokens) and will be able to utilize the token on the platform. As the utility token, $FIGHT is used to incentivize fans, claim rewards, buy merchandise on FightID, and engage with combat sports fans, with other utilities set to be added in the future. The presale was launched on Holoworld on Solana, leveraging the fast speeds and low cost of the blockchain. The first presale was on BSC, also successfully raising more than the team planned, with over $15 million in demand, exceeding its original target by over 20x. Phase 1 participants were refunded by Holoworld before the launch of Phase 2 presale on Solana, a statement from Holoworld confirmed. A Striking Partnership With UFC The presale demand is heavily influenced by FightID’s partnership with the UFC, which was announced in September. The partnership offers recurring visibility for the platform and its token, building a presence amongst UFC fans every match week. According to its website, the partnership will allow Fight to be “promoted in the same rhythm that UFC cards are announced, marketed, and broadcast”. This means the company can tap into the millions of UFC fans and combat sports audiences watching around the globe during the marketing period, weigh-in day, and fight day. Additionally, it provides a gateway for new audiences to join the crypto ecosystem through a fun, competitive, and interactive channel. The goal is to drive fans to complete small actions that stake their claim in the fight world, such as creating a FightID, earning fighter points (FP), and learning how to use $FIGHT inside prediction markets, staking, and fighter communities. Uniting global fans through $FIGHT The UFC partnership drives new, mainstream combat sports fans into crypto natives. The company, however, targets a larger goal of transforming real-world fights into on-chain events. This opens a world of possibilities in predictions, fan support, and content creation in combat sports. The $FIGHT token revolutionizes how fans interact with the sport, giving them the opportunity to directly participate in the sport they love. The token has been designed to unite global fighting fans, capturing the thrill of combat sports and unlocking new ways for fans, athletes, and creators to participate. The token bridges the passion for martial arts and digital assets, introducing millions of people to Web3. According to its roadmap, the project will develop Fighthub, a platform for fan loyalty programs; the Fight.ID system for wallets and digital identities; Prize Fight, a dedicated reward fund tied to each athlete’s journey; and Fight Gear, high-end clothing available only within the FIGHT network. This gives extra utility for the $FIGHT token. The launch of $FIGHT will empower fans to participate through an ecosystem defined by identity, reputation, and ownership, the three key pillars of the project.

The White House released the full terms. The deal is meant to de-escalate the trade fight between both countries. It includes lowered U.S. tariffs, large Chinese purchases of American farm goods, and China reversing several export control and retaliation measures. Trump said the move will “reset the terms of trade” and shift how both countries manage critical supply chains and controlled materials. The deal also pauses China’s planned restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets. Those materials are required for chipmaking, EV motors, renewable power equipment, and weapons manufacturing. China will issue general licenses to allow exports of rare earths, gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite to U.S. companies and suppliers. The White House said this reverses Chinese controls announced in April 2025 and October 2022. Trump described the outcome as “a necessary step to stop market pressure tactics.” China suspends export controls and trade retaliation China will halt the global rollout of the new export controls it announced on October 9, 2025. It will also stop retaliation taken since March 4, 2025. That retaliation included tariffs on U.S. soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, pork, beef, chicken, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and aquatic products. China will also lift non‑tariff moves such as placing American firms on “unreliable entity” lists. Officials said the lists blocked companies from government procurement and domestic contracts. China will buy at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S. soybeans in the last two months of 2025, and at least 25 MMT each year in 2026, 2027, and 2028. China will also resume purchases of U.S. sorghum and hardwood logs. The White House said the volume commitments are tied to supply chain stabilization and market dependability. China will end investigations into U.S. companies in the semiconductor supply chain. Those include antitrust, anti‑monopoly, and anti‑dumping probes . China will also take actions to ensure trade resumes from Nexperia facilities in China. Those facilities produce legacy chips used in industrial, automotive, and defense systems. They had been limited due to trade friction. China will take “significant measures” to stop the movement of fentanyl precursors into the United States. China will block certain chemicals entirely from being sent to North America and will strictly control the export of others to all countries. The White House said this was required because fentanyl precursor supply chains rely heavily on Chinese chemical plants. United States lowers tariffs and delays enforcement actions The United States will reduce tariffs placed to curb fentanyl-linked imports by removing 10 percentage points from the cumulative rate. This change begins November 10, 2025. The U.S. will keep the current 10% reciprocal tariff in place during a suspension period lasting until November 10, 2026. The U.S. will also extend the expiration of certain Section 301 tariff exclusions from November 29, 2025 to November 10, 2026. The U.S. will delay the implementation of the Expansion of End‑User Controls rule for one year starting November 10, 2025. The U.S. will also suspend for one year actions tied to the Section 301 investigation into China’s maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. While paused, negotiations will continue. The U.S. will also keep coordination active with South Korea and Japan to support U.S. shipbuilding and technology supply chains. The agreement comes at the end of Trump’s Asia trip. In Malaysia, Trump signed reciprocal trade agreements with Malaysia and Cambodia, and announced negotiation frameworks with Thailand and Vietnam. Trump also signed critical minerals deals with Thailand and Malaysia. In Japan, Trump announced new projects linked to Japan’s $550 billion investment commitment in the U.S. and expanded energy and counter‑narcotics cooperation. In the Republic of Korea, he secured funding and industrial cooperation measures tied to maritime infrastructure, energy supply, and technology manufacturing.

Bitcoin is climbing toward record highs, and Ethereum’s strength continues to drive liquidity across the market. Yet, behind the scenes, the smartest money in crypto is rotating early—not into established giants, but into emerging AI-driven projects poised to dominate the next growth phase. At the center of that rotation stands Ozak AI , a groundbreaking AI-powered presale project currently priced at $0.012. With over $4.2 million raised, more than 980 million tokens sold, and partnerships spanning multiple blockchain ecosystems, Ozak AI is redefining what it means to invest early. Analysts believe a modest $3,000 entry today could grow into a $250,000 portfolio by 2026—an astonishing 83x return driven by one of crypto’s most compelling innovations. Why Ozak AI Is the Project Every Smart Investor Is Watching Ozak AI is capturing market attention for one powerful reason—it’s not a meme coin, and it’s not a speculative gamble. It’s a utility-focused project built at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain analytics. Its ecosystem revolves around AI prediction agents, autonomous systems that process blockchain transactions, market sentiment, and trading data in real time. These agents generate actionable insights and predictive signals for traders and institutions, helping them make smarter, faster, and more profitable decisions. This real-world functionality gives Ozak AI an edge over typical OZ presale tokens that rely purely on hype. The project’s use case aligns perfectly with two global megatrends—AI adoption and decentralized finance—making it one of the few early-stage tokens with the potential for sustainable long-term growth. Turning $3,000 Into $250,000 At its current presale price of $0.012, a $3,000 investment buys 250,000 Ozak AI tokens. If the token reaches $1 by 2026—a price many analysts consider realistic given its momentum—that same $3,000 turns into $250,000. Even at a more conservative target of $0.50, the bag would still be worth $125,000, representing a 40x ROI. These figures highlight the asymmetrical nature of Ozak AI’s opportunity—high upside, low initial capital, and enormous potential for early investors. Compare that to large-cap assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, where a 2x or 3x return is the best-case scenario in the current cycle. The difference is clear: Ozak AI isn’t a long hold for slow gains—it’s a high-leverage innovation play with the power to transform modest investments into generational wealth. Partnerships That Power Ozak AI’s Rise Ozak AI’s credibility is reinforced by its strategic partnerships with Perceptron Network, HIVE, and SINT—three leading organizations at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and data infrastructure. Perceptron Network connects Ozak AI to over 700,000 decentralized AI nodes, improving data accuracy and prediction speed. HIVE enhances the integration of market signals and blockchain analytics, strengthening the foundation for Ozak AI’s prediction agents. SINT contributes cross-chain functionality, SDK tools, and voice-driven interfaces, expanding accessibility across AI and DeFi environments. On top of this, Ozak AI has undergone audits by CertiK and Sherlock, providing the transparency and security that presale investors demand. These validations elevate Ozak AI from a high-potential idea to a credible long-term ecosystem. Why Whales and Early Traders Are Rotating Into Ozak AI Large investors are already positioning themselves before the next presale stage increase. Whales understand that the real money in crypto is made by entering before the hype—when valuations are still low and multipliers are massive. As Ozak AI prepares to transition to Stage 7, where token prices will rise, early entrants are locking in allocations before the next wave of retail FOMO hits. This rotation mirrors patterns from previous cycles: Bitcoin profits flow into Ethereum, then into altcoins—and finally into early-stage projects with breakout potential. In 2025, that breakout narrative belongs to AI-powered crypto, and Ozak AI is leading it. A $3,000 Decision That Could Define 2026 Every bull market has a project that changes the game—and this time, that project is Ozak AI. With an early presale price, strong partnerships, and real-world AI integration, it offers one of the highest risk-to-reward ratios in the market today. A $3,000 investment might seem small now, but in a market where timing is everything, it could build a $250,000 portfolio by 2026. The investors who saw the potential in Ethereum under $100 or Solana under $2 didn’t just buy tokens—they bought vision. In 2025, that same vision points directly to Ozak AI—the project redefining the future of crypto intelligence and the top flip opportunity for those who move before the crowd. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced facts analytics for monetary markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, correct, and actionable insights to help crypto fanatics and companies make appropriate decisions.

The company focuses on improving privacy, security, and user experience within the Zcash ecosystem. One of the most notable innovations on the roadmap is the “temporary transparent address” system. Now, when users exchange ZEC through NEAR Intents, a new temporary transparent address will be generated for each transaction. This mechanism aims to increase privacy and reduce the interconnectivity between different transactions. Additionally, transparent address rotation is being introduced. This feature will automatically create a new address after each fund transfer, further anonymizing users' transaction history. ECC has also introduced a new system to streamline device connection management for Zashi-Keystone users. Users can disconnect and resync their Keystone hardware wallets at any time. Related News: Reason Behind Today's Notable Altcoin Surge Is Now Clear: Developers Will Only Get Paid If the Price Increases Fivefold Additionally, P2SH multi-signature support will be implemented on Keystone devices. This feature will ensure the secure management of Zcash Development Fund resources, contributing to the sustainable growth of the ecosystem. While Keystone will initially be used with Lockbox access, all wallets with PCZT integration will be able to use Keystone for signing transactions. According to Coingecko data, the market capitalization of Zcash (ZEC) has surpassed $7 billion, reaching $7,010,784,529, marking a new all-time high for the project. The ZEC price has increased by 5.9% in the last 24 hours. The surge in investor interest is driven by the upcoming Zcash halving, which will reduce mining rewards and significantly reduce the circulating supply of new ZEC. *This is not investment advice.

The 2025 bull market is not just about these well-known players; there's a growing interest in newer, innovative projects that meld artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. One such project making headlines is Ozak AI . This AI-driven venture has intrigued the market not merely by its ambitious technological promises but also by its impressive early financial metrics. With over $4.2 million already secured through funding and more than 980 million tokens sold, Ozak AI's entry into the market is anything but quiet. Encircled by significant blockchain partnerships and an expanding ecosystem, it's set to redefine early-stage investing. What Makes Ozak AI Stand Out? Rather than riding the waves of transient trends like meme coins, Ozak AI stakes its claim in the crypto space with a sturdy foundation of utility and real-world application. Positioned at the convergence of AI and blockchain, it leverages advanced predictive agents which analyze real-time data to provide market insights. This functional edge primes Ozak AI not only for current relevance but sustainable future growth. Investment Projections: Turning $3,000 into $250,000 At the heart of the financial discussion is the potential for a modest $3,000 investment to burgeon into a quarter-million-dollar portfolio by 2026. This projection hinges on the token's presale price, currently at $0.012. Should the token price ascend to $1, early investors would reap substantial rewards, showcasing an 83x return. The projection remains robust even under conservative estimates. Should Ozak AI's token price hit $0.50, a $3,000 stake could still translate into $125,000—a 40x return. This underlines the asymmetrical investment potential offered by Ozak AI compared to more established cryptocurrencies where returns are typically more subdued. Strategic Partnerships Enhancing Growth Significant collaborations bolster Ozak AI's market position. Partnerships with entities like Perceptron Network, HIVE, and SINT facilitate a robust data infrastructure, enhancing the predictive capabilities of Ozak AI's platform. These partnerships not only validate its technological promise but also enhance its operational efficacy. Why Investors are Flocking to Ozak AI Understanding the unique position of Ozak AI in the market, whale investors and savvy traders are already positioning their stakes early. By investing before the project enters its next development stage, these early adopters are poised to benefit from the first-mover advantage before mainstream FOMO sets in. The Vision Driving Ozak AI Ozak AI isn't just another crypto project. It's a vision of the future where blockchain meets AI to create a new paradigm in data-driven financial insights. For those who saw potential in early giants at their nascent stages, Ozak AI represents a similar frontier of opportunity today. About Ozak AI Ozak AI melds AI with blockchain to offer real-time analytics and insights, shaping the future of financial decision-making in the crypto world.

Experts Highlight New Altcoin as Top Growth Pick,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-cryptocurrency-to-buy-for-q1-2026-experts-highlight-new-altcoin-as-top-growth-pick/,"With the next market cycle fast approaching, analysts and investors are turning their attention to early-stage projects with strong fundamentals and utility. Many believe that 2026 could be a breakout year for DeFi-based altcoins that go beyond speculation and focus on revenue-driven ecosystems. Among the new entrants making waves is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto that experts now rank as one of the potential best cryptocurrencies to buy for Q1 2026. Mutuum Finance’s ongoing momentum has already captured the attention of thousands of investors and raised millions in funding. The project’s unique lending design, token distribution model, and upcoming protocol launch are fueling optimism that MUTM could be one of the top crypto to watch heading into the new year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a non-custodial decentralized lending and borrowing platform that uses smart contracts to make crypto markets more transparent and secure. Its goal is to give users more flexibility and control when lending or borrowing assets, all while keeping everything automated and on-chain. The system operates through two complementary markets: The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to deposit tokens into liquidity pools. In return, they receive mtTokens, which are yield-bearing tokens that automatically earn interest. For example, depositing 1 ETH would generate 1 mtETH, which increases in value as borrowers repay their loans. This approach allows investors to earn passive income without needing to manually manage or move their assets. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace gives users the ability to set their own terms on loans for less common assets. Borrowers and lenders can agree on interest rates, collateral types, and durations directly, creating more customized opportunities. Strong Demand and Clear Structure Mutuum Finance’s presale continues to gain traction, with investors quickly filling each stage as the project nears its next price milestone. Currently in Phase 6, each MUTM token is priced at $0.035, while the next stage will raise the price to $0.04. The confirmed launch price is $0.06, meaning early investors are positioned for 100-500% MUTM appreciation at listings. From the total 4 billion token supply, 45.5% (1.82 billion MUTM) are allocated for presale distribution. The project has already raised over $18 million and attracted more than 17,600 holders, showcasing strong investor confidence and a steady rate of growth. So far, over 785 million tokens have been allocated, marking around 80% of Phase 6 completion. MUTM’s presale began at $0.01 in Phase 1, meaning the token’s value has already increased by 250% from its starting point. As each stage sells out faster than the previous one, momentum is building toward full allocation and final listing. To keep engagement high, the project features a 24-hour leaderboard, where the top daily contributor wins $500 worth of MUTM tokens. This approach keeps the presale transparent and interactive while strengthening community involvement. Upcoming V1 Launch and Security Milestones The most anticipated part of Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is its V1 protocol launch , scheduled for Q4 2025 on the Sepolia Testnet. This version will introduce the foundation of Mutuum Finance’s ecosystem, including the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and an automated Liquidator Bot that maintains balance and security within the system. V1 will support ETH and USDT as the first lending and borrowing assets, chosen for their stability and deep liquidity. Once fully tested, the team plans to expand support to additional tokens and deploy across other blockchain networks. Mutuum Finance has already completed a CertiK security audit, achieving a 90/100 Token Scan Score, one of the highest in its category. This ensures that its smart contracts meet high safety and reliability standards before launch. The project also runs a $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards developers for responsibly identifying any potential issues before mainnet deployment. Experts predict that the V1 launch could be the first major trigger for price momentum. If Mutuum Finance successfully transitions from presale to active usage, the token could see gains of 500% to 800% over the following 12 to 18 months, depending on market conditions. Why MUTM Could Lead Q1 2026 Market analysts are now listing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2026, pointing to its clear roadmap and token model that ties revenue directly to holders. They see several factors that could help MUTM outperform many existing DeFi projects once it launches. One of the key advantages is the presale pricing. Investors are currently entering at $0.035 per token, while the confirmed listing price is $0.06. If MUTM reaches between $0.30 and $0.40 within its first year — a range analysts describe as realistic — that would mean potential gains of around 700% to 900% from today’s level. Analysts also emphasize utility-based growth as a major strength. MUTM’s demand is tied to lending activity and protocol fees, which are used to buy tokens from the open market and distribute them to stakers. This creates ongoing demand and adds stability to the ecosystem, unlike meme coins that rely on social hype. Timing is another important factor. The V1 protocol launch, scheduled for Q4 2025, will allow MUTM to enter Q1 2026 with a working product, real users, and active liquidity. This positions the project for stronger adoption and sustained growth through the next cycle. Together, these points make Mutuum Finance stand out as one of the best cryptocurrencies to consider before 2026, offering both early-stage entry potential and real long-term utility.

The crypto market never sleeps, and investors are already positioning for the next breakout cycle. From meme coins that fuel viral excitement to blockchain giants that power real utility, several tokens stand out as top choices for 2025. This list brings together ten projects that blend long-term potential with high-energy community backing. Each crypto was chosen for unique strengths like staking, scalability, adoption, or viral reach. If you’re building a portfolio around the best cryptos to hold in 2025, these names deserve your attention. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Best Cryptos To Hold In 2025 MoonBull ($MOBU) is rewriting what meme coins can be. It’s a community-first token on Ethereum that rewards early believers through reflections, staking, and burns. Unlike typical hype coins, MoonBull focuses on transparency and sustainability, making it one of the best cryptos to hold in 2025 . Every trade strengthens its economy: part of each sale goes to liquidity, part to holders, and another part is burned forever. The project has two standout features. The first is trust. MoonBull’s audit has been completed, and its liquidity is locked, proving that safety isn’t optional. The second is a referral system that actually pays. Share your code, and you get 15% of your invitee’s purchase instantly, while your invitee receives 15% more tokens. The top referrers also earn monthly USDC bonuses. Together, these systems reward loyalty, encourage growth, and strengthen the community. MoonBull’s presale numbers are lighting up dashboards across the industry. The project is now in its 5th stage with a current price of $0.00006584 and over $500,000 raised. More than 1,700 holders have already joined. The ROI from Stage 5 to the listing price of $0.00616 is above 9,256%, while early supporters have seen 163% growth so far. The next stage is projected to bring a 27.4% price jump. To put it into perspective, a $20,000 investment at the current price is equivalent to about 303,766,707 MOBU tokens. At the listing price, that investment could grow to roughly $1.87 million. Why did this coin make it to this list? MoonBull earned its spot because it delivers fairness, passive rewards, and growth potential wrapped in meme energy. It’s not just hype; it’s structured to reward both early and long-term holders. 2. Aster (ASTER): Multi-Chain Trading Power Aster deserves its place among the best cryptos to hold in 2025 because it bridges decentralized trading and professional-grade performance.

Its roadmap combines entertainment with economics, giving meme traders both fun and functional rewards. The project’s presale has already drawn early whales, and its community is growing daily. The combination of staking, referral perks, and long-term tokenomics makes BullZilla a high-risk but high-potential coin for next year. Why did this coin make it to this list? BullZilla made it because it blends meme hype with real earning potential, a rare balance that fits today’s presale trend. 4. La Culex ($CULEX): The Stylish Meme Movement La Culex ($CULEX) is a design-driven meme coin built for traders who care about culture and branding as much as numbers. With its cool Buzz Gang mascot, La Culex sets itself apart through community engagement and clean Ethereum-based tokenomics. It features staking, giveaways, and burns that push organic growth. As an upcoming project, La Culex is still under development but is already generating strong buzz. Early supporters expect listings and partnerships that could ignite another wave of meme-coin enthusiasm. Why did this coin make it to this list? La Culex secured its place for its creativity, strong community roots, and potential to become a top meme coin for 2025. 5.

Despite past network issues, Solana has consistently bounced back and maintained a top-five market cap position. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana earned its place for speed, scalability, and ecosystem depth that support real blockchain adoption. 6.

Despite legal battles, Ripple continues to secure new partnerships and expand its tokenization and treasury solutions. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ripple remains a top hold due to its utility in international payments and its potential rebound following regulatory clarity. 8.

Most larger-cap alts are with minor losses over the past day, led by HYPE, BCH, HBAR, ZEC, and TAO. BTC Stopped at $111K For Now The primary cryptocurrency began the business week on the right foot, with a price surge to just over $116,000 on Monday. After a minor correction, it spiked above that line again on Tuesday, where it was stopped and pushed south hard. On Wednesday, BTC had calmed at around $112,000 before the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates for the second consecutive time in the past few months. Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop that drove it south to $110,000 and even lower on Thursday when the asset slipped below $106,500. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and initiated a leg up that drove BTC up to $111,500. However, that was a short-term rally once again, and bitcoin has been unable to run higher since then. In the past few hours, it tried to overcome $111,000 but to no avail so far. Its market cap has reclaimed the $2.2 trillion level on CG, while its dominance over the alts has stalled at 58%. BTCUSD.

The post distinguishes between blockchains built around middlemen and those that enable complete financial autonomy. It presents XRP as a solution for individuals seeking full control over their assets without relying on custodial institutions or permissioned systems. The statement underscores XRP’s role as a tool for financial self-determination, which enables users to transact securely and freely without intermediaries’ interference or taxation. Ripple : David Schwartz sums it up perfectly: $XRP isn’t about replacing banks it’s about removing them from the equation. No middlemen. No permission. No risk of freeze or clawback. The future of value is self-sovereign. pic.twitter.com/fziWqQooBM — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) October 30, 2025 XRP’s design and value proposition Schwartz emphasized that XRP’s integration with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) gives it a unique position in the digital asset space. The design ensures that XRP can directly capture some of the value generated by transactions conducted on the ledger. He noted that XRP is distinct because it operates without a counterparty, meaning it can be used and accessed globally with no risk of default, freeze, or clawback. This characteristic reinforces XRP’s appeal as a neutral, non-sovereign asset that functions across jurisdictions, independent of any single entity’s control. The argument also touches on the broader issue of trust and security in the blockchain ecosystem. While many networks rely on intermediaries to manage accounts or facilitate transactions, XRPL’s structure enables individuals to be their own banks. This design reduces dependency on third parties and mitigates the risks that arise when financial access is restricted or revoked. Schwartz’s comments reaffirm that XRP’s utility lies not in displacing banks but in removing their necessity for digital settlement and cross-border value exchange. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community perspectives and broader implications Following BankXRP’s post, community members echoed similar sentiments. An X user, Vincent Hees, described XRP as a direct challenge to the traditional correspondent banking model that benefits a limited few through Vostro and Nostro arrangements. He suggested that XRPL’s framework could represent a future where value moves globally without the constraints of legacy banking networks. The emphasis on self-sovereignty and accessibility aligns with the long-standing narrative around XRP as a bridge asset designed to facilitate efficient, borderless transactions. Rather than replacing financial institutions, XRP removes unnecessary barriers, offering a system that moves value transparently and securely. Schwartz’s comments, as highlighted by BankXRP, reinforce the principle that the future of finance may rely not on institutions, but on open, permissionless networks where control remains with the individual.

The world’s biggest meme coin, Dogecoin, is having a rough year, losing over 40% in the first ten months of 2025. Has Dogecoin fallen out of favor with meme coin enthusiasts, or is it just waiting for one good push before revealing its true potential? Well, House of Doge – the official corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation – has done something that might just trigger the next Dogecoin rally. In partnership with Brag House Holdings Inc., it has acquired a majority stake in the Italian football club US Triestina Calcio 1918 – a team that competes in the Serie C tournament. Under this arrangement, the club will feature the Dogecoin motif on the front of its official match shirts – for the remainder of the 2025/26 season and all of the 2026/27 campaign. We see sport as one of the most powerful platforms for accelerating Dogecoin adoption. By becoming the largest equity holder of US Triestina Calcio 1918, House of Doge is…setting the stage for Dogecoin to be integrated into everyday culture – from payments to partnerships to global fan experiences. Imagine the Dogecoin logo appearing in every single match photo and TV shot of a major football club! That would surely boost its visibility and give it the hype trigger it needs to bark loudly again. Plus, branding on t-shirts and match kits is just one part of the deal. The broader plan is to test $DOGE as a payment option for tickets, merchandise, and other concessions. Although the exact terms of how this Dogecoin-based financial system will be rolled out remain unclear, the companies involved are keen on making $DOGE more than just a representative of the meme coin space – they want to turn it into an actual payments token with practical uses and global acceptance. Here’s the kicker now : With Dogecoin primed for mainstream visibility and potentially a new wave of investors, it could be the catalyst behind the next surge of dog-themed meme coins. Of course, you don’t want to discount $DOGE itself; it’s still a solid investment. However, due to the token’s maturity, it’s now very difficult to deliver 1,000% rallies like we saw in 2017 and 2021. By the way, this is also what we’re seeing with Bitcoin. That doesn’t mean you have to miss out on those kinds of true ‘crypto-like’ returns. This is why backing another Doge-themed altcoin that’s still under the radar and yet to hit the mainstream could be a very smart move. Enter Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Maxi Doge is Dogecoin on Steroids Maxi Doge isn’t one to shy away from its true nature. It proudly admits that it has no underlying utility or game-changing roadmap. That said, the mission it carries is what’s attracting investors and making $MAXI one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . Maxi and Doge go a long way back. In fact, according to Maxi, they belong to the same family and are distant cousins. Now, because of Dogecoin’s early success and fun-loving vibe, he stole away all the limelight from his younger cousin Maxi, who then had to spend his childhood in loneliness. And that exact hurt is what’s driving $MAXI to challenge his elder cousin’s dominance in the meme coin space. He doesn’t just want to become the next 1000x crypto – he wants to outperform Dogecoin and, for once, make him feel what he felt – but this time on a much larger scale, stealing attention from investors and traders alike. That’s also why Maxi Doge became everything Dogecoin is not. Compared to Dogecoin’s slim arms and cutesy aura, Maxi Doge is built like the Hulk, with protein shakes and caffeine in his veins, embodying the true spirit of a degen crypto trader, eyes red from staring at charts day and night. Decoding Maxi Doge’s Master Plan Maxi Doge’s developers have hit the nail on the head when it comes to knowing what it takes to become a top-trending crypto. That’s why they’ve reserved a whopping 40% of $MAXI’s total token supply for marketing purposes. This includes PR pushes, social media campaigns, and high-ticket influencer collaborations, all aimed at spreading Maxi Doge’s gym-bro humor across the crypto landscape. On top of that, $MAXI also plans to offer several community benefits. These include holder-only weekly trading events, complete with engaging competitions and leaderboard prizes. Then there’s Maxi’s ambition to list on futures platforms. This fired-up ‘dawg’ doesn’t want to settle for just CEX and DEX listings. By making itself available on the futures derivatives market, $MAXI wants to go toe-to-toe with Dogecoin in every possible arena. Not to mention, this will allow degen meme coin traders to use $MAXI as the perfect tool for their leveraged bets. Buy $MAXI’s Presale for Maximum Gains Maxi Doge ’s biggest selling point is that it’s a low-cap coin, giving you the chance to get positioned before what could turn out be a 2017-Dogecoin-like rally. Currently in presale, $MAXI has already attracted over $3.87M from early investors who, credit to its absurd yet amusing mission, are backing this token to become the next crypto to explode . Is this your first time buying a meme coin in presale? Check out our guide on how to buy $MAXI in four simple steps. Right now, one $MAXI token is available for just $0.000266. And according to our $MAXI price prediction : The token could hit a high of $0.0058 by the end of 2026, delivering a massive 2,000% ROI from current levels. But if you’re in it for the long haul, you’ll be glad to know that $MAXI could reach $0.01 by 2030 – a gobsmacking 3,600% return potentially on the cards. Grab your $MAXI tokens today – and join the next wave of dog meme coins. Disclaimer : Kindly do your own research before investing, as crypto is highly volatile and unpredictable.

It’s reflecting steady activity despite mild consolidation. As the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum continues to show resilience amid shifting macroeconomic sentiment, holding a market cap of $466.6 billion. With traders eyeing year-end momentum, technical indicators suggest ETH may be building toward a significant breakout, potentially targeting $4,500 by December 2025. Ethereum’s Price Consolidation Near $3,800 The ETH/USD pair has been consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, forming higher lows since October. This compression phase, marked by reduced volatility, typically signals an approaching breakout. Key support sits at $3,680, while resistance near $4,030 defines the short-term range. The RSI near 46 remains neutral, hinting at equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, the 50-period EMA has flattened, reflecting short-term indecision. Yet, the pattern’s geometry and Ethereum’s structural strength, particularly its consistent higher lows, suggest a bullish bias once momentum picks up. If ETH closes decisively above $4,030, it could trigger a move toward $4,250 and $4,485, both previous reaction highs and critical resistance levels. Bullish Continuation Pattern on Weekly Chart On the weekly timeframe, Ethereum maintains a bullish flag pattern, a continuation signal often preceding upward extensions in an existing uptrend. This flag structure is supported by strong fundamentals, rising on-chain activity, scaling upgrades, and sustained institutional inflows into Ethereum-based ETFs and staking products. Ethereum Weekly Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key technical markers include: Support: $3,513 and $2,734 Resistance: $4,960 and $6,353 RSI: Hovering around 63, showing steady bullish momentum If ETH breaks the $4,960 resistance, it could accelerate toward the Fibonacci 1.0 level at $6,353, with potential long-term extensions to $8,136 under favorable market conditions. December 2025 Outlook and Trade Setup Ethereum price prediction remains bullish as ETH’s tightening structure suggests that traders may soon face a pivotal moment. A breakout above $4,000–$4,100 would validate bullish continuation, opening long setups toward $4,500 by December 2025. Conversely, a failure to hold above $3,680 may invite short-term weakness, but major supports remain intact above $3,500. For long-term investors, Ethereum’s combination of robust network demand, consistent upgrades, and historical trend behavior supports a constructive outlook. A breakout from the flag could mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next major cycle, one that might redefine its valuation heading into 2026. Ethereum Price Forecast: ETH Eyes $4,250 Breakout as Triangle Pattern Tightens Ethereum (ETH/USD) is trading near $3,866, consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern as traders anticipate a decisive move. The chart reveals converging trendlines between support at $3,680 and resistance at $4,030, suggesting that volatility is tightening before a potential breakout. Despite a slight dip of 0.29% in the past 24 hours, Ethereum’s market cap remains above $466 billion, maintaining its dominance as the second-largest cryptocurrency. The 4-hour EMA structure indicates indecision, with price action hovering around the 50-period EMA, while the RSI at 46 signals neutrality. This positioning often precedes sharp directional moves as buyers and sellers compete for control near the pattern’s apex. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview From a technical perspective, Ethereum is forming a series of higher lows, reflecting cautious accumulation despite macro uncertainty. If ETH successfully breaks above $4,030, traders could see a swift move toward the $4,250 and $4,485 resistance zones, both aligning with the upper boundary of the triangle and prior swing highs. A close above these levels would likely confirm a bullish breakout, potentially extending the rally toward $4,750. However, a breakdown below $3,680 could shift sentiment, exposing $3,500 and $3,350 as key downside targets. Watch for confirmation through candlestick behavior such as a bullish engulfing for upside validation or a bearish breakout candle for downside continuation.

This initiative forms part of the European Commission’s comprehensive strategy to create a competitive market, which is expected to surpass that of the US and other rivals. The newly proposed regulation would extend ESMAs’ direct supervision capabilities over the most critical of European Union-wide and cross-border firms in the market. As it now stands, every EU member state has a separate regulator responsible for monitoring these stock exchanges, as well as other markets. The proposal, according to the Commission, will deliver regulatory expertise while enabling a suitable cross-border exchange trading environment for new European businesses and investors. The initiative is also crucial for the EU’s objective of completing its Capital Markets Union. The Commission will present the market integration package in December. This would be the draft law to genuinely expand ESMAs’ ruling authority. The ESMAs plan would also provide for national agency disputes to be resolved. If they involve large cross-border operations between asset agency sectors or globally active financial sectors, disputes may arise between their national bodies. National divides emerge over centralized oversight Numerous endorsements for the initiative have been heard from the leading capitals , but support still varies across member states. For example, France, a long-time supporter of the single market’s regulator, firmly endorses the idea , claiming that it will prevent the phenomenon of regulatory arbitrage, where companies incorporate in a state with lenient regulation to serve the rest of the EU. Germany had historically been reluctant to cede financial control to Brussels, but the current government, led by Friedrich Merz, has changed its stance. The vast majority of EU countries perceive it as an understanding that Europe must restructure its market and adapt to keep up with the times. However, some countries, such as Luxembourg, Ireland, and Malta, are not so enthusiastic. They argue that ESMA supervision would weaken their financial sectors and deprive them of the expertise of their local watchdogs. Representatives of these countries argue the best solution is to balance centralization with convergence and coordination between EU- and EEA-level regulators. Some industry groups are also concerned. Fund associations and major exchange operators emphasize that working with the national watchdog ensures maximum personalization. They argue that doing business with one-size-fits-all ESMA could result in higher compliance costs and more bureaucratic hurdles. For cryptocurrencies in particular, ESMA has not yet prepared a specifically adapted regulation for the sector. EU reform reshapes stock and crypto markets The reform also intends to simplify cross-border operations for Europe’s stock exchanges. Large trading venues would no longer need to interact with dozens of national regulators; they would instead be accountable to ESMA. Furthermore, the situation may help to harmonize standards while lowering administrative expenses. For crypto-asset service providers, the change is even more pronounced. Currently, crypto firms are regulated under the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, which grants national-level licensing but allows firms to operate Europe-wide using a mechanism known as “passporting”. Instead, the biggest and most systemically relevant crypto firms would be subject to immediate ESMA oversight. This may be a positive development, as it would put pressure on more enforcement and guarantee uniformity throughout the bloc. It is projected that enforcing a more homogeneous strategy may make things harder for so-called regulatory shopping and help close previous oversight gaps, ensuring that fewer harmful firms manage to slip through the cracks. For investors, the model offers enhanced levels of protection and transparency. A powerful regulator would have more resources to address potential cross-border concerns, guaranteeing no regulatory loopholes, and enforcing stricter surveillance of market manipulation. The model has a local touch, according to the Commission. Local authorities will still be responsible for overseeing small firms and conducting daily supervision. ESMA will have oversight over organizations that operate across multiple nations or are critical to the economy.

Specifically, the trader currently holds 39,000 ETH worth $151 million at an average entry of $3,845.33, 1,070 BTC valued at $118 million at $110,114.10, and 569,050 SOL worth $105 million at $198.23, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved from Lookonchain by Finbold on November 2. Crypto trader’s long position. Source: Lookonchain He has also placed limit orders to add 40,000 SOL about $7.36 million to his long position at $184, showing confidence in Solana’s potential rebound despite recent volatility. This move follows his previous set of trades on October 30, when he also went long on the same three assets, holding 1,039 BTC worth $114 million, 560,840 SOL valued at $109 million, and 13,419 ETH worth $52.66 million. Interestingly, over an 18-day period, the trader completed 14 trades with a 100% win rate, realizing more than $16 million in profit. With the trader going long again, it appears he’s betting on a market rebound, signaling strong confidence in a potential rally. Bitcoin fails to make major moves Notably, the market, led by Bitcoin, briefly rebounded after suffering steep losses earlier in the week, stabilizing around the $110,000 level as both bulls and bears showed little conviction to push prices decisively either way. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $110,734, up about 0.5% in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum was at $3,872, down less than 0.1% over the same period. Notably, the bearish sentiment follows Bitcoin’s first monthly loss since 2018, ending a seven-year streak that once made October a “lucky” month for crypto traders. The broader market also mirrored declines in gold and equities, retreating from record highs amid rising investor uncertainty. The sell-off intensified after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and hinted at export restrictions on key software, triggering the largest crypto liquidation on record. Despite easing trade tensions, the market has shown little sign of recovery. Prices remain partly weighed down as institutional investors stay cautious, with exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) witnessing notable outflows in the past week. A resumption of inflows could, however, trigger renewed bullish sentiment.

Anutin was present at the 32nd APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting (Session II), which was held in Gyeongju, South Korea, under the theme “Preparing a Future-Ready Asia–Pacific.” The event started with an opening remark delivered by the President of the Republic of South Korea, Lee Jae Myung, before leaders from other countries in the APEC region were invited to deliver their statements. Thailand’s PM urges regional support to strengthen digital security In his statement, the Thai PM noted that over the last 36 years, APEC has been the main driver of the Asia-Pacific region, pushing the region to become the engine of global economic growth. However, he concedes that the world is undergoing rapid changes driven by advances in technology, demographic shifts, and climate change, noting that these challenges have been testing the resilience and adaptability of the region. He mentioned that APEC needs to continue its good work of emphasizing stability, innovation, and adaptability. In this regard, Thailand proposed three key approaches to achieve this. The first is to promote regional cooperation and inclusive growth, while the second is to be a leader in the artificial intelligence space. Lastly, he noted that they also need to focus on digital transformation, noting that Thailand believes that it would be meaningless if any nation in the region is left behind. According to Charnvirakul, a deeper regional economic integration would ensure that the benefits of growth are shared across all sectors, particularly among the most vulnerable groups in society. He also strongly noted the need for APEC to take a lead in developing AI and advancing digital transformation. He highlighted that it should be developed on the principles of trust, responsibility, equitable access, and safety. Thailand has developed AI ethics guidelines, ensuring that emerging technologies are designed and used safely and fairly. Charnvikarul highlights the rising rate of cybercrime Charnvikarul also talked about addressing the issue of cybercrime . “At the same time, Thailand stresses the urgency of addressing cybercrime, particularly online scams and human trafficking — cross-border threats that require concerted regional action,” Mr Anutin said. He noted that this includes aspects like information sharing, harmonized law enforcement, and raising public awareness against the different types of incidents and how people can avoid falling victim. He thanked South Korea and the United States for their leadership in this area, noting that Thailand is prepared to collaborate with the pair through the Anti-Online Scam Operation Center (AOC) and the APEC Online Scams Exchange Forum. The PM also mentioned that Thailand has advanced policies to ensure the well-being of people of all ages, including expanding universal healthcare coverage, implementing smart family planning, and promoting employment opportunities. “In an increasingly borderless and uncertain world, no economy can stand alone. If Apec can move forward in unity, it will continue to be a vital engine of global progress,” the PM said. “The road ahead may not be easy, but Apec will walk it together — with strong cooperation and shared purpose — to build a region that is connected, sustainable, and truly future-ready.” Industry Minister Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana also hailed the government led by the PM, noting that he has only been in office for about a month, but it is clear that Thailand is gradually returning to the attention of the global population. He mentioned that the PM recently took part in the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting with the APEC Business Advisory Council, where he showcased Thailand’s potential to the international community.

Its trading volume has surpassed $2.16 billion. Despite this rebound, XRP is trapped below a solid resistance level of around $2.60. That’s a level where technical indicators signal a decisive move could unfold soon. With a market cap of $153 billion, XRP maintains its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, but traders are watching key levels closely as momentum narrows within a tightening structure. XRP/USD Technical Picture: Descending Triangle Pressure XRP’s daily chart displays a descending triangle pattern , a setup often associated with bearish continuation when support gives way. The upper trendline connecting lower highs from $3.15 continues to limit upward momentum, while support around $2.54 acts as the final buffer for bulls. XRP Price Alert: XRP is testing the $2.60 resistance — the final hurdle before a potential breakout toward $3.00. A close above $2.72 could trigger a rally, while a drop below $2.54 risks a move toward $2.02. The battle between bulls and bears is heating up #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/2vLqM9TFYS — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) November 2, 2025 Despite the recent price uptick, XRP trades below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggesting sellers still dominate near-term sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) consolidates near 48, signaling neutral momentum but revealing a bearish divergence. Price has stabilized, while RSI has failed to make new highs. Such divergence often warns of weakening buying power and the potential for trend exhaustion. Recent candle patterns, mainly Doji and spinning tops, reflect indecision. Traders will be watching for a bullish engulfing candle to confirm renewed strength or a bearish breakout to affirm continuation toward lower targets. XRP Key Levels and Potential Scenarios XRP price prediction remians bearish, howeverm if XRP breaks above $2.60–$2.72, momentum could accelerate toward $3.00, where the next resistance cluster sits. A sustained close above this range may validate a short-term bullish reversal, targeting $3.15, the peak of the previous consolidation phase. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, a failure to hold above $2.54 may expose the next downside targets near $2.26 and $2.02, both aligned with the lower boundary of the descending triangle. Bullish Scenario: Breakout above $2.60 opens path to $3.00–$3.15. Bearish Scenario: Breakdown below $2.54 risks fall to $2.26–$2.02. XRP Trade Setup and Outlook For active traders, a short position below $2.54 targeting $2.02 offers a favorable risk-to-reward profile, with a stop-loss near $2.73. On the other hand, a breakout above $2.72 could justify long positions aiming for $3.00. Until one direction prevails, XRP’s movement remains finely balanced between consolidation and a breakout, making $2.60 the crucial pivot to watch for the next major move.

White Whale, the anonymous account that helped expose MEXC’s frozen funds crisis, is now stepping in to help reform the exchange, not as a paid contractor, but as an unpaid advisor. The development came after MEXC executive Cecilia Hsueh publicly apologized to White Whale over the mishandling of his account, which triggered a widespread thread from X user Mystral accusing MEXC of allegedly freezing millions in user funds and engaging in sexual relations with one another. Behind the scenes, Cecilia and the White Whale had held a one-hour video call, and what came next was even more unexpected: White Whale offered to support the exchange’s turnaround efforts, despite having helped lead the campaign that damaged its credibility. “My offer… was sincere,” White Whale shared on X. “If you truly want to fix what was broken—I’ll support you.” He offered to join MEXC’s effort with no compensation, citing his experience building and managing platforms. “A better MEXC only improves crypto as a whole,” he added. Cecilia accepted the offer publicly: “We’d be more than happy to have you onboard as an advisor,” she replied. “We’re genuinely grateful for the push you gave us, it became the catalyst for MEXC’s transformation.” She also acknowledged their “rounds of back and forth,” but said both sides now share the same goal. Execs respond to sex rumor fallout, launch fund recovery channel As for the viral thread’s alleged orgy videos involving MEXC executives, Cecilia responded directly, saying: “People enjoy tearing women down by inventing sexual rumors. It’s pathetic.” White Whale publicly backed her, saying: “She is not the woman in the video.” He criticized users who sent him the leaked clip, stating, “Right is right and wrong is wrong… truth still matters.” The defense earned Cecilia’s praise: “Thanks for speaking up and having the integrity to say the truth.” Meanwhile, MEXC has also launched new recovery channels for frozen funds, admitting the “most frustration” came from MEXC’s internal risk control system. “If your account has been frozen, we’ve opened two fast-track channels and streamlined the unfreezing process,” she wrote, linking support head Derrick Yeo’s Twitter and Telegram. The announcement racked up over 433,000 views, followed by another update 17 hours later: “Users who provided the required info have been unfrozen in batches,” she said. She asked for patience, clarifying that Telegram support was overloaded, and Twitter DMs were the preferred channel going forward. Max Lee case triggers friction with MEXC leadership One major flashpoint has been the situation of Maxuel (Max) Lee, a trader who posted screenshots showing over $3.3 million USDT locked in his account for 20 days, with five failed withdrawal attempts between October 11–13. Cecilia pushed back against the claims, saying Max never responded to earlier requests for UID verification. “We found no such account with this amount frozen,” she wrote. “Our CS team and I have both asked him to provide UID, but there has been no reply until now. If we were wrong and you really have this issue, my dm is open.” She also added, “Spreading rumors won’t help.” Max’s post had originally said, “At first, I genuinely believed it was a bug or system error. But now, I’ve been told my account had ‘abnormal profit.’ No proof. Just frozen forever.” Earlier, Cecilia claimed that:- “In the past 17 hours, users who provided the required info have been unfrozen in batches.

According to his analysis , the fund has surpassed $100 million in assets under management within just one month of launch—a performance that exceeds the early growth rate of several initial Bitcoin ETFs. This rapid accumulation, he emphasized, is not being driven by retail participants but by institutional investors quietly positioning themselves for the next phase of market expansion. The analyst explained that while public debate often centers around short-term market direction or chart patterns, institutional players are steadily accumulating regulated assets through approved financial vehicles. The approval and rapid success of the Rex Osprey ETF, he noted, represent an important shift in the structure of XRP investment exposure. It signals the beginning of institutional adoption on a scale previously unseen for the digital asset, supported by the legal clarity and custodial frameworks that traditional financial entities require. #XRP THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING pic.twitter.com/seT92k2mZy — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 31, 2025 Institutional Entry and Regulatory Readiness Ripple Bull Winkle underlined that the presence of established ETF providers like Rex and Osprey signals the growing alignment between digital assets and regulated financial markets. He indicated that approximately two dozen additional XRP ETFs are awaiting approval , pending broader government decisions on reopening pathways for new filings. Once these approvals are granted, he believes the market will experience a chain reaction similar to what occurred following the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, when capital inflows accelerated dramatically. The analyst described this development as part of a larger shift toward “regulated rails” — the infrastructure that enables major funds, banks, and institutions to allocate capital into compliant digital asset products. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He noted that XRP fits these institutional preferences through established liquidity, proven transaction efficiency, and confirmed asset status in regulatory contexts. For these reasons, he argued, it is now being positioned as a cornerstone of upcoming institutional portfolios. Market Reaction and Broader Implications Reactions from the crypto community have largely aligned with this perspective. One X user, X Finance Bull, stated that “Rex + Osprey just made XRP institutional-grade overnight,” underscoring the significance of this milestone for professional investors. The overall sentiment reflects growing acknowledgment that institutional infrastructure around XRP is maturing rapidly. If these trends continue, XRP could see a broader wave of institutional integration, driven by ETF adoption and clearer regulatory conditions. For now, the $100 million benchmark reached by the Rex Osprey ETF stands as a measurable indicator of shifting market dynamics that suggests institutional participation in the XRP ecosystem.

The outlook is based on a comparison of Bitcoin’s current monthly price structure to previous bull market cycles, particularly the parabolic rallies of 2016–2017 and 2020–2021. In an X post on November 1, Martinez noted that each of those cycles followed a period of consolidation, then a strong breakout that coincided with a bullish crossover on the MACD indicator, a popular momentum gauge. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Currently, Bitcoin appears to be trading in a similar pattern, with the MACD histogram turning positive, a signal that has historically preceded explosive growth phases. In the 2016 cycle, Bitcoin surged over 4,000%, while the 2020 rally delivered gains of nearly 1,500%. If this pattern repeats, Martinez implies Bitcoin could mirror those exponential moves, potentially reaching $250,000 by December. Notably, with Bitcoin opening November in a consolidation phase around $110,000, such a move would require extraordinary momentum and macro conditions similar to previous peaks, including sustained institutional inflows and renewed retail enthusiasm. Has BTC price peaked? Indeed, Bitcoin’s recent stall has led to speculation that the asset may have already reached the peak of the current cycle. However, insights from crypto trader Ted Pillows challenge that notion. In an X post on November 1, Pillows stated that in past cycles, Bitcoin typically set new all-time highs after its halving event, followed by a rapid, euphoric surge and a sharp correction of 60% to 70%. This time, however, the narrative is shifting. Bitcoin recorded a new all-time high before the 2024 halving, a first in its price history, and the uptrend since then has been steadier than in previous explosive cycles. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows The cryptocurrency has also spent nearly six months consolidating above the $100,000 level, a behavior Pillows said is atypical of a blow-off top, where prices usually spike and collapse quickly. The prolonged consolidation, he argued, suggests a stronger structural base and ongoing institutional accumulation. While analysts acknowledge the potential for a pullback, Pillows contends that the traditional post-peak pattern may not apply. He noted that the current setup points to a different market environment than in prior cycles. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $111,076, up nearly 1% in the past 24 hours but down about 2% on the weekly timeframe. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At current levels, Bitcoin remains comfortably above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $114,247, signaling short-term bullish momentum as the asset holds a premium over this key support level. However, it sits below the 200-day SMA of $105,861, reflecting a longer-term bearish tilt and potential vulnerability to deeper pullbacks if momentum fades. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 46.37, indicating neither overbought exhaustion nor oversold conditions, suggesting sideways consolidation is likely in the near term unless a decisive catalyst emerges.

According to trade disclosures filed Friday, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) purchased 72,537 Bullish shares, ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) acquired 21,354 shares, and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) bought an additional 11,122 shares. The combined purchases amount to over $5 million in new exposure to Bullish, further strengthening ARK’s position in the exchange. This move follows an earlier $8.27 million investment made in mid-October across ARK’s funds. Since Bullish’s $1.1 billion listing, ARK has accumulated roughly $172 million worth of shares across multiple ETFs, underscoring its growing confidence in the platform’s long-term potential. Bullish Shares Rebound After Market Volatility Bullish stock closed at $50.57 on Friday, marking a 1.24% increase and a recovery from recent market turbulence. The exchange, founded by Block.one and led by CEO Tom Farley, has quickly become one of the most watched digital asset platforms following its NYSE debut. Farley, the former president of the New York Stock Exchange, has been steering Bullish’s expansion strategy to position it as a leader in regulated crypto trading. Celebrating the U.S. Expansion The timing of ARK’s latest purchase coincides with Bullish’s U.S. launch celebration in New York, where the firm hosted an event featuring leading figures in the digital asset industry. “The energy in the room said it all — the future is Bullish,” the company posted on X following the event. Earlier in October, Bullish officially began operations in 20 U.S. states after securing both a BitLicense and a money transmission license from New York regulators. Its first U.S. clients include BitGo and Nonco, which began spot trading on the platform as part of Bullish’s initial market rollout. Global Growth and Trading Volume Since its international launch in 2021, Bullish has processed more than $1.5 trillion in trading volume and now ranks among the top 10 exchanges globally for Bitcoin and Ether transactions. The exchange’s rapid growth and its regulatory approval in the U.S. suggest that it could become a major player in bridging traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-02 12:36:02

The first-ever staking-enabled spot Solana ETFs from Bitwise ($BSOL) and Grayscale ($GSOL) launched within a day of each other last week and have taken the market by absolute storm. Put together, they’ve recorded nearly $200M in inflows since launch , and that doesn’t even include their seed capital. That said, it’s worth mentioning that $BSOL, which launched on October 28, a day prior to Grayscale’s $GSOL, currently dominates this two-player party with over $197M in net inflows. $BSOL, by the way, pulled in a staggering $69.5M in inflows on its very first day , making it the biggest crypto ETF launch since Ethereum. What a week for $BSOL, besides the big volume, it led all crypto ETPs by a country mile in weekly flows with +$417m. It also ranked it 16th in overall flows for the week. Big time debut – Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas According to Eric Balchunas, the fact that $GSOL launched a day after $BSOL caused it to lose some steam, as investors poured into the first available opportunity. Even so, $GSOL’s $2.2M in cumulative net inflows is impressive, especially considering it carries a higher 0.35% fee, compared to 0.2% for $BSOL. Such strong investor interest in a product that makes crypto more accessible to the public is a clear sign that there is undoubtedly huge demand for these tokens. This also means that despite the last few weeks of sideways action across the crypto landscape – whether that’s Solana, Bitcoin, or Ethereum – it’s only a bump in the road. In all likelihood, it’s a healthy consolidation phase where crypto is resting and gathering steam before its next major rally. Now, if you want to get positioned before the larger bullish trend resumes, consider investing in low-cap, under-the-radar altcoins that could 10x, 100x, or even 1000x your investment. Here are our top three suggestions for the best altcoins to buy now . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bringing Real-World Utility to Bitcoin with Solana-Like Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) allows you to ride Bitcoin’s foray into real-world utility and potentially make life-changing returns in the process. That’s because $HYPER is building a new Layer-2 solution that will bring Solana-like speeds, low fees, and Web3 support to Bitcoin. It will do so by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which will empower $HYPER to execute thousands of transactions simultaneously, as long as they’re unrelated. On top of that, developers on Bitcoin will also be able to use $HYPER to build smart contracts and decentralized applications, finally opening the door to Web3 and DeFi on Bitcoin. So, if you buy Bitcoin Hyper , you’ll be able to access high-speed DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance, lending, staking, swapping, and gaming dApps on Bitcoin – without having to leave Bitcoin’s secure environment. It’s worth noting that a non-custodial canonical bridge will power seamless interaction between Bitcoin’s Layer-1 and Hyper’s Layer-2 networks. It’ll lock your original Bitcoin and mint an equivalent amount of Layer-2 compatible tokens, allowing you to seamlessly access the SVM-powered Web3. The best part? Bitcoin Hyper is currently in presale, which means you can grab it for a super low price of $0.013205. And according to our $HYPER price prediction , those who get in now could make a staggering 1,400% ROI by the end of 2026. Join the Bitcoin Web3 revolution – buy $HYPER today for just $0.013205. 2. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) – Unique Mine-to-Earn Cryptocurrency Project PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is offering a never-before-seen way to engage in crypto mining. Its gamified mining ecosystem, albeit virtual, offers real rewards. All you have to do is buy $PEPENODE tokens , furnish the empty virtual server room you get with meme nodes, and create the perfect mining setup to rank as high as possible on PepeNode’s mining leaderboard. When PepeNode’s TGE (token generation event) completes and its virtual mining simulator goes live, rewards in the form of free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FARTCOIN tokens will be distributed to the top players on the leaderboard. The best part about PepeNode is that, unlike traditional crypto mining, it’s extremely affordable and doesn’t require any technical know-how to get started. The only caveat is that you’ll need to experiment with different combinations of meme nodes, since each one carries unique characteristics, mining capabilities, and compatibility factors. Currently in presale, PepeNode has already raised over $2M from early investors, with each token priced at just $0.0011272. Based on our $PEPENODE price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $642 by the end of 2026, and potentially $2,300 by the end of 2030. Buy $PEPENODE today – and be part of the biggest next-gen mining platform. 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Donald Trump’s Personal Meme Coin Preparing for a Leg Up OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) absolutely skyrocketed immediately after listing, coming from nowhere to become the 5th biggest meme coin in the world. However, since then, Donald Trump’s declining popularity among market participants, largely due to his tariff wars, has led to a steady decline in $TRUMP’s price. Now though, in light of the U.S.’s latest trade deal with China and Donald Trump’s pro-crypto moves, most notably his pardoning of the hyper-popular Binance founder CZ, a strong revival has taken place in his own meme coin, which is now up over 40% in the last 10 days. Most importantly, $TRUMP has now broken out of a long-drawn downward-sloping resistance line and looks primed for a strong rally – one that could take it to around $24, representing a massive 220% gain from current levels. Fancy some PolitFi meme coin action? Buy $TRUMP on Binance today. Recap : With spot Solana ETFs posting record-breaking inflow numbers, the stage is set for low-cap coins to ride the trend. Top choices include Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , and OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP). Disclaimer : Invest in crypto only after doing your own research. The market is highly volatile and unpredictable. None of the above information is financial advice.

Analysis Company Warned Not to Fall Below This Level,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-expected-for-the-ethereum-eth-price-analysis-company-warned-not-to-fall-below-this-level/,"In its latest technical assessment for Ethereum (ETH), cryptocurrency analysis company MakroVision stated that the price is still moving within the falling trend channel and the consolidation process continues in the short term. According to the report, ETH is currently trading just above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement zone at around $3,596. The company argued that maintaining this level is critical for near-term stability. MakroVision stated that a stable outlook can be maintained as long as the $3,596 support level remains above. However, a break above this level could bring the next significant support level at $3,174 (0.5 Fibonacci level) into focus. It is anticipated that buyer interest in this area could increase again. Related News: Reason Behind Today's Notable Altcoin Surge Is Now Clear: Developers Will Only Get Paid If the Price Increases Fivefold According to the analysis, Ethereum could regain strong bullish momentum if $4,290 and the upper boundary of the falling channel are broken. This scenario is considered a key signal for a trend reversal in the medium-term. MakroVision noted that Ethereum is currently in consolidation mode, with the near-term support at $3,730 looking strong. However, they warned that a dip below this level could deepen the correction. ETH price is trading at $3,882 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What is Expected for the Ethereum (ETH) Price?

According to the agency, misuse of crypto and blockchain is growing more complex and organized, and that trend is stretching police resources across Europe. Europol Findings And Figures Based on reports and the agency’s own assessments, the warning followed the ninth Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Crypto Assets held on October 28–29. EU-SOCTA 2025, Europol’s broader assessment of organized crime, flagged the same issues. Analytics firms are backing up the concern: Chainalysis and TRM Labs have estimated illicit crypto flows in 2024 measured in the tens of billions of dollars. That figure helps explain why investigators say the problem cannot be ignored. Lawmakers and investigators cited concrete numbers during the event. A Spanish-led operation that police say laundered €460 million, roughly $540 million, was highlighted as an example of the scale and sophistication officials are facing. Other cases show criminals mixing on-chain methods with off-chain financial routes to hide money across borders. Law Enforcement Response Police in several countries have moved from small, local efforts to joint, cross-border investigations. Europol supported the recent €460 million probe by helping coordinate evidence and sharing forensic tools. Still, many national units report gaps in equipment and training that slow down tracing and seizure efforts. Training is needed, and standardized tools could help investigators follow funds faster across multiple blockchains and fiat systems. Ransomware groups, scams, and fraud rings now often use crypto as part of a larger toolkit. Reports show criminals combining hacked accounts, mixers, and private payment rails with traditional banking and shell companies. There’s also a rise in violent robbery tactics aimed at crypto holders, sometimes called wrench attacks, which has pushed the threat from purely financial to physical safety concerns as well. Industry Data And Trends Based on reports from industry analysts, detection and tracking tools have improved, but criminals adapt quickly. New laundering techniques and the use of AI to automate parts of schemes were both flagged in the EU-SOCTA briefing. That means even well-equipped teams must update methods often. Chainalysis and TRM Labs offer ongoing data that reporters and investigators watch closely for shifts in flow volumes and method changes. Europol has urged stronger international cooperation, saying that chasing crypto across borders needs shared standards and faster information exchange. There were calls at the conference for more public-private work between law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms. Some officials also asked for wider legal clarity so banks and exchanges can act faster when suspicious flows appear.

According to trader and market analyst Trader Tardigrade, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Dogecoin has settled at levels similar to those seen before price rallies in the past two years or so. This technical observation is based on Dogecoin’s steady uptrend along a long-standing support line since 2023 and points to its price action currently being in a possible early stage of accumulation before another leg upward. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashback: Mirror Move Hints At Record-Breaking Surge Dogecoin RSI Now Showing Pre-Breakout Signals The RSI is an indicator that has consistently aligned with Dogecoin’s strongest rallies in this cycle. According to the current 2-week candlestick setup shared by Trader Tardigrade, the RSI is currently trading stable within the same low range that has preceded Dogecoin’s previous upward rises since 2023. Each of the three major RSI dips, as shown on the price chart below, has coincided with price retests of the red ascending trendline. This event is notable because the first two dips were followed by significant upward movements in the Dogecoin price. Right now, the present RSI position is at its third dip, and it can be inferred that the meme coin may once again be approaching a launch point similar to those that led to past price surges. The long-term support trendline drawn from mid-2023 has acted as a reliable price base for Dogecoin’s recovery cycles. Price action has tested this line multiple times without breaking below it, and this has led to the creation of higher highs and higher lows. Dogecoin 2W Candlestick Price Chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade On X Although Dogecoin broke below the trendline in the middle of October, this breakdown was very brief with a long wick. Based on Dogecoin’s price action in October, the most recent interaction with this trendline is just above $0.17. This latest interaction has been highlighted with stability above this price level, and this is another early sign of technical strength. What To Expect If The Pattern Holds If this recurring structure between RSI and price maintains its consistency, Dogecoin could be about to embark on its third notable bullish run since early 2024. The most possible scenario is another rally that plays out over multiple weeks, as seen in the past two rallies. The last rally saw the Dogecoin price just around $0.5 in December 2024. Therefore, another rally from this point will see the creation of another higher high above $0.5 at least. The projection within the analyst’s chart, which is based on how the last rally plays out, points to a target around $0.8. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1877, up by 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Reaching $0.8 will translate to new all-time highs and a 228% increase from the current price level.

The country is presently facing a widespread illegal crypto mining crisis, with authorities noting that over 95% of the active 427,000 mining devices in the country are being operated without standard licenses and authorization. This development comes amid a report that places Iran in the fourth position when it comes to the largest crypto mining hubs worldwide. The report claims that the position was fueled by the heavily subsidized electricity prices, which have made the country a paradise for illegal crypto miners. These unlicensed operations have consumed more than 1,400 megawatts of power around the clock, putting great strain on the national grid and threatening the stability of the electricity supply in the country. Iran shuts down illegal crypto mining operations According to Akbar Hasan Beklou, CEO of the Tehran Province Electricity Distribution Company, the majority of the illegal miners in Iran disguise their activities as industrial facilities because of their access to cheap electricity. Beklous added that since the launch of the government’s effort against unauthorized crypto mining, about 104 illegal mining farms have been discovered in Tehran Province, with authorities seizing more than 1,465 mining devices. He mentioned that total energy consumption as a result of the criminals’ activities is around 3,359 kilowatts, which is equivalent to 10,000 household units. He mentioned that as a result of their activities, there has been reduced stability in power supplies to both residential and industrial consumers in the country. He added that over 95% of these devices are operated using unauthorized electricity, increasing the menace of power theft, wasting subsidized energy, and reducing the available electricity for legitimate users. In addition, he claimed that the government has also identified several hotspots where these activities are rampant. They include Pakdasht, Firuzkuh, Shahre Qods, Malard, Kahrizak, and industrial zones in the southwestern area of Tehran. He highlighted that during the crackdown in the first half of this year, about 80 unauthorized farms containing more than 1,300 mining devices were uncovered, with the farms consuming a cumulative power that can be used by 8,000 households. Beklou promises to intensify efforts Beklou said illegal crypto miners often go to great lengths and use sophisticated methods to conceal their electricity theft and illegal operations. For example, they dig underground tunnels, bury mining devices, and tap into subsidized industrial power lines, which makes detection difficult. Nevertheless, Beklou added that specialized inspection teams from the power company, working alongside security and law enforcement agencies, will continue to monitor these activities, with an aim to dismantle all illegal operations. Iran has been moving swiftly in its quest to combat this menace. In August, the country announced cash rewards to citizens who report illegal cryptocurrency mining operations. Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, CEO of state-run utility Tavanir, announced a reward of up to $24 (approximately 1 million toman) for every informant with credible information that leads to the seizure of an unauthorized mining device. Mashhadi blamed the activities of the illegal miners for the issues with the country’s power grid. According to a June report by CoinLaw, Iran ranks fifth globally in Bitcoin hashrate distribution. The country contributes 4.2% of the total network’s computing power. The United States leads the group with a dominant 44%, with Kazakhstan picking up the second spot with 12%, while Russia at 10.5% and Canada at 9% take up the rest of the spots.

Although the regulator is yet to greenlight such a product and the government shutdown endures, the XRP Army is hopeful that Canary Capital, through its latest update, could bypass the waiting line and launch its own spot ETF in two weeks. This is because the company removed the “delaying amendment” from its filing, which could result in a product launch on November 13, an approach taken by several ETF issuers lately. How High, XRP? Given the high probability of a spot XRP ETF reaching the markets in November or December at least, we decided to touch upon ChatGPT and see what it believes would be the impact on the underlying token in terms of price actions. It began with a brief history lesson on crypto ETFs, especially for BTC’s January 2024 launch and the subsequent ETH products in July of the same year. The AI solution noted that it would expect similar first weeks for XRP, which included a “pop” shortly after the launch, and a choppy “sell-the-news” window. However, it believes that these products will inevitably kick-start a “flows-driven” rally once they pick up the pace. It’s most optimistic prediction sees the asset surging to well beyond $7.50 and up to $10 within a year after the ETF launch, if the crypto market is in a “broad crypto risk-on regime and XRP wins significant institutional allocation (multi-billion-dollar AUM).” Within the next six months, ChatGPT noted that Ripple’s cross-border token can peak at around $5.50 if altseason and strong ETF flows align. Its short-term prediction is more cautious, indicating that the cryptocurrency will probably range somewhere between $2.70 and $3.40 once the approval hype fades. Bearish Scenario Although it believes the spot XRP ETF approvals would be a bullish development for the asset, it still outlined a few bearish scenarios in case the market mechanics flip and the overall global economy tumbles. As such, ChatGPT noted that if “macro tightens, flows fizzle, or regulatory headlines turn negative,” XRP’s price could slump to $1.50-$2.00 within the next six months. Moreover, it warned that Ripple’s token can plunge further to $1.20 in the year ahead if recession fears become reality and investors flock to risk-off assets. Despite the positive moves in the past few weeks, ChatGPT still highlighted potential risks ahead or even after the launch of these financial vehicles.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.5784 Market cap $616.45M Trading volume (24-hour) $12.31M Circulating supply 1.063B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $9.12 24-hour low $0.3505 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.45% (High) 50-day SMA $0.6596 14-Day RSI 39.18 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 37 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.7064 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos trades around $0.579, showing mild recovery after a drop. If the coin holds above $0.56, it could rebound to $0.62. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart As of November 2, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $0.5796, up 0.26% on the day, showing a mild recovery after recent declines. The price sits between the middle Bollinger Band at $0.593 and lower support near $0.564, indicating consolidation within a narrowing range. The upper band at $0.6218 acts as the key resistance level that bulls need to reclaim for momentum to strengthen. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD is showing a neutral tone, suggesting that bearish momentum is fading but not yet reversed. The RSI stands at 40.86, still slightly below the neutral 50 mark, pointing to subdued buying pressure and potential for a rebound if sentiment improves. If XTZ holds above $0.56, a short-term recovery toward $0.60–$0.62 remains possible. However, failure to maintain this support could cause the price to drop to $0.54. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Tezos is trading at around $0.5791, exhibiting minor intraday weakness. The Alligator indicator lines are slightly converging, showing that price movement has lost direction and may enter a phase of sideways accumulation. Resistance levels are clustered at $0.5814 and $0.584, while short-term support sits near $0.578–$0.576. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI reading of 47.27 reflects a balance between buyers and sellers, with neither side in firm control. A break above $0.582 could trigger a push toward $0.59, while rejection at current levels might lead to renewed weakness toward $0.57.

Tezos is consolidating near support, showing reduced volatility and fading selling pressure. If the price sustains above $0.56, gradual accumulation could lead to a short-term breakout toward $0.60 or higher, but a drop below that level would likely extend the correction phase. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos (XTZ) October 2025 roundup! 🎃 The Tezos October Roundup is here!

In a recent post, he wrote that “$XRP is not heading to $10k-$50k per coin” and asked traders to “please stop with this nonsense.” His statement came in response to an argument suggesting that XRP’s value could soar to such levels if it achieved full-scale institutional adoption. The discussion began when another user suggested XRP’s price could trade between $10,000 and $50,000 if it became the foundation of global payment systems , such as SWIFT, DTCC, and central bank digital currencies. The post claimed that XRP would need to reach this range to sustain global liquidity flows without network congestion. ChartNerd, who is known for his technical analysis of digital assets, rejected that assumption outright. His dismissal made it clear that he views such expectations as detached from realistic market behavior. $XRP is not heading to $10K-$50K per coin Please stop with this nonsense. https://t.co/ALQ42EXNMM — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 31, 2025 Assessing Market Realities ChartNerd’s position aligns with a segment of analysts who emphasize measured forecasting over speculative optimism. His message reflects instances where traders rely on market structure and real-world behavior rather than hypothetical scenarios that ignore supply constraints and regulatory hurdles. While ChartNerd has previously shared bullish predictions for XRP , his choice of words indicated a clear disapproval of those who believe XRP could achieve such extraordinary valuations, as they fail to consider the realities of the crypto market. Community Divisions on XRP Expectations The post quickly received a range of responses reflecting the community’s divided outlook on XRP’s long-term potential. One commenter suggested that a more modest target near $6 or $7 would be reasonable and even achievable. ChartNerd agreed , replying that such a price was “easily attainable.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A different commenter argued that the analyst was overlooking potential future utility as blockchain adoption grows. However, ChartNerd dismissed this line of reasoning as well, stating directly, “It will not.” Balancing Optimism with Analysis Although the XRP community continues to debate what the asset’s future might hold, ChartNerd’s firm rejection of exaggerated valuations signals a broader caution to investors who may conflate long-term institutional adoption with guaranteed exponential returns. Price growth requires more than optimism, and credible forecasts must align with the realities of supply, demand, and utility.

Meanwhile, the T3 Financial Crime Unit froze $300 million in illicit funds, marking a major milestone in crypto security efforts. Business An account used by Samn Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has claimed the exchange was never insolvent, echoing arguments raised during his trial. Binance.US has denied claims that its USD1 listing was a form of payback for President Trump’s pardon of Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. Mastercard is in advanced talks to acquire crypto startup Zerohash in a deal valued between $1.5 and $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the deal. Crypto giant Coinbase has acquired onchain capital raising platform Echo in a $375 million deal which will enable Coinbase community members to raise capital more easily for growth. Web3 Crypto exchange BTCC has introduced a limited-time Halloween campaign, the Spooktacular Halloween Night of Fortune , which will have significant giveaways, including one full Bitcoin, for users who participate by completing a set of trading and deposit-based tasks, including a minimum deposit of 200 USDT and a cumulative futures trading volume of at least 50 million USDT While algorithmic trading bots have long been part of the crypto landscape, AI tools, especially large language models specifically designed for analytical work like Anthropic’s Claude has emerged as a particularly valuable resource for traders who need to process vast amounts of information quickly and accurately. TZ APAC's Fortify Labs announced that it is now inviting applications for its 2026 cohort. The program , scheduled to take place in Singapore will span seven months of focused development time, offering funding of up to $1.3 million while simultaneously delivering hands-on guidance for each participating project individually. According to the latest Crypto Adoption and Stablecoin Usage Report , US crypto activity surged by 50% between January and July compared to the same period last year, while adoption has also accelerated in key markets like South Asia and North Africa. As the world’s first omnibank, Digitap has introduced a no-KYC option, giving users the power to spend globally without the frustration of checks. Altcoins In his op-ed for BeInCrypto, Outset PR’s founder Mike Ermolaev warned that projects ignoring AI visibility are already fading from digital awareness. As crypto markets prepare for what could be a major rebound heading into 2026, early Solana (SOL) investors appear to be shifting part of their portfolios into newer, lower-cost altcoins, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). FUNToken has officially launched a fully transparent, audited Ethereum smart contract designed to automatically reward $FUN holders as the token grows from a $5 Million rewards pool that directly benefits long-term supporters and early stakers. Security The T3 Financial Crime Unit, a joint initiative by Tether, TRON, and TRM Labs, has frozen $300 million in tainted digital assets within its first year, signaling a major advancement in crypto industry-led financial crime prevention.
