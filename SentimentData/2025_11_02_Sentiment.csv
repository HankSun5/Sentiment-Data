53914536,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88347,1762027525,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Solana Says Ripple and XRP Are Not On Its Level, Litecoin Responds",https://timestabloid.com/solana-says-ripple-and-xrp-are-not-on-its-level-litecoin-responds/,"A routine promotional post from Ripple has turned into one of the most talked-about exchanges in crypto this week. What started as a corporate update about institutional custody evolved into a heated debate over which blockchain deserves institutional recognition — Ripple’s XRP Ledger or Solana’s high-performance network. Ripple Prepares for Swell 2025 Ripple’s official X account announced that Swell 2025 will host top global finance leaders to discuss secure institutional custody in a tokenized world. The company confirmed speakers from Citi, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and FTI_US, all of whom will explore the growing link between blockchain and traditional finance. The post was meant to highlight Ripple’s growing influence among financial institutions and its role in tokenization. Instead, it became the spark for a public debate about status and institutional relevance in the crypto ecosystem. Jackson Knox Ignites Ripple (XRP) vs. Solana Supremacy War Crypto community figure Jackson Knox responded to Ripple’s post with strong admiration for Ripple and XRP. Correct, not on the same level: Sandy Kaul from Franklin Templeton on how to talk crypto with Solana: https://t.co/N3iqTOkWus Sandy Kaul on LinkedIn says Solana ""serve[s] as a unifying digital-era layer that can provide investors around the world with real-time, 24/7 access to… pic.twitter.com/Hps3UiK6pQ — Solana (@solana) October 31, 2025 He wrote, “If there is any!!! And I mean any doubt! That Ripple the company and XRP the asset are not on your level… Solana and Western Union.” His statement directly addressed Solana and Western Union, implying that Ripple and XRP stand far above both in institutional class and credibility. Knox’s comment may not be unconnected to recent Western Union’s choice of Solana over XRP . The post gained momentum, drawing immediate attention from Solana’s official team. Solana Counters with Institutional Backing Solana’s official handle swiftly replied, stating, “Correct, not on the same level.” The response referenced respected voices from global finance, including Franklin Templeton executives who have publicly praised Solana’s institutional readiness. Sandy Kaul, Franklin Templeton’s Head of Digital Asset Strategy, recently described Solana as “a unifying digital-era layer that provides investors 24/7 access to previously unreachable assets.” Jenny Johnson, the firm’s CEO, also called Solana “one of the first institutionally focused chains.” Solana used these endorsements to reinforce its claim of leadership in blockchain adoption among traditional finance players, presenting itself as the preferred infrastructure for institutional tokenization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Litecoin Turns Up the Humor Moments later, Litecoin’s official X account joined the discussion with a playful meme. It showed two women labeled “Solana” and “XRP” fighting, captioned “Fight, fight, fight, fight.” The humorous post quickly went viral, symbolizing the constant rivalry among crypto projects competing for relevance. Litecoin’s comment lightened the mood but also emphasized how social engagement fuels visibility and brand power across crypto networks. Fight, fight, fight, fight! pic.twitter.com/XthucNAgpo — Litecoin (@litecoin) October 31, 2025 Institutional Credibility and the Battle Ahead Beyond the memes, the exchange highlights the ongoing competition for institutional trust in blockchain finance. Ripple continues to focus on bank partnerships and tokenized settlements, positioning itself as the bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Solana, meanwhile, emphasizes speed, scalability, and validation from global asset managers. Its strategy focuses on real-time financial applications and high-performance token infrastructure. As Swell 2025 approaches , the crypto industry is watching closely. Will Ripple’s enterprise-grade strategy continue to attract banks and payment providers, or will Solana’s institutional narrative win broader acceptance among asset managers? In the modern crypto landscape, technology, partnerships, and perception now share equal weight. The latest online clash between Solana, Ripple, and Litecoin proves that influence in blockchain is no longer won only by innovation — but by the story each network tells.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3195 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility, ensuring that the total supply remains accessible to users. Pi Network is reaching one of the most crucial phases in 2025; as the market is still suspicious, the on-chain activity and the Pi ecosystem continue to develop. Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. Passkey Update enhanced the security of the Pi Wallet with Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN ahead of the Mainnet launch. New DeFi tools Pi DEX and AMM on Testnet allow users to transact Pi and explore decentralized finance in a Web3-aligned way. Meanwhile, Pi Network Ventures partnered with OpenMind AI to build a decentralized AI infrastructure, and a recent system process enabled 3.36 million Pioneers to complete identity verification pi network on Pi Network. With the Pi Hackathon 2025 and Sign Protocol partnership ongoing, the network price prediction suggests a resilient ecosystem still focused on utility and long-term growth within the declining exponential model that defines its supply and mining rewards In this article on Pi price prediction and Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2473 Price Change 24h 0.5% Market Cap $2.06B Circulating Supply 8.29B PI Trading Volume 24h 8.29B PI All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2473 Price Prediction $ 0.1860 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 33 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.61% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2672 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 56.56 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi trades at $0.2473, up by 0.09% in the past 24 hours, following a brief rally to $0.252 earlier in the day. Pi Network’s price has shown a moderate recovery after recent crypto market turbulence that drove it to a new monthly low earlier last month. Resistance lies between $0.26 and $0.28, while support zones remain at $0.24 and $0.226. As of November 1, 2025, Pi Network’s price analysis shows muted movement after recent volatility, with a current price average reflecting stability in the market. The coin is trading around $0.2473, down slightly from the previous session’s high of $0.252, as consolidation continues near the $0.24 support zone. Price action remains range-bound, with minor pullbacks indicating fading momentum but no major breakdown. Resistance levels stand at $0.26–$0.28, while support is holding near $0.24 and $0.226, suggesting Pi is stabilizing after a modest recovery phase. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart for Pi Network (PI) price shows a moderate consolidation phase after last week’s short-term recovery. Pi traded between $0.2443 and $0.2524 during the session before stabilizing around $0.2473, indicating sideways momentum as the market digests prior gains. The pattern suggests Pi is forming a neutral base near the $0.24 zone following a failed attempt to break higher. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56.00, cooling slightly from earlier highs but still above its signal line at 43.69. This positioning signals balanced market conditions with modest bullish bias, implying that selling pressure is subsiding. If RSI continues trending above 50, it could confirm early accumulation and a potential breakout continuation toward the $0.26–$0.28 resistance area. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) shows the main line at –0.0006 crossing above the signal line at –0.0090, with the histogram turning positive. This crossover indicates fading bearish momentum and the likelihood of short-term stabilization. Immediate resistance levels stand at $0.26, aligning with the 50-day moving average, while support remains near $0.24 and $0.226. A close above $0.26 could extend gains toward $0.28, while a slip below $0.24 may invite a retest of the $0.22 area. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.2472, over the past 4 hours, as the price consolidates near the $0.25 mark. The coin traded between $0.2467 and $0.2495, reflecting tight range-bound movement with reduced volatility. Bulls are attempting to defend the $0.24 support region, while sellers maintain pressure below the $0.26 resistance zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 49.71, hovering close to its signal line at 50.81. This near-neutral setup indicates a balance between buyers and sellers, with neither side dominating. RSI readings around 50 suggest consolidation after earlier volatility, signaling that momentum is stabilizing. A break above 55 could reintroduce mild bullish momentum, while a dip below 45 may expose further downside toward $0.23. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator supports this neutral stance. The MACD line –0.0014 is slightly below the signal line 0.0017, while the histogram shows fading red bars and an early hint of decreasing bearish pressure. If the MACD crosses back into positive territory, it could confirm renewed buying interest. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3019 SELL SMA 5 $0.2744 SELL SMA 10 $0.2451 BUY SMA 21 $0.2286 BUY SMA 50 $0.2672 SELL SMA 100 $0.3262 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2387 BUY EMA 5 $0.2571 SELL EMA 10 $0.2897 SELL EMA 21 $0.3235 SELL EMA 50 $0.3764 SELL EMA 100 $0.4668 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi price is expected to remain in a consolidation phase between $0.20 and $0.24 over the short term. The token is still oversold, suggesting fewer pi in circulation, limited buying momentum but potential for a rebound if demand increases. However, bearish pressure persists. Unless Pi breaks above $0.25 resistance, sideways trading with a weak bias is likely, while a drop below $0.20 could trigger further bearish momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? PI’s price dropped after traders took profits from last week’s 19% rally to $0.291, as retail-driven momentum faded and volume fell 40% to $30.7M. The token also faced rejection at the $0.26 Fibonacci resistance, with RSI divergence signaling weakening bullish momentum and a possible correction toward $0.209. Added pressure comes from a looming 120M token unlock in November, which could expand supply and heighten volatility despite long-term optimism around Pi’s AI and DeFi ecosystem. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline.

This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72.

Across the global gaming industry, more studios are seeing workers’ demand for rights to form unions, especially after years of criticism over “crunch” periods often required to meet production deadlines. Rockstar Games is now facing allegations that it does not support employee demands for organized action. Rockstar Games accused of deliberately targeting union efforts Rockstar Games , the studio behind the Grand Theft Auto series, is facing allegations of union-busting after it fired dozens of employees across its UK and Canadian offices. According to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), the game developer abruptly dismissed between 30 and 40 workers on Thursday in what the union describes as a deliberate attempt to disrupt efforts to form a union inside the company. The union referred to the company’s actions as one of the most “blatant and ruthless” acts of union busting in the gaming industry. Alex Marshall, the president of the IWGB, said the studio’s actions showed “flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions.” He also criticized Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for showing disregard toward their employees and the gaming community that supports their work. Union representatives are urging an investigation into the dismissals because they believe the timing and scale of the layoffs are suspicious and don’t seem to be for valid reasons. The IWGB is reportedly exploring legal means to get the dismissals overturned. In a statement, the IWGB said that a major company like Rockstar getting away with antagonizing union organizers sends a “chilling message to workers everywhere who want to organize for fair treatment.” Take-Two denies accusations Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., denied all of IWGB’s accusations. The company insists that the layoffs were due to “gross misconduct” by the employees and not related to any union activities, but it has so far failed to provide any details of the supposed misconduct. Alan Lewis, a spokesperson for Take-Two, said the company “fully supports Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.” Despite the backlash, Rockstar has not indicated any plans to reverse the firings. This isn’t the first time Rockstar has faced employee relations controversy. In early 2024, the company was heavily criticized for asking workers to return to the office five days a week. The IWGB criticized that decision, saying it ignored workers’ well-being and family responsibilities. Rockstar defended the return-to-office directive as a necessary step to beef up security after a major leak revealed dozens of video footage from the unfinished Grand Theft Auto VI in 2022. Rockstar is still preparing to release the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI video games on May 26, 2026.

However, the stock has risen by over 3% in the last five days. Meanwhile, this development follows the recent emergence of Ripple-backed Evernorth , which plans to build the largest treasury. XRPScan data shows that the treasury company currently holds 388.7 million XRP worth nearly $1 billion, making it the largest XRP treasury. The company had earlier announced plans to raise over $1 billion from investors such as Ripple, Kraken, Pantera Capital, and GSR. This comes ahead of the company’s debut on the Nasdaq. The treasury company plans to list on the stock exchange through a business combination agreement with Armada II. Armada notably recently changed its ticker to XRPN as part of the business agreement. More Institutions Set To Accumulate The Altcoin More institutional investors are set to accumulate the token with the imminent launch of the Canary Capital XRP ETF . The asset manager filed an amendment to its fund to remove the delaying amendment, allowing it to launch on November 13. This will be similar to how the firm launched its Hedera and Litecoin ETFs earlier this week.

This proposal, approved in July, includes a rewards plan based on price targets. According to the proposal, if the VIRTUAL token price reaches $10, $20, and $40, respectively, it will trigger a token allocation equivalent to 2% of the total supply to the Virgen Labs team. If all targets are met, the team will earn a total reward of 6% (60 million VIRTUAL tokens).

However, if all targets are met, the share of the DAO treasury will decrease from 34% to 28%. This will only apply if the VIRTUAL price reaches $40.

It was also the first time the monthly trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) exceeded $1 trillion, evidence of them gaining ground on rival centralized exchanges (CEXs). The open interest (OI) in perps was recorded to be approximately $17.9 billion. According to DeFi data analytics platform DeFiLlama , on-chain perpetuals’ monthly trading volume for September was over $738 billion. DEX perps futures nearly doubled September’s figures, hitting $1.3 trillion in October. Source: DeFiLlama Perps go from niche experiment to trillion-dollar engine Perpetual futures, crypto derivatives that let traders bet on prices without expiry, have long been the domain of big centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. But as those exchanges have tightened their risk controls and compliance rules over the past year, a growing share of liquidity has started to move on-chain. Decentralized platforms such as Hyperliquid , Lighter, EdgeX, and those built on Ethereum and Arbitrum have stepped in to fill the gap, handling more than a trillion dollars in notional trading volume last month. Sentora researcher Juan Pellicer wrote that the shift to on-chain trading is being driven by the tighter risk and reduced market-making activities on CEXs. On-chain protocols have developed new execution models that cater to niche and slower-moving traders, the “long tail” of the market, while offering transparency and composability. “On-chain derivatives are no longer a sideshow,” the Sentora report noted. “They’re now the marginal venue for leverage in crypto, shaping how risk transmits through the system.” Fed rate cuts add fuel to leverage demand The U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut , its second this year, has lowered the cost of dollar funding, indirectly boosting leverage appetite across risk assets. By reducing short-term interest rates, the Fed has made holding fully funded spot positions less attractive relative to leveraged exposure via perps. With lower base rates, the shadow value of collateral is lifted, and this also reduces “USD funding alternatives,” effectively making “perp exposure cheaper relative to holding fully-funded spot.” The October 10 market turbulence played a major role Other reports say this record volume may not be unconnected to the brief market crash that occurred on October 10. The incident, which was sparked by President Donald Trump’s announcement of more tariffs on China, saw the crypto market power through the largest liquidation event on record to date. Some major CEXs experienced some downtime and saw glitches due to the volumes and pressure of users, prompting more traders to utilize DEXs more. Hyperliquid, the leading perpetual DEX, saw the liquidation of more than 1,000 wallets on October 10. That day saw “on-chain perpetual markets hit a record single-day trading volume of $78 billion,” and it showed observers that decentralized platforms have evolved and are ready to play in the same field as their centralized counterparts.

Every rise and fall leaves a trace that often repeats in reverse. For traders who grasp this rhythm, emotions fade, and patterns become clear. This deep understanding of time and symmetry defines Egrag Crypto’s latest XRP analysis — a perspective built on structure, rhythm, and patience. Egrag Crypto’s Theory of Market Reflection In his most recent update, Egrag Crypto revisited his “As Above, So Below” thesis. The model suggests that XRP’s market structure mirrors itself across different timeframes. According to Egrag, the same sequence that shaped previous moves now appears to be unfolding again. The updated chart shows matching highs and lows across two 89-bar cycles. These cycles, he says, reveal the market’s “universal rhythm,” a balance between resistance and support that often determines price direction. His analysis suggests an 80% probability of rejection from the current resistance area, and only a 20% chance of a confirmed breakout. #XRP – As Above, So Below (UPATED CHART): Just 4 days ago (October 27), I shared a post showing an 80% chance of rejection and only a 20% chance of penetration… and guess what? Nothing has changed. It’s still the same universal rhythm , “As Above, So Below.” … https://t.co/vZ1EGPbeIw pic.twitter.com/CzF717OPbG — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 1, 2025 Current XRP Price Outlook As of report time, XRP trades in the mid-$2 range. This zone aligns closely with Egrag Crypto’s highlighted resistance band. The market recently attempted a breakout, but the price action shows hesitation near the same structural level that capped gains in earlier phases. Analysts note that holding above the key Fibonacci levels around $2.40 to $2.60 remains essential. Failure to sustain this range could open the path toward lower retracement zones near $2.20. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios The bullish path requires XRP to break and close above the current resistance area with strong volume. That move could confirm renewed momentum toward targets around $3.00 and beyond. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, the bearish outlook remains valid if XRP fails to maintain support . A breakdown below $2.30 could invite further correction, aligning with the “As Below” reflection Egrag identifies in his chart. Other technical indicators, such as declining volume and moving-average crossovers, could reinforce this downside scenario. Time, Patience, and Market Alignment Egrag emphasizes that timing governs every market movement. To him, patience is not passive waiting — it is alignment with time. Traders who understand this principle can detach from emotions and follow market structure with precision. The idea reflects his belief that success in trading depends on synchronization with market rhythm, not impulsive reaction. In conclusion, Egrag Crypto’s “As Above, So Below” framework remains one of the most thought-provoking XRP analyses today. It connects time, symmetry, and emotion into a unified approach to reading markets. Whether XRP confirms a breakout or mirrors another rejection, his message is clear — understanding time is the key to understanding price.

A strong triangle support structure and a developing inverse head and shoulders pattern are signaling a potential bullish reversal. Momentum is tightening, suggesting that a breakout could be closer than it seems. Massive Triangle Formation Holds Firm Amid Market Shakeouts Batman, a well-known crypto analyst, recently highlighted that Bitcoin has been consolidating for several weeks within a massive descending triangle formation. Despite multiple shakeouts attempting to push the price lower, the key support level has consistently held firm, signaling underlying strength in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Key Retest: Bounce Or $98,000 Next? He noted that the current setup represents a classic, textbook pattern often seen before an explosive breakout in price. Each test of support has been met with strong buying interest, showing that bulls are actively defending the lower boundary of the structure. The classic textbook formation suggests that Bitcoin’s price is coiling up energy for a potential breakout once momentum returns. Batman remains highly optimistic about Bitcoin’s next move, stating that his target remains clear at $126,000. He cautioned traders not to underestimate the setup, emphasizing that the current price action could mark the calm before a major surge. In his view, this represents a big opportunity for those watching closely, as the market prepares for what could be the next explosive leg higher. Technical Setup Hints At Shift From Consolidation To Expansion According to GandalfCrypto in a current update, Bitcoin is currently forming a potential inverse Head & Shoulders pattern, which often signals a major trend reversal in technical analysis. The structure has been developing over the past few weeks, with clear left and right shoulders forming, while the neckline sits around the $115,000–$116,000 range. This area has become a key zone to monitor, as it represents the boundary between continued consolidation and a potential bullish breakout. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Market Dynamics Are Evolving As New Developments Surface Overnight GandalfCrypto explained that if Bitcoin successfully breaks above this neckline with strong volume, it would validate the reversal pattern and likely trigger a surge toward the $130,000 target. Such a move would confirm renewed strength among buyers and could mark the beginning of a sustained bullish phase after weeks of sideways movement and uncertainty. He further noted that momentum indicators are coiling tightly, reflecting a buildup of energy beneath the surface. GandalfCrypto emphasized the importance of patience and precision, waiting for a confirmed breakout rather than preempting the move, as this will distinguish traders who capture the next leg higher from those caught in false starts.

Abagnale, the real-life inspiration for Leonardo DiCaprio’s leading role in the crime comedy-drama film, lectured attendees of the conference this week in an exclusive meeting with members of the finance and crypto industries. American con artist talks cybersecurity at Russian crypto forum In his presentation, the once convicted felon, who forged bank checks and other documents in his youth while faking identities, provided a thorough analysis of modern digital fraud schemes and vulnerabilities in common online practices, sharing his recommendations for protecting personal data. The lecture, titled “Catch the Legend,” gathered around 100 representatives of business circles, finance, and the crypto sector, including major digital asset exchanges, the Russian business news outlet RBC reported on Saturday. Abagnale was invited as the speaker in the first of the new RBC Global Talks, a format meeting guests with world experts and opinion leaders in various fields. It was organized as a side event of the international Blockchain Life 2025 forum, held in Dubai. This was the 15th anniversary edition of the conference, Russia’s most significant international crypto gathering, which aims to connect Russian-speaking and global crypto communities. Among the headlines it produced this year was Pavel Durov ’s unveiling of a new decentralized computing platform called Cocoon, meant as an alternative to centralized cloud services such as Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. According to the tech entrepreneur, founder and owner of the popular in the crypto space messenger Telegram, the AI services of today are heavily dependent on centralized providers that can access, collect, and exploit users’ personal data. Abagnale doesn’t keep cryptocurrency and has no social media accounts For his part, Frank Abagnale touched on the subject of personal cybersecurity, too. During a discussion following the lecture, he stated he does not use cryptocurrency and doesn’t have any social media accounts either, as part of his safety strategy. Abagnale spent over an hour answering questions in an informal setting. Participants in the meeting received copies of a new edition of his book, specially printed for the event. No video recording was allowed. The screenplay for Spielberg’s movie, which made his story world famous, is based on a semi-autobiography with the same title that he co-authored with writer Stan Redding. The book details his criminal exploits. During his time as a con man, Abagnale allegedly cashed $2.5 million worth of forged checks while also impersonating a doctor, a professor, an attorney, and even a Pan Am pilot, flying millions of air miles as a deadheading employee. Some of his claims have been challenged, leaving the impression he might have faked, or at least exaggerated, even his own biography. But others are likely true, to one degree or another, as he has been arrested on multiple occasions, for an array of crimes and offences in the 1960s and 70s, when he was in his teens and 20s. He also spent time in prison in the United States, Sweden, and France, of which he is a citizen, too. Eventually, Abagnale transitioned into a career of a security consultant, advising various organizations, including companies and banks. He gave numerous speeches, lectures, and interviews, making a great number of public appearances, including in Talks at Google and popular talk shows. Among the most controversial claims he introduced into his repertoire in the early 80s is that he was granted a parole from prison so that he could work for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He has continuously maintained his involvement with the FBI. Besides RBC, which is Blockchain Life’s main media partner this year, Abagnale’s appearance at the conference was sponsored by the A7A5 platform. The latter is the issuer of a ruble-pegged stablecoin with the same name, which accounts for almost half of the market cap of all non-dollar stablecoins, as reported by Cryptopolitan.

A monumental XRP transfer , totaling 300 million tokens, has moved from an undisclosed wallet directly to Ripple. This transaction, valued at approximately $751 million, sparks immediate questions and ignites discussions across the crypto community about its implications. The Unprecedented XRP Transfer – What Just Happened? On [Insert Date if available, otherwise keep general], the renowned blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert, flagged an extraordinary movement of digital assets. An astonishing 300,000,000 XRP tokens were transferred from an unknown wallet. The destination? None other than Ripple, the blockchain company behind the XRP ledger. This single XRP transfer represents a substantial amount of capital, equivalent to over three-quarters of a billion dollars. Such a large-scale transaction naturally draws scrutiny, especially when involving a major player like Ripple. It prompts us to consider the underlying reasons and potential ripple effects (pun intended) this could have on the market. Understanding the dynamics of these large whale movements is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. They often precede or indicate significant strategic decisions by the entities involved. This particular event is no exception, demanding a closer look at its potential impact. Why Does a Large XRP Transfer to Ripple Matter? When an entity like Ripple receives such a colossal XRP transfer , several possibilities emerge. These transactions are rarely random; they usually serve a strategic purpose. Here are a few reasons why this specific transfer is significant: Treasury Management: Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP in its treasury. This transfer could be part of an internal restructuring or a consolidation of funds from various controlled wallets. Liquidity Provision: The incoming XRP might be intended to bolster liquidity for Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors. ODL uses XRP to facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border payments. Strategic Sales or Partnerships: While less common for direct transfers to Ripple, a large influx could prepare for future strategic initiatives, perhaps involving new partnerships or even potential over-the-counter (OTC) sales to institutional clients. Escrow Management: Ripple periodically releases XRP from its escrow accounts. This transfer could relate to re-escrowing or managing those released funds. These large movements are often a window into the operational health and strategic direction of a major crypto enterprise. They indicate active management of assets rather than dormant holdings. Analyzing the Market Impact of This XRP Transfer Any substantial XRP transfer , especially one involving Ripple, can generate considerable market discussion. While such a transfer doesn’t automatically mean an immediate price surge or drop, it certainly influences market sentiment. Investors and traders closely watch these whale movements for clues about future market activity. Transparency in blockchain transactions, even with “unknown wallets,” allows for this level of scrutiny. However, the lack of explicit context from Ripple itself often leads to speculation. This particular event highlights the dual nature of crypto: unparalleled transparency in transactions combined with potential opacity regarding the motives behind them. It is important for market participants to differentiate between a transfer and a sale. A transfer to Ripple’s known wallets doesn’t automatically imply an imminent sale onto exchanges. Instead, it suggests internal asset management or preparation for a specific strategic use. What’s Next for Ripple and XRP Holders After This Transfer? For XRP holders and those following Ripple, monitoring official announcements and further on-chain activity becomes paramount. This significant XRP transfer could be a precursor to several developments. Ripple continues to expand its global presence and ODL network. Such a large influx of XRP could empower them to further scale these operations, potentially increasing XRP’s utility. Keeping an eye on Ripple’s partnerships and quarterly reports can offer more context. Actionable Insight: While it’s tempting to react to large transfers, a balanced approach involves observing broader market trends and Ripple’s strategic communications. Don’t base investment decisions solely on single whale alerts; instead, consider them as one piece of a larger puzzle. In conclusion, the recent 300 million XRP transfer to Ripple is a compelling event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact motives remain unconfirmed, it points towards active strategic management by Ripple, potentially impacting its operational capabilities and the broader XRP ecosystem. These significant movements remind us that the crypto landscape is constantly evolving, driven by the actions of its major players. Staying informed and understanding the potential implications of such large transactions is key for navigating this exciting space.

A1: An XRP transfer refers to the movement of XRP digital tokens from one wallet address to another on the XRP Ledger. These transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be tracked by services like Whale Alert. Q2: Who is Whale Alert? A2: Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions (often referred to as “whale movements”) across various blockchains. It provides real-time notifications about significant transfers, helping to increase transparency in the crypto market. Q3: Why would an “unknown wallet” transfer XRP to Ripple? A3: An “unknown wallet” could be an address controlled by Ripple itself, used for internal treasury management, or an address belonging to an institutional partner or client making a large payment or contributing to a liquidity pool. Without specific announcements from Ripple, the exact nature remains speculative. Q4: Does this XRP transfer mean Ripple will sell the tokens immediately? A4: Not necessarily. A large XRP transfer to Ripple’s known wallets often indicates internal asset management, such as preparing for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) operations, consolidating funds, or managing escrow releases. While sales are always a possibility, the transfer itself doesn’t guarantee an immediate market dump. Q5: How does this affect the price of XRP? A5: Large transfers can sometimes create market speculation, but their direct impact on price is not always straightforward. While some might interpret it as a bearish signal (potential sale), others might see it as a bullish sign of strategic activity or increased liquidity. The actual price movement depends on broader market sentiment and Ripple’s subsequent actions. Q6: Where can I track these large XRP transfers? A6: You can track large XRP transfers and other cryptocurrency movements using blockchain explorers specific to the XRP Ledger or through services like Whale Alert, which aggregates and reports on significant transactions across multiple chains.

A staggering 200,000,000 XRP transfer , valued at approximately $500 million, has been reported moving from an unknown wallet directly to Ripple. This kind of significant movement always captures attention and prompts questions among investors and market watchers alike. What Just Happened with This XRP Transfer? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert recently flagged a colossal transaction involving Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP. The report indicated that 200 million XRP tokens were sent from a wallet identified only as ‘unknown’ to Ripple. Scale of the Transfer: This particular XRP transfer represents a substantial amount, making it one of the larger single transactions observed recently. Valuation: At current market prices, this transfer is valued at around half a billion dollars, underscoring its financial significance. Destination: The recipient, Ripple, is the company closely associated with XRP, leading to immediate speculation about the purpose of such a large influx. When an ‘unknown wallet’ is involved, it typically means the address is not publicly associated with a known individual, exchange, or institution, adding a layer of mystery to the transaction. Why Do Large XRP Transfers Spark Market Interest? Significant cryptocurrency movements, often dubbed ‘whale transfers,’ frequently draw attention because they can signal potential market shifts. A massive XRP transfer like this one can be interpreted in several ways: Potential Selling Pressure: Sometimes, large transfers to exchanges precede a sell-off, which could impact price. However, a transfer directly to Ripple itself might suggest internal management. Strategic Moves: It could indicate a strategic decision by the sending entity or by Ripple to consolidate assets or prepare for a specific initiative. Liquidity Management: Ripple often uses XRP for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solutions. This transfer could be related to bolstering liquidity for these services. Understanding the context behind such transfers is crucial for market participants. The sheer volume of this particular XRP transfer makes it a notable event for the entire crypto community. What Could This XRP Transfer Mean for Ripple’s Operations? A direct XRP transfer to Ripple itself opens up several possibilities regarding the company’s internal operations and strategy. Ripple holds a significant portion of XRP in escrow, releasing it periodically for various purposes. This incoming transfer could potentially be: A Buyback: Ripple might be repurchasing XRP from a large holder. Strategic Partnership: The transfer could be part of an agreement with a partner or institution. Internal Reallocation: Perhaps it is a movement between Ripple-controlled wallets for treasury management or operational needs. Historically, Ripple has been transparent about its escrow releases and sales, aiming to maintain market stability. This particular incoming XRP transfer suggests a different kind of interaction. Navigating the Impact of Significant Crypto Movements For investors, understanding these large transactions is part of staying informed. While a single XRP transfer doesn’t always dictate immediate price action, it contributes to the overall market sentiment and narrative. It’s a reminder of the dynamic nature of digital assets and the importance of on-chain analytics. Monitoring reputable sources like Whale Alert provides valuable insights into the movements of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales.’ These insights can help individuals make more informed decisions, rather than reacting to unverified rumors. The recent 200,000,000 XRP transfer to Ripple is undoubtedly a significant event in the cryptocurrency landscape. While its exact purpose remains undisclosed by Ripple, it highlights the constant activity within the digital asset space. Such large-scale movements underscore the growing maturity and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies like XRP. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these substantial transfers will remain a key aspect of understanding potential future developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in crypto transfers? An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly identified or linked to a specific individual, exchange, or institution. These wallets are often used by large holders, sometimes called ‘whales,’ who prefer to remain anonymous. Why is this 200,000,000 XRP transfer significant? The significance lies in the sheer volume and value of the transaction ($500 million) and its destination – Ripple. Large transfers can influence market sentiment, signal strategic moves, or indicate changes in liquidity management for the asset. Does this XRP transfer mean Ripple is selling XRP? Not necessarily. While transfers to exchanges can sometimes precede sales, a direct transfer to Ripple could indicate a buyback, an internal reallocation, or part of a strategic partnership. It is an incoming transfer to Ripple, not an outgoing one to an exchange for sale. How can I track large crypto transfers like this? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. These platforms provide real-time updates on large movements, helping the community stay informed. What impact could this have on XRP’s price? The immediate impact on XRP’s price is not always clear-cut. While large transfers can sometimes create short-term volatility due to speculation, the long-term effects depend on the actual purpose of the transfer and Ripple’s subsequent actions. It’s important to consider broader market trends. Did you find this analysis helpful?

There has been massive investment in ETFs related to Bitcoin and Ethereum in the last quarter, marking renewed faith in cryptos with the onset of economic change. Solana, being a strong altcoin, has numerous times been arrested at the $203 and $212 mark due to selling pressures from persons who took profits in the altcoin. This is because it emphasizes the importance of making informed decisions on the best crypto to invest in, with the key aspect being growth and sustainability in these volatile markets. On the other hand, there is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , one of the most prominent DeFi cryptos that has garnered intense attention from over 17,660 investors since the onset of its presale event, with $18,270,000 in funds raised so far. Solana Resistance Challenges Solana has resisted key areas around $203 and $212 for weeks now, while market players observe ETF injection-related growth in the crypto market without resulting in higher prices for Solana. The bears have completely controlled these areas, resulting in Solana crashing after short periods of rises in prices, thereby disappointing Solana investors who seek to benefit instantly from it despite it being known for high speed and an exciting network. On the other hand, these challenges highlight why investors are turning to more dependable opportunities such as the best crypto to buy, in which steady progress beats intermittent rallies. Therefore, while SOL remains in limbo, new projects with real-world value are gaining importance because they avoid volatility pitfalls. Mutuum Finance Presale Activity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rushed the presale in Phase 6, with 85% of the tokens sold, giving it immense hype in the DeFi crypto space currently. The earlier investors have booked the current price of $0.035, marking an increase of 250% from Phase 1, where it was $0.01 to join the space. As Phase 6 is nearing the point of being sold out, investors lock in purchases ready to yield returns of as much as 420% after the initial launch price of $0.06. Also, the team has launched a dashboard with the 24-hour leaderboard where the highest depositor takes home the $500 bonus for MUTM every day after making one transaction with the rewards being reset at 00:00 UTC. For enhanced community sentiment, Mutuum Finance maintains a $100,000 prize give out in an attempt to distribute $10,000 prizes among the 10 lucky individuals, resulting in the current holders reaching 17,660 with the current motivation mixture making MUTM the best cryptocurrency to buy currently in light of Phase 7 approaching with a near 20% increase to $0.04 while leaving others to pay higher prices. Dual-Market Lending Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its multi-tiered loan model combining the best of pool-based efficiency with direct flexibility, making it one of the best cryptos in DeFi. The process involves users staking funds such as ETH or USDT in peer-to-contract pools, where borrowers access automatically, earning steady returns in the process. Where less frequently used tokens tend to not have deep enough pools of liquidity, peer-to-peer solutions allow the lender to set terms, encouraging them to make the most of the returns without the middlemen in the process increasing the rewards’ after-take fee risks, either directly in terms of rising to higher altcoins if geared towards mass altcoin users or to simple altcoins if catering to users unsatisfied with altcoins’ same old story each time they pull out. Hence, it is the best cryptocurrency to invest in for users who are fed up with one-note altcoins. Looking Back at Smart Choices Those who have participated in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during the current surge in the presale can now own a stake in the DeFi crypto that has been designed with longevity in mind, reaching far beyond the temporary resistance fights involved in altcoins such as SOL. Its perfect blend of community spirit and good fundamentals provides further reasons why one should own the best crypto to buy in the current market uncertainty – start now in the presale before Phase 6 ends.

The document titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” was first posted on October 31, 2008. Bitcoin Hits Its 17th Year The network itself went live when the genesis block was mined on January 3, 2009. That first block carried a headline embedded in its code that referenced a major banking bailout story, a move that many say set the tone for the crypto’s original message. The market has changed a lot since then. Based on reports , BTC’s market value is now being measured in the trillions, with some outlets citing a roughly $2 trillion market cap as part of the broader picture of adoption by institutions and governments. Today marks the 17th anniversary of the Bitcoin Whitepaper. Read it today: https://t.co/w5GI7OilDH pic.twitter.com/fahFRbSMmY — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) October 31, 2025 Traders and investors watched prices closely on the anniversary. According to market snapshots, Bitcoin traded around $110,500 on the day, reflecting both recent gains and ongoing volatility. Why The Date Matters Analysts say anniversaries like this are both symbolic and practical. They give a moment to check how the technology and the money around it have changed. Supporters point to Bitcoin’s continuous operation since the genesis block as proof of its durability. Political figures also used the date to weigh in: US Treasury officials and other public voices highlighted that the network has stayed “always on,” and some compared that to government operations. Adoption Has Been Gradual And Uneven According to reports, adoption was slow initially before picking up as products were developed, new exchanges opened and investment funds became available. Now, some countries and companies have begun holding Bitcoin directly. Others are establishing rules and limits. So, in total, a mixed status. Policy decisions will continue to have an impact on the level of adoption with Bitcoin. Traders are tracking support levels near $105,000 and watching for fresh momentum that could push prices higher or trigger pullbacks. Markets have seen large swings this year, and experts say those swings will likely remain. Looking Ahead Reports have disclosed mixed forecasts for price and policy in the months ahead, but many industry voices agree on one point: Bitcoin’s first 17 years have moved it from a technical experiment into a broad public debate about money, policy and investment.

This move, reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a large transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver with potential implications for the XRP ecosystem. For those tracking the pulse of digital assets, understanding the nuances of such an action is crucial. What Does XRP Locked in Escrow Truly Mean? When we talk about XRP locked in escrow, it refers to a specific mechanism Ripple employs to manage the supply of its native cryptocurrency. Escrow acts like a digital vault, holding a predetermined amount of XRP for a set period or until certain conditions are met. This isn’t a new practice for Ripple; they have been utilizing escrow accounts for years to ensure transparency and predictability in the release of XRP into the market. Transparency: The escrow schedule is public, allowing the community to anticipate future releases. Supply Management: It prevents a sudden flood of XRP onto exchanges, which could potentially destabilize its price. Investor Confidence: It signals a commitment to long-term stability and responsible asset management. Why is This XRP Locked Development So Significant? The locking of 500 million XRP is a substantial amount, representing a considerable portion of the circulating supply. This action directly impacts the available supply of XRP on exchanges, which can influence market dynamics. Less available supply, assuming consistent demand, can lead to interesting price movements. Furthermore, it reinforces Ripple’s ongoing strategy to maintain a structured release schedule. Consider the broader context: Ripple’s vision for XRP Ledger (XRPL) involves facilitating fast, low-cost international payments. Managing the supply of XRP is a key component of this vision, ensuring the asset remains viable and attractive for institutional adoption. This latest XRP locked event underscores that commitment. The Broader Implications of XRP Locked Funds This move isn’t just about supply and demand; it also speaks to Ripple’s strategic positioning within the global financial landscape. By consistently locking up large sums of XRP, Ripple demonstrates its long-term belief in the asset’s utility and its ecosystem’s growth. This can be a powerful signal to potential partners and investors who are looking for stability and foresight in the volatile crypto market. Moreover, the continuous locking of XRP in escrow highlights a proactive approach to managing market sentiment. In an industry often swayed by news and speculation, predictable actions like these can foster a sense of security. It shows that Ripple is not just reacting to market conditions but actively shaping the environment for XRP’s sustained development and adoption. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for XRP Locked Assets? The question many are asking is, what happens next with these XRP locked funds? Typically, Ripple’s escrow system releases a portion of XRP each month. Any unspent XRP from these monthly releases is then re-escrowed. This cyclical process ensures a continuous, managed flow of XRP into the market, aligning with Ripple’s operational needs and ecosystem development efforts. For investors and enthusiasts, monitoring these escrow releases and re-escrows provides valuable insight into Ripple’s financial health and its ongoing commitment to the XRP Ledger. It’s a transparent mechanism that allows for a degree of predictability in an otherwise unpredictable market. As the crypto space evolves, such structured approaches become increasingly important for establishing trust and stability. The recent report of 500 million XRP locked in escrow at Ripple is a clear indicator of the company’s deliberate strategy to manage its digital asset. This consistent approach to supply management, through transparent escrow releases, aims to foster stability and confidence within the XRP ecosystem. It underscores Ripple’s long-term vision for XRP as a key player in global finance, reinforcing its commitment to a predictable and robust digital asset environment. For anyone interested in the future of digital payments and blockchain technology, these strategic moves by Ripple are certainly worth watching. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when XRP is locked in escrow? When XRP is locked in escrow, it means a specific amount of XRP is held in a secure digital account for a predetermined period or until certain conditions are met. This prevents it from being sold or moved freely on the market, helping to manage supply. Why does Ripple lock XRP in escrow ? Ripple locks XRP in escrow primarily to manage its supply and ensure market stability. This transparent process prevents a sudden influx of XRP onto exchanges, which could negatively impact its price and investor confidence. How often does Ripple release XRP from escrow ? Ripple typically releases a portion of XRP from escrow on a monthly basis. Any unspent XRP from these monthly releases is then re-escrowed, maintaining a controlled and predictable supply flow. Does XRP locked in escrow affect its price? Yes, the amount of XRP locked in escrow can affect its price by influencing the circulating supply. A larger amount of XRP locked generally means less available on the open market, which can, in theory, support its value if demand remains consistent. Where can I track XRP escrow movements? Platforms like Whale Alert often report significant XRP escrow movements. Additionally, Ripple’s official channels and various crypto analytics sites provide information on the escrow schedule and releases.

A substantial amount of XRP locked in escrow has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This isn’t just a minor transaction; it’s a strategic move with potential ripple effects across the market. Let’s dive into what this means for the digital asset and its community. What’s the Buzz About 200 Million XRP Locked ? According to a report from Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, a staggering 200 million XRP has been placed into Ripple’s escrow. This isn’t the first time such an event has occurred, but each instance brings renewed discussion about Ripple’s strategy and XRP’s market dynamics. For those new to the term, “escrow” in the crypto world generally refers to funds held by a third party or, in this case, a smart contract, until certain conditions are met. Ripple utilizes this mechanism to manage the supply of XRP, ensuring a predictable release schedule. Significant Volume: 200 million XRP represents a considerable portion of the circulating supply. Transparency: These transactions are publicly verifiable on the XRP Ledger. Market Impact: Locking up such a large amount can influence supply-demand dynamics. Understanding Ripple’s Escrow Strategy for XRP Locked Ripple’s escrow system is a cornerstone of its economic model for XRP. Back in 2017, Ripple locked 55 billion XRP in a series of escrows, designed to release 1 billion XRP each month over 55 months. The purpose was to provide predictability and stability to the market, preventing a sudden flood of tokens that could depress prices. When we see XRP locked , it typically means these tokens are moved into an account that cannot be accessed until a predetermined time or condition is met. Any unreleased XRP from the monthly allocations is usually returned to the escrow queue, further ensuring a controlled release. This systematic approach aims to: Boost Investor Confidence: By providing clarity on future supply. Reduce Volatility: Mitigating the risk of large, unpredictable token dumps. Support Ecosystem Growth: Allowing Ripple to strategically use XRP for partnerships and development without immediate market pressure. How Does XRP Locked Affect Market Dynamics? The locking of 200 million XRP can be interpreted in several ways by the market. On one hand, it reduces the immediate circulating supply, which, in theory, could be seen as a bullish signal. A lower available supply, coupled with consistent demand, often leads to upward price pressure. However, it’s also a reminder that Ripple holds a significant portion of XRP and manages its release. While this provides stability, some critics point to it as a centralized aspect of the asset. Nevertheless, the transparency of the escrow system allows market participants to track these movements. Consider these points: Supply Constraint: Fewer tokens available for immediate sale. Psychological Impact: Can create a sense of scarcity, potentially encouraging buying. Long-Term Vision: Reinforces Ripple’s commitment to a structured distribution plan. What’s Next for the Future of XRP Locked and Ripple? The consistent locking and releasing of XRP from escrow is part of Ripple’s long-term strategy to build out the utility of the XRP Ledger and the XRP token. As Ripple continues to pursue partnerships and develop its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, the controlled release of XRP is crucial for funding these initiatives without disrupting the market. Investors and enthusiasts should monitor these escrow movements as they offer insights into Ripple’s operational rhythm. While 200 million XRP locked is a notable event, it fits within a broader pattern of strategic supply management. The ongoing legal landscape also plays a role, but these escrow actions demonstrate business as usual for Ripple’s tokenomics. In conclusion, the locking of 200 million XRP in escrow by Ripple is a significant but not unprecedented event. It underscores Ripple’s commitment to a structured supply management strategy, aiming to foster stability and long-term growth for the XRP ecosystem. This move provides transparency and predictability, which are vital for investor confidence in the volatile crypto market. Keep an eye on these developments, as they often hint at the future trajectory of one of the most talked-about digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when XRP is locked in escrow? A: When XRP is locked in escrow, it means a specific amount of tokens is held in a secure, smart-contract-controlled account. These tokens are inaccessible until predetermined conditions, such as a specific date or event, are met. This mechanism is used by Ripple to manage the circulating supply of XRP. Q2: Why does Ripple lock XRP in escrow? A: Ripple locks XRP in escrow primarily to provide predictability and stability to the market. By controlling the release of a large portion of its XRP holdings, Ripple aims to prevent sudden supply shocks, boost investor confidence, and strategically fund its operations and ecosystem development over time. Q3: How often does Ripple lock or release XRP from escrow? A: Historically, Ripple established a system in 2017 to lock 55 billion XRP in escrow, with 1 billion XRP typically released each month. Any unreleased XRP from the monthly allocation is usually returned to escrow. Specific locking events, like the recent 200 million XRP locked , are part of this ongoing, dynamic management strategy. Q4: Does 200 million XRP locked affect the price of XRP? A: The locking of a significant amount of XRP locked can potentially affect its price by reducing the immediate circulating supply. In economic terms, if demand remains constant or increases while supply decreases, it can create upward pressure on the price. However, many factors influence crypto prices, so this is just one component. Q5: Is Ripple’s escrow system transparent? A: Yes, Ripple’s escrow system is designed for transparency. All transactions, including the locking and release of XRP locked , are recorded on the public XRP Ledger, allowing anyone to verify these movements. This public record helps maintain trust and accountability within the ecosystem. Did you find this deep dive into XRP locked in escrow insightful?

The latest data shows 440 million DOGE being offloaded as selling pressures intensify. Amidst this sharp decline in whale holdings, the meme coin’s price has experienced significant volatility, falling to $0.18 after recording weeks-long losses. Dogecoin Whales Trim DOGE Holdings En Masse According to on-chain data from crypto analytics platform Santiment, wallets holding between 10,000,000 and 100,000,000 DOGE have sold off roughly 440 million tokens within 72 hours. This large-scale distribution marks one of the most significant short-term liquidations from mid-level whale wallets in recent weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Crashes 50% From October Highs, Volume Is Worse, What’s Going On? Notably, on Thursday, October 29, these wallets accounted for approximately 15.51% of the total DOGE supply, but that figure dropped to 15.31% the following day. Moreover, it declined again on October 31 to 15.17%, and now stands at a low of 15.15%, at the time of writing. As whales abruptly reduced their exposure, the market also responded quickly. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Dogecoin’s price plummeted about 5.76% this last week, following its 27% crash over the past month. As selling pressure increases for Dogecoin, Santiment’s data further reveals that whale transaction counts for holders managing DOGE worth $100,000 and above spiked to 119 transactions on October 30, before plunging to 15 at the time of writing. This sharp decline suggests a rapid transition from distribution to dormancy among short-term high-volume traders. Interestingly, there have been signs of a redistribution, indicating that not all large holders are exiting the market. Santiment reports that whales with holdings exceeding 100,000,000 DOGE have increased their balances from 19.28% to 19.46% over the same period, implying accumulation from even larger players. Meanwhile, investors with holdings between 100,000 and 10,000,000 DOGE have maintained a steady position, signaling a neutral stance amid market uncertainty. Analysts Eye $0.33 And Beyond As Technical Patterns Align Despite widespread whale dumping, analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s medium to long-term price trajectory. Crypto market expert Ali Martinez identified Dogecoin’s current price at $0.18 as a critical support level. Based on his analysis, maintaining this price floor could spark a recovery wave targeting $0.26 and potentially $0.33. His chart illustrating Dogecoin’s ongoing consolidation within an Ascending Channel highlights a potential upward break aligning with previous recovery phases. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resurrection To $0.5 Could Be Imminent If This Level Breaks Adding to the bullish outlook, Bitcoinsensus has released a long-term projection, suggesting an explosive continuation of DOGE’s cyclical uptrend. The analysis compares past rallies, showing gains of 300% and 500%, and now points toward a potential 800% surge that could propel the meme coin to approximately $1.70 in the current market cycle.

The analyst pointed out that while market observers are focused on Western Union’s stablecoin partnership, the broader financial positioning of Ripple remains largely overlooked. According to Kwok, the focus on billion-dollar payment systems fails to capture the scale at which Ripple is now operating. He argues that recent strategic acquisitions by Ripple position the company to engage with trillions of dollars in institutional liquidity and settlement activity, making its market exposure far larger than that of traditional remittance firms. Ripple’s Expanding Financial Network Ripple’s recent acquisitions have attracted particular attention from analysts who see them as indicators of a deeper structural shift. These deals extend Ripple’s reach far beyond its previous partnerships with banks and payment providers. many of you have asked for my thoughts on the western union x solana announcement, so here they are. TLDR: billions are cool, but trillions are cooler. while western union handles billions of dollars each year, ripple is on its way to handling trillions of dollars each year.… — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 29, 2025 Among the most notable of Ripple’s recent acquisitions are Hidden Road , a global prime brokerage that clears around $3 trillion in transactions annually. GTreasury , a multinational treasury management company that facilitates trillions in yearly payment flows across more than 160 countries. Ripple also acquired Rail, a rapidly expanding payments platform responsible for approximately 10% of all stablecoin-based transactions worldwide. Analysts view these purchases as more consequential than traditional corporate partnerships, as they give Ripple direct ownership and operational control over platforms that already manage vast liquidity volumes. This distinction is significant because acquisitions allow Ripple to influence infrastructure design and settlement mechanisms, key factors that could eventually determine whether XRP becomes the default asset used within these systems. XRP’s Role in Ripple’s Long-Term Vision Kwok highlighted that the company’s broader goal appears to center on integrating XRP as a settlement layer within this expanding ecosystem. By owning companies that already handle multi-trillion-dollar transactions, Ripple gains both the technological and strategic leverage needed to gradually embed the XRP Ledger into high-value financial processes. This perspective contrasts sharply with the public narrative surrounding Western Union’s recent collaboration with Solana. Western Union’s stablecoin, USDPT, will launch in 2026 to facilitate global money transfers and digital cash-outs, potentially managing over $100 billion in annual flow. While this development is noteworthy, Dom Kwok and other XRP advocates argue that it represents a much smaller scale compared to Ripple’s institutional ambitions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Broader Industry Context Market commentator Scott Melker recently questioned whether XRP still holds relevance in the global payments market, noting that Western Union opted for Solana after earlier experiments with Ripple’s network. In response, Dom Kwok and other analysts urged observers to evaluate Ripple’s expanding control over institutional payment infrastructure rather than individual partnerships. Supporting this view, Flare Network CEO Hugo Philion has previously stated that Ripple’s direction points toward trading and asset management infrastructure, citing the acquisitions of Hidden Road and GTreasury as examples of this strategic evolution. Philion also emphasized that Flare’s interoperability and decentralized finance features complement Ripple’s broader ecosystem rather than compete with it. The takeaway from Kwok’s analysis is that Ripple is repositioning itself to participate in global financial systems measured in trillions, not billions. While public attention may gravitate toward headline-grabbing collaborations like Western Union’s, Ripple’s recent business moves suggest a deliberate effort to secure influence over the institutional frameworks that facilitate large-scale liquidity and cross-border settlements. In the analyst’s words, the market should not confuse short-term developments with long-term positioning. Ripple’s acquisition-driven strategy signals a transition from partnership-based collaboration to ownership of key financial pipelines, potentially placing XRP at the core of high-value global payment systems.

These massive withdrawals coincided with the exchange’s chief strategy officer’s public apology for mishandling a situation with a user with the pseudonym The White Whale. Earlier in July, The White Whale claimed that MEXC froze over $3.1 million worth of his personal funds without any terms of service violations. The crypto user later launched a $2 million social media pressure campaign against the exchange, claiming that the trading platform had requested a 12-month review period before unfreezing their funds. The White Whale said the “vague review” allowed the exchange to hold customers’ money hostage despite having completed the platform’s most advanced KYC (Know Your Client) process. MEXC Apologizes For Withholding Users’ Personal Funds On Friday, MEXC Chief Strategy Officer Cecilia Hsueh took to X to apologize to White Whale on behalf of the exchange. After revealing that the user’s money has been released, and “he can claim it at any time,” the exchange’s executive said that she got emotional communicating with White Whale when she shouldn’t have. Hsueh added in the post on X: Since I joined MEXC 2 months ago I’ve been fighting behind the scenes to get MEXC to change. We grew really fast—a few years ago, we were a very small exchange, but given our current scale, our risk, operations, and PR teams have not kept up. Furthermore, the exchange’s CSO clarified that her statement was not limited only to the White Whale’s case. Hsueh said other users with unresolved account issues will also be attended to, as they look to implement changes that will improve their transparency. Is Another FTX Fiasco Looming? A few minutes after this apology was posted on the X platform, pseudonymous on-chain analyst Maartunn revealed that exchange withdrawal transactions on MEXC were on the rise. It appeared at the time that users were moving their funds off the cryptocurrency platform. Burak Kesmeci, another prominent on-chain analyst, also noticed the big outflows from the MEXC exchange, likening this situation to that of the now-defunct FTX exchange. However, the crypto pundit later revealed that the exchange’s Bitcoin reserves are still intact . It’s worth mentioning that FTX’s Bitcoin reserves were found to have hit zero days before the exchange declared bankruptcy. Hence, if there is to be a repeat of such an incident, the Bitcoin reserves might be worth watching over the next few days.",MEXC|crypto|crypto exchange|crypto news|FTX,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 23:30:40

53921194,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88355,1762041636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Software Dev Reveals What Will Happen When XRP Hits $100,https://timestabloid.com/software-dev-reveals-what-will-happen-when-xrp-hits-100/,"XRP community member and software developer Vincent Van Code recently argued that small variations in XRP’s current trading price will become insignificant if the digital asset eventually reaches the higher valuations many investors anticipate. In recent weeks, XRP has traded within a narrow band between $2.20 and $2.60, attempting to recover from the October 10 market decline . After touching $2.69 on October 27, the token has since retreated to about $2.49 , recording three consecutive daily losses. During this pullback, XRP’s market capitalization declined by more than $8 billion, even though its unit price fell by only $0.14. While such fluctuations are meaningful to traders operating on short-term timeframes, Van Code emphasized that long-term investors should avoid focusing on minor price changes. His position reflects a broader investment mindset within the XRP community, one that prioritizes the potential for large-scale gains over short-term volatility. I used to wing about having to pay $0.80 for XRP when I bought for $0.20 or less. I knew one day it wouldn't matter, and I am even more confident that a 0.60 price difference won't matter at $100 — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 26, 2025 Small Price Gaps Become Meaningless Over Time Van Code recalled that he once felt uneasy about purchasing XRP at $0.80, having previously accumulated the token at prices near $0.20. At the time, paying more for the same asset seemed like a poor decision. However, his perspective changed as he began evaluating the market with a longer-term outlook. He noted that when an asset appreciates significantly, small differences in the initial purchase price fade in importance. For example, if XRP were to achieve a future value of $100, the difference between buying at $0.20 or $0.80 would hardly matter. In both cases, the investor would still see exponential gains. Historical data provides some context for this argument. XRP traded for as little as $0.21 in January 2021 before climbing to $1.96 by April that year. After the broader market downturn in 2022, it fell to $0.29, only to rebound above $0.90 by mid-2023. As of today, the asset trades at roughly $2.55, maintaining steady performance despite market uncertainty. Long-Term Confidence in XRP’s Future Van Code’s optimism stems from the belief that XRP could one day reach valuations similar to early Bitcoin levels. In 2011, Bitcoin fluctuated between $3 and $12; now it trades above $110,000. For those early investors, the difference between buying at $3 or $12 became irrelevant once the price increased more than ten thousandfold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Using this logic, Van Code suggested that if XRP were to climb to $100, minor differences in entry prices today would have little bearing on eventual returns. For instance, an investor spending $50,000 at $2.18 would obtain 22,935 XRP, while another buying at $2.55 would acquire 19,607 XRP. If XRP reached $100, those holdings would be valued at $2.29 million and $1.96 million, respectively. Although the two investors would see different absolute gains, both would achieve life-changing profits. In Van Code’s view, this underscores the importance of long-term conviction rather than obsessing over short-term entry points. While Van Code’s scenario assumes that XRP could reach $100, a target that remains speculative, his broader argument centers on investment discipline. He maintains that price fluctuations within a small range should not distract holders from the potential long-term value of the asset. For now, XRP’s short-term movements continue to capture market attention, but voices like Van Code’s encourage investors to evaluate the asset through a longer lens. Whether XRP reaches those projected highs or not, his remarks highlight a growing maturity in how parts of the crypto community assess value beyond short-term trading cycles.

On-Chain Data Says ‘Possibly’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-investors-in-accumulation-mode/,"After the market-wide downturn on October 10, the Bitcoin price showed no definite direction for the rest of the historically bullish month. At the moment, the premier cryptocurrency is struggling to gather any significant momentum to the upside. However, recent on-chain evaluation suggests that this period of relative silence could represent a springboard for the cryptocurrency’s sustained upswing. Sender/Receiver Ratio Falls To One-Year Low In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, pseudonymous analyst CryptoOnchain shared an interesting insight into Bitcoin’s future trajectory, leaning towards a bullish hypothesis in the report. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the Bitcoin Sender/Receiver Address Ratio, which compares the number of active sending (selling) addresses to receiving (buying) addresses. This metric acts as a means to gauge the prevalent market sentiment within a period of time. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Loading: Bullish Factors That Point To A Massive Surge A high ratio (with a reading above 1) indicates that there are more sending addresses compared to the buying addresses. As a result, there is expectedly greater selling pressure in this market condition. On the other hand, a low ratio (a reading approaching 1 and levels below) reflects the preponderance of buying addresses. CryptoOnchain reported that Bitcoin’s Sender/Receiver ratio on Binance has recently fallen to 1.34 — its lowest level in the past year. As previously explained, when this ratio falls to levels such as it currently reads, it usually indicates that there are more buying addresses relative to the amount of selling addresses in the market. This shift in investor leanings typically signals an accumulation phase, where more investors are willing to acquire Bitcoin on exchanges. Interestingly, the analyst also referenced historical evidence, explaining that periods where this shift in market sentiment occurred often preceded the establishment of local price bottoms. As of late 2024, the Sender/Receiver ratio fell to levels around 1.3, with significant upward movement following suit, and a similar pattern was seen in early 2023. According to CryptoOnchain, this current consolidation phase could signal that the market’s foundation is gaining strength. Thus, if history is anything to go by, Bitcoin’s price could see an immense upward boost in the days to come — one which could sponsor the world’s leading asset to see a fine amount of growth in the mid-term. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is worth approximately $109,899, reflecting no significant movement in the past day. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is down by nearly 2% in the past seven days.

His post on X invited XRP community members to join a “facts-only” debate, urging participants to rely on verifiable on-chain metrics rather than speculation. The move reflects growing tension between advocates of Solana’s expanding ecosystem and Ripple’s supporters, who often emphasize long-term institutional growth. Vibhu Questions XRP’s Network Activity Vibhu argued that many XRP supporters avoid discussing measurable on-chain trends. He said he respects Ripple’s innovation but believes its community should face data showing minimal progress. According to metrics he cited, XRP Ledger’s daily active accounts have hovered near 25,000 for about three years. “The numbers don’t lie,” Vibhu said, noting that XRP’s network has not kept pace with market developments. He contrasted this stagnation with Solana’s rapid growth, reporting more than 2.5 million active accounts daily. Consequently, he pointed out that Solana’s network processes far more real activity than XRP, highlighting a significant gap between both ecosystems. Vibhu stressed that low fees exist on both blockchains, so the disparity reflects user demand, not cost advantages. Comparing Volumes and Ecosystem Growth Besides user counts, Vibhu compared transactional and payment data to demonstrate Solana’s growing dominance. XRP Ledger reportedly handles 1 million to 1.5 million daily transactions, while Solana records roughly 100 million. Moreover, he noted that Solana’s stablecoin transfer volume hit nearly $2 trillion in October, while XRP’s monthly transfers remain between $50 billion and $60 billion. However, Ripple continues to expand its ecosystem through acquisitions and new initiatives. Its purchase of GTreasury and launch of Evernorth on Nasdaq show a push toward broader enterprise adoption. Additionally, Ripple’s upcoming DeFi roadmap aims to increase tokenization and stablecoin activity on the XRP Ledger, signaling potential recovery in future usage metrics. Live Debate to Settle the Data Dispute Vibhu invited Ripple executives to join a public debate where both sides present verifiable data. “I’ll bring facts,” he said, emphasizing that the event should remain factual and transparent. Former Ripple Director of Developer Relations Matt Hamilton accepted the challenge, while community figure King Solomon offered to host the debate. The upcoming discussion could reveal contrasting views on blockchain growth and user engagement, shaping how investors perceive Solana’s and XRP’s network strength in the evolving crypto landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|SOL|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-02 00:40:48

With institutional demand toward Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) benefiting from speculative hype, people are focusing fast on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency invading the DeFi space and now widely regarded as which crypto to buy today for short-term gains. At present in Phase 6 of the presale, MUTM is more than 80% sold out, and more than $18.27 million has been raised at $0.035 per token. Its dual-lending mechanism, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending, offers early investors the advantage of optimizing capital efficiency and profit in a market where liquidity is presently booming. As the Fed lowers rates, projects like MUTM, in its nascent stage, will be helped by increasing market demand for risk, allowing it to outshine mature altcoins. With only limited presale tokens available, this is a limited entry opportunity for investors deciding which crypto to buy today for short-term profits before a project that can potentially experience 10x or more growth as 2025 goes by. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Coiling for Its Next Giant Move as Volatility Squeezes Shiba Inu (SHIB) is revealing signs of a future massive volatility squeeze since price action is constricting in an increasing wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart. Consolidating at the moment within $0.0000108–$0.0000110, SHIB is poised well around its midline support level, meaning there is increasing tension prior to a breakout. The build-up from the $0.0000090 base, with an obvious pattern of higher highs and higher lows, creates a constructively technical setup. If bulls can break out above $0.0000115 on decent volume, the way is clear for a possible rally to $0.0000125–$0.0000135, or a fall below $0.0000098 would provoke a pullback to the $0.0000090–$0.0000088 accumulation range. With its technical foundations solidifying and traders watching expectantly, SHIB’s next move will be the impetus for high short-term volatility. In the meantime, while SHIB holders await the breakout, most are quietly looking away from the ball and onto Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new cryptocurrency with strong early momentum that many experts now say is the answer to the question which crypto to buy today for short-term profits. Solana (SOL) Attempts Key Neckline Support, Breakdown on the Horizon? Solana (SOL) is flashing warning signs as it takes shape in a Head & Shoulders pattern on the 1-hour chart, usually a sign of short-term reversals. The left shoulder has been created around $198, the head touched almost $205, and the right shoulder has been created around $202, while $192–$193 is still the crucial neckline support. Now, SOL is slightly higher in this area, and a confirmed breakdown from here would trigger an immediate decline toward $185–$180, which is in line with the entire measured move target. If bulls can hold the neckline and retrace to $200, though, the pattern will be broken, and there will be a relief rally to $205+. While short-term momentum is cautiously bullish, traders are optimistic that institutional demand can lead the trend of SOL to remain stable in the coming future. However, with uncertainty, most investors are quietly positioning themselves in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new cryptocurrency with rapidly growing presale traction that has been repeatedly labeled as which crypto to buy today for short-term gains due to its impressive early performance. Mutuum Finance: Shaping the Future of Decentralized Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly becoming one of the most innovative and dynamic new cryptocurrency projects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Operating well above all initial estimates, the venture has already captured the interest of over 17,660 investors and raised over $18.27 million in its current presale. This stellar performance has impressed investors and analysts as well, so Mutuum Finance is now at the top of every list for which crypto to buy today for short-term results and future stability. Early investors are expecting possible returns of almost 2x since the first launch of MUTM. Every earlier presale round has finished in record time, reflecting gigantic investor trust and building a solid early liquidity foundation before the mainnet launch. This continued organic demand is a clear reflection of the confidence that Mutuum Finance is not just another speculative bubble but a next-gen DeFi protocol with long-term sustainability and real-world application. Redefining Borrowing: Mutuum Finance’s Clear and Stable DeFi Model At the heart of Mutuum Finance is an innovative lending mechanism that aims to bring higher predictability, stability, and fairness to all in the DeFi lending market. Advance repayment fees can be negotiated by borrowers, and interest rates are dynamically adjusted to reflect market conditions. While fixed-rate models might appear higher at first glance versus floating rates, they provide a critical layer of security, safeguarding users from unexpected rate spikes and volatility risks. With the introduction of fixed-rate lending in decentralized communities, Mutuum Finance provides a more equitable, transparent, and user-friendly process for borrowing. It’s a first step toward building decentralized finance on protection, clarity, and long-term trust. Mutuum Finance is not only revolutionizing how DeFi functions; it is establishing new standards for how decentralized finance can engage with global users in a stable and predictable manner. With the Fed rate cut, shareholders are looking for high-upside assets. Mutuum Finance, currently at $0.035 and more than 80% sold in Phase 6, has already achieved $18.27M. With real-world applications in DeFi and robust demand, MUTM is clearly which crypto to buy today for short-term, and it stands tall as the new cryptocurrency leading the next wave of financial innovation before 2025’s bull trend.

53922848,618804,1762045200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53922848.jpeg,Shiba Inu Facing A Bear Market? Pundit Shows What To Expect,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-facing-a-bear-market/,"Shiba Inu appears to be repeating a familiar market structure, according to a recent technical analysis shared by crypto trader IncomeSharks on X. The analyst highlighted how SHIB’s price history over the past two years reflects a cyclical pattern of short-lived rallies followed by prolonged downturns. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.00001007, showing little momentum to break free from its extended bearish grip. Is Shiba Inu’s Market Structure Looking Bearish? The analyst’s daily candlestick timeframe chart, which tracks Shiba Inu’s daily price action since early 2024, presents a visual timeline of its repeated boom-and-bust movements in recent years. The first major phase came in early 2024 when SHIB experienced a rapid one-month surge, its biggest move during the observed period. This move took place in just one month and saw the Shiba Inu price break above $0.00004. However, this bullish stretch was quickly followed by a six-month decline between March and September 2024 that erased much of the gains. The analyst noted that the next significant recovery phase lasted about three months, starting around September 2024 and ending in December, after which SHIB again entered a long-term bearish trend up until the time of writing. This recurring pattern of brief rallies and extended downturns paints a picture of the Shiba Inu price struggling to sustain upward momentum when compared to other cryptocurrencies. What To Expect If The Pattern Continues In his post, IncomeSharks summarized this cycle as “basically a two-year-long bear market that started with a wild pump and one little relief rally.” The statement echoes what the chart above shows: one sharp upward move followed by an extended sequence of red candles. As it stands, Shiba Inu is now into about 11 months of downward price action, making this one of its longest bearish phases to date. If SHIB’s current trajectory remains consistent with the pattern identified by the analyst, the token could face additional months of consolidation or decline before any significant rebound occurs. It also implies that traders hoping for a repeat of any parabolic surges may have to wait longer. Furthermore, Shiba Inu’s biggest uptrend within the two-year frame lasted just one month. This means that the next major bullish movement, whenever it happens, could arrive quickly but fade just as fast within a month if selling pressure resumes. This behavior is not limited to Shiba Inu; it reflects a wider sentiment that has gripped the entire meme coin market over the past year. Even Dogecoin, the king of meme coins, has struggled to maintain its momentum above $0.2 despite multiple attempts to reclaim its earlier highs. Each failed breakout has sent ripples across the meme coin sector, dampening enthusiasm and pulling other tokens like SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI into similar patterns of prolonged correction. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001007, up by 2.8% in the past 24 hours but down 20% in a 30-day timeframe.",Shiba Inu|dogecoin|Floki|IncomeSharks|Pepe|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 01:00:00
53922874,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88357,1762045234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Projection If Ripple Cuts Escrow Supply by 20%,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-projection-if-ripple-cuts-escrow-supply-by-20/,"The possibility of Ripple reducing the XRP escrow by a significant percentage has been a recurring topic among community members. Many investors believe that a supply cut could potentially drive the token’s value higher, while others question whether such an event would produce any measurable market impact. Currently, XRP’s total supply stands at 99.9 billion tokens, with approximately 60 billion in circulation and 35 billion locked in escrow under Ripple’s control. The escrow system was created to release XRP into the market gradually, ensuring a predictable supply and limiting excessive liquidity. However, some community members argue that the large reserve continues to create uncertainty and concerns. Evaluating a Hypothetical Supply Reduction To better understand the potential outcome, Google’s Gemini model was asked to simulate a scenario in which Ripple removes 20% of XRP’s total supply through token burns. The model emphasized that the market response to such a move would ultimately depend on broader factors, including investor sentiment, adoption trends, and regulatory clarity. Under this theoretical case, a 20% reduction would eliminate roughly 19.98 billion XRP, decreasing the total supply to about 79.92 billion tokens. If this burn were applied solely to the escrow holdings, Ripple’s reserve would shrink from 35 billion to about 15 billion XRP, while the circulating supply would remain constant at 60 billion tokens. Short-Term Versus Long-Term Effects According to Gemini’s analysis, the immediate market effect of such a burn would likely be limited because no change would occur in the number of tokens currently traded. However, reducing the future available supply could create favorable long-term dynamics. If market demand for XRP remains steady or grows, a smaller total supply might apply upward pressure on the asset’s valuation over time. Gemini explained that similar patterns have been observed in traditional asset markets, where supply reductions can enhance value provided there is consistent or rising demand. Yet, it also noted that macroeconomic factors, competition among blockchain networks, and investor confidence would heavily influence the outcome. Modeling a Bullish Outcome Gemini further developed a theoretical “high-optimism” case to demonstrate potential price effects under ideal market conditions. This model assumes several supportive factors, sustained adoption of the XRP Ledger, favorable regulatory developments, and broad investor enthusiasm following the burn. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In this scenario, Gemini estimated XRP’s total market capitalization could rise to approximately $4 trillion, representing nearly a 28-fold increase over its current valuation of about $144 billion. Based on a circulating supply of 60 billion XRP, this would translate to an indicative price near $66.67 per token, an increase of over 2,600% from the current price level of around $2.53 Gemini emphasized that these figures are theoretical calculations meant to illustrate potential outcomes rather than actual forecasts. The platform noted that market reactions to supply burns are unpredictable and depend on sentiment and adoption momentum. Supporting this caution, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz previously commented that reducing the total supply might not necessarily raise the token’s price. He referred to the Stellar (XLM) supply burn in 2019, which had little lasting impact on market valuation. While a 20% reduction of Ripple’s escrow could theoretically strengthen XRP’s long-term outlook by lowering available supply, the actual effect would depend on demand-side factors, overall market conditions, and investor behavior. The hypothetical price of $66.67 represents an optimistic case under perfect circumstances rather than a guaranteed projection. Ultimately, analysts agree that although supply mechanics are important, the key drivers of XRP’s value will remain adoption, real-world utility, and broader confidence in the asset’s role within the digital payments ecosystem.

CEO David Baszucki said the plan is to finish the rollout by the end of the year. In his words:- “We’re going to use AI to estimate the age of every single person on Roblox. We expect to have this done all by the end of this year.” This is aimed at dealing with ongoing concerns about minors on the platform and how they interact with others. Investors did not react positively. Roblox stock fell on Friday after the company presented this safety push along with comments about increased spending planned for 2026. Even with that drop, shares are still up more than 93% this year. In the third quarter, Roblox reported revenue of $1.36 billion, which was a 48% jump compared to last year and above estimates of $1.09 billion. But the company also posted a net loss of $257.4 million, compared to $240.4 million last year. Bookings grew 70% year over year, and daily active users were also up 70%. Even with that growth, management warned that higher capital expenses are coming, and that the new facial age estimation system may create what they described as “engagement friction.” Wall Street did not like the sound of that. Analysts highlight risk to engagement metrics JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter rates Roblox Overweight. He said the new facial estimation feature may reduce player usage as users get used to the process. Carpenter wrote, “Facial estimation is the primary safety initiative that could impact engagement next year. Mgmt thinks it’s prudent to expect some initial friction, but it’s hard to quantify at this point.” Roblox has built its model around players spending long periods of time inside its worlds. Any slowdown is something investors will watch closely. Baszucki described the system as part of Roblox’s broader safety framework. He said the company wants to create what he called a “gold standard for communication safety on the internet,” pointing to strict text filters and bans on image or video sharing in chats. He added that the AI age system has already been tested internally. “It’s really quite elegant,” he said. “I’m very optimistic that any friction that we might see from this is actually beneficial to us in the long run.” The company is also under legal pressure. A lawsuit in Florida claimed Roblox did not do enough to prevent minors from encountering harmful content. Roblox has denied these claims. Regulators and lawmakers are also pushing all major platforms to improve age verification and safety tools. Other platforms are moving too. Instagram applies PG-13 restrictions to users under 18. Verification process may create user pushback A third of Roblox’s 150 million daily active users are under 13. That makes safety changes more urgent, but also more complicated. The facial estimation process takes about 30 seconds and requires players to turn on their camera and rotate their head. This could be harder on consoles and mobile devices. Carpenter noted that Roblox users spend an average of 2.5 hours per day on the platform, and any feature that interrupts that routine could weaken engagement. Roblox currently runs more than 400 AI systems across the platform, including systems for generating new game content, moderating chat, and translating languages. The company is also building new data centers to support its AI work. Baszucki said new 4D generative tools are coming that will let users create objects simply by talking. Even with short-term concerns, Carpenter remains positive on the business.He expects bookings to grow 20% next year and believes margins will start improving again by 2027. Carpenter did, however, cut his 2026 price target from $160 to $145. He wrote, “There’s no debate around the near-term platform momentum.” Get seen where it counts.

Based on reports, the analyst used a two-month chart to compare current price action with the buildup that preceded a breakout in March 2017. Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 20% – But Some Think This Is When The Real Gains Start Back then, DOGE climbed from about $0.0003 to $0.0194 by January 2018, a rally of 7%. Traders pointing to that episode say the current narrowing range looks familiar and could set the stage for a notable move. Market Moves This Month DOGE is trading at around $0.18 at the time of writing after a 20% drop so far this October. That decline contrasts with recent Octobers: a 40% rise in October 2024, a 10% gain in October 2023, and a 100% jump in October 2022. Prices have been compressing inside the triangle since late 2024, and the tighter range has increased talk among chart watchers that a breakout may be near. $DOGE/2-month#Dogecoin is following its first cycle 🚀 pic.twitter.com/FNFJo3C59I — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) October 30, 2025 Targets After A Breakout Analysts who favor the pattern point to a first target near $3.90, which would represent about a 2,000% gain from current levels if reached. Other, much bolder projections are also being shared. One chart shown by bulls extends toward $48 — a 26,500% rise — which, if circulating supply stayed near 151 billion tokens, would imply a market value near $7 trillion. That number would dwarf most global asset classes and is widely seen as highly unlikely. Reports have also referenced an $18 forecast last month, a level that would make many holders wealthy if it materialized, but it remains a long shot. Technical Patterns Versus Broader Forces Pattern recognition can offer a clear rule for traders, but charts do not capture everything that drives price. Liquidity levels, investor interest, moves in Bitcoin, and shifts in social attention all affect how far any rally can run.

Why the $NNZ Stage BURN Confirms Noomez Is on the 1000x Path,https://timestabloid.com/next-crypto-to-explode-why-the-nnz-stage-burn-confirms/,"Every cycle has that one token everyone talks about before it takes off. This time, traders say Noomez ($NNZ) could be it. With Stage 2 of its presale now live and the first automatic Stage Burn already underway for unsold tokens, the countdown has started. The project’s mix of deflation, rewards, and transparent mechanics has investors asking a single question: could this be the next crypto to explode before the next market rally begins? Why Noomez ($NNZ) Is Being Called the Next Crypto to Explode Noomez ($NNZ) has entered Stage 2 of its meme coin presale , and momentum is building fast. The project runs on the Binance Smart Chain with a fixed supply of 280 billion tokens , of which 140 billion are reserved for the presale. Prices rise across 28 stages , starting from $0.00001 and ending at $0.0028 , creating a clear, transparent path that rewards early buyers. Each stage lasts up to seven days or until sold out, and any unsold tokens are automatically burned , reducing the circulating supply. One wallet per stage also wins the Stage X Million Airdrop , matching the stage number in millions of $NNZ, for example, 2 million $NNZ in Stage 2 or 28 million in Stage 28 . With this level of structure and deflation, many traders now believe Noomez could answer the question of which crypto will explode in 2025. Stage Burn System: How Noomez Turns Unsold Tokens Into Value One of the most unique features of Noomez ($NNZ) is its Stage Burn system , a built-in mechanism that removes unsold tokens at the end of every stage. This constant reduction in supply keeps the token deflationary and helps strengthen price stability as the presale advances. The Noom Gauge visually tracks progress, lighting up with each completed stage and adding to community excitement. Core mechanics: Automatic burns after each stage closes. Transparent seven-day stage cycle. Fixed rising price curve from $0.00001 to $0.0028. Burn data displayed publicly for verification. By removing excess supply and maintaining a clear structure, Noomez keeps the focus on scarcity and fairness. These mechanics have led traders to call it the next crypto coin to explode , as every stage completion tightens the path toward higher valuations. Vault Events, Stage X Airdrops, and Real Rewards for Holders Vault Events At Stage 14 and Stage 28 , Noomez unlocks special Vaults that deliver massive $NNZ rewards, surprise bonuses, and additional burns. The Stage 28 Vault marks the presale finale, closing with a live one-hour countdown and the biggest prize pool of the campaign. Each Vault also removes a significant portion of tokens from circulation, strengthening the deflationary model. Stage X Airdrops Each presale stage gives one buyer a reward equal to the stage number in millions of $NNZ. This creates 28 total airdrops , ranging from 1 million in Stage 1 to 28 million in Stage 28 , all chosen transparently through random draws. Referral Rewards Noomez also offers a 10% bonus for both the referrer and the buyer on every verified referral. This system rewards community growth, motivates sharing, and ensures that early supporters gain consistent value throughout the presale. Why $NNZ’s Deflationary Design and Staking Model Signal Long-Term Growth The real strength of Noomez ($NNZ) comes after the presale ends. Its staking program allows holders to lock tokens for 30 to 365 days , with higher rewards for longer commitments. These pools are fueled by the Noom Stake reserve and reinforced by the Noom Engine , which will send partner token drops directly to $NNZ holders after launch. Each element is designed to keep activity flowing and discourage early selling. This system connects presale momentum with post-launch value, creating steady engagement instead of short-lived hype. With multiple income streams, a shrinking supply, and an expanding reward base, traders are starting to treat Noomez as more than just a meme coin. Many now see it as the strongest contender for what is the next crypto to explode heading into the next market cycle. Pro Tip: Locking $NNZ in staking pools early may maximize rewards and align you with long-term presale growth.

It’s the classic setup before the next big rally. As Bitcoin ETFs continue attracting inflows and the overall market sentiment turns bullish again, 2025 is gearing up to be a pivotal year for digital assets.

Despite recent indecisive candles, the setup suggests that one strong bullish move could quickly shift sentiment and reignite momentum toward higher targets. Chainlink Faces Mixed Signals As Monthly Candle Closes Bearish In his Chainlink daily technical outlook, crypto analyst CryptoWzrd began by reviewing the higher timeframes, noting that the monthly candle for LINK closed slightly bearish. Additionally, the LINK/BTC pair closed its monthly candle indecisively, reflecting a lack of clear momentum against Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the daily candles for both closed indecisively, setting an ambiguous tone for the near term. Related Reading: Chainlink Eyes 300% Upside As Road To $46 Forms – Analyst CryptoWzrd emphasizes that the LINK/BTC pair must move upside to inject meaningful momentum. For this to happen, LINK/BTC needs to hold above the $0.000170 BTC resistance level, which would generate the initial bullish sentiment required for Chainlink to begin its ascent toward the first major target. If the necessary bullish sentiment is secured, the altcoin is expected to be pushed toward the $20 daily resistance target. The analyst highlights that achieving a healthy bullish breakout above $20 is the critical event that will trigger the next major upside rally and confirm a stronger directional trend. On the other hand, CryptoWzrd identifies the $16 level as the main daily support for the current structure. This price point must hold to prevent a deeper correction that would jeopardize the current bullish targets. The analyst has stated that his focus for the immediate future will shift to the lower timeframe chart formations tomorrow. This micro-analysis will be crucial for identifying the best scalp opportunities as the market continues to consolidate near these critical structural levels. Choppy Intraday Action Keeps Traders On Edge CryptoWzrd went further to reveal that LINK’s intraday chart has been choppy and slow, reflecting bearishness in the market. Despite the lack of strong momentum, the price is still holding above the $16.90 level, which remains a positive sign for the bulls in the short term. Also, the analyst emphasized that a further upside move is necessary to confirm a constructive chart formation and create a potential long opportunity. Related Reading: Chainlink To $100? Analyst Says This Breakout Could Be The Trigger Without that breakout, the structure remains fragile, and traders could face difficulty finding reliable entry points for bullish setups. A drop below $16.90 could trigger a deeper decline, putting additional pressure on Chainlink. CryptoWzrd concluded that patience remains key in navigating the current indecisive phase, as it’s best to wait for the next clear signal or trading setup before making any major moves.

The premier cryptocurrency dropped beneath the psychological $110,000 level despite the interest rate cut decision by the United States Federal Reserve on Wednesday, October 29. The tame reaction of the Bitcoin price—and other large-cap assets—has raised concerns about the viability of the crypto market in the current cycle. Nevertheless, a prominent blockchain firm CEO has predicted that, although the bull cycle might be coming to an end, the market leader might just be days away from a new all-time high price. BTC Could Peak Between $143,000 – $146,000: CEO In an October 31st post on the X platform, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson revealed that the price of Bitcoin could run up to a new all-time high in the short term. The crypto expert put the potential cycle peak for the flagship cryptocurrency at a price between $143,000 and $146,000. This evaluation revolves around the Max Intersect SMA Model (the blue line), which has accurately identified the price peaks of previous BTC cycles. Wedson’s analysis expects the Bitcoin price to soon reach a new all-time high (and the cycle peak), as the cycle is currently in its final stage (the distribution phase). According to the Alphractal CEO, the Bitcoin Smart Model price (the blue line) recently jumped from around $60,000 and now stands at $62,664. Wedson noted that once this Smart Model price gets close to the $68,000 region, that could represent the exact day of a new all-time high for the Bitcoin price. Furthermore, Wedson highlighted the current sideways movement of the Bitcoin price as a result of the market hunting for liquidity up and down during the current distribution phase. “Now, many are afraid to sell, confident we’ll shoot straight to $250K — which, historically, is the classic signature of a distribution phase,” the crypto founder said. Ultimately, Wedson warned that the bear market could arrive sooner than expected; hence, investors should approach the market with caution. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $110,120, reflecting a mere 0.1% increase in the past 24 hours. While the premier cryptocurrency seems to be recovering fairly, the last day’s slight jump is not enough to cover the past week’s loss. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is down by over 1% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 02:30:49

However, this perspective overlooks a more profound truth, and there are two distinct and complementary manifestations of the same enduring monetary revolution. How Bitcoin And Gold Perform Under Different Conditions The narrative behind the ongoing Bitcoin and gold war is often missed. In an X post , Ayni Gold has offered an insightful perspective on the matter, arguing that both assets are value rails with different powers and have been winning in their lanes. Ayni Gold highlighted that adoption is broad on both sides. The Bitcoin network has evolved into a multi-trillion-dollar asset class, with its market capitalization hovering around $2.2 trillion, powered by record ETF inflows this month. Meanwhile, the gold role is strengthening, not fading. Central banks have accumulated heavily through Q3 2025, and expect to continue increasing their reserves over the next five years. Furthermore, the tokenized gold led by XAUT and PAXG has surpassed $2.5 billion in market value . This digital evolution of gold will lower frictions for transfer and fractional access relative to many legacy rails. While it doesn’t erase custodians, it effectively compresses the intermediary stack for more users. The core of this is to stop picking tribes to manage risk . Ayni Gold advocates acquiring both assets and letting them do their job. This suggests a balanced portfolio, with BTC for permissionless, high-beta digital scarcity and global settlement, and gold for durability through macro cycles. Both are different instruments, yet they share the same goal of preserving and maintaining purchasing power. However, Ayni Gold mentioned that they are building practical rails between physical gold and Ethereum so more people can access gold-linked rewards transparently. BTC And Gold As Pillars Of Financial Resilience While Bitcoin and gold have long shared a deep macro correlation, an investor in crypto and blockchain, Batman, has noted that when analyzing Bitcoin and gold performance cycles closely, there tends to be a time lag before BTC catches up with gold. Meanwhile, a closer look at the data over the past two years reveals that the time lag of BTC and gold has consistently ranged between 77 and 98 days. Presently, data shows that gold has rallied for nine weeks straight and is showing signs of topping out after a sustained surge in prices. According to the expert, this move also marks 77 days from when gold started rallying. If the longest time observed lag is around 98 days, then it won’t take long before BTC catches up to gold.",Bitcoin News|Ayni Gold|Batman|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Central Banks|gold|PAXG|xaut,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 04:00:39

Serving as the current head of Product Marketing at the Solana Foundation with a broad experience in web3 technology, Vibhu made this invitation via the X platform, motivating any individual from the XRP community to engage in a “facts-only” discussion. Vibhu criticizes the community for ignoring existing data on the XRP network Norby said his goal is to confront what he views as widespread misconceptions about the XRP network’s actual performance metrics . According to him, he is optimistic about Ripple and XRP succeeding in the ecosystem. However, Vibhu criticized the community for ignoring existing data that illustrates limited growth. He acknowledged that although it is fine to believe in future adoption, the current on-chain information implies otherwise. The crypto leader’s remarks noted years of stagnation in XRP’s network activity, in contrast to fast-growing blockchains such as Solana. Citing data from XRPScan, Vibhu highlighted that the total number of daily active accounts on the XRP Ledger over the last three years has remained around 25,000. His statement followed a recent announcement that Evernorth, a new venture in the crypto industry backed by digital asset firm Ripple, has been listed on Nasdaq. Following this announcement, analysts believe the listing will expand XRP’s footprint among institutional investors. Meanwhile, in contrast to XRP’s daily active accounts, Solana reportedly has over 2.5 million daily active accounts, illustrating a notable difference. Based on Vibhu’s argument, this situation has sparked heated debates, as XRP has been in the market for a long time and has a valuable ecosystem. The CEO also shared statistics illustrating the XRP Ledger’s daily transactions, which showed that the blockchain processes approximately 1 million to 1.5 million transactions daily. Sources commented that this figure has only surged slightly over time. When comparing the transaction figure with that of Solana, the sources that wished to remain anonymous mentioned that Solana’s daily transactions amount to about 100 million. Regarding the results, Vibhu argued that this comparison underscores how much more active Solana’s network has become in real-world applications. Vibhu expresses optimism about Ripple and XRP succeeding in the ecosystem In an X post dated November 1, Vibhu expressed that he wants Ripple and XRP to achieve a remarkable milestone, allowing the entire industry to progress. Afterwards, he stated that the community usually ignores facts even when the data is easily accessible. He admitted finding this frustrating as someone who has served as an engineer for a long time and is seeking the truth. In the meantime, after researching, analysts discovered that XRP transfers total approximately $50 billion to $60 billion monthly. In comparison, data from Blockworks, cited by Vibhu, showed that Solana’s stablecoin transfer volume nearly reached $2 trillion in October. Despite these figures, XRP Ledger’s native token, XRP, ended the third quarter on a strong note as it closed at an all-time high of $2.85, up 27.2% quarter-over-quarter. Its circulating market capitalization rose 29% to $170.3 billion, outperforming the combined 13.3% gain in market cap posted by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana over the same period. Nonetheless, the token’s momentum cooled in October as broader market sentiment turned negative following hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. XRP has plunged by 12% over the past month, dropping to around $2.50 amid heavy selling pressure. This event fueled discussions on the reasons underpinning XRP’s value and utility in the real world. Popular trader and analyst Scott Melker, also known as The Wolf of All Streets, questioned the purpose of the crypto. Then the analyst obtained information that SWIFT and Western Union do not employ this currency, which implies that it is not a crucial alternative. However, XRP defenders appear to be unaffected by the bearish warning, describing the coin as a “neutral bridge” for use in audits. In brief, Melker recognized the currency as a temporary structure but did not believe in its long-term potential.

The company highlighted the development in a brief post. The data showed a sharp rise in institutional participation in a market launched only months ago. The surge in volume demonstrates that interest in regulated XRP derivatives has moved beyond novelty and into active market use. When CME first introduced XRP futures in May 2025 , initial trading was measured in the thousands of contracts. By the first month, over 24,000 contracts had been traded . Within five months, that figure has scaled significantly, suggesting that the product has found consistent liquidity and a growing pool of counterparties willing to engage through regulated infrastructure. 9.9K XRP futures contracts traded on October 27, a new record.

These contracts clear through CME Clearing, ensuring that all counterparties trade within a regulated, risk-managed environment. The exchange has also expanded its offering with options on XRP futures, introduced in October. This addition enables more sophisticated trading strategies, providing flexibility for institutions seeking to manage volatility or hedge positions tied to XRP. The inclusion of both futures and options makes XRP one of the few cryptocurrencies with a complete derivatives suite on a U.S.-regulated exchange.

The availability of regulated derivatives often signals that institutional traders are treating the asset as a legitimate market instrument rather than a speculative token. The strong performance of CME’s XRP futures also indicates that the market is ready for spot XRP ETFs . Their steady volume, transparent pricing, and institutional participation demonstrate sufficient maturity, liquidity, and oversight to justify the approval of a regulated spot product. CME’s expansion into XRP derivatives has created a gateway for traditional financial institutions to engage with the asset class in a compliant manner. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF is already making waves in the market, and with CME’s XRP futures breaking records, the SEC may find growing justification to advance approval for additional spot XRP ETF applications awaiting review.

Leaves fall, chart lines climb, and portfolios wake up like they had a triple espresso. Every cycle, there is a moment when the market stops yawning and starts itching like a mosquito bite you cannot ignore. That moment looks like right now. Traders are scanning charts, crypto Twitter is cooking, and whispers are growing louder around one tiny mosquito-themed memecoin sneaking toward the next 100x crypto in Q4 crown. Meanwhile, familiar meme heavyweights stretch their paws, wings, and feathers as the market heats up. This list is not for the weak pockets or sleepy fingers. It is for those who track sentiment, meme momentum, community traction, and real token mechanics. In Q4 2025, one thing is clear. Dogs may bark, frogs may ribbit, but the mosquito is buzzing and wallets are itching. So buckle up. Time to walk through 10 coins to watch and La Culex , with one tiny troublemaker flying ahead as the next 100x crypto in Q4 contender that nobody wants to swat away. 1. La Culex: The Tiny Biter With Big Plans and a Swarm Growing Fast While other memes roar, La Culex hums in the shadows and bites where it counts. The project positions itself as the mosquito of crypto and leans into the identity with comic power and practical mechanics. The La Culex presale comes packed with staking, referral rewards, and token burns, creating a combo of humor and economic value. That blend gives the Culex presale a unique sting. Instead of depending only on memes and vibes, the La Culex price structure rewards early conviction and provides a model that encourages long-term participation. That formula is how strong meme runs often begin. This buzzing token sits in Stage 3, the Bug Spray Dip, with a La Culex price of $0.00002274. Over 50 holders already joined the swarm and more than 400 million tokens are sold with a presale tally above $8,000. A scheduled jump of roughly 8.091 percent takes the price to $0.00002458 soon. With a projected listing price of $0.007, La Culex currently stands at a staggering 30,683 percent theoretical upside from where it sits today if its targets hit. Early support already shows 16.8 percent growth before full public expansion. A $5,500 allocation unlocks nearly 241,890,000 CULEX tokens, and at listing those tokens translate to roughly $1,692,960 potential based on projected price. That level of upside is why traders are whispering about this mosquito and calling it the next 100x crypto in Q4 before the swarm becomes too large to stop. 2. Dogecoin: The Meme Grandfather That Still Wags Strong Dogecoin still stands as the original crypto comedian. It built culture before culture became a metric in token valuation. Despite years in the arena, it keeps surprising markets with renewed strength during bull phases. Dogecoin’s community behavior has proven time and time again that memes do not lose power. They mature. The dog continues to run with the pack, but with a golden-retriever type of confidence that says: “Relax. We bark when it counts.” Beyond its humor, Dogecoin benefits from massive brand trust and global awareness. Every cycle, new traders rediscover its charm and buy in, while long-time holders celebrate a familiar pattern. The coin does not pretend to be anything but itself. In a market full of over-engineered promises, the simplicity becomes its strength. Dogecoin may not be the next 100x crypto in Q4, but it still plays like a veteran striker who knows exactly when to attack the goal. 3. Shiba Inu: The Pack Leader With an Ecosystem Mindset Shiba Inu holds community power like few others. The ShibArmy built a culture that feels more like a digital nation than a token group. From decentralized applications and DeFi tools to layer expansion and burning strategies, Shiba Inu evolved into a serious ecosystem in the meme world. The passion behind the project creates consistent momentum, especially when market sentiment turns bullish. As traders gear up for seasonal runs, SHIB positions itself as a reliable force that charges hard when momentum flows. The community amplifies market moves and rallies with conviction. Shiba Inu may not race toward the next 100x crypto in Q4, but it could lead the early marches and ignite wide meme participation. When retail enthusiasm returns, Shiba typically sits near the front of the parade. 4. Pepe: The Frog With Wild Market Reflexes Pepe entered the market like a meme predator emerging from the bushes. It jumped, leaped, and croaked its way into massive liquidity storms early in its lifecycle. The internet culture gave it wings, and traders gave it markets. This token represents raw Web3 humor and unpredictable acceleration potential during high-sentiment phases. Pepe fits the mold of a meme with bite, not bark. Even now, traders watch it closely because Pepe has a knack for surprising the charts when attention spikes. Its brand sticks across platforms and communities, making it a reliable volatility play in the right environment. Pepe may not take the next 100x crypto in Q4 crown, but it stays ready to sprint the second meme volume rises. 5. Official Trump: The Nothing-Is-Calm Coin Official Trump rides the digital energy of politics, and politics never sleeps. Controversy fuels engagement, and engagement fuels crypto moves. Whether someone loves or hates the theme, they still talk about it, share memes about it, and debate the sentiment around it. That alone broadcasts strong viral fuel for market activity. Every election cycle or major policy moment creates more conversation around this token. In a space where eyes equal liquidity, Official Trump sits positioned for narrative bursts. It may not chase the crown for the next 100x crypto in Q4 , but it certainly will not sit quietly in a bull cycle. It is built for engagement, and engagement runs markets. 6. Bonk: Solana’s Hyper Mascot With Speed Bonk thrives on Solana’s velocity and community rhythm. Where the Solana ecosystem pumps, Bonk follows, powered by culture and chain loyalty. The mascot energy gives this token personality, and personality matters in meme market psychology. Bonk shows stamina across cycles while pushing fresh bursts during bullish sentiment. Two things make Bonk compelling. First, Solana continues climbing in developer and trading adoption, according to reports from Electric Capital and Messari. Second, chain loyalty rallies often start with mascot tokens. Bonk stands strong, and while it may not match the next 100x crypto in Q4 potential of La Culex, it continues to swing loud in meme season. 7. Floki: Branding Muscle Everywhere You Look Floki made marketing a personality trait. Billboards, sponsorships, sports ads, social campaigns, and global visibility made the mascot recognizable far outside crypto echo chambers. It carries structured branding power while still holding meme personality. The mix turns Floki into an evergreen meme option when markets heat. Floki’s push toward utility and expansion, according to updates shared on its documentation and dev channels, gives long-term holders reason to stay confident. The token does not need chaos to rally. It needs attention, and Q4 is rarely slow on attention. While it might not take the next 100x crypto in Q4 crown, it has one of the strongest public brand foundations in meme culture. 8. Dogwifhat: The Hat That Became Iconic Dogwifhat rose as an aesthetic token. A dog in a hat sounds simple, but it formed a visual identity that stuck online. In crypto, identity is half the battle. This meme thrives on creative energy and Solana enthusiasm. As momentum builds, traders often rotate into this type of playful yet strong-culture coin. In bull conditions, social image tokens shine. Dogwifhat holds that advantage. And while La Culex builds utility and narrative to chase the next 100x crypto in Q4 , Dogwifhat holds its hat proudly waiting for markets to heat and memers to assemble again. 9. Pudgy Penguins: The Web3 Plush King Pudgy Penguins bring real-world crossover strength. Toys, partnerships, physical brand presence, and online identity blend into a hybrid crypto-retail movement. That allows this token to perform even outside pure crypto volatility cycles. The penguin community loves storytelling and creative culture, making it unique in the list. This token does not chase chaotic meme swings. It builds presence. That stability gives it long-term staying power. While not the wild candidate for next 100x crypto in Q4, Pudgy Penguins still slide into bull seasons with smooth confidence and brand charm. 10. Brett: The “I Came to Cause Chaos” Coin With Cult Volume Brett stormed its way into the meme arena with pure attitude and relentless conviction from its fanbase. It did not arrive shy or polite. It rolled in like someone kicked open the digital door and yelled “vibes only” before dancing across charts. Traders gravitated to Brett because it embraced chaos with personality, not confusion. It knew it was a meme, but it carried itself with confidence like a humorous heavyweight. With every new volatile stretch of the market, attention naturally comes back to Brett, because unpredictable tokens with personality tend to shine hardest when the market starts heating. Conclusion: Swarms Win Markets, and New Blood Moves Fast Crypto bull seasons turn into stampedes. Coins run, traders sprint, and memes evolve into million-dollar stories. The list above highlights every flavor of momentum: classics, mascots, culture builders, chaos magnets, and one mosquito with a sharp stinger. Each coin brings fire when market heat returns, but only one is still in presale positioning itself to become the next 100x crypto in Q4 with swarm momentum and structured token mechanics. La Culex does not try to bark louder than dog memes or dress in silly hats. It takes a different route: bite first, reward believers, burn tokens for strength, and stack referral swarm mechanics like a mosquito hive taking over a summer lake house. With price stages rising every few days and the La Culex presale filling faster than ankles during camping nights, timing matters more than hype. The La Culex price sits at mosquito-size but dreams in swarm scale. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official CULEX Website Telegram: Join the CULEX Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow CULEX ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About the Next 100x Crypto in Q4 What makes La Culex different from other meme coins? La Culex stands out due to actual token mechanics including staking rewards, referral incentives, and planned burns. Instead of relying only on memes, it builds loyalty loops and supply reduction, allowing early swarm members to stack position strength before full market attention arrives. Why do meme coins gain momentum during bull markets? Bull runs trigger increased retail participation and viral investor behavior. Meme coins thrive when culture meets liquidity. When sentiment rises, humor spreads, communities pile in, and speculative capital flows into tokens that offer story plus emotional energy. Is La Culex early in its journey? Yes. The La Culex presale is still in early stages with stage-based price jumps. This means early buyers receive lower entry points before the La Culex price increases and the public listing approaches. Early networks usually create higher upside potentials. Glossary Meme Coin A cryptocurrency driven by community and internet culture instead of traditional financial fundamentals. Presale A token sale before public listing where early participants enter at lower price stages. Token Burns Permanent removal of tokens from supply to increase scarcity and strengthen economics over time. Staking Locking tokens to earn rewards, support network activity, or participate in ecosystem incentives. Community Momentum Market power generated by active meme culture, social media participation, and viral appeal. Summary This editorial compares La Culex with leading meme coins and highlights why it may rise as the next 100x crypto in Q4. The article describes bull market behavior, meme coin psychology, and cultural power in crypto cycles. It explains La Culex token mechanics including staking, referrals, burns, and presale stage growth. It also analyzes Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Official Trump, Bonk, Floki, Dogwifhat, Pudgy Penguins, and Brett through meme momentum, brand strength, and liquidity behavior while positioning La Culex as the only early-phase entry with utility plus viral branding. Tone stays fun, meme-centric, and energetic while maintaining clarity and investment transparency. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

She used this sentiment to convey that the soon-to-be-launched central bank digital currency would be a powerful tool to promote financial independence and facilitate payments within the European Union. According to the statement, the ECB would guarantee that anyone in Europe could have access to public money, now that payments are more digitized. The full text of her remarks was published online. She explained that the digital euro would coexist with physical cash rather than replace it. According to Lagarde, the currency forms would be used together to ensure maximum payment coverage and inclusion. The digital euro would enable citizens across the continent to make instant online and offline payments, either quickly or at no charge, in all member states. According to the ECB, the initiative aims to provide a publicly owned alternative to private payment providers such as Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Pay. ECB pushes digital euro for unity and trust The president emphasized that Europe should establish a timetable that enables it to maintain its position in the digital world and reduce its reliance on non-European banking and other systems. In the latter part of October 2025, the Governing Council of the ECB convened and decided to proceed with the “preparation phase,” where the technical blueprint for the E-euro will be created. Such activities, according to the president, involve setting up computing systems, securing infrastructure, and implementing robust privacy safeguards, which allow individuals to transact freely and securely. At a related news conference on Wednesday, Fabio Panetta, an ECB Executive Board member in charge of the project, emphasized that the digital euro will offer privacy at least as strong as that of existing electronic payments. There is no reason to be concerned that the currency would remove liquidity from commercial banks, according to the bank. The ECB has stated that the digital euro may supplement private banks by providing a secure means of digital central bank money for everyday use. At that time, the ECB aims to launch the digital euro by 2027, with full deployment possible by 2029, depending on lawmakers’ ability to pass the necessary legislation. During the pilot project, alternative scenarios will be played. These scenarios include transfers from one individual to another, offline transactions, and cross-border transactions, all of which will be carried out within the Eurozone. According to the initial estimates on pricing, the project could be worth approximately €1.3 billion to develop and test, with annual operating costs of around €320 million. Currently, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are considering a bill that would enable the ECB to issue its own digital currency. Despite skepticism about privacy, security, and financial stability, Lagarde believes that stringent data security measures, combined with the public’s trust in the ECB, will support the integrity of the system. Most importantly, Lagarde argues that the digital euro will support user preferences rather than regulation. Critics challenge the ECB over digital control Critics in the crypto space argue that such systems run counter to the decentralization ethos, and that creating a central bank digital currency enables real-time surveillance of your payments. Analysts believe that totalitarian governments will soon emerge, possessing excessive control over their citizens’ ability to spend money. Last week, French conservative Éric Ciotti submitted a bill to ban the e-euro and advocate for Bitcoin as a moneyless alternative. Similarly, Alternative für Deutschland called on aficionados to e-petition Parliament to designate Bitcoin a vital national priority. Lagarde said the bank’s goal is to offer users an option to make and receive euro-based payments that are inclusive, confidential, and distinctly European.

Wallets can wait,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/web3-gaming-without-barriers-starts-instantly-with-sachi-fun-comes-first-wallets-can-wait/,"[Dubai, UAE] For years, one of the single biggest hurdles to the mainstream adoption of Web3 gaming has been the wallet setup stage. Many attempts to pick up token-based games stalled at this stage for many reasons. The combination of seed phrases, extensions, and token transfers can quickly become overwhelming for newcomers, who are immediately overloaded with some of these wallet operations. In most cases, some never even make it as far as actually playing the game, getting turned off by the wall of technicality guarding the game. SACHI, the immersive Web3 competitive gaming universe, is helping users scale this barrier completely using an onboarding system designed to seamlessly transition users to Web3 proficiency using a completely invisible bridge that appears no different from the Web2 interface they are familiar with . Instead of asking players to connect a wallet before they play, SACHI flips the script: jump in first, enjoy the game, and only connect when you’re ready. This seamless approach puts fun ahead of friction, making “try SACHI” a realistic and inviting option for anyone, even those unfamiliar with crypto. Play Now, Wallet Later In SACHI, players can open the platform instantly thanks to pixel streaming . No installs, no downloads, and no wallet required. Whether on a phone, laptop, or tablet, players are greeted with polished Unreal Engine 5 gameplay from the moment they start the game.

Of course, players who enjoy the game and want to unlock the full range of the SACHI Web3 ecosystem, including social features and token rewards, can then choose to connect their crypto wallet. This mainstream-friendly onboarding design makes SACHI more accessible to: Casual gamers who want to enjoy the game before any commitments. Curious Web2 users who need the right opportunity to be onboarded into crypto. Partners and creators who want to share instant “click-to-play” experiences with their communities. By removing complexity from the entry point, SACHI positions itself as the most mainstream-friendly Web3 platform on the market. Web3’s Next Big Onboarding Event Hamster Kombat was all the rave in 2024 because it delivered on the simplicity that mainstream gamers could get down with. It doesn’t get more straightforward than click, play, enjoy. SACHI is taking it even further, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry and exponentially ramping up the Web3 rewards. For the first time, the focus switches from the unnecessary technicality barriers limiting Web3-based gaming to the token benefits and governance rewards users can unlock when they’re ready to explore blockchain technology. Beyond Web3-curious players who are drawn to SACHI’s technicality-free game model, players without any Web3 interests can simply enjoy smooth gameplay built on Unreal Engine 5 on their phones, laptops, or tablets. “Our goal was simple: make Web3 as inconspicuous as possible,” said Jonas Martisius, CEO of SACHI. “Players should feel the magic of SACHI first. The wallets, tokens, and on-chain mechanics can come later, when they’re ready to explore deeper. This is how Web3 gaming grows mainstream.” Start playing SACHI in seconds, no wallet, no setup, just instant entrance into the Immersive Gaming World. When you’re ready, your Web3 journey will be waiting.

Aljarrah’s statement suggested that XRP’s evolution is already beyond retail market speculation. It now focuses instead on its institutional trajectory. Aljarrah wrote, “For the IMF to adopt an asset, sovereign nations must adopt it first.” He followed this with a reference to Ripple’s future holdings, adding that once the company lowers its XRP below the “Clarity Act threshold,” it would “open the door for global use without risk.” He concluded, “That’s how XRP becomes a global reserve asset where its price isn’t discovered, it’s set.” For the IMF to adopt an asset, sovereign nations must adopt it first. Once Ripple lowers its $XRP holdings below the Clarity Act threshold, it opens the door for global use without risk. That’s how $XRP becomes a global reserve asset where its price isn’t discovered, it’s set. https://t.co/SqnKPXlqt1 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 31, 2025 The Shift from Speculation to Systemic Use Aljarrah’s post builds on ideas he expressed in 2022, asserting that XRP’s value had already been determined . He argued that global financial institutions and central banks had agreed on XRP’s role long before retail markets understood its purpose. The logic follows the model of traditional markets, where institutional investors negotiate valuations before a company goes public. In XRP’s case, Aljarrah drew parallels to a “pre-IPO” stage that occurred behind the scenes with major banks and financial authorities. He maintained that XRP, as a bridge currency and liquidity instrument, was already being positioned within global financial frameworks. This process, according to him, extends beyond speculation and enters the realm of structured financial planning among sovereign and institutional participants. Institutional Control and the Next Phase Aljarrah tied XRP’s role to the World Economic Forum’s concept of Stakeholder Capitalism, a system in which central banks and large financial entities coordinate to shape the monetary order. He claimed that these institutions have already integrated Ripple’s technology within early-stage systems across several regions, suggesting that XRP’s price and utility are linked to global liquidity needs rather than market volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The central point of his latest post is that global adoption depends on regulatory clarity and Ripple’s reduced control over XRP’s supply. Ripple’s holdings dropping below the threshold that defines significant influence would allow the asset to function within the same frameworks governing sovereign monetary systems. What This Means for XRP’s Future If Aljarrah’s assessment proves accurate, XRP’s next phase would mark a transition from market-driven valuation to institutional utility pricing. The “set” price he references implies a model in which central banks and transnational entities determine XRP’s value through contractual use rather than open-market discovery. Aljarrah’s argument reinforces the notion that XRP’s future will be decided by policy and integration, not by retail sentiment. He sees this evolution as a necessary step toward establishing XRP as a neutral settlement layer for cross-border finance.

Yet, Bitcoin’s next move will depend on whether it can confirm a breakout above the 100-day MA or hold the 200-day MA as structural support. Until one side of this equilibrium breaks, the market remains in accumulation and consolidation mode, with volatility compression likely preceding the next major impulse move. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin has been oscillating between the 100-day MA near $114K and the 200-day MA around $109K, creating a well-defined equilibrium zone. The repeated rebounds from the 200-day MA signal that the $108K–$109K area continues to attract institutional demand, while the $114K–$116K range serves as a strong distribution zone. This structure highlights the market’s current state of balance between buyers and sellers. The ongoing stabilization phase could represent an accumulation pattern, as shown by the clustered price action between the two key moving averages. A confirmed daily close above the 100-day MA would likely trigger a breakout toward $120K–$122K, while a breakdown below $108K could expose the $102K–$104K institutional demand zone once again. Improving macro sentiment from the FOMC’s dovish policy pivot and the U.S.–China cooperation framework could support a bullish continuation if on-chain and volume metrics confirm accumulation. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour timeframe reinforces the range-bound nature of Bitcoin’s recent behavior. The price has repeatedly reacted from the $108K–$109K support zone, forming higher lows and attempting to reclaim short-term structure. However, the $115K–$116K resistance band remains a ceiling that has capped multiple upward attempts. This setup outlines a symmetrical consolidation within an ascending structure, suggesting that volatility is tightening before a potential breakout. A bullish breakout above $116K could mark a structural shift toward $120K–$122K, while a failure to hold the $108K area would confirm a deeper retest toward the $102K liquidity pocket. Until either side of the range is breached, the market is expected to oscillate between these levels, with low volatility preceding the next expansion. On-Chain Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin Active Addresses offers an important signal about market participation and network health. Over recent months, the number of active addresses has gradually declined, even as Bitcoin’s price maintained its position near record highs. Historically, such a decline in on-chain activity often reflects market fatigue or short-term distribution, particularly following extended rallies. However, the current level of activity, while subdued, remains above the 2024 accumulation baseline, implying that the market is not experiencing full capitulation. Periods of reduced address activity near key support levels have often preceded large-scale accumulation and trend reversals, as seen in late 2023 and mid-2024. If active address growth stabilizes while price holds the $108K–$110K support range, it would strengthen the case for an accumulation-driven bottom formation, aligning with the macro environment of increased global liquidity and improving investor sentiment after the Fed’s rate cut.

While the recent bounce from support suggests short-term buyers are still present, the price remains trapped in a range without clear bullish conviction. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair On the USDT pair, XRP is hovering around $2.50, still below the confluence of the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. After the sharp liquidation wick into the demand zone, the asset bounced quickly but failed to break back above the key resistance near $2.60. The RSI has also flattened out around 45, reflecting weak momentum and a lack of strong bullish drive. Unless the price reclaims the moving averages and breaks above the $2.60–$2.75 zone with volume, the path of least resistance remains sideways to slightly bearish. Regardless, a return to the support level around $2.20 would offer a better risk-reward for buyers. The BTC Pair Looking at the XRPBTC chart, the price remains under pressure after multiple failed attempts to reclaim key resistance levels. It’s currently trading around 2,270 sats, stuck below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. This entire structure has been a prolonged accumulation or distribution range, depending on how it resolves. While the bounce off the 2,000 sat zone shows buyers are still defending key long-term support, there’s little follow-through to suggest strength. The RSI at 47 indicates a neutral momentum, but unless a clean break above 2,500 sats with high volume occurs, XRP continues to lag against Bitcoin.

However, there are some warning signs on the DOGE horizon, such as whales disposing of large quantities of the asset. $0.18 looks like a strong buy-the-dip zone for Dogecoin $DOGE before a potential run toward $0.26 or $0.33. pic.twitter.com/LltHHiRFMR — Ali (@ali_charts) November 1, 2025 Ali Martinez has repeatedly outlined the significance of the $0.18 support. It doubled down earlier today, indicating that it could serve as a price propeller if DOGE remains above it and could actually be used as a “strong buy-the-dip zone.” The analyst with over 161,000 followers on X predicted another price surge to $0.26 or even $0.33 if this support holds. It’s worth noting that DOGE exceeded the first target twice in September and October but hasn’t reached the second since January. Its latest rejection came during the October 10 bloodbath when it plunged from $0.23 to $0.15 within hours. It has since maintained a value above $0.18, despite testing it on a couple of occasions. However, the resistance at $0.22 has capped its progress. What’s particularly worrisome about DOGE’s perspective is whales’ behavior. These large market participants sold 440 million DOGE in just three days last week, intensifying the immediate selling pressure and potentially signaling market capitulation to smaller investors. Dogecoin’s RSI, a metric showing the underlying asset’s overbought or oversold condition, doesn’t offer much insight into its next move. It’s currently at 46, which is essentially a neutral zone, without any significant indication of what’s to follow.

The agreement was reached during a high-level meeting between the Bank of Korea and the People’s Bank of China in Seoul. South Korea’s presidential office stated that it would now exchange its national currency, the won, and the Chinese yuan within the existing limits. The swap line was developed to stabilize the financial market, trade transactions, and ensure liquidity during times of crisis. It replaces a previous agreement that expired in October 2025. Seoul authorities believe the strategic swap line would help reduce the usage of the US dollar in Asian deals. The move aligns with a broader trend across Asia, where countries are seeking to reduce their reliance on the US dollar in trade and financial transactions. Similar initiatives have been observed between China and other BRICS members, as well as between ASEAN economies, in their efforts to strengthen regional payment frameworks. Such patterns are emerging due to growing confidence in their national currencies and concerns that external monetary turbulence may harm their national economies. Analysts say this is a vital agreement, as all countries globally face multiple global economic challenges, including differences in energy costs, declining growth, and currency fluctuations. Through more substantial yuan-won connections, Beijing and Seoul wish to integrate their economies more effectively and foster assurance between their central monetary authorities. Leaders pledge broader cooperation The currency swap was one of the six memorandums of understanding signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to South Korea, his first since taking office 11 years ago. State President Lee Jae-myung welcomed Xi in Seoul on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, to expand economic cooperation beyond their four-day-long meeting, which also sought to bolster mutual trust. These agreements encompass economic and trade, services and digital economy, agriculture and related sectors, as well as amendments to quarantine policies concerning Korean produce. Additionally, they will accelerate their collaboration in combating online and telecom fraud and prioritize collaboration within the silver economy. President Xi hailed the collaboration as marking a new phase of mutual trust and shared development. At the same time, President Lee added that a closer partnership would help build a stronger foundation for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. The two leaders also discussed ways to revitalize the Korea-China Free Trade Agreement, which has performed poorly compared to other trade agreements, while expanding their joint investments in clean energy, green technology, and semiconductor production. For South Korea , the currency swap also adds stability to its foreign exchange reserves, which have been shaky due to global monetary contraction. The Bank of Korea explained that the agreement would eliminate the possibility of temporary liquidity shortages and promote financial cooperation in the region. Economists agree that this agreement broadens Asia’s financial safety net and creates conditions for similar trade agreements within the region. In such a context, last year’s agreement by Seoul to renew the $10 billion won-dollar swap line with Tokyo is a positive sign. Region faces shifting strategic dynamics The revitalization of economic partnership with China comes at a time when regional geopolitics is shifting in a new direction. This has left Seoul straddling between age-old ties with China, its largest trading partner, and a deepening strategic partnership with Washington and Tokyo. Park Sung-hoon, an economist at Korea University, said the swap was a genuine response from the South to maintain multilateral financial routes. The analyst suggested that it served as a “plan B” in case of a deterioration in relations with China or the United States. He said the agreement demonstrated economic independence and strategic thinking, keeping in mind that the dollar “does not have Korea in chains” anymore. For China, meanwhile, flawed regional economic performance and the need to consolidate its regional role encourage pragmatic diplomacy. The revival of Chinese exchange lines, for example, is one component of enhanced integration into Asian economies amid slowing exports and persistent pressure on the property sector.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-locks-700-million-xrp-back-in-escrow-heres-what-is-next/,"Ripple’s monthly escrow routine has again captured the attention of market participants. According to on-chain tracking platform Whale Alert, 700 million XRP, worth roughly $1.75 billion, was locked in escrow within hours following the release of 1 billion XRP on November 1. The alerts showed two separate transactions. The first transaction involved 500 million XRP, and the second locked 200 million XRP. These transactions occurred after Ripple moved 500 million XRP to unknown wallets in quick succession. Another notable part of this sequence is that Ripple has yet to perform its monthly escrow release. The company typically unlocks 1 billion XRP from escrow at the start of each month, a pattern it has maintained for years. As of press time, that release has not occurred, creating speculation among market observers about whether the schedule will proceed as usual. How Ripple’s Escrow System Works Ripple introduced its escrow system in December 2017 to ensure transparency and predictability in the XRP supply. The company placed 55 billion XRP, which is just over half of the total supply, into a series of escrow accounts on the XRP Ledger. Each month, 1 billion tokens are released automatically , providing Ripple with liquidity for partnerships, institutional sales, and ecosystem incentives. Any unused XRP from these monthly releases is customarily returned to new escrows, extending the overall timeline. This mechanism limits the amount of XRP entering circulation at any given time while maintaining confidence that Ripple cannot suddenly flood the market. The locking transactions reported by Whale Alert align with this long-standing process. However, the absence of the usual 1 billion unlock so far has prompted attention within the community. The escrow system has faced delays , but Ripple usually makes up before the end of the month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? XRP’s price has traded steadily despite the escrow developments. The asset is trading at $2.51, up 0.41% from yesterday, and holding strong despite the recent decline . The company’s practice of re-locking unused XRP has helped prevent sudden liquidity shocks, and the transparency of these escrow movements remains a key aspect of investor trust. Many experts believe Ripple’s escrow system protects XRP’s price , and sticking to the schedule by unlocking 1 billion tokens could help reinforce the confidence of market participants. For now, the company’s decision to lock 700 million XRP with the delayed release stands out as one of the more interesting recent shifts in its long-running monthly cycle.

The figure represents an 85.7% fall from September’s $127.06 million total. Garden Finance, Typus Finance, and Abracadabra suffered the heaviest blows, contributing $16.2 million to the overall losses. As a result, the report indicates that October was one of the less tumultuous months for crypto-related breaches, reflecting improved protocol security. Hackers stole over $10 million from Garden Finance Garden Finance’s team announced on October 30 that attackers had stolen over $10 million through a solver breach . Though the hack was isolated to the solver’s inventory, it still bumped October’s overall losses. Without that incident, the tally would have stayed around $7.18 million — the lowest monthly loss since early 2023. By contrast, earlier months of 2025 saw multiple multi-million-dollar attacks targeting decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and cross-chain protocols, driving the year’s cumulative total losses past the $1 billion mark by mid-year. Sui-based yield platform Typus Finance was also the victim of an oracle manipulation attack , which drained off as much as $3.4 million on October 15th. The exploit was later linked to a flaw in a TLP contract, causing its native token to tumble by 35%. Around the same time, Abracadabra, a DeFi lending platform, was hit by yet another exploit — its third overall — which cost it about $1.8 million in MIM tokens. The attack was down to a smart contract bug that allowed the thieves to bypass capital verification. Although the number of hack losses fell in October, analysts believe it is too early for the industry to be complacent. They noted that hackers are still perfecting new techniques, and some attacking groups, especially those linked to North Korea, are even trying to insert malware directly into blockchain systems. By early October, North Korean hackers had already stolen more than $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency this year, according to Elliptic. Intelligence agencies disclosed that at least some part of this could well be slated for the country’s nuclear and missile programs. More traders trust crypto as much as traditional banks Despite ongoing incidents of crypto losses, user confidence in digital assets continues to rise. The latest survey from the National Cryptocurrency Association found that 76% of participants now trust cryptocurrency as much as, or even more than, traditional banks. However, while public confidence in cryptocurrencies has undoubtedly been on the rise, many analysts still doubt their value as investments. Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, likened purchasing crypto to placing an NFL bet. He said the assets were all made out of thin air and that their value depended largely on popular interest in the technology itself. Amanda Fischer, COO of Better Markets, also expressed concern over the absence of the kind of market oversight that governs traditional investments. She cautioned that even when crypto ETFs are purchased through banks or brokerages, the underlying assets themselves remain unregulated. She asked crypto traders to: “Treat any cryptocurrency investment like you would any sort of budget for sports betting or gambling; only put up what you can afford to lose.” She also warned that crypto is an “attractive honeypot for hackers,” given how easily it can be stolen and subsequently laundered. Following a turbulent year of high-value exploits, October’s steep drop in crypto hack losses is a promising development for the industry; yet, it remains to be seen whether this decrease represents long-term stability or temporary respite.

However, analysts are now cautious. They warn that Bitcoin (BTC) could face a 20% correction before the next major altcoin boom. While short-term sentiment looks cautious, experts believe this pullback could fuel capital rotation into high-utility projects like Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi solution that’s fast becoming a top contender for 2025’s biggest breakout. Bitcoin Price Prediction Signals Pre Altcoin Boom Correction The BTC price today sits around $110,000, with analysts warning that a deeper correction could be on the horizon before the next major rally. Despite a supportive rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bitcoin price action remains sluggish, ending October down 3.7% — its weakest “Uptober” since 2018. ETF outflows totaling over $670 million last week show institutions reducing exposure, dampening bullish momentum. Many experts believe the current weakness could precede a healthy reset before an altcoin boom, with projects like Remittix (RTX) poised to benefit from renewed retail capital. Technical indicators show tightening Bollinger Bands, signaling an explosive move is imminent. Analysts warn that a decline to the levels of around $95,000–$100,000 would be consistent with a healthy 20% correction in bullish markets. In the meantime, long-term traders are still hopeful about the broader cycle. They believe that Bitcoin price prediction targets in the $150,000 range will stay intact once the pullback is over. Remittix Leads Altcoin Buzz As Bitcoin Pullback Looms While Bitcoin prepares for what analysts warn could be a 20% pullback before the next altcoin boom, investors are already identifying the projects set to benefit most, and Remittix (RTX) tops that list. The PayFi project is redefining digital payments by making it possible to send crypto directly to any bank account in seconds. Unlike XRP and Stellar, which focus on crypto-to-crypto transfers, Remittix simplifies real-world spending through instant fiat deposits. Experts believe this gives RTX a massive advantage heading into the next market rotation, where utility-based tokens could lead the charge. BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing for RTX, with LBank joining soon after. The Remittix Wallet beta is live, allowing users to test crypto-to-bank payments. A 15% USDT Referral Program rewards users daily through the Remittix dashboard. The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway continues to attract global participation. Now verified by CertiK and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens, Remittix is proving that true adoption, not speculation, drives long-term growth.

This New Crypto Coin Could Lead Q1 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-cryptocurrency-to-25x-this-new-crypto-coin-could-lead-q1-2026/,"The search for the next high-growth cryptocurrency is intensifying as 2025 comes to a close. With the market showing signs of recovery and investors repositioning portfolios for the next bull run, many are focusing on early-stage tokens that combine use cases with strong presale traction. One name that keeps surfacing among analysts is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a DeFi crypto that could become one of the top cryptocurrencies heading into Q1 2026. The project has already raised millions, achieved a top-tier audit rating, and confirmed the upcoming testnet launch of its lending protocol. With its unique model for yield generation and token demand, some experts now predict that MUTM could deliver up to 25x token appreciation within the next major crypto cycle. Dual Lending Model, Yield System, and Presale Data Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol that aims to make digital asset lending more secure and efficient. It operates through two complementary systems: a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pool for popular assets like ETH and USDT, and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace for more specialized tokens. Together, these models create flexibility and depth in liquidity — allowing users to lend or borrow under transparent, smart contract conditions. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $18 million, attracting over 17,600 holders — a strong sign of growing investor confidence. The project’s Phase 6 presale is now around 80% complete, with over 785 million tokens sold so far. Each stage has sold out faster than the one before it, reflecting accelerating demand as the launch date approaches. Currently, tokens are priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, with the next stage set to increase to $0.04. The confirmed launch price is $0.06, giving early investors an opportunity for roughly 100-500% potential growth by listing. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) are allocated specifically for the presale — a clear and transparent structure that has helped build trust around the project’s long-term vision. V1 Launch and Security Measures Mutuum Finance is preparing to launch its V1 protocol on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, a key milestone that will transition the project from development to product delivery. This version will introduce the protocol’s core components: a Liquidity Pool, mtTokens for yield generation, Debt Tokens representing borrowed amounts, and a Liquidator Bot that automatically manages under-collateralized loans. The testnet will initially support ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral use — two of the most stable and liquid assets in crypto. Once testing is complete, more assets and stablecoins will be added. Mutuum Finance’s commitment to security has been one of its biggest strengths. The project successfully completed a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 Token Scan Score, a strong indicator of smart contract reliability. Additionally, the team operates a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage external testing and ensure robust defense against potential vulnerabilities. Token Utility, Buy-and-Distribute Model, and Analyst Forecasts Mutuum Finance’s utility extends far beyond a typical DeFi token. Its buy-and-distribute model is designed to create continuous buying pressure on the MUTM token. A portion of the protocol’s revenue — generated from borrowing fees and platform activity — is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This model effectively ties token demand to the platform’s activity, meaning the more users lend and borrow, the more tokens are purchased and redistributed. It’s a long-term sustainability mechanism that helps prevent supply dilution while rewarding loyal holders. To further enhance the platform’s reliability, Mutuum Finance plans to use oracle integrations, such as Chainlink, for accurate real-time pricing. This ensures that all lending, borrowing, and liquidation processes reflect true market conditions — a crucial feature for maintaining a stable ecosystem. Analyst projections for MUTM vary, but several independent forecasts suggest that the token could increase by 20x to 25x from its presale price once the mainnet is fully launched and exchange listings follow. This growth projection is based on current adoption rates, presale velocity, and the platform’s advanced revenue model. Why Analysts Compare MUTM to Early Aave and Solana Several market researchers have drawn parallels between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and early-stage success stories like Aave and Solana. Both of those projects combined strong utility with early community growth, which led to significant price appreciation once their products went live. Like Aave, Mutuum Finance is focused on real DeFi functionality — generating yield through a transparent lending model rather than speculation. Like Solana, it aims to deliver technical scalability and cross-chain compatibility over time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a new crypto with strong fundamentals, real product delivery, and measurable demand. With its V1 launch on the horizon, $18 million raised, and Phase 6 nearing full allocation, the project is already proving it can execute. The token’s combination of utility, transparency, and security sets it apart from typical presales. If analyst predictions hold true and MUTM delivers on its roadmap, it could become one of the few early-stage cryptos capable of 25x returns in the next cycle — making it one of the top cryptos to buy now ahead of Q1 2026.

However, it couldn’t maintain its run and quickly dropped to the current $2.52 even after the positive news on a macro level, such as the Fed’s interest rate cut. Now, popular analyst Ali Martinez has outlined the most significant support and resistance lines for the asset that might determine the next big move. For $XRP , resistance stands at $2.80 and $3, while support holds at $2.15. pic.twitter.com/ODv0X9sWhh — Ali (@ali_charts) November 2, 2025 XRP’s current price tag means that it’s a low closer to the upper boundaries of its channel, especially the first one at $2.80. If broken, then the asset could challenge the coveted $3.00, which has been a distant dream for almost a month. On the downside, $2.15 will serve as the first meaningful line of defense if Ripple’s token reverses its trajectory and heads south once again. The XRP Army expects more volatility in the following weeks due to several factors. A spot XRP ETF might launch in less than two weeks after Canary Capital’s latest update in its filing, which could bypass the typical approval process. If it indeed hits the markets on November 13, the underlying asset could go on a wild price ride. On the bearish side is the current investor behavior. As previously reported , whales have been disposing of XRP tokens for weeks, but there’s more. Glassnode data shows that long-term holders who accumulated before the price run that began a year ago had “ramped up their spending by 580%, from $38m/day to $260m/day.” The analytics platform warned that this is a “clear sign of seasoned traders exiting and adding pressure to [the] price action.” Since early August, XRP price has dropped from $3.3 to $2.4 (-27% ).

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/this-expert-says-do-this-asap-if-you-hold-xrp-heres-why/,"As the cryptocurrency market experiences another round of volatility, investor and crypto expert Levi Rietveld believes this is precisely when serious participants should be paying attention. In a recent video, Rietveld argued that instances of heavy selling pressure often present the best opportunities for accumulation. His comments come amid a pullback across digital assets, including XRP, which has faced short-term declines . Rietveld’s message was straightforward. He said that most investors fail to make real gains in crypto because they act on emotion rather than strategy. “The only people that actually do well investing are the people that are buying on the red days and selling on the green days,” he said. According to him, the recent dip should not be seen as a reason to panic but rather as a chance to lower one’s average entry price before the next upward move. IF YOU’RE HOLDING #XRP DO THIS ASAP #Ripple #crypto #cryptonews pic.twitter.com/bqukXfx9Pg — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 31, 2025 Market Timing and Investor Behavior Rietveld emphasized that retail investors tend to buy at the wrong times. He pointed out that many are quick to chase rallies rather than position during corrections. “All of the money you’re gonna make is on the way back up,” he explained, adding that the best strategy involves adding to positions when the market temporarily turns against them. To illustrate his point, Rietveld referenced a recent example from October. He referenced XRP’s shared decline in early October , which the asset quickly recovered from. For him, that kind of move shows why reacting to fear-based declines is often a mistake. He said investors should remember that large sell-offs tend to create temporary inefficiencies that long-term holders can leverage. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why His Message Resonates Now The timing of Rietveld’s remarks is notable, as the current market environment resembles previous consolidation phases that preceded significant rallies. XRP’s recent movements have drawn renewed attention from investors evaluating long-term value prospects. His comments add to a growing view that experienced market participants are treating current weakness as an opportunity rather than a setback. For holders seeking guidance, Rietveld advised leveraging fear-driven dips instead of reacting to them. He cautioned that waiting for total clarity or perfect timing often results in missed chances. As he put it, “You want to lower your average entry, not raise it by following into every single pump that happens.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Hougan argued that ETH has experienced short-term challenges but retains its long-term structural advantages: “Ethereum is poised to reach $5,000 by the end of this year and at least double by the end of the decade.” Overshadowed by the strong performance of rivals like Solana in recent months, Ethereum has struggled with low transaction volumes and weak market sentiment, particularly throughout 2024. As the growth of Layer-2 networks reduces economic activity on the main chain, some analysts have claimed that Ethereum has become “overvalued and uninvestable.” Related News: Major Cryptocurrency Exchange Responds to Claims of “Financial Difficulties” According to Hougan, ETH's biggest advantage is that it sits at the heart of the stablecoin ecosystem. “All payments will be made with stablecoins,” Hougan said, “and the vast majority of these stablecoins run on Ethereum.” According to DefiLlama data, 53% of the $307 billion in circulating stablecoin supply resides on the Ethereum network. The two largest stablecoins in the market, USDT and USDC, are primarily issued on the network. In comparison, Solana's share is only around 4%. *This is not investment advice.

Recent market monitoring indicates that the Bitcoin price has made a significant move, surging above the $111,000 mark. This impressive rally has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a period of renewed optimism in the digital asset space. According to Bitcoin World market data, BTC is currently trading around $111,000 on the Binance USDT market, reflecting strong buying pressure. What’s Driving This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? When the Bitcoin price climbs so dramatically, it’s natural to wonder about the underlying causes. Several factors often contribute to such a powerful upward trajectory. Understanding these drivers can offer valuable insights into market dynamics and help anticipate future movements. Increased Institutional Adoption: A growing number of institutional investors are allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class and a hedge against inflation. This influx of large-scale investment provides substantial liquidity and confidence. Positive Macroeconomic Outlook: Global economic conditions, including inflation concerns and interest rate policies, can influence investor sentiment towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Technological Advancements: Continuous developments in the Bitcoin network and the broader crypto ecosystem, such as improved scalability solutions and increased utility, can boost investor confidence. Market Sentiment and FOMO: As the Bitcoin price rises, a ‘Fear Of Missing Out’ (FOMO) often kicks in, encouraging more retail investors to enter the market, further fueling the rally. This latest surge above $111,000 highlights the volatile yet potentially rewarding nature of cryptocurrency investments. It serves as a reminder that Bitcoin remains a key player in the financial landscape. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Price Landscape For both seasoned traders and new entrants, the current market presents unique opportunities and challenges. While a rising Bitcoin price is generally positive, it’s essential to approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, regulatory developments, and technological updates that could impact Bitcoin. Reliable sources like Bitcoin World can provide timely information. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. The cryptocurrency market, despite its growth, can experience rapid price fluctuations. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin. While BTC is dominant, other cryptocurrencies may also offer growth potential. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide whether your investment strategy is geared towards short-term gains or long-term holding. This will influence your trading decisions. The journey of the Bitcoin price has been marked by significant milestones, and this latest climb is another chapter in its evolving story. Investors are keenly watching to see if this momentum can be sustained. What Could Be Next for the Bitcoin Price? Predicting the exact future trajectory of the Bitcoin price is challenging, given the numerous variables at play. However, analysts often consider various scenarios. A sustained period above $111,000 could solidify this level as new support, potentially paving the way for further gains. Conversely, market corrections are always a possibility, especially after rapid surges. It is important to remember that market movements are influenced by a complex interplay of supply and demand, investor psychology, and global economic indicators. Therefore, continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies are crucial for navigating the dynamic crypto market. The excitement around Bitcoin’s performance underscores its enduring appeal and its potential to reshape traditional finance. In conclusion, the surge of the Bitcoin price above $111,000 is a significant event, sparking optimism across the crypto community. While the future remains uncertain, this milestone reaffirms Bitcoin’s position as a leading digital asset.

Key Takeaways: Thodex founder Faruk Fatih Ozer was found dead in his prison cell while serving an 11,196-year sentence. Ozer’s death ends one of Türkiye’s largest crypto scandals, involving the loss of over ₺356 million ($12.5 million) in investor funds. Authorities have launched an investigation as his case continues to shape Türkiye’s tightening stance on crypto regulation. Authorities said Ozer was discovered hanging in his bathroom during an inspection, with early reports pointing to suicide as the likely cause, according to a recent report by local news outlet Türkiye Today . Thodex Founder Was Serving 11,196-Year Sentence Ozer had been serving a historic sentence of 11,196 years , 10 months, and 15 days after being convicted of multiple charges, including establishing and leading a criminal organization, aggravated fraud, and money laundering. His siblings, Guven and Serap Ozer, were convicted on similar charges and received identical sentences. The case remains one of Türkiye’s largest crypto-related fraud scandals. Founded in 2017, Thodex once ranked among the country’s leading crypto exchanges before abruptly halting operations in April 2021, citing a “temporary suspension.” Shortly after, Ozer fled to Albania, allegedly taking investors’ funds with him. He was arrested in Albania in August 2022 following an international manhunt and extradited to Türkiye in April 2023. Prosecutors accused him of defrauding over 400,000 investors, alleging that ₺253.7 million ($8.9 million) worth of crypto assets were transferred to wallets controlled by Ozer and his associates, including accounts in Malta.

Thodex’s collapse triggered widespread outrage, marking a turning point for Türkiye’s crypto oversight and leading to calls for tighter regulation of the industry. In the indictment prepared by the Anadolu Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, authorities outlined how Thodex lured users with promotions before abruptly freezing withdrawals. Twenty-one defendants were tried in the case, seven of whom were detained, while sixteen were acquitted for lack of evidence. Ozer’s death brings a grim end to a saga that shook Türkiye’s crypto landscape and left thousands of investors without recourse. Officials have launched a formal investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death. Turkey Tops MENA Crypto Market With $200B in Annual Transactions As reported, Turkey has cemented its position as the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East and North Africa , recording nearly $200 billion in annual transactions, according to new data from Chainalysis. The figure is roughly four times that of the United Arab Emirates, which ranked second with $53 billion. Analysts say much of Turkey’s activity remains driven by short-term trading rather than long-term adoption. The Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Adoption Report highlights how crypto has become both a financial refuge and a speculative outlet for Turks facing high inflation and a weakening lira. Since 2021, Turkey’s total inflows have exceeded $878 billion, making it one of the world’s most active markets. Despite this growth, retail participation is cooling, with small and large retail transactions declining slightly as institutional investors dominate.

This development was communicated by Burkhard Mühl, the head of Europol’s European Financial and Economic Crime Centre (EFECC). He made these comments at the just-concluded Global Conference on Finances and Crypto Assets. The event was organized jointly by Europol, the Basel Institute on Governance, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). During the event, Mühl mentioned that the misuse of digital assets for criminal activities has become widespread and more sophisticated while pledging continued investment from Europol to support member states in complex and international investigations. “Investigating these crimes places a significant burden on the law enforcement agencies of EU member states,” he said. Europol raises alarm over misuse of digital assets for criminal activities The conference focused on the ways that digital assets and blockchains have evolved and how scammers are taking advantage of them to carry out their sophisticated crimes. In the 2025 crypto crime report released by Chainalysis in January, the firm mentioned that illicit crypto addresses received about $40.9 billion across 2024. The figure only represented a small segment of the overall proceeds of financial crime, and excludes traditional crimes such as drug trafficking, where crypto is used for payments. Europol has initiated and completed several major takedowns since the beginning of this year. This includes dismantling the cybercrime network in Latvia, which authorities claimed laundered more than $330,000 through digital assets. It also carried out an operation targeting the clandestine hawala banking network that laundered over $23 million using several digital assets. In addition, it smashed a crypto investment fraud ring that profited more than $540 million from more than 5,000 victims. Europe has been hit with a series of so-called wrench attacks, where criminals turn to physical assaults to compel digital asset holders to hand over their digital assets or, in some instances, their private keys. In particular, over the course of the year, France has witnessed more than 10 separate incidents. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the growing rate of these attacks forced crypto enthusiasts in the country to call for crypto data security as a way to safeguard wealthy crypto personalities. Challenges of cross-border enforcement Some of the challenges for police forces across the world when it comes to crypto-related crimes are their global nature. In addition, the need for cross-border cooperation in operations also makes it difficult at other times. For example, victims of a hack or scam in the United States could be targeted by operators located in another continent. Challenges also remain in how law enforcement and the private sector approach investigating these crimes. Diana Pātrut, project manager at the Block Intelligence Professionals Association (BIPA) mentioned that different analytics companies often produce inconsistent results. “Our stakeholders have articulated that different blockchain analytics firms produce different results when tracing transactions. There has also been no standardization for wallet attribution, methodology, training, and formatting, making cross-border investigations especially challenging,” Pătruț said. Pātrut also added that training is still an area that needs work. “The biggest issue we see at the moment is that blockchain intelligence training appears to be primarily driven by private sector solutions, and this creates the confirmation bias, herding trainees to specific commercial solutions and methodologies, without necessarily understanding or appreciating their underlying application,” she explained. She also added that investigators and financial institutions need to develop their critical assessment capabilities. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

As SHIB debates burns and usage, a PayFi upstart with a live wallet beta keeps showing up on analyst shortlists. That is where anticipation builds, because when utility starts shipping, money follows. This piece sets clear levels for SHIB and then explains why many traders now preview Remittix for the next leg. Expect urgency. Expect numbers. And expect a clear path for readers who are done waiting on memes. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Levels, Flows, and What Matters Next The immediate Shiba Inu price prediction range is $0.0000095 to $0.0000105. A decisive daily close above that band could open $0.0000115 early in November, while a rejection risks retesting recent lows. Today, SHIB trades near $0.000010 on a modest relief bounce. On-chain context is mixed. Community trackers flagged multi-month lows in Shibarium transactions late October, followed by brief spikes that faded. That inconsistency keeps the multiple in check. The most honest Shiba Inu price prediction remains simple: watch usage first, price second. If activity stabilizes, the door to higher levels reopens. If not, rallies look fragile. For many desks, that is the signal to rotate. Remittix (RTX): Utility First, Built for Payouts Here is the shift. Remittix focuses on sending crypto to real bank accounts with live FX quotes, merchant-grade APIs, and a wallet already in public testing. Community testers are using the beta today, and the team is pushing updates based on feedback. Security has been treated as a first-order job, with top-tier verification that puts the project at the front of pre-launch rankings. Numbers matter. RTX is available around $0.1166. More than 30,000 investors have already participated. Over $27.7 million has been raised and 681 million tokens are spoken for. Access is set to broaden on centralized exchanges, which can drive discovery and depth. When supply tightens and access improves, price steps tend to follow. Why buyers act now The wallet beta is live, which removes guesswork and shows product velocity in real time. Payment coverage targets many countries so users can move value like money, not just trade. Listings roadmap expands liquidity on major venues that the wider market trusts. Independent security validation by Certik gives institutions and funds a green light to engage. Shiba Inu price prediction may find a bounce, but the market is voting with flows. Utility is beating noise. If you want exposure to real payments, the window while RTX sits near $0.1166 will not stay open forever.

Key Takeaways: Prince Andrew arranged a private Buckingham Palace visit for crypto businessmen tied to a failed £1.4M deal with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. Ferguson earned over £200,000 from Pegasus Group Holdings, whose Bitcoin mining venture collapsed. The revelations come as Buckingham Palace moves to strip him of remaining royal titles. The meeting took place in June 2019 while Queen Elizabeth II was in residence, raising fresh questions about Andrew’s use of royal privileges for private dealings. Prince Andrew Welcomed Crypto Executives Linked to £1.4M Deal at Palace Event The businessmen, Jay Bloom and Michael Evers, co-founders of the Arizona-based Pegasus Group Holdings, were chauffeured through the palace gates in the Duke of York’s car before attending Andrew’s Pitch@Palace business event later that day. Ferguson, who was employed by Pegasus as a “brand ambassador,” joined the pair for dinner that evening with Andrew and their daughter, Princess Beatrice. Pegasus claimed to be building a large-scale Bitcoin mining operation powered by solar energy in the Arizona desert, but the project collapsed within a year, leaving investors millions out of pocket. Court filings later revealed that only 615 of 16,000 planned generators were ever purchased, producing just £25,000 worth of Bitcoin. US investors eventually won a $4.1 million arbitration award after accusing the company of misusing funds, a ruling Bloom is appealing. Documents obtained by the BBC show Ferguson was paid more than £200,000 for her work with Pegasus, with a contract entitling her to an additional £1.2 million bonus and shares in the firm. Her agreement required first-class travel, five-star accommodation, and professional styling services but stated she bore no responsibility for the company’s technical claims. The revelations reignite concerns about Andrew and Ferguson’s financial ties and the blurred lines between their royal status and private ventures. Buckingham Palace confirmed on Thursday that formal steps are underway to strip Andrew of his remaining titles and his Windsor residence amid ongoing scrutiny of his past associations, including his links to Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew stripped of all titles. King Charles formally removes Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew. Done with immediate effect. He will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. Also, he's kicked out of Lodge too. pic.twitter.com/JA3XpBLzxE — Dina Shakti (@Dina_Shakti) October 30, 2025 Pegasus co-founder Bloom denied meeting the late Queen during his palace visit but admitted thanking Andrew and Ferguson for arranging the tour. UK Crypto ETN Fee War Erupts After Regulator Reopens Retail Access As reported, a price war has broken out among UK crypto exchange-traded note (ETN) issuers after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year ban on retail participation . The decision, effective October 8, allows everyday investors to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked ETNs through tax-free accounts such as ISAs, marking a major shift in the UK’s regulatory approach to digital assets. The move triggered immediate fee cuts across major issuers. Bitwise slashed its Core Bitcoin ETP fee from 0.2% to 0.05%, while 21Shares lowered its Bitcoin and Ethereum products to 0.1%. Fidelity, Invesco, and BlackRock joined the fray with temporary discounts, and CoinShares continued to lead the ether market by offering zero management fees, offset through staking rewards. Trading volumes on the London Stock Exchange surged following the policy change, with daily Bitcoin ETN turnover rising from $2.1 million to $7.2 million.

The cloud mining-as-a-service (MaaS) offering, called “Cloud Miner”, an ICT infrastructure, aims to pioneer sustainable crypto innovation. “Cloud Miner” is designed exclusively for UAE residents in line with du’s commitment to transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. Customers can bid through an online auction that will be hosted on the Online Auction website, starting from the 3rd to the 9th of November. As per du, the cloud-as-a-mining service will offer a cloud-based solution that simplifies traditional processes. Clients will be able to mine, benefit from potential Bitcoin rewards, and participate in the blockchain ecosystem without the burdens of hardware management, electricity costs, or maintenance concerns, and operations can commence immediately after subscription. Jasim AlAwadi, CICTO at du, noted that the telecom operator aims to offer an easy entry point into the world of cryptocurrency while leveraging du’s reputation, reliability, transparency, and security. He explained, “The service embodies our commitment to innovation, leveraging our robust data center skills & ICT infrastructure to secure a sustainable future for digital finance in the UAE.” The telecom operator distinguishes its Cloud Miner with competitive pricing and a transparent, no-hidden-fee contract available for 24 months, allowing clients to conveniently enjoy 250 TH/s capacity, where subscribers can access crypto mining through a straightforward web application. Furthermore, du ensures adherence to KYC/AML compliance for high-value transactions with the use of UAE Pass and by bolstering account security with two-factor authentication, demonstrating its commitment to providing a secure and trustworthy service. “The launch of Cloud Miner under sub-brand du Tech highlights du’s rich heritage in telecom. With du’s Cloud Miner, entering the cryptocurrency market has never been easier or more secure,” added Jasim AlAwadi at du. Bitcoin mining is spearheaded by corporates in the UAE There is already strong corporate mining activity in the UAE , with entities such as UAE Phoenix Group, which launched its IPO last year, and Marathon Digital, which in 2023 partnered with Zero Two, a subsidiary of the UAE sovereign wealth fund, for a Bitcoin mining facility in Abu Dhabi. However, this is the first time a telecom entity offers such a service in the UAE. Globally, for example, Deutsche Telekom subsidiary MMS, in collaboration with Bankhaus Metzler, is launching a pilot project to operate a Bitcoin mining infrastructure using surplus energy.

Data from on-chain analytics platform Sentora, formerly known as IntoTheBlock, shows that exchange balances for both leading cryptocurrencies have dropped notably over the past week. Prices are holding steady without much bullish momentum, but these massive withdrawals may hint at a subtle change in investor sentiment going into November. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashback: Mirror Move Hints At Record-Breaking Surge Bitcoin And Ethereum Witness Billions Of Outflows From Exchanges According to data from Sentora, Bitcoin recorded more than $2 billion in outflows from centralized exchanges over the course of the week. This is interesting, as it is one of the largest weekly movements of Bitcoin from exchanges so far this quarter. Furthermore, this trend is interesting because it is coming off an unfavorable month for the crypto industry in general, considering the crash that happened in the middle of the month. The outflow numbers can be interpreted as a sign of confidence among whale addresses choosing long-term storage over trading. On-chain data from whale transaction tracker Lookonchain supports this trend, showing two newly created wallets withdrawing 2,000 BTC worth about $260 million from crypto exchange Binance toward the end of the week. Ethereum also witnessed a similar trend to Bitcoin. Data from Sentora shows that the leading altcoin saw major outflows during the week, coming to a total of about $600 million. Bitcoin and Ethereum Weekly Key Metrics. Source: Sentora What Could This Signal For Bitcoin And Ethereum? The massive exchange outflows are somewhat confusing, considering the fact that both Bitcoin and Ethereum ended October with negative monthly closes and broke the long-running Uptober trend that has shaped the crypto market for years. For six straight years, October had been one of Bitcoin’s most dependable bullish months that set the stage for strong year-end rallies. That streak has now ended with Bitcoin closing October 2025 about 4% below its monthly open, its first red October since 2018. Ethereum also followed a similar path and recorded a more notable monthly close of about 7.15% below its open. Data from Sentora, as shown above, points to reduced activity in these blockchains that suggests the required bullish activity may not be there yet. The total fees on the Bitcoin blockchain come out to be $2.03 million, an 8.6% reduction from the previous week. The Ethereum network also saw a 13.2% fall in fees, coming out to $5.05 million. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters The Big Leagues — Stadium And Jerseys Get A Crypto Makeover Nonetheless, the outflows from exchanges are a bullish place to start. It eases selling pressure in the market, as fewer coins on exchanges mean fewer assets immediately available for sale. This, in turn, can tighten supply and gradually build a foundation for higher prices leading up to November. Whale traders might already be positioning themselves for the possibility of a bullish November.

The plan sets out pilots and proof-of-concepts that regulators and industry will run together over the next few years. Malaysia: Digital Asset Innovation Hub Moves Into Action Based on reports, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and the Securities Commission have created a Digital Asset Innovation Hub and an Industry Working Group to guide projects. The hub will host pilots on things like supply-chain finance for small and medium sized enterprises, Shariah-compliant finance, and green or ESG-linked instruments. These are the first use cases BNM has highlighted. The goal is to test ways tokenized assets might improve access to funds and make settlement clearer for smaller firms.

Industry consultation is open until one March 2026, giving firms a chance to send feedback on rules and technical designs. Regulators are studying how tokenized deposits, stablecoins , and even linkages to a wholesale central bank digital currency might fit into existing systems. How those pieces will work together has not been fixed yet. There are practical questions that remain. Will tokenized assets trade on public blockchains or in permissioned systems? How will legal ownership be recorded when an asset is split into tokens? Based on reports, regulators want to protect retail investors while still letting firms test real use cases. That balancing act will be crucial. Focus On SMEs And Shariah Finance While Monitoring Risks The push could open new funding routes for SMEs, help make cross-border settlements easier, and offer Islamic finance structures in token form. But it also carries risks. Market integrity, consumer protection, and operational resilience will need close checks. Regulators are expected to set guardrails before any large rollouts. Some observers say the move is Malaysia positioning itself alongside other regional centers that have been exploring tokenization. Regulated firms, fintech startups, banks, and asset managers are being invited to take part. Based on reports, the initiative will run pilot projects, collect data, and then shape formal rules. That process could take the whole three years, depending on results and feedback.

Market data analyst Dom (@traderview2) highlighted the development, noting that “it looks like some type of TWAP was also turned on for XRP about an hour ago on Coinbase.” The analyst shared a chart to back up his claims, comparing XRP prices and cumulative volume deltas across major exchanges. The data showed Coinbase’s XRP price (represented in yellow) trading at a visible premium compared to Binance, Bybit, and Kraken, beginning roughly an hour before Dom’s post. This divergence coincided with a large number of repetitive transactions. According to Dom, “638 XRP buys repeated 4,287 times over the last hour.” The repetition and precision of the order sizes suggest that an algorithmic trading strategy known as a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) may have been used. It looks like some type of TWAP was also turned on for $XRP about an hour ago on Coinbase? Look at premium develop compared to the other exchanges (yellow starts trading higher) 638 XRP buys repeated 4,287 times over the last hour Pretty bizarre https://t.co/WAX9I5NINN pic.twitter.com/leJD44uLDV — Dom (@traderview2) October 31, 2025 Evidence of Sustained Buying Pressure A TWAP is designed to minimize market disruption by dividing a large order into smaller transactions evenly spread over time. In this case, the pattern of identical buy orders and the resulting Coinbase premium point to sustained spot demand. The corresponding chart supports this interpretation. While XRP prices across exchanges moved in alignment, Coinbase’s price line gradually rose above others, reflecting increased local demand or a deliberate accumulation pattern . The right side of the chart, showing cumulative volume delta (CVD), further reinforces this view. CVD represents the difference between buying and selling pressure over time. Coinbase’s CVD line rose sharply, while Binance, Kraken, and Bitstamp showed smaller or flat movements. The divergence between Coinbase’s CVD and other exchanges indicates concentrated buying activity originating from that venue. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Dom had previously reported a similar automated accumulation process for Ethereum on Binance, and the XRP data now appears to show a comparable approach, though on a smaller scale. Potential Outcomes for XRP Such patterns often emerge when institutional or high-volume traders aim to build a position without triggering price volatility. If this were indeed a TWAP, it may signal that a whale is entering a sizable XRP position in a measured way. That could sustain upward momentum in the short term, as the consistent demand supports price stability. However, artificial order flow of this nature can also create temporary price imbalances . Once the automated buying ends, the absence of constant bid support may allow prices to retrace if organic demand fails to maintain the same intensity. Traders monitoring spreads between exchanges often interpret these moments as opportunities to arbitrage or test market depth.

The widely tracked Crypto Fear & Greed Index showed only a small improvement, rising from 33 to 37 on Sunday, still firmly in “Fear” territory. Essentially, a low value of the observed sentiment index indicates that traders and investors do not trust the current breakthrough in the geopolitical sphere. A count below 50 indicates a lack of euphoria, and the increase in value reflects the growing trust of participants in the trading community. Despite an increase in Saturday’s value, 37 is not a reassuring level. It shows that the trading community has lost confidence in the industry after the global economic superpowers’ conflict has calmed down. Traders are still processing the deal. US-China relations have been shaping both digital and traditional sectors for months, with tariff threats, supply chain disruptions, and tech restrictions fueling concerns about global economic growth. This agreement has been a significant step forward, but without clarification and sanctions, investors remain cautious. Upcoming political shifts could introduce even stricter rules on intellectual property and information security, adding another layer of uncertainty. US and China reach trade truce, but confidence stays low The US-China deal will roll back a significant share of the tariffs imposed during the previous disputes. Washington agrees to reduce some tariffs on Chinese goods from about 57 to 47 percent. Ultimately, Beijing agrees to restart large purchases of US agricultural goods and significantly reduce restrictions on the export of rare earths to the US markets — the materials vital for technology and energy production. It is therefore no surprise that the White House claimed the accord to be a massive victory for American workers, farmers, and families, and a critical stride towards restoring US economic power and national security. Chinese officials also lauded the pact as a positive step in the right direction that would bring back certainty to global commerce . Initially, the financial markets were positive. US shares, for example, all soared, and the dollar gained momentum against all major currencies. On the contrary, significant changes were not observed in the cryptocurrency market, where it is believed that traders’ hopes have yet to materialize. The public has indeed considered the agreement as more of a ceasefire. Notably, various points — including tech access and commitment clauses — remain far apart or have not been addressed. Thus, cryptocurrency market prices are projected to fluctuate, just as they did in previous rounds of negotiations. Crypto market holds back despite improved clarity All in all, the modest gains in the crypto industry suggest that investors are more apprehensive than optimistic. Market observers highlight the serious losses that occurred earlier in October, following Trump’s threat of 100% tariffs against China, which triggered the biggest panic in international markets. The event resulted in around $19 billion worth of crypto positions being liquidated in less than 24 hours. Recovery has been shaky. Analyst Michael van de Poppe of MN Capital says that the current phase is challenging, but it could, in hindsight, represent one of the market’s bottom days. He still notes that the overall momentum remains at the early stages of a potential bull cycle for both altcoins and Bitcoin. Others echo the sentiment. More experienced traders stated that the deal is the perfect prerequisite for a slow recovery and is “bullish for markets in the medium term.” In other words, the majority is under the impression that while traders should remain hopeful, they should not expect bull activity anytime soon. For now, fear and hope are equally responsible for determining prices. Traders are likely awaiting the signs that the trade war is indeed over, and global markets will be alright long enough for the market to recover. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Many analysts believe 2025 could mark a comeback year for the token as institutional adoption accelerates and confidence in its long-term use case strengthens. Emerging payment systems like Remittix (RTX) , designed to enable faster and more affordable crypto-to-fiat transfers are quietly gaining traction and could eventually rival established tokens such as XRP in the global payments space. XRP Market Snapshot XRP is currently selling at $2.50 following a loss of 1.4% over the last 24 hours with a market capitalization of $150.31 billion, while trading volume has fallen by nearly 40% to $3.04 billion, suggesting reduced speculative interest. Analysts suggest that XRP’s recent price action shows growing sensitivity to ongoing ETF discussions and evolving regulatory expectations. Although there is still a lot of interest in XRP, rivals that provide physical transaction utilities are becoming more well-known. Remittix stands out because of its active user adoption and practical payment options. Why Remittix Is Gaining Ground Due to the high initial demand for its PayFi service, Remittix has raised more than $27.7 million in private funding. With over 681.9 million RTX tokens distributed and a current price of $0.1166 per token, a substantial early community has been established. In contrast to conventional cryptocurrency initiatives, it concentrates on useful applications, such as real-time foreign exchange conversion, support for over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, and quick crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries. More community testers can now participate in the platform’s wallet beta program, confirming its potential for adoption. CertiK has fully validated the Remittix team and RTX is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens. Remittix has announced upcoming centralized exchange listings on BitMart and LBANK, which should improve liquidity and accessibility. Key Features and Utilities of Remittix Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Built for practical payments, not just speculation Security Verified: Audited by CertiK, top blockchain auditor Community Rewards: $250,000 giveaway and 15% referral rewards in USDT Cross-Chain DeFi: Supports multiple tokens and low gas fee transfers Remittix: The Alternative Payment Leader As XRP gains headlines from ETF speculation, Remittix quietly delivers a measurable impact on global payments. Its practical use cases, growing community, and secure infrastructure suggest it could become a major alternative in cross-border transactions. Investors looking for the next 100x crypto with real-world applications may find Remittix to be a compelling addition alongside traditional XRP positions. With the $27.7M private funding milestone, ongoing wallet beta, and upcoming exchange listings, Remittix is emerging as one of 2025’s most promising crypto projects.

While speculative projects often dominate headlines, analysts are increasingly favoring Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto that’s proving itself as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch heading into 2026. Currently in an advanced stage of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already attracted thousands of investors and raised millions in funding. With its mainnet test launch approaching, industry experts believe MUTM has the structure, timing, and momentum to potentially deliver up to 800% token appreciation over the next market cycle. Presale Momentum Shows Strong Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to gain momentum in its presale, which has already raised over $18 million and onboarded more than 17,600 holders. The sale is now in Phase 6, with each token priced at $0.035 and nearly 80% of this stage already sold out. The next phase will lift the price by nearly 20% to $0.04, ahead of the confirmed launch price of $0.06, meaning those joining now could see around 100% token appreciation while phase 1 participants are positioned for 500% MUTM value. From the total 4 billion supply, 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) are dedicated to the presale, offering a transparent and structured model that has strengthened investor confidence. Momentum has accelerated with every round selling out faster than the last, as growing awareness and strong fundamentals continue to attract new participants. The presale’s clear tokenomics, defined pricing system, and organized allocation structure have helped distinguish Mutuum Finance from less transparent early-stage crypto projects. What Mutuum Finance Is Building At its core, Mutuum Finance is a non-custodial, decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that aims to make digital asset markets more transparent, secure, and efficient. The system allows users to lend their crypto to earn passive yield or borrow against their existing holdings — all powered by smart contracts that automate and secure every transaction. When users deposit assets into the platform, they receive mtTokens, which are interest-bearing receipt tokens. For example, a user depositing 50 USDC receives 50 mtUSDC, which accrues interest over time as loans are repaid. This provides a continuous source of yield without the need for manual management. The protocol also plans to implement a buy-and-distribute model, where a portion of platform fees are used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This mechanism builds direct, organic buying pressure into the ecosystem and ties the project’s success to tokenholder rewards. V1 Launch and Upcoming Milestones One of the biggest upcoming catalysts for Mutuum Finance is its V1 protocol launch , scheduled for the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This release marks the transition from presale hype to a working product, often the turning point for serious DeFi protocols. V1 will introduce core components including the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot that automatically manages under-collateralized positions. The testnet will initially support ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral, with plans to expand support to additional cryptocurrencies and stablecoins after testing. Analysts say that this stage will be crucial for building investor confidence and could act as the first major trigger for post-launch growth. As one market strategist commented, “When a DeFi token moves from presale to active use, that’s when value shifts from promise to proof.” As long as Mutuum Finance successfully launches and scales its lending pools, analysts estimate that MUTM could surge 700–800% from its presale price within its first full year of trading, driven by increasing adoption and token buybacks. Stablecoin and Layer-2 Plans Add Depth Beyond its lending model, Mutuum Finance has also outlined plans to launch an on-demand, USD-pegged stablecoin that will be overcollateralized by active loans within the platform. This design not only provides an additional yield opportunity but also enhances long-term sustainability. The stablecoin will be minted and burned on demand, keeping supply aligned with lending activity and maintaining peg stability. Another key feature in development is Layer-2 expansion, which will allow Mutuum Finance to deploy across multiple blockchains for faster transactions and lower fees. This cross-chain capability could help MUTM capture liquidity from various ecosystems, expanding its user base and trading volumes. The project also plans to rely on oracle networks, such as Chainlink, to deliver accurate market data and ensure fair pricing for assets within the protocol. These oracles play a critical role in liquidation events, keeping the system stable even during market volatility. Taken together, these upgrades are why analysts see Mutuum Finance as a long-term growth play rather than a short-term presale trend. Multiple independent reports forecast a potential 8x to 10x increase within the first two years after launch, especially if adoption follows a curve similar to early lending protocols like Aave. Security, Transparency, and Community Engagement Mutuum Finance has already completed a CertiK audit, one of the most respected security assessments in crypto, achieving a 90/100 Token Scan Score. To further ensure safety, the project operates a $50,000 bug bounty program, encouraging external developers to identify vulnerabilities before launch. The team has also built a 24-hour leaderboard system, where the top daily contributor earns $500 worth of MUTM tokens. This adds transparency and community engagement during the presale, rewarding participation while keeping activity visible in real time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a rare combination of strong utility, transparent presale progress, and near-term product deployment. With its V1 launch confirmed for Q4 2025, $18 million raised, and 80% of Phase 6 already allocated, the project has proven its traction before even going live. For investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance might just be the opportunity that defines Q1 2026 and beyond.

According to the Romanian regulator, the prediction website has been operating in the country, carrying out gambling activities without an active license from the required agency. “The decision to include Polymarket on the blacklist is not related to technology, but to the law,” ONJN President Vlad-Cristian Soare said in a statement. “Regardless of whether you bet in lei or crypto, if you bet money on a future result, under the conditions of a counterpart bet, we are talking about gambling that must be licensed.” Soare added that the regulator will not allow platforms to use the transformation of blockchain into a screen to carry out illegal betting activities. Launched in 2020, Polymarket is a polygon-based prediction market with its headquarters in Manhattan, New York. It allows individuals to place bets on future events, including economic indicators, awards, and political and legislative outcomes. The platform allows users to deposit USDC through the Polygon blockchain network. The platform became more popular after it accurately predicted Donald Trump as the winner of the United States presidential elections. It accrued over $3.3 billion in wagers on the election. Romanian regulator blacklists Polymarket According to the Romanian regulator, while it understands that Polymarket is often regarded as an “event trading platform” and meets the definition of what it considers a “counterparty betting,” users still put up stakes against other users, and a future event determines the outcome. “Accepting the idea that a ‘counterparty betting’ system can be called ‘trading’ would create a dangerous precedent, whereby any operator could ‘reinterpret’ the counterparty betting activity as a stock exchange activity – circumventing strict gambling or capital markets regulations,” the regulator wrote . The Romanian regulator was particularly concerned about the increased prediction market activity during the Romanian local elections. For example, the regulator claimed that the market on Polymarket, where it asked users to predict the mayor of the capital city of Bucharest, has seen more than $16 million in volume. Earlier this year, an electoral market on the platform also generated more than $370 million in total volume. International scrutiny and POLY token launch Polymarket has garnered scrutiny across the world for similar reasons. Last year, France’s National Gaming Authority announced plans to ban the platform after an investigation into its compliance with French gambling legislation. “The regulator is currently examining [Polymarket’s] operation as well as its compliance with French gambling legislation,” a report from French news outlet The Big Whale said at the time. The platform had also been effectively banned in the United States following a fine from the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) back in 2022. However, in July, it acquired derivatives exchange QCX, which has received a no-action letter from the regulator, essentially allowing the prediction platform to resume its activities in the United States. Polymarket recently received a $2 billion investment from the New York Stock Exchange owner, Intercontinental Exchange. Meanwhile, Polymarket is planning to launch its POLY token and an airdrop. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, Polymarket CMO Matthew Modabber confirmed plans in an interview. “There will be a token, there will be an airdrop We could have launched a token whenever we wanted, and it’s just how thorough we want to be about it. We want it to be a token with true utility, longevity, and to be around forever, right? That’s what we expect from ourselves, and that’s what I think everyone in the space expects from us,” he said.

According to data from on-chain tracking platform Whale Alert , the company unlocked 1 billion XRP, valued at approximately $2.5 billion, as part of its long-standing monthly escrow routine on November 1. Shortly after the unlock, Ripple relocked 700 million XRP, worth about $1.75 billion, back into escrow through two separate transactions, one of 500 million XRP and another of 200 million XRP. XRP unlocks by Ripple. Source: Whale Alert Additionally, 500 million XRP was moved to unknown wallets, a step that typically precedes market-related operations such as institutional transfers or liquidity management. Notably, the XRP escrow system ensures transparency and predictability in supply, with Ripple releasing about 1 billion XRP each month for operations, partnerships, or liquidity purposes. Attention now shifts to whether XRP’s price will react to the newly available tokens. Notably, past unlocks have had little impact on the asset, which is currently consolidating around the $2.50 level after a period of significant capital outflow. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.53, having rallied almost 1% in the past 24 hours, while on a weekly basis the asset has dropped more than 4%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Meanwhile, on-chain data from Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on November 2 shows that XRP is currently consolidating below major resistance levels at $2.80 and $3.00, with significant supply clustering near those price points. Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap. Source: Glassnode The heatmap indicates that many holders acquired positions in this range, suggesting potential selling pressure if prices retest those levels. On the downside, support remains strong around $2.15, where accumulation has been more pronounced, hinting that buyers may step in to defend that zone. The pattern reflects a broader consolidation phase for XRP as investors weigh market direction following months of volatility. A breakout above $3 could signal renewed bullish momentum, while a drop below $2.15 might invite further downside risk.

Stellar, its long-standing parallel in cross-border utility, introduced limited inflation-based rewards early on, but never expanded into dynamic yield systems. XRP Tundra is changing that equation. The project’s new Cryo Vaults introduce on-ledger staking for XRP holders, allowing users to earn verifiable yields while maintaining custody of their assets. Instead of relying on validator inflation or third-party custodians, rewards are distributed through transparent smart contracts governed by TUNDRA-X — the project’s governance token on XRPL. This marks the first functional staking structure that directly connects XRP ownership with yield potential inside the XRPL ecosystem. Native XRPL Staking Redefines What Stellar Couldn’t Stellar’s staking equivalent operates through network inflation and validator incentives, rewarding those who delegate to consensus nodes. It’s stable, but static — capped, predictable, and centralized in practice. XRP Tundra’s Cryo Vaults instead introduce a variable model where holders can lock XRP or TUNDRA-S for yields up to 20% APY, secured through multi-signature Frost Keys. The rewards are algorithmic and transparent, visible on-ledger rather than determined by network governance votes. Investors have taken notice. Analyst coverage, including Ben Crypto’s review , highlights that XRP holders now gain a route to passive income without leaving XRPL — something previously impossible. The upcoming Cryo Vault activation effectively transforms XRP from a transactional asset into a yield-bearing one, bridging the functionality gap that Stellar’s inflation model never fully addressed. Dual-Chain Efficiency Versus Stellar’s Single-Layer Framework At the structural level, XRP Tundra’s architecture breaks away from traditional single-chain logic. Its dual-token system — TUNDRA-X on the XRP Ledger for governance and reserves, and TUNDRA-S on Solana for utility and liquidity — creates separation of function that Stellar’s design never implemented. This separation ensures governance and execution can scale independently, minimizing token inflation and allowing yield flows to remain predictable. The market response underscores confidence in the model. The project’s Phase 9 presale offers TUNDRA-S at $0.147 with an 11% token bonus, paired with free TUNDRA-X allocations at a $0.0735 reference price. With confirmed listing prices of $2.5 and $1.25 respectively, and over $2 million raised, XRP Tundra has already attracted more measurable investor traction than comparable multi-chain DeFi projects in early-stage fundraising. Stellar’s simplicity remains valuable for remittance infrastructure, but Tundra’s modular system delivers what traditional cross-border chains have lacked — composability and reward scalability. Dynamic Liquidity Design That Ends DeFi’s Volatility Cycle The contrast becomes sharper when Tundra’s liquidity design is compared with mainstream DeFi staking models. While many decentralized exchanges promise high yields through token emissions, those returns often rely on inflationary incentives that collapse when trading volume falls. Volatility and impermanent loss dominate ecosystems such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, leaving liquidity providers exposed when token prices fluctuate. XRP Tundra takes a different route using Meteora’s DAMM V2 liquidity pools. These introduce dynamic fees that start high — near 50% — and decrease over time, making it prohibitively expensive to front-run or dump tokens immediately after launch. That model replaces the “farm-and-dump” cycle typical of traditional DeFi with what developers call a “race to stake,” redirecting trading profits into Cryo Vault rewards. It’s a liquidity architecture built for token longevity, not speculative churn. Transparency and Security: Verifiable Trust Versus Institutional Centralization Stellar has long maintained its reputation through institutional partnerships — MoneyGram, Circle, and cross-border pilot programs that emphasize compliance. XRP Tundra’s approach is not a rejection of that framework but an evolution of it. Every layer of the system is verifiable through public documentation: audits from Cyberscope , Solidproof , and FreshCoins , alongside Vital Block KYC certification . This transparency aligns Tundra more closely with regulated DeFi frameworks than anonymous liquidity farms. It allows institutional-grade visibility — not through centralization, but through open verification. Stellar operates within regulated ecosystems; Tundra extends that assurance to retail participants through public auditability, bridging traditional compliance culture with transparent DeFi mechanics. Why XRP Tundra’s Model Outpaces Stellar and DeFi Counterparts Across function, architecture, and transparency, XRP Tundra’s system advances beyond both major comparison points. Compared to Stellar, it replaces inflation-based validator logic with programmable, user-level staking directly on XRPL. Compared to traditional DeFi, it substitutes inflationary reward farming with audited, dynamic-yield mechanics that maintain token value integrity. This convergence of institutional-grade transparency and decentralized execution redefines how staking operates on established chains. Tundra effectively upgrades XRP’s utility layer while addressing the weaknesses of both centralized and permissionless staking ecosystems.

Every cycle brings a wave of new tokens promising quick profits, but only a few deliver sustained results. The strongest projects are those that combine innovation with actual use. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such name now emerging as a hidden gem among early-stage defi projects. It is designed to power decentralized lending, staking, and passive income in one secure system. At its current low presale price, it stands out as the most strategic crypto to buy now before the next market upturn. Presale Strength and the Last Chance to Buy Cheap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, already attracting impressive attention from the defi community. The total supply is 4 billion tokens, and about $18.35 million has been raised across all phases. The current token price is $0.035, with 85% of this phase sold out from a 170 million supply. Once the phase closes, the price will rise to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. More than 17,750 holders have already joined, showing solid early confidence in the project’s direction. This is the last opportunity to buy at the $0.035 mark before the price moves higher. The process is simple, with direct card payment options that make participation fast and easy. As the crypto fear and greed index begins to lean toward optimism again, many investors see this as a rare window to enter early before the next bullish wave. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will redefine decentralized lending through a dual-model system that balances safety and profit potential. The first mode, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), will allow users to deposit major assets such as USDT and ETH into audited lending pools and earn dynamic yields based on utilization. The second mode, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), will enable users to negotiate direct lending deals for higher-risk tokens like DOGE, or TRUMP, earning greater returns in exchange for increased exposure. Both models will be powered by mtTokens, which represent users’ share in the lending pools and form the base for staking rewards. This structure ensures transparent participation while maintaining strong collateralization and liquidity. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its synchronized launch approach. The platform and token will go live together, allowing lending and staking to start immediately after listing. This feature will transform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from a presale token into a working defi product from day one, offering tangible yield rather than speculative hype. Buybacks and Passive Rewards for Long-Term Participants Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reward its long-term supporters through a structured buy-and-distribute system. A portion of the platform’s revenue, collected from borrowing interest, will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as regular rewards. This cycle will generate steady buying pressure while strengthening the token’s long-term value. The direct link between revenue and rewards makes the system sustainable. Every lending transaction will contribute to MUTM’s demand, creating an ecosystem where growth supports both price stability and staker income. Early participation in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already shows how strategic timing can multiply returns. An investor who bought $5,000 worth of MUTM during Phase 2 at $0.020 received 250,000 tokens. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, that same holding is now valued around $8,750, representing a 75% gain. When the token reaches its upcoming target of $0.15 after launch, the same investment will grow to $37,500, which equals a 650% increase. This is not a speculative projection but a result driven by utility, staking rewards, and constant buyback activity designed to support value. Launch, Expansion, and Long-Term Vision The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform will launch alongside the token listing, allowing users to lend and stake from the first day. Recently Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced through its official X handle that its V1 protocol rollout is scheduled for the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This version will include the platform’s foundational components, such as the liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot designed to maintain efficiency and security. During this phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and utilize ETH or USDT as collateral. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) treats security as a foundation for trust. The project has completed a CertiK audit with a score of 90, confirming the reliability of its smart contracts. A $50,000 bug bounty program is also in place to ensure continuous safety improvements. To strengthen community engagement, the project has launched a $100,000 giveaway for ten winners who will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. These initiatives show the team’s focus on building a transparent, secure, and rewarding environment for early supporters. The Final Word Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines real defi functionality with audited security and sustainable tokenomics. With Phase 6 nearly sold out and the next price increase approaching, this is the last opportunity to secure MUTM at $0.035 before it climbs to $0.040 and beyond. It is a functioning, yield-generating protocol designed for lasting adoption rather than speculation. As market sentiment shifts and the crypto fear and greed index moves toward confidence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the crypto to buy now. For investors who want to add a real utility token to their portfolio, this low-cost entry could become one of 2026’s biggest success stories.

People familiar with the talks say that senior Trump officials in the administration have convened a series of high-level meetings since August to explore how the United States can persuade more foreign countries to use the US dollar as their primary currency or reserve currency. Discussion participants include the Treasury, the White House, and the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, as well as outside experts such as Steve Hanke, a Johns Hopkins University economist best known for his work on currency stabilization and currency denomination. Hanke reported that the policy discussions concerned were not to be mentioned, but rather that the matters were deliberative in nature. He added that Washington was becoming increasingly concerned over China’s de-dollarization aspirations, which entail using the yuan and other currencies for foreign commerce, thereby challenging the dollar’s global dominance. A spokesperson for the White House confirmed that the meetings with experts had indeed taken place and stated that the administration routinely receives input on significant economic issues. Nonetheless, the spokesperson stated that the administration had yet to make a final decision on the strategy. Beijing’s currency diplomacy alarms Washington China’s intention to oppose the US dollar persists as the country accelerates its global campaign to promote the yuan. This includes signing currency-swap agreements with its main trading partners and promoting local currency settlements to limit the dollar’s clout. Most recently, Beijing extended and doubled the size of its 360 billion yuan swap line with South Korea, a move analysts view as an essential aspect of wider efforts to promote the yuan internationally and create financial reserves against Western sanctions. Moreover, China has also expanded Chinese yuan oil and gas trading with Russia and the Gulf as another indicator of Beijing’s ambition to undermine the dollar’s primacy in world energy pricing. Bank for International Settlements data show that the yuan accounts for over 5% of global payments, its highest share to date. In Washington, the phenomenon raises concerns. Administration officials call it a “slow erosion” of one of America’s most valuable instruments: the unrivaled function of the dollar in the global financial order. A senior official with experience in the field stated that the issue was not merely economic, warning that the United States could lose many of its key tools and a significant portion of its influence in areas such as sanctions, trade, and diplomacy. Targeting dollar adoption in struggling economies Some in the administration explore ways to counter China’s economic influence by promoting “dollarization” in finance-vulnerable states. According to Hanke, they identified several emerging markets as likely candidates for the US dollar, comprising Argentina, Lebanon, Ghana, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. In particular, Argentina remains a focal point. The country is currently facing another wave of currency instability , with the annual inflation rate exceeding 200% at the start of the year. Argentina had a currency limit in place for over a decade, from 1991 to 2002, when it was abandoned during an unprecedented economic collapse. According to well-known economist Jay Newman, a former partner at Elliott Management, full dollarization of the Argentine economy may finally “break the cycle” of constant devaluations and massive capital flight. Nevertheless, critics, such as the International Monetary Fund, warn that eagerness for dollarization puts a foreign policy issue into the hands of Washington. Moreover, in addition to physical currencies, the United States resumed its interest in the dollar’s global application in digital finance. Those close to the talks claim this administration deems the dollar-backed stablecoins and blockchain-based payment systems a convenient modern tool to secure the US dollar’s central international role. Hanke clarified that the Treasury is also researching how some of the recent advancements can assist the US in controlling the growing national digital currencies that have emerged in recent years.

With ongoing developments in cross-border payments, institutional liquidity solutions, and the increasing relevance of tokenized finance, market participants are looking ahead to how XRP might perform by the end of the year. To gain a clearer perspective, we asked ChatGPT to provide a price projection for XRP on November 30, 2025. The model’s analysis considered fundamentals, liquidity data, historical patterns, and the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets. Market Context and Timing According to ChatGPT, the outlook for XRP aligns with what it described as the “late-2025 leg of the crypto bull cycle.” Altcoins tied to real utility rather than purely speculative demand tend to outperform during this phase. The model referenced Bitcoin’s April 2024 halving , noting that altcoin rallies typically follow twelve to eighteen months later, positioning the fourth quarter of 2025 as a key performance window. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Utility and Regulatory Drivers ChatGPT emphasized the influence of utility-driven growth , pointing to the broader adoption of Ripple’s XRP-powered technology across institutional corridors. It noted that pilots involving real-world asset tokenization and central bank digital currencies are likely to be more visible toward the end of the year. If a measurable share of international settlement traffic uses the XRP Ledger for liquidity, the model suggested that such activity could support higher valuations. The AI also referenced legislation like the GENIUS Act, which was passed into law, and the CLARITY Act . According to the model, these developments could help establish XRP as a regulated commodity, allowing for institutional participation through vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and settlement products. ChatGPT’s Targets for XRP In its technical breakdown, ChatGPT identified an accumulation pattern between $2 and $3.5, based on observed trading depth and algorithmic buying behavior. It also highlighted a projected Fibonacci extension near $4.7, which marks a potential resistance point. After compiling its models and data inputs, ChatGPT set a base-case forecast for XRP at $4.85 by November 30, with an expected range within $3.7 and $6.1. It further outlined three potential outcomes: a bullish case of $6.5 to $9 if global adoption expands rapidly, a base case of $4 to $5 with a gradual rise in institutional demand , and a bearish case of $1.8 to $3.

Key Takeaways: Arca’s Jeff Dorman criticized Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for referencing prediction market bets during the company’s earnings call. Armstrong mentioned crypto buzzwords like “Bitcoin” and “Web3” that users had wagered would appear. The incident reignited debate over market integrity. Dorman said Armstrong’s comments “mocked the industry” and undermined efforts to build institutional trust in crypto. Coinbase CEO Drops Bitcoin and Web3 Mentions After Tracking Prediction Market Bets At the end of the call on Thursday, Armstrong admitted he had been “tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call.” He then added the words “Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Staking, and Web3” – terms that users on Polymarket and Kalshi had wagered would be mentioned. His remark effectively allowed some bettors to win. Bloomberg reported that more than $84,000 was staked on whether those keywords would be said during the call. The moment quickly spread across social media, sparking debate over whether Armstrong’s actions were simply playful or potentially manipulative. Dorman wasn’t amused. “You need your head examined if you think it’s cute or clever or savvy that the CEO of the biggest company in this industry openly manipulated a market,” he wrote on X. He added that such behavior damages credibility, especially as firms like Arca work to position crypto as a serious, institutional asset class. I’m tired of dumping on Clownbase, but you need your head examined if you think it’s cute or clever or savvy that the CEO of the biggest company in this industry openly manipulated a market. It’s not fun working tirelessly for 8 years trying to educate institutional investors on… https://t.co/7XCJ8tYhMb — Jeff Dorman (@jdorman81) October 31, 2025 Polymarket, one of the platforms hosting the bets, reacted in jest, calling Armstrong’s actions “diabolical work.” However, the incident underscored how lightly regulated “mention markets” can be influenced when public figures knowingly reference their outcomes. Coinbase later clarified that its employees are barred from participating in prediction markets involving the company. Notably, Coinbase has invested in both Polymarket and Kalshi, and Armstrong used the same call to promote the firm’s new “Everything Exchange,” which may eventually support prediction markets. Responding to the backlash, Armstrong posted on X, “lol this was fun – happened spontaneously when someone on our team dropped a link in the chat.” lol this was fun – happened spontaneously when someone on our team dropped a link in the chat https://t.co/tQiV3B9jUj — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) October 31, 2025 Coinbase Rejects Senator’s Claim of Ties to Trump’s ‘Corruption Factory’ Coinbase has denied allegations from Senator Chris Murphy , who accused the exchange of being part of what he called President Donald Trump’s “corruption factory.” Murphy cited Coinbase’s donations to Trump’s inauguration and a new White House ballroom project, as well as its political spending through Fairshake, a crypto-backed super PAC that supported pro-crypto candidates. In response, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad called the claims “ridiculous,” saying the senator ignored “basic facts.” Shirzad clarified that Fairshake is a non-partisan PAC that supported both Republicans and Democrats, including several of Murphy’s Senate colleagues. He added that corporate donations to presidential inaugurations have been standard practice for decades and fully disclosed under campaign finance law. Addressing concerns over the ballroom donation, Shirzad said Coinbase’s contribution was part of a broader corporate effort through the Trust for the National Mall, alongside firms such as Apple, Google, and Ripple. The White House confirmed the ballroom’s $300 million cost is funded privately.

Meme tokens are showing fresh signs of life, and analysts say PEPE could be gearing up for another significant move. The latest Pepe Price Prediction suggests a possible breakout in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, as the frog-themed favourite prepares for action, attention is shifting quietly to Remittix (RTX) . This rising payments-focused cryptocurrency, some traders believe, could outperform meme tokens by a wide margin this year. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: Signs of a Breakout PEPE is currently trading at about $0.00000670, with support at $0.000010. In the last 48 hours, Pepe’s trading volume has increased by almost 20%, according to analysts, indicating a fresh surge in retail activity. Many anticipate a surge toward $0.000009–$0.000012 if PEPE closes above the resistance at $0.0000008. Although technical analysts warn that meme coins like PEPE frequently rely strongly on momentum and that sustained growth can be difficult in the absence of wider market support, the bullish scenario looks encouraging. The Meme Coin Fatigue Factor Even as meme coins recover, many investors are now diversifying into tokens with real-world utility. The last two cycles were dominated by hype, but this one is shifting toward projects offering practical use cases, DeFi, payments, and cross-chain integrations. That’s why growing sections of the market are calling PEPE “a short-term play,” while looking elsewhere for longer-term growth. Remittix: The Token Set To Outpace Meme Coins in 2025 This is where Remittix (RTX) enters the conversation. Built on Ethereum and expanding to Solana, Polygon, and Avalanche, Remittix isn’t another speculative DeFi project; it’s a cross-chain payments system designed for real-world use. The platform enables users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, instantly converting it to fiat with low gas fees and no involvement from centralised exchanges. The Remittix wallet beta is now live, with over 40,000 holders already testing the system. The project has raised $27.7 million, earned the #1 ranking on CertiK Skynet, and confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank. This combination of functionality and adoption is why analysts believe Remittix (RTX) could outperform many meme coins, with some projecting potential gains of up to 50x through 2025. While PEPE’s community keeps it relevant, Remittix’s real-world payments utility gives it staying power, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments of the cycle. Pepe Looks Promising, But Remittix Promises Real Utility Meme coins like PEPE may experience a short-term bounce as traders return to riskier plays. Still, long-term investors are starting to favour projects like Remittix (RTX) that combine real-world adoption with early growth potential. The Pepe Price Prediction shows room for upside; yet, the smarter bet might be balancing speculation with sustainability, and that’s precisely where Remittix shines.

Notably, analysis of on-chain data indicates that these assets are primarily within the privacy-focused sector. Despite the momentum, the overbought condition suggests that traders may need to wait on the sidelines, as such moves could trigger a price correction. Zcash (ZEC) Zcash ( ZEC ) has been one of the strongest-performing privacy coins in recent weeks, but its technical indicators now signal caution. As of press time, ZEC was trading around $417, down 0.09% in the last 24 hours and 3.51% over the past week, suggesting that short-term momentum may be cooling. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ), which measures market momentum, shows ZEC nearing 70, typically considered overbought. According to the latest RSI data, ZEC’s 15-minute RSI sits at 51.39, one-hour at 53.09, four-hour at 61.98, 12-hour at 72.51, and 24-hour at 77.07, placing it solidly in the overbought zone across longer time frames. ZEC RSI readings. Source: Coinglass Dash (DASH) On the other hand, Dash (DASH) IS displaying an even more aggressive overbought profile. The token is trading at $89.78, up 1.05% in the past 24 hours and an impressive 30.53% for the week, reflecting strong speculative buying. The RSI readings highlight this momentum: 15-minute at 63.06, one-hour at 78.76, four-hour at 91.45, 12-hour at 83.59, and 24-hour at 82.57, all deeply overbought. Dash RSI readings. Source: Coinglass Such elevated RSI levels suggest that DASH has entered an overheated zone where prices have surged much faster than underlying fundamentals can justify. Just like ZEC, the coin’s sharp rally follows renewed attention on privacy assets and a technical breakout above key resistance, but the probability of a pullback or consolidation phase is high. Despite these recent gains, DASH faces structural challenges, particularly from tightening global regulations on privacy coins, which could impact liquidity and exchange access.

The former exchange CEO was sentenced in 2023 to 11,196 years in jail for various financial crimes. Thodex CEO Might Have Committed Suicide: Turkish Minister On Saturday, November 1, Bloomberg reported that Ozer died in his prison cell in the F-Type High Security Closed Prison in the Western Turkish city of Tekirdag. Citing Turkish broadcaster TRT, Bloomberg revealed that the authorities are investigating the founder’s death, with a focus on the possibility of a suicide. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said in a statement: An investigation has been opened on this matter and is ongoing. The exact cause of death will be determined as a result of the investigation. But currently, the initial findings indicate that it was a suicide. Ozer was found hanging in the bathroom of his single-person prison cell, which led the investigative speculations on the cause of death being a suicide. However, the Tekirdag F-Type High Security Closed Prison has been called out in the past by some human rights organizations for its use of solitary confinement and small-group isolation. Ozer, who established the cryptocurrency exchange Thodex in 2017, fled to Albania after the abrupt collapse of his firm in 2021. Following his extradition from Albania in 2022, the former crypto CEO, along with his two siblings, was found guilty by an Istanbul court for various crimes, including aggravated fraud, money laundering, and running a criminal organization. Ozer revealed in a statement released shortly after the implosion of Thodex that he had thought of surrendering to law enforcement or committing suicide. However, the former exchange boss chose instead to flee Turkey for Albania in order to “stay alive and fight, work and repay my debts.” In the initial case brought against Ozer, the prosecutor estimated the total losses incurred by investors to be around $24 million after Thodex’s collapse. However, the Turkish media put the figures as high as $2 billion, while a data analytics firm reported a $2.6 billion loss. Crypto Total Market Cap At $3.66 Trillion As of this writing, the cryptocurrency total market capitalization stands at around $3.66 trillion, reflecting a 0.39% jump in the past 24 hours. However, a broader look shows that the market is on a downward trend, falling by nearly 10% in the past month.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto exchange|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|Faruk Fatih Ozer|Thodex,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 11:00:06

According to supporters of XRP, that headline misses a bigger picture: Ripple has been buying firms that touch much larger pools of money. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Shaves $5 Billion From Satoshi Nakamoto’s Untouched Fortune Western Union’s deal could steer over $100 billion in annual cross-border flow to Solana. But some say that sum is small compared with the pipelines Ripple is tying into. Trillions Not Billions Based on reports, Ripple has added firms that already sit inside massive payment and liquidity systems. Hidden Road, a global prime brokerage, clears about $3 trillion a year. GTreasury provides treasury tools that move trillions in payments across 160+ countries. Rail handles roughly 10% of all stablecoin-based payment volume worldwide. Those figures matter because ownership gives a different kind of access than a short-term partnership does. many of you have asked for my thoughts on the western union x solana announcement, so here they are. TLDR: billions are cool, but trillions are cooler. while western union handles billions of dollars each year, ripple is on its way to handling trillions of dollars each year.… — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 29, 2025 Market Comment And Skepticism Market voices pushed back. Scott Melker questioned XRP’s current role after Western Union chose Solana, noting Western Union had tested the XRP Ledger for years. That choice has prompted debate about whether XRP still matters for big global payments right now. At the same time, Ripple’s backers argue a deeper story exists beyond which chain a single company picks for its stablecoin. XRP As The Settlement Layer According to Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, the proper lens is scale. He says the conversation should not center on deals worth billions but on the trillions Ripple now touches through acquisitions. Kwok and others suggest those companies could be steered to use the XRP Ledger for settlement over time. Ripple’s own technology and business moves are being framed as the plumbing that could let XRP settle large, institutional flows. Supporters Speak Up Flare CEO Hugo Philion has also downplayed the Western Union news, saying it does not undercut Ripple’s strategy. Based on reports from community figures, some engineers and analysts now say XRP could shift from a bridge token to a place people hold value. There will come a time where XRP and XRPL is just where you keep most of your wealth. That is called Treasury. Hint hint. — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 17, 2025 Vincent Van Code told followers that “a time will come when XRP and the XRP Ledger are just where you keep most of your wealth,” a view which mirrors comments by Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz about users acting as their own banks. Ownership Vs. Partnerships When a company owns a platform, it can choose how that tool grows. Reports show acquisitions give Ripple a steadier role in payments and trading services than a single contract would. Yet ownership does not guarantee instant change. Moving institutional flows onto a specific ledger is complex and can take time. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters The Big Leagues — Stadium And Jerseys Get A Crypto Makeover What This Means Going Forward For now, the debate will track two threads. One asks whether wins like Western Union’s Solana deal signal broader market preference. The other watches whether Ripple’s purchases translate into actual settlement volume for XRP. Numbers such as $3 trillion, trillions across 160+ countries, and 10% of stablecoin payments give weight to the second view. But adoption at scale is not automatic, and observers will be looking for clear signs that those trillions are truly shifting toward the XRP Ledger.

The latest headline-maker came from Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , who took to X (formerly Twitter) to warn of a “massive crash” that could “wipe out millions.” Kiyosaki’s post, seen by 4.6 million users, urged investors to seek safety in silver, gold, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. MASSIVE CRASH BEGININING: Millions will be wiped out. Protect yourself. Silver, gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum investors will protect you. Take care — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 1, 2025 While his warnings echo broader concerns about overvalued markets, Bitcoin’s steady price suggests traders are not panicking. Instead, many are positioning around technical consolidation patterns that hint at a potential breakout. Bitcoin’s Technical Picture: A Tightening Triangle On the technical front, Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC’s price action shows a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic sign of narrowing volatility before a breakout. The cryptocurrency has found consistent support along its ascending trendline near $106,375, while overhead resistance remains capped at $111,675. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin trades close to its 50-period EMA, indicating equilibrium between bulls and bears. The RSI around 49 signals neutrality, while a series of higher lows points toward cautious accumulation. If Bitcoin closes decisively above $111,700, momentum could lift prices toward $116,350 or even $119,750, according to Fibonacci projections. Conversely, a dip below $106,000 could trigger a short-term correction toward $103,500, but technical support zones suggest downside risk remains limited. Key short-term signals traders are watching: Breakout confirmation above $111,700 to target $116,000+ Support holding at $106,000 to preserve bullish bias Increasing trading volume to confirm directional breakout Market Sentiment: Fear or Foundation for a Rally? While Kiyosaki’s warning adds a layer of uncertainty, it may also signal rising investor skepticism—a sentiment often seen before strong recoveries. Historically, Bitcoin has performed best when fear peaks but technical support holds firm. With its market cap above $2.2 trillion and a circulating supply nearing 19.94 million BTC, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. The asset continues to benefit from institutional inflows and post-halving optimism heading into 2025. If Bitcoin breaks above its tightening range, a rally toward $120,000 could unfold in the coming weeks, fueled by renewed risk appetite and speculation that the worst of market fear is already priced in. As volatility builds, the key question remains, will Kiyosaki’s crash warning mark the beginning of panic, or the perfect contrarian signal for Bitcoin’s next major breakout? Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $25.5 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013205 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

This comes as the parent company saw increased visibility across UFC matches, leading to an uptick of combat sports fans in crypto. Announced Thursday, $FIGHT, a combat sports utility token helping fans build digital identities on-chain, has raised $183 million in its Phase 2 Presale, surpassing the initial target of $1.5 million. The $FIGHT presale Phase 2 completed today on Holoworld, a Solana launchpad, showing increased demand for fan tokens in the MMA world. As a result, FIGHT, the app, reported more than 500K app sign-ups with Fight ID, topping up to the successful funding round. Fight ID provides fans and fighters a portable, on‑chain identity that helps them identify in the community, build a reputation, and own the sport. The token is developed by Fight Foundation, in conjunction with FightFi, to build an ecosystem that unites combat sports fans. Following the end of Phase 2 presale, participants will share 1% of the total $FIGHT supply (100 million tokens) and will be able to utilize the token on the platform. As the utility token, $FIGHT is used to incentivize fans, claim rewards, buy merchandise on FightID, and engage with combat sports fans, with other utilities set to be added in the future. The presale was launched on Holoworld on Solana, leveraging the fast speeds and low cost of the blockchain. The first presale was on BSC, also successfully raising more than the team planned, with over $15 million in demand, exceeding its original target by over 20x. Phase 1 participants were refunded by Holoworld before the launch of Phase 2 presale on Solana, a statement from Holoworld confirmed. A Striking Partnership With UFC The presale demand is heavily influenced by FightID’s partnership with the UFC, which was announced in September. The partnership offers recurring visibility for the platform and its token, building a presence amongst UFC fans every match week. According to its website, the partnership will allow Fight to be “promoted in the same rhythm that UFC cards are announced, marketed, and broadcast”. This means the company can tap into the millions of UFC fans and combat sports audiences watching around the globe during the marketing period, weigh-in day, and fight day. Additionally, it provides a gateway for new audiences to join the crypto ecosystem through a fun, competitive, and interactive channel. The goal is to drive fans to complete small actions that stake their claim in the fight world, such as creating a FightID, earning fighter points (FP), and learning how to use $FIGHT inside prediction markets, staking, and fighter communities. Uniting global fans through $FIGHT The UFC partnership drives new, mainstream combat sports fans into crypto natives. The company, however, targets a larger goal of transforming real-world fights into on-chain events. This opens a world of possibilities in predictions, fan support, and content creation in combat sports. The $FIGHT token revolutionizes how fans interact with the sport, giving them the opportunity to directly participate in the sport they love. The token has been designed to unite global fighting fans, capturing the thrill of combat sports and unlocking new ways for fans, athletes, and creators to participate. The token bridges the passion for martial arts and digital assets, introducing millions of people to Web3. According to its roadmap, the project will develop Fighthub, a platform for fan loyalty programs; the Fight.ID system for wallets and digital identities; Prize Fight, a dedicated reward fund tied to each athlete’s journey; and Fight Gear, high-end clothing available only within the FIGHT network. This gives extra utility for the $FIGHT token. The launch of $FIGHT will empower fans to participate through an ecosystem defined by identity, reputation, and ownership, the three key pillars of the project.

The White House released the full terms. The deal is meant to de-escalate the trade fight between both countries. It includes lowered U.S. tariffs, large Chinese purchases of American farm goods, and China reversing several export control and retaliation measures. Trump said the move will “reset the terms of trade” and shift how both countries manage critical supply chains and controlled materials. The deal also pauses China’s planned restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets. Those materials are required for chipmaking, EV motors, renewable power equipment, and weapons manufacturing. China will issue general licenses to allow exports of rare earths, gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite to U.S. companies and suppliers. The White House said this reverses Chinese controls announced in April 2025 and October 2022. Trump described the outcome as “a necessary step to stop market pressure tactics.” China suspends export controls and trade retaliation China will halt the global rollout of the new export controls it announced on October 9, 2025. It will also stop retaliation taken since March 4, 2025. That retaliation included tariffs on U.S. soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, pork, beef, chicken, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and aquatic products. China will also lift non‑tariff moves such as placing American firms on “unreliable entity” lists. Officials said the lists blocked companies from government procurement and domestic contracts. China will buy at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S. soybeans in the last two months of 2025, and at least 25 MMT each year in 2026, 2027, and 2028. China will also resume purchases of U.S. sorghum and hardwood logs. The White House said the volume commitments are tied to supply chain stabilization and market dependability. China will end investigations into U.S. companies in the semiconductor supply chain. Those include antitrust, anti‑monopoly, and anti‑dumping probes . China will also take actions to ensure trade resumes from Nexperia facilities in China. Those facilities produce legacy chips used in industrial, automotive, and defense systems. They had been limited due to trade friction. China will take “significant measures” to stop the movement of fentanyl precursors into the United States. China will block certain chemicals entirely from being sent to North America and will strictly control the export of others to all countries. The White House said this was required because fentanyl precursor supply chains rely heavily on Chinese chemical plants. United States lowers tariffs and delays enforcement actions The United States will reduce tariffs placed to curb fentanyl-linked imports by removing 10 percentage points from the cumulative rate. This change begins November 10, 2025. The U.S. will keep the current 10% reciprocal tariff in place during a suspension period lasting until November 10, 2026. The U.S. will also extend the expiration of certain Section 301 tariff exclusions from November 29, 2025 to November 10, 2026. The U.S. will delay the implementation of the Expansion of End‑User Controls rule for one year starting November 10, 2025. The U.S. will also suspend for one year actions tied to the Section 301 investigation into China’s maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. While paused, negotiations will continue. The U.S. will also keep coordination active with South Korea and Japan to support U.S. shipbuilding and technology supply chains. The agreement comes at the end of Trump’s Asia trip. In Malaysia, Trump signed reciprocal trade agreements with Malaysia and Cambodia, and announced negotiation frameworks with Thailand and Vietnam. Trump also signed critical minerals deals with Thailand and Malaysia. In Japan, Trump announced new projects linked to Japan’s $550 billion investment commitment in the U.S. and expanded energy and counter‑narcotics cooperation. In the Republic of Korea, he secured funding and industrial cooperation measures tied to maritime infrastructure, energy supply, and technology manufacturing.

Bitcoin is climbing toward record highs, and Ethereum’s strength continues to drive liquidity across the market. Yet, behind the scenes, the smartest money in crypto is rotating early—not into established giants, but into emerging AI-driven projects poised to dominate the next growth phase. At the center of that rotation stands Ozak AI , a groundbreaking AI-powered presale project currently priced at $0.012. With over $4.2 million raised, more than 980 million tokens sold, and partnerships spanning multiple blockchain ecosystems, Ozak AI is redefining what it means to invest early. Analysts believe a modest $3,000 entry today could grow into a $250,000 portfolio by 2026—an astonishing 83x return driven by one of crypto’s most compelling innovations. Why Ozak AI Is the Project Every Smart Investor Is Watching Ozak AI is capturing market attention for one powerful reason—it’s not a meme coin, and it’s not a speculative gamble. It’s a utility-focused project built at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain analytics. Its ecosystem revolves around AI prediction agents, autonomous systems that process blockchain transactions, market sentiment, and trading data in real time. These agents generate actionable insights and predictive signals for traders and institutions, helping them make smarter, faster, and more profitable decisions. This real-world functionality gives Ozak AI an edge over typical OZ presale tokens that rely purely on hype. The project’s use case aligns perfectly with two global megatrends—AI adoption and decentralized finance—making it one of the few early-stage tokens with the potential for sustainable long-term growth. Turning $3,000 Into $250,000 At its current presale price of $0.012, a $3,000 investment buys 250,000 Ozak AI tokens. If the token reaches $1 by 2026—a price many analysts consider realistic given its momentum—that same $3,000 turns into $250,000. Even at a more conservative target of $0.50, the bag would still be worth $125,000, representing a 40x ROI. These figures highlight the asymmetrical nature of Ozak AI’s opportunity—high upside, low initial capital, and enormous potential for early investors. Compare that to large-cap assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, where a 2x or 3x return is the best-case scenario in the current cycle. The difference is clear: Ozak AI isn’t a long hold for slow gains—it’s a high-leverage innovation play with the power to transform modest investments into generational wealth. Partnerships That Power Ozak AI’s Rise Ozak AI’s credibility is reinforced by its strategic partnerships with Perceptron Network, HIVE, and SINT—three leading organizations at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and data infrastructure. Perceptron Network connects Ozak AI to over 700,000 decentralized AI nodes, improving data accuracy and prediction speed. HIVE enhances the integration of market signals and blockchain analytics, strengthening the foundation for Ozak AI’s prediction agents. SINT contributes cross-chain functionality, SDK tools, and voice-driven interfaces, expanding accessibility across AI and DeFi environments. On top of this, Ozak AI has undergone audits by CertiK and Sherlock, providing the transparency and security that presale investors demand. These validations elevate Ozak AI from a high-potential idea to a credible long-term ecosystem. Why Whales and Early Traders Are Rotating Into Ozak AI Large investors are already positioning themselves before the next presale stage increase. Whales understand that the real money in crypto is made by entering before the hype—when valuations are still low and multipliers are massive. As Ozak AI prepares to transition to Stage 7, where token prices will rise, early entrants are locking in allocations before the next wave of retail FOMO hits. This rotation mirrors patterns from previous cycles: Bitcoin profits flow into Ethereum, then into altcoins—and finally into early-stage projects with breakout potential. In 2025, that breakout narrative belongs to AI-powered crypto, and Ozak AI is leading it. A $3,000 Decision That Could Define 2026 Every bull market has a project that changes the game—and this time, that project is Ozak AI. With an early presale price, strong partnerships, and real-world AI integration, it offers one of the highest risk-to-reward ratios in the market today. A $3,000 investment might seem small now, but in a market where timing is everything, it could build a $250,000 portfolio by 2026. The investors who saw the potential in Ethereum under $100 or Solana under $2 didn’t just buy tokens—they bought vision. In 2025, that same vision points directly to Ozak AI—the project redefining the future of crypto intelligence and the top flip opportunity for those who move before the crowd. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced facts analytics for monetary markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, correct, and actionable insights to help crypto fanatics and companies make appropriate decisions.

The company focuses on improving privacy, security, and user experience within the Zcash ecosystem. One of the most notable innovations on the roadmap is the “temporary transparent address” system. Now, when users exchange ZEC through NEAR Intents, a new temporary transparent address will be generated for each transaction. This mechanism aims to increase privacy and reduce the interconnectivity between different transactions. Additionally, transparent address rotation is being introduced. This feature will automatically create a new address after each fund transfer, further anonymizing users' transaction history. ECC has also introduced a new system to streamline device connection management for Zashi-Keystone users. Users can disconnect and resync their Keystone hardware wallets at any time. Related News: Reason Behind Today's Notable Altcoin Surge Is Now Clear: Developers Will Only Get Paid If the Price Increases Fivefold Additionally, P2SH multi-signature support will be implemented on Keystone devices. This feature will ensure the secure management of Zcash Development Fund resources, contributing to the sustainable growth of the ecosystem. While Keystone will initially be used with Lockbox access, all wallets with PCZT integration will be able to use Keystone for signing transactions. According to Coingecko data, the market capitalization of Zcash (ZEC) has surpassed $7 billion, reaching $7,010,784,529, marking a new all-time high for the project. The ZEC price has increased by 5.9% in the last 24 hours. The surge in investor interest is driven by the upcoming Zcash halving, which will reduce mining rewards and significantly reduce the circulating supply of new ZEC. *This is not investment advice.

The 2025 bull market is not just about these well-known players; there's a growing interest in newer, innovative projects that meld artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. One such project making headlines is Ozak AI . This AI-driven venture has intrigued the market not merely by its ambitious technological promises but also by its impressive early financial metrics. With over $4.2 million already secured through funding and more than 980 million tokens sold, Ozak AI's entry into the market is anything but quiet. Encircled by significant blockchain partnerships and an expanding ecosystem, it's set to redefine early-stage investing. What Makes Ozak AI Stand Out? Rather than riding the waves of transient trends like meme coins, Ozak AI stakes its claim in the crypto space with a sturdy foundation of utility and real-world application. Positioned at the convergence of AI and blockchain, it leverages advanced predictive agents which analyze real-time data to provide market insights. This functional edge primes Ozak AI not only for current relevance but sustainable future growth. Investment Projections: Turning $3,000 into $250,000 At the heart of the financial discussion is the potential for a modest $3,000 investment to burgeon into a quarter-million-dollar portfolio by 2026. This projection hinges on the token's presale price, currently at $0.012. Should the token price ascend to $1, early investors would reap substantial rewards, showcasing an 83x return. The projection remains robust even under conservative estimates. Should Ozak AI's token price hit $0.50, a $3,000 stake could still translate into $125,000—a 40x return. This underlines the asymmetrical investment potential offered by Ozak AI compared to more established cryptocurrencies where returns are typically more subdued. Strategic Partnerships Enhancing Growth Significant collaborations bolster Ozak AI's market position. Partnerships with entities like Perceptron Network, HIVE, and SINT facilitate a robust data infrastructure, enhancing the predictive capabilities of Ozak AI's platform. These partnerships not only validate its technological promise but also enhance its operational efficacy. Why Investors are Flocking to Ozak AI Understanding the unique position of Ozak AI in the market, whale investors and savvy traders are already positioning their stakes early. By investing before the project enters its next development stage, these early adopters are poised to benefit from the first-mover advantage before mainstream FOMO sets in. The Vision Driving Ozak AI Ozak AI isn't just another crypto project. It's a vision of the future where blockchain meets AI to create a new paradigm in data-driven financial insights. For those who saw potential in early giants at their nascent stages, Ozak AI represents a similar frontier of opportunity today. About Ozak AI Ozak AI melds AI with blockchain to offer real-time analytics and insights, shaping the future of financial decision-making in the crypto world.

Experts Highlight New Altcoin as Top Growth Pick,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-cryptocurrency-to-buy-for-q1-2026-experts-highlight-new-altcoin-as-top-growth-pick/,"With the next market cycle fast approaching, analysts and investors are turning their attention to early-stage projects with strong fundamentals and utility. Many believe that 2026 could be a breakout year for DeFi-based altcoins that go beyond speculation and focus on revenue-driven ecosystems. Among the new entrants making waves is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto that experts now rank as one of the potential best cryptocurrencies to buy for Q1 2026. Mutuum Finance’s ongoing momentum has already captured the attention of thousands of investors and raised millions in funding. The project’s unique lending design, token distribution model, and upcoming protocol launch are fueling optimism that MUTM could be one of the top crypto to watch heading into the new year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a non-custodial decentralized lending and borrowing platform that uses smart contracts to make crypto markets more transparent and secure. Its goal is to give users more flexibility and control when lending or borrowing assets, all while keeping everything automated and on-chain. The system operates through two complementary markets: The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to deposit tokens into liquidity pools. In return, they receive mtTokens, which are yield-bearing tokens that automatically earn interest. For example, depositing 1 ETH would generate 1 mtETH, which increases in value as borrowers repay their loans. This approach allows investors to earn passive income without needing to manually manage or move their assets. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace gives users the ability to set their own terms on loans for less common assets. Borrowers and lenders can agree on interest rates, collateral types, and durations directly, creating more customized opportunities. Strong Demand and Clear Structure Mutuum Finance’s presale continues to gain traction, with investors quickly filling each stage as the project nears its next price milestone. Currently in Phase 6, each MUTM token is priced at $0.035, while the next stage will raise the price to $0.04. The confirmed launch price is $0.06, meaning early investors are positioned for 100-500% MUTM appreciation at listings. From the total 4 billion token supply, 45.5% (1.82 billion MUTM) are allocated for presale distribution. The project has already raised over $18 million and attracted more than 17,600 holders, showcasing strong investor confidence and a steady rate of growth. So far, over 785 million tokens have been allocated, marking around 80% of Phase 6 completion. MUTM’s presale began at $0.01 in Phase 1, meaning the token’s value has already increased by 250% from its starting point. As each stage sells out faster than the previous one, momentum is building toward full allocation and final listing. To keep engagement high, the project features a 24-hour leaderboard, where the top daily contributor wins $500 worth of MUTM tokens. This approach keeps the presale transparent and interactive while strengthening community involvement. Upcoming V1 Launch and Security Milestones The most anticipated part of Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is its V1 protocol launch , scheduled for Q4 2025 on the Sepolia Testnet. This version will introduce the foundation of Mutuum Finance’s ecosystem, including the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and an automated Liquidator Bot that maintains balance and security within the system. V1 will support ETH and USDT as the first lending and borrowing assets, chosen for their stability and deep liquidity. Once fully tested, the team plans to expand support to additional tokens and deploy across other blockchain networks. Mutuum Finance has already completed a CertiK security audit, achieving a 90/100 Token Scan Score, one of the highest in its category. This ensures that its smart contracts meet high safety and reliability standards before launch. The project also runs a $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards developers for responsibly identifying any potential issues before mainnet deployment. Experts predict that the V1 launch could be the first major trigger for price momentum. If Mutuum Finance successfully transitions from presale to active usage, the token could see gains of 500% to 800% over the following 12 to 18 months, depending on market conditions. Why MUTM Could Lead Q1 2026 Market analysts are now listing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2026, pointing to its clear roadmap and token model that ties revenue directly to holders. They see several factors that could help MUTM outperform many existing DeFi projects once it launches. One of the key advantages is the presale pricing. Investors are currently entering at $0.035 per token, while the confirmed listing price is $0.06. If MUTM reaches between $0.30 and $0.40 within its first year — a range analysts describe as realistic — that would mean potential gains of around 700% to 900% from today’s level. Analysts also emphasize utility-based growth as a major strength. MUTM’s demand is tied to lending activity and protocol fees, which are used to buy tokens from the open market and distribute them to stakers. This creates ongoing demand and adds stability to the ecosystem, unlike meme coins that rely on social hype. Timing is another important factor. The V1 protocol launch, scheduled for Q4 2025, will allow MUTM to enter Q1 2026 with a working product, real users, and active liquidity. This positions the project for stronger adoption and sustained growth through the next cycle. Together, these points make Mutuum Finance stand out as one of the best cryptocurrencies to consider before 2026, offering both early-stage entry potential and real long-term utility.

The crypto market never sleeps, and investors are already positioning for the next breakout cycle. From meme coins that fuel viral excitement to blockchain giants that power real utility, several tokens stand out as top choices for 2025. This list brings together ten projects that blend long-term potential with high-energy community backing. Each crypto was chosen for unique strengths like staking, scalability, adoption, or viral reach. If you’re building a portfolio around the best cryptos to hold in 2025, these names deserve your attention. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Best Cryptos To Hold In 2025 MoonBull ($MOBU) is rewriting what meme coins can be. It’s a community-first token on Ethereum that rewards early believers through reflections, staking, and burns. Unlike typical hype coins, MoonBull focuses on transparency and sustainability, making it one of the best cryptos to hold in 2025 . Every trade strengthens its economy: part of each sale goes to liquidity, part to holders, and another part is burned forever. The project has two standout features. The first is trust. MoonBull’s audit has been completed, and its liquidity is locked, proving that safety isn’t optional. The second is a referral system that actually pays. Share your code, and you get 15% of your invitee’s purchase instantly, while your invitee receives 15% more tokens. The top referrers also earn monthly USDC bonuses. Together, these systems reward loyalty, encourage growth, and strengthen the community. MoonBull’s presale numbers are lighting up dashboards across the industry. The project is now in its 5th stage with a current price of $0.00006584 and over $500,000 raised. More than 1,700 holders have already joined. The ROI from Stage 5 to the listing price of $0.00616 is above 9,256%, while early supporters have seen 163% growth so far. The next stage is projected to bring a 27.4% price jump. To put it into perspective, a $20,000 investment at the current price is equivalent to about 303,766,707 MOBU tokens. At the listing price, that investment could grow to roughly $1.87 million. Why did this coin make it to this list? MoonBull earned its spot because it delivers fairness, passive rewards, and growth potential wrapped in meme energy. It’s not just hype; it’s structured to reward both early and long-term holders. 2. Aster (ASTER): Multi-Chain Trading Power Aster deserves its place among the best cryptos to hold in 2025 because it bridges decentralized trading and professional-grade performance.

Its roadmap combines entertainment with economics, giving meme traders both fun and functional rewards. The project’s presale has already drawn early whales, and its community is growing daily. The combination of staking, referral perks, and long-term tokenomics makes BullZilla a high-risk but high-potential coin for next year. Why did this coin make it to this list? BullZilla made it because it blends meme hype with real earning potential, a rare balance that fits today’s presale trend. 4. La Culex ($CULEX): The Stylish Meme Movement La Culex ($CULEX) is a design-driven meme coin built for traders who care about culture and branding as much as numbers. With its cool Buzz Gang mascot, La Culex sets itself apart through community engagement and clean Ethereum-based tokenomics. It features staking, giveaways, and burns that push organic growth. As an upcoming project, La Culex is still under development but is already generating strong buzz. Early supporters expect listings and partnerships that could ignite another wave of meme-coin enthusiasm. Why did this coin make it to this list? La Culex secured its place for its creativity, strong community roots, and potential to become a top meme coin for 2025. 5.

Despite past network issues, Solana has consistently bounced back and maintained a top-five market cap position. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana earned its place for speed, scalability, and ecosystem depth that support real blockchain adoption. 6.

Despite legal battles, Ripple continues to secure new partnerships and expand its tokenization and treasury solutions. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ripple remains a top hold due to its utility in international payments and its potential rebound following regulatory clarity. 8.

Most larger-cap alts are with minor losses over the past day, led by HYPE, BCH, HBAR, ZEC, and TAO. BTC Stopped at $111K For Now The primary cryptocurrency began the business week on the right foot, with a price surge to just over $116,000 on Monday. After a minor correction, it spiked above that line again on Tuesday, where it was stopped and pushed south hard. On Wednesday, BTC had calmed at around $112,000 before the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates for the second consecutive time in the past few months. Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop that drove it south to $110,000 and even lower on Thursday when the asset slipped below $106,500. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and initiated a leg up that drove BTC up to $111,500. However, that was a short-term rally once again, and bitcoin has been unable to run higher since then. In the past few hours, it tried to overcome $111,000 but to no avail so far. Its market cap has reclaimed the $2.2 trillion level on CG, while its dominance over the alts has stalled at 58%. BTCUSD.

The post distinguishes between blockchains built around middlemen and those that enable complete financial autonomy. It presents XRP as a solution for individuals seeking full control over their assets without relying on custodial institutions or permissioned systems. The statement underscores XRP’s role as a tool for financial self-determination, which enables users to transact securely and freely without intermediaries’ interference or taxation. Ripple : David Schwartz sums it up perfectly: $XRP isn’t about replacing banks it’s about removing them from the equation. No middlemen. No permission. No risk of freeze or clawback. The future of value is self-sovereign. pic.twitter.com/fziWqQooBM — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) October 30, 2025 XRP’s design and value proposition Schwartz emphasized that XRP’s integration with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) gives it a unique position in the digital asset space. The design ensures that XRP can directly capture some of the value generated by transactions conducted on the ledger. He noted that XRP is distinct because it operates without a counterparty, meaning it can be used and accessed globally with no risk of default, freeze, or clawback. This characteristic reinforces XRP’s appeal as a neutral, non-sovereign asset that functions across jurisdictions, independent of any single entity’s control. The argument also touches on the broader issue of trust and security in the blockchain ecosystem. While many networks rely on intermediaries to manage accounts or facilitate transactions, XRPL’s structure enables individuals to be their own banks. This design reduces dependency on third parties and mitigates the risks that arise when financial access is restricted or revoked. Schwartz’s comments reaffirm that XRP’s utility lies not in displacing banks but in removing their necessity for digital settlement and cross-border value exchange. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community perspectives and broader implications Following BankXRP’s post, community members echoed similar sentiments. An X user, Vincent Hees, described XRP as a direct challenge to the traditional correspondent banking model that benefits a limited few through Vostro and Nostro arrangements. He suggested that XRPL’s framework could represent a future where value moves globally without the constraints of legacy banking networks. The emphasis on self-sovereignty and accessibility aligns with the long-standing narrative around XRP as a bridge asset designed to facilitate efficient, borderless transactions. Rather than replacing financial institutions, XRP removes unnecessary barriers, offering a system that moves value transparently and securely. Schwartz’s comments, as highlighted by BankXRP, reinforce the principle that the future of finance may rely not on institutions, but on open, permissionless networks where control remains with the individual.

The world’s biggest meme coin, Dogecoin, is having a rough year, losing over 40% in the first ten months of 2025. Has Dogecoin fallen out of favor with meme coin enthusiasts, or is it just waiting for one good push before revealing its true potential? Well, House of Doge – the official corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation – has done something that might just trigger the next Dogecoin rally. In partnership with Brag House Holdings Inc., it has acquired a majority stake in the Italian football club US Triestina Calcio 1918 – a team that competes in the Serie C tournament. Under this arrangement, the club will feature the Dogecoin motif on the front of its official match shirts – for the remainder of the 2025/26 season and all of the 2026/27 campaign. We see sport as one of the most powerful platforms for accelerating Dogecoin adoption. By becoming the largest equity holder of US Triestina Calcio 1918, House of Doge is…setting the stage for Dogecoin to be integrated into everyday culture – from payments to partnerships to global fan experiences. Imagine the Dogecoin logo appearing in every single match photo and TV shot of a major football club! That would surely boost its visibility and give it the hype trigger it needs to bark loudly again. Plus, branding on t-shirts and match kits is just one part of the deal. The broader plan is to test $DOGE as a payment option for tickets, merchandise, and other concessions. Although the exact terms of how this Dogecoin-based financial system will be rolled out remain unclear, the companies involved are keen on making $DOGE more than just a representative of the meme coin space – they want to turn it into an actual payments token with practical uses and global acceptance. Here’s the kicker now : With Dogecoin primed for mainstream visibility and potentially a new wave of investors, it could be the catalyst behind the next surge of dog-themed meme coins. Of course, you don’t want to discount $DOGE itself; it’s still a solid investment. However, due to the token’s maturity, it’s now very difficult to deliver 1,000% rallies like we saw in 2017 and 2021. By the way, this is also what we’re seeing with Bitcoin. That doesn’t mean you have to miss out on those kinds of true ‘crypto-like’ returns. This is why backing another Doge-themed altcoin that’s still under the radar and yet to hit the mainstream could be a very smart move. Enter Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Maxi Doge is Dogecoin on Steroids Maxi Doge isn’t one to shy away from its true nature. It proudly admits that it has no underlying utility or game-changing roadmap. That said, the mission it carries is what’s attracting investors and making $MAXI one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . Maxi and Doge go a long way back. In fact, according to Maxi, they belong to the same family and are distant cousins. Now, because of Dogecoin’s early success and fun-loving vibe, he stole away all the limelight from his younger cousin Maxi, who then had to spend his childhood in loneliness. And that exact hurt is what’s driving $MAXI to challenge his elder cousin’s dominance in the meme coin space. He doesn’t just want to become the next 1000x crypto – he wants to outperform Dogecoin and, for once, make him feel what he felt – but this time on a much larger scale, stealing attention from investors and traders alike. That’s also why Maxi Doge became everything Dogecoin is not. Compared to Dogecoin’s slim arms and cutesy aura, Maxi Doge is built like the Hulk, with protein shakes and caffeine in his veins, embodying the true spirit of a degen crypto trader, eyes red from staring at charts day and night. Decoding Maxi Doge’s Master Plan Maxi Doge’s developers have hit the nail on the head when it comes to knowing what it takes to become a top-trending crypto. That’s why they’ve reserved a whopping 40% of $MAXI’s total token supply for marketing purposes. This includes PR pushes, social media campaigns, and high-ticket influencer collaborations, all aimed at spreading Maxi Doge’s gym-bro humor across the crypto landscape. On top of that, $MAXI also plans to offer several community benefits. These include holder-only weekly trading events, complete with engaging competitions and leaderboard prizes. Then there’s Maxi’s ambition to list on futures platforms. This fired-up ‘dawg’ doesn’t want to settle for just CEX and DEX listings. By making itself available on the futures derivatives market, $MAXI wants to go toe-to-toe with Dogecoin in every possible arena. Not to mention, this will allow degen meme coin traders to use $MAXI as the perfect tool for their leveraged bets. Buy $MAXI’s Presale for Maximum Gains Maxi Doge ’s biggest selling point is that it’s a low-cap coin, giving you the chance to get positioned before what could turn out be a 2017-Dogecoin-like rally. Currently in presale, $MAXI has already attracted over $3.87M from early investors who, credit to its absurd yet amusing mission, are backing this token to become the next crypto to explode . Is this your first time buying a meme coin in presale? Check out our guide on how to buy $MAXI in four simple steps. Right now, one $MAXI token is available for just $0.000266. And according to our $MAXI price prediction : The token could hit a high of $0.0058 by the end of 2026, delivering a massive 2,000% ROI from current levels. But if you’re in it for the long haul, you’ll be glad to know that $MAXI could reach $0.01 by 2030 – a gobsmacking 3,600% return potentially on the cards. Grab your $MAXI tokens today – and join the next wave of dog meme coins. Disclaimer : Kindly do your own research before investing, as crypto is highly volatile and unpredictable.

It’s reflecting steady activity despite mild consolidation. As the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum continues to show resilience amid shifting macroeconomic sentiment, holding a market cap of $466.6 billion. With traders eyeing year-end momentum, technical indicators suggest ETH may be building toward a significant breakout, potentially targeting $4,500 by December 2025. Ethereum’s Price Consolidation Near $3,800 The ETH/USD pair has been consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, forming higher lows since October. This compression phase, marked by reduced volatility, typically signals an approaching breakout. Key support sits at $3,680, while resistance near $4,030 defines the short-term range. The RSI near 46 remains neutral, hinting at equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, the 50-period EMA has flattened, reflecting short-term indecision. Yet, the pattern’s geometry and Ethereum’s structural strength, particularly its consistent higher lows, suggest a bullish bias once momentum picks up. If ETH closes decisively above $4,030, it could trigger a move toward $4,250 and $4,485, both previous reaction highs and critical resistance levels. Bullish Continuation Pattern on Weekly Chart On the weekly timeframe, Ethereum maintains a bullish flag pattern, a continuation signal often preceding upward extensions in an existing uptrend. This flag structure is supported by strong fundamentals, rising on-chain activity, scaling upgrades, and sustained institutional inflows into Ethereum-based ETFs and staking products. Ethereum Weekly Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key technical markers include: Support: $3,513 and $2,734 Resistance: $4,960 and $6,353 RSI: Hovering around 63, showing steady bullish momentum If ETH breaks the $4,960 resistance, it could accelerate toward the Fibonacci 1.0 level at $6,353, with potential long-term extensions to $8,136 under favorable market conditions. December 2025 Outlook and Trade Setup Ethereum price prediction remains bullish as ETH’s tightening structure suggests that traders may soon face a pivotal moment. A breakout above $4,000–$4,100 would validate bullish continuation, opening long setups toward $4,500 by December 2025. Conversely, a failure to hold above $3,680 may invite short-term weakness, but major supports remain intact above $3,500. For long-term investors, Ethereum’s combination of robust network demand, consistent upgrades, and historical trend behavior supports a constructive outlook. A breakout from the flag could mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next major cycle, one that might redefine its valuation heading into 2026. Ethereum Price Forecast: ETH Eyes $4,250 Breakout as Triangle Pattern Tightens Ethereum (ETH/USD) is trading near $3,866, consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern as traders anticipate a decisive move. The chart reveals converging trendlines between support at $3,680 and resistance at $4,030, suggesting that volatility is tightening before a potential breakout. Despite a slight dip of 0.29% in the past 24 hours, Ethereum’s market cap remains above $466 billion, maintaining its dominance as the second-largest cryptocurrency. The 4-hour EMA structure indicates indecision, with price action hovering around the 50-period EMA, while the RSI at 46 signals neutrality. This positioning often precedes sharp directional moves as buyers and sellers compete for control near the pattern’s apex. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview From a technical perspective, Ethereum is forming a series of higher lows, reflecting cautious accumulation despite macro uncertainty. If ETH successfully breaks above $4,030, traders could see a swift move toward the $4,250 and $4,485 resistance zones, both aligning with the upper boundary of the triangle and prior swing highs. A close above these levels would likely confirm a bullish breakout, potentially extending the rally toward $4,750. However, a breakdown below $3,680 could shift sentiment, exposing $3,500 and $3,350 as key downside targets. Watch for confirmation through candlestick behavior such as a bullish engulfing for upside validation or a bearish breakout candle for downside continuation.

This initiative forms part of the European Commission’s comprehensive strategy to create a competitive market, which is expected to surpass that of the US and other rivals. The newly proposed regulation would extend ESMAs’ direct supervision capabilities over the most critical of European Union-wide and cross-border firms in the market. As it now stands, every EU member state has a separate regulator responsible for monitoring these stock exchanges, as well as other markets. The proposal, according to the Commission, will deliver regulatory expertise while enabling a suitable cross-border exchange trading environment for new European businesses and investors. The initiative is also crucial for the EU’s objective of completing its Capital Markets Union. The Commission will present the market integration package in December. This would be the draft law to genuinely expand ESMAs’ ruling authority. The ESMAs plan would also provide for national agency disputes to be resolved. If they involve large cross-border operations between asset agency sectors or globally active financial sectors, disputes may arise between their national bodies. National divides emerge over centralized oversight Numerous endorsements for the initiative have been heard from the leading capitals , but support still varies across member states. For example, France, a long-time supporter of the single market’s regulator, firmly endorses the idea , claiming that it will prevent the phenomenon of regulatory arbitrage, where companies incorporate in a state with lenient regulation to serve the rest of the EU. Germany had historically been reluctant to cede financial control to Brussels, but the current government, led by Friedrich Merz, has changed its stance. The vast majority of EU countries perceive it as an understanding that Europe must restructure its market and adapt to keep up with the times. However, some countries, such as Luxembourg, Ireland, and Malta, are not so enthusiastic. They argue that ESMA supervision would weaken their financial sectors and deprive them of the expertise of their local watchdogs. Representatives of these countries argue the best solution is to balance centralization with convergence and coordination between EU- and EEA-level regulators. Some industry groups are also concerned. Fund associations and major exchange operators emphasize that working with the national watchdog ensures maximum personalization. They argue that doing business with one-size-fits-all ESMA could result in higher compliance costs and more bureaucratic hurdles. For cryptocurrencies in particular, ESMA has not yet prepared a specifically adapted regulation for the sector. EU reform reshapes stock and crypto markets The reform also intends to simplify cross-border operations for Europe’s stock exchanges. Large trading venues would no longer need to interact with dozens of national regulators; they would instead be accountable to ESMA. Furthermore, the situation may help to harmonize standards while lowering administrative expenses. For crypto-asset service providers, the change is even more pronounced. Currently, crypto firms are regulated under the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, which grants national-level licensing but allows firms to operate Europe-wide using a mechanism known as “passporting”. Instead, the biggest and most systemically relevant crypto firms would be subject to immediate ESMA oversight. This may be a positive development, as it would put pressure on more enforcement and guarantee uniformity throughout the bloc. It is projected that enforcing a more homogeneous strategy may make things harder for so-called regulatory shopping and help close previous oversight gaps, ensuring that fewer harmful firms manage to slip through the cracks. For investors, the model offers enhanced levels of protection and transparency. A powerful regulator would have more resources to address potential cross-border concerns, guaranteeing no regulatory loopholes, and enforcing stricter surveillance of market manipulation. The model has a local touch, according to the Commission. Local authorities will still be responsible for overseeing small firms and conducting daily supervision. ESMA will have oversight over organizations that operate across multiple nations or are critical to the economy.

Specifically, the trader currently holds 39,000 ETH worth $151 million at an average entry of $3,845.33, 1,070 BTC valued at $118 million at $110,114.10, and 569,050 SOL worth $105 million at $198.23, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved from Lookonchain by Finbold on November 2. Crypto trader’s long position. Source: Lookonchain He has also placed limit orders to add 40,000 SOL about $7.36 million to his long position at $184, showing confidence in Solana’s potential rebound despite recent volatility. This move follows his previous set of trades on October 30, when he also went long on the same three assets, holding 1,039 BTC worth $114 million, 560,840 SOL valued at $109 million, and 13,419 ETH worth $52.66 million. Interestingly, over an 18-day period, the trader completed 14 trades with a 100% win rate, realizing more than $16 million in profit. With the trader going long again, it appears he’s betting on a market rebound, signaling strong confidence in a potential rally. Bitcoin fails to make major moves Notably, the market, led by Bitcoin, briefly rebounded after suffering steep losses earlier in the week, stabilizing around the $110,000 level as both bulls and bears showed little conviction to push prices decisively either way. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $110,734, up about 0.5% in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum was at $3,872, down less than 0.1% over the same period. Notably, the bearish sentiment follows Bitcoin’s first monthly loss since 2018, ending a seven-year streak that once made October a “lucky” month for crypto traders. The broader market also mirrored declines in gold and equities, retreating from record highs amid rising investor uncertainty. The sell-off intensified after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and hinted at export restrictions on key software, triggering the largest crypto liquidation on record. Despite easing trade tensions, the market has shown little sign of recovery. Prices remain partly weighed down as institutional investors stay cautious, with exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) witnessing notable outflows in the past week. A resumption of inflows could, however, trigger renewed bullish sentiment.

Anutin was present at the 32nd APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting (Session II), which was held in Gyeongju, South Korea, under the theme “Preparing a Future-Ready Asia–Pacific.” The event started with an opening remark delivered by the President of the Republic of South Korea, Lee Jae Myung, before leaders from other countries in the APEC region were invited to deliver their statements. Thailand’s PM urges regional support to strengthen digital security In his statement, the Thai PM noted that over the last 36 years, APEC has been the main driver of the Asia-Pacific region, pushing the region to become the engine of global economic growth. However, he concedes that the world is undergoing rapid changes driven by advances in technology, demographic shifts, and climate change, noting that these challenges have been testing the resilience and adaptability of the region. He mentioned that APEC needs to continue its good work of emphasizing stability, innovation, and adaptability. In this regard, Thailand proposed three key approaches to achieve this. The first is to promote regional cooperation and inclusive growth, while the second is to be a leader in the artificial intelligence space. Lastly, he noted that they also need to focus on digital transformation, noting that Thailand believes that it would be meaningless if any nation in the region is left behind. According to Charnvirakul, a deeper regional economic integration would ensure that the benefits of growth are shared across all sectors, particularly among the most vulnerable groups in society. He also strongly noted the need for APEC to take a lead in developing AI and advancing digital transformation. He highlighted that it should be developed on the principles of trust, responsibility, equitable access, and safety. Thailand has developed AI ethics guidelines, ensuring that emerging technologies are designed and used safely and fairly. Charnvikarul highlights the rising rate of cybercrime Charnvikarul also talked about addressing the issue of cybercrime . “At the same time, Thailand stresses the urgency of addressing cybercrime, particularly online scams and human trafficking — cross-border threats that require concerted regional action,” Mr Anutin said. He noted that this includes aspects like information sharing, harmonized law enforcement, and raising public awareness against the different types of incidents and how people can avoid falling victim. He thanked South Korea and the United States for their leadership in this area, noting that Thailand is prepared to collaborate with the pair through the Anti-Online Scam Operation Center (AOC) and the APEC Online Scams Exchange Forum. The PM also mentioned that Thailand has advanced policies to ensure the well-being of people of all ages, including expanding universal healthcare coverage, implementing smart family planning, and promoting employment opportunities. “In an increasingly borderless and uncertain world, no economy can stand alone. If Apec can move forward in unity, it will continue to be a vital engine of global progress,” the PM said. “The road ahead may not be easy, but Apec will walk it together — with strong cooperation and shared purpose — to build a region that is connected, sustainable, and truly future-ready.” Industry Minister Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana also hailed the government led by the PM, noting that he has only been in office for about a month, but it is clear that Thailand is gradually returning to the attention of the global population. He mentioned that the PM recently took part in the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting with the APEC Business Advisory Council, where he showcased Thailand’s potential to the international community.

Its trading volume has surpassed $2.16 billion. Despite this rebound, XRP is trapped below a solid resistance level of around $2.60. That’s a level where technical indicators signal a decisive move could unfold soon. With a market cap of $153 billion, XRP maintains its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, but traders are watching key levels closely as momentum narrows within a tightening structure. XRP/USD Technical Picture: Descending Triangle Pressure XRP’s daily chart displays a descending triangle pattern , a setup often associated with bearish continuation when support gives way. The upper trendline connecting lower highs from $3.15 continues to limit upward momentum, while support around $2.54 acts as the final buffer for bulls. XRP Price Alert: XRP is testing the $2.60 resistance — the final hurdle before a potential breakout toward $3.00. A close above $2.72 could trigger a rally, while a drop below $2.54 risks a move toward $2.02. The battle between bulls and bears is heating up #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/2vLqM9TFYS — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) November 2, 2025 Despite the recent price uptick, XRP trades below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggesting sellers still dominate near-term sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) consolidates near 48, signaling neutral momentum but revealing a bearish divergence. Price has stabilized, while RSI has failed to make new highs. Such divergence often warns of weakening buying power and the potential for trend exhaustion. Recent candle patterns, mainly Doji and spinning tops, reflect indecision. Traders will be watching for a bullish engulfing candle to confirm renewed strength or a bearish breakout to affirm continuation toward lower targets. XRP Key Levels and Potential Scenarios XRP price prediction remians bearish, howeverm if XRP breaks above $2.60–$2.72, momentum could accelerate toward $3.00, where the next resistance cluster sits. A sustained close above this range may validate a short-term bullish reversal, targeting $3.15, the peak of the previous consolidation phase. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, a failure to hold above $2.54 may expose the next downside targets near $2.26 and $2.02, both aligned with the lower boundary of the descending triangle. Bullish Scenario: Breakout above $2.60 opens path to $3.00–$3.15. Bearish Scenario: Breakdown below $2.54 risks fall to $2.26–$2.02. XRP Trade Setup and Outlook For active traders, a short position below $2.54 targeting $2.02 offers a favorable risk-to-reward profile, with a stop-loss near $2.73. On the other hand, a breakout above $2.72 could justify long positions aiming for $3.00. Until one direction prevails, XRP’s movement remains finely balanced between consolidation and a breakout, making $2.60 the crucial pivot to watch for the next major move.

White Whale, the anonymous account that helped expose MEXC’s frozen funds crisis, is now stepping in to help reform the exchange, not as a paid contractor, but as an unpaid advisor. The development came after MEXC executive Cecilia Hsueh publicly apologized to White Whale over the mishandling of his account, which triggered a widespread thread from X user Mystral accusing MEXC of allegedly freezing millions in user funds and engaging in sexual relations with one another. Behind the scenes, Cecilia and the White Whale had held a one-hour video call, and what came next was even more unexpected: White Whale offered to support the exchange’s turnaround efforts, despite having helped lead the campaign that damaged its credibility. “My offer… was sincere,” White Whale shared on X. “If you truly want to fix what was broken—I’ll support you.” He offered to join MEXC’s effort with no compensation, citing his experience building and managing platforms. “A better MEXC only improves crypto as a whole,” he added. Cecilia accepted the offer publicly: “We’d be more than happy to have you onboard as an advisor,” she replied. “We’re genuinely grateful for the push you gave us, it became the catalyst for MEXC’s transformation.” She also acknowledged their “rounds of back and forth,” but said both sides now share the same goal. Execs respond to sex rumor fallout, launch fund recovery channel As for the viral thread’s alleged orgy videos involving MEXC executives, Cecilia responded directly, saying: “People enjoy tearing women down by inventing sexual rumors. It’s pathetic.” White Whale publicly backed her, saying: “She is not the woman in the video.” He criticized users who sent him the leaked clip, stating, “Right is right and wrong is wrong… truth still matters.” The defense earned Cecilia’s praise: “Thanks for speaking up and having the integrity to say the truth.” Meanwhile, MEXC has also launched new recovery channels for frozen funds, admitting the “most frustration” came from MEXC’s internal risk control system. “If your account has been frozen, we’ve opened two fast-track channels and streamlined the unfreezing process,” she wrote, linking support head Derrick Yeo’s Twitter and Telegram. The announcement racked up over 433,000 views, followed by another update 17 hours later: “Users who provided the required info have been unfrozen in batches,” she said. She asked for patience, clarifying that Telegram support was overloaded, and Twitter DMs were the preferred channel going forward. Max Lee case triggers friction with MEXC leadership One major flashpoint has been the situation of Maxuel (Max) Lee, a trader who posted screenshots showing over $3.3 million USDT locked in his account for 20 days, with five failed withdrawal attempts between October 11–13. Cecilia pushed back against the claims, saying Max never responded to earlier requests for UID verification. “We found no such account with this amount frozen,” she wrote. “Our CS team and I have both asked him to provide UID, but there has been no reply until now. If we were wrong and you really have this issue, my dm is open.” She also added, “Spreading rumors won’t help.” Max’s post had originally said, “At first, I genuinely believed it was a bug or system error. But now, I’ve been told my account had ‘abnormal profit.’ No proof. Just frozen forever.” Earlier, Cecilia claimed that:- “In the past 17 hours, users who provided the required info have been unfrozen in batches.

According to his analysis , the fund has surpassed $100 million in assets under management within just one month of launch—a performance that exceeds the early growth rate of several initial Bitcoin ETFs. This rapid accumulation, he emphasized, is not being driven by retail participants but by institutional investors quietly positioning themselves for the next phase of market expansion. The analyst explained that while public debate often centers around short-term market direction or chart patterns, institutional players are steadily accumulating regulated assets through approved financial vehicles. The approval and rapid success of the Rex Osprey ETF, he noted, represent an important shift in the structure of XRP investment exposure. It signals the beginning of institutional adoption on a scale previously unseen for the digital asset, supported by the legal clarity and custodial frameworks that traditional financial entities require. #XRP THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING pic.twitter.com/seT92k2mZy — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 31, 2025 Institutional Entry and Regulatory Readiness Ripple Bull Winkle underlined that the presence of established ETF providers like Rex and Osprey signals the growing alignment between digital assets and regulated financial markets. He indicated that approximately two dozen additional XRP ETFs are awaiting approval , pending broader government decisions on reopening pathways for new filings. Once these approvals are granted, he believes the market will experience a chain reaction similar to what occurred following the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, when capital inflows accelerated dramatically. The analyst described this development as part of a larger shift toward “regulated rails” — the infrastructure that enables major funds, banks, and institutions to allocate capital into compliant digital asset products. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He noted that XRP fits these institutional preferences through established liquidity, proven transaction efficiency, and confirmed asset status in regulatory contexts. For these reasons, he argued, it is now being positioned as a cornerstone of upcoming institutional portfolios. Market Reaction and Broader Implications Reactions from the crypto community have largely aligned with this perspective. One X user, X Finance Bull, stated that “Rex + Osprey just made XRP institutional-grade overnight,” underscoring the significance of this milestone for professional investors. The overall sentiment reflects growing acknowledgment that institutional infrastructure around XRP is maturing rapidly. If these trends continue, XRP could see a broader wave of institutional integration, driven by ETF adoption and clearer regulatory conditions. For now, the $100 million benchmark reached by the Rex Osprey ETF stands as a measurable indicator of shifting market dynamics that suggests institutional participation in the XRP ecosystem.

The outlook is based on a comparison of Bitcoin’s current monthly price structure to previous bull market cycles, particularly the parabolic rallies of 2016–2017 and 2020–2021. In an X post on November 1, Martinez noted that each of those cycles followed a period of consolidation, then a strong breakout that coincided with a bullish crossover on the MACD indicator, a popular momentum gauge. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Currently, Bitcoin appears to be trading in a similar pattern, with the MACD histogram turning positive, a signal that has historically preceded explosive growth phases. In the 2016 cycle, Bitcoin surged over 4,000%, while the 2020 rally delivered gains of nearly 1,500%. If this pattern repeats, Martinez implies Bitcoin could mirror those exponential moves, potentially reaching $250,000 by December. Notably, with Bitcoin opening November in a consolidation phase around $110,000, such a move would require extraordinary momentum and macro conditions similar to previous peaks, including sustained institutional inflows and renewed retail enthusiasm. Has BTC price peaked? Indeed, Bitcoin’s recent stall has led to speculation that the asset may have already reached the peak of the current cycle. However, insights from crypto trader Ted Pillows challenge that notion. In an X post on November 1, Pillows stated that in past cycles, Bitcoin typically set new all-time highs after its halving event, followed by a rapid, euphoric surge and a sharp correction of 60% to 70%. This time, however, the narrative is shifting. Bitcoin recorded a new all-time high before the 2024 halving, a first in its price history, and the uptrend since then has been steadier than in previous explosive cycles. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows The cryptocurrency has also spent nearly six months consolidating above the $100,000 level, a behavior Pillows said is atypical of a blow-off top, where prices usually spike and collapse quickly. The prolonged consolidation, he argued, suggests a stronger structural base and ongoing institutional accumulation. While analysts acknowledge the potential for a pullback, Pillows contends that the traditional post-peak pattern may not apply. He noted that the current setup points to a different market environment than in prior cycles. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $111,076, up nearly 1% in the past 24 hours but down about 2% on the weekly timeframe. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At current levels, Bitcoin remains comfortably above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $114,247, signaling short-term bullish momentum as the asset holds a premium over this key support level. However, it sits below the 200-day SMA of $105,861, reflecting a longer-term bearish tilt and potential vulnerability to deeper pullbacks if momentum fades. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 46.37, indicating neither overbought exhaustion nor oversold conditions, suggesting sideways consolidation is likely in the near term unless a decisive catalyst emerges.

According to trade disclosures filed Friday, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) purchased 72,537 Bullish shares, ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) acquired 21,354 shares, and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) bought an additional 11,122 shares. The combined purchases amount to over $5 million in new exposure to Bullish, further strengthening ARK’s position in the exchange. This move follows an earlier $8.27 million investment made in mid-October across ARK’s funds. Since Bullish’s $1.1 billion listing, ARK has accumulated roughly $172 million worth of shares across multiple ETFs, underscoring its growing confidence in the platform’s long-term potential. Bullish Shares Rebound After Market Volatility Bullish stock closed at $50.57 on Friday, marking a 1.24% increase and a recovery from recent market turbulence. The exchange, founded by Block.one and led by CEO Tom Farley, has quickly become one of the most watched digital asset platforms following its NYSE debut. Farley, the former president of the New York Stock Exchange, has been steering Bullish’s expansion strategy to position it as a leader in regulated crypto trading. Celebrating the U.S. Expansion The timing of ARK’s latest purchase coincides with Bullish’s U.S. launch celebration in New York, where the firm hosted an event featuring leading figures in the digital asset industry. “The energy in the room said it all — the future is Bullish,” the company posted on X following the event. Earlier in October, Bullish officially began operations in 20 U.S. states after securing both a BitLicense and a money transmission license from New York regulators. Its first U.S. clients include BitGo and Nonco, which began spot trading on the platform as part of Bullish’s initial market rollout. Global Growth and Trading Volume Since its international launch in 2021, Bullish has processed more than $1.5 trillion in trading volume and now ranks among the top 10 exchanges globally for Bitcoin and Ether transactions. The exchange’s rapid growth and its regulatory approval in the U.S. suggest that it could become a major player in bridging traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-02 12:36:02

The first-ever staking-enabled spot Solana ETFs from Bitwise ($BSOL) and Grayscale ($GSOL) launched within a day of each other last week and have taken the market by absolute storm. Put together, they’ve recorded nearly $200M in inflows since launch , and that doesn’t even include their seed capital. That said, it’s worth mentioning that $BSOL, which launched on October 28, a day prior to Grayscale’s $GSOL, currently dominates this two-player party with over $197M in net inflows. $BSOL, by the way, pulled in a staggering $69.5M in inflows on its very first day , making it the biggest crypto ETF launch since Ethereum. What a week for $BSOL, besides the big volume, it led all crypto ETPs by a country mile in weekly flows with +$417m. It also ranked it 16th in overall flows for the week. Big time debut – Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas According to Eric Balchunas, the fact that $GSOL launched a day after $BSOL caused it to lose some steam, as investors poured into the first available opportunity. Even so, $GSOL’s $2.2M in cumulative net inflows is impressive, especially considering it carries a higher 0.35% fee, compared to 0.2% for $BSOL. Such strong investor interest in a product that makes crypto more accessible to the public is a clear sign that there is undoubtedly huge demand for these tokens. This also means that despite the last few weeks of sideways action across the crypto landscape – whether that’s Solana, Bitcoin, or Ethereum – it’s only a bump in the road. In all likelihood, it’s a healthy consolidation phase where crypto is resting and gathering steam before its next major rally. Now, if you want to get positioned before the larger bullish trend resumes, consider investing in low-cap, under-the-radar altcoins that could 10x, 100x, or even 1000x your investment. Here are our top three suggestions for the best altcoins to buy now . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bringing Real-World Utility to Bitcoin with Solana-Like Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) allows you to ride Bitcoin’s foray into real-world utility and potentially make life-changing returns in the process. That’s because $HYPER is building a new Layer-2 solution that will bring Solana-like speeds, low fees, and Web3 support to Bitcoin. It will do so by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which will empower $HYPER to execute thousands of transactions simultaneously, as long as they’re unrelated. On top of that, developers on Bitcoin will also be able to use $HYPER to build smart contracts and decentralized applications, finally opening the door to Web3 and DeFi on Bitcoin. So, if you buy Bitcoin Hyper , you’ll be able to access high-speed DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance, lending, staking, swapping, and gaming dApps on Bitcoin – without having to leave Bitcoin’s secure environment. It’s worth noting that a non-custodial canonical bridge will power seamless interaction between Bitcoin’s Layer-1 and Hyper’s Layer-2 networks. It’ll lock your original Bitcoin and mint an equivalent amount of Layer-2 compatible tokens, allowing you to seamlessly access the SVM-powered Web3. The best part? Bitcoin Hyper is currently in presale, which means you can grab it for a super low price of $0.013205. And according to our $HYPER price prediction , those who get in now could make a staggering 1,400% ROI by the end of 2026. Join the Bitcoin Web3 revolution – buy $HYPER today for just $0.013205. 2. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) – Unique Mine-to-Earn Cryptocurrency Project PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is offering a never-before-seen way to engage in crypto mining. Its gamified mining ecosystem, albeit virtual, offers real rewards. All you have to do is buy $PEPENODE tokens , furnish the empty virtual server room you get with meme nodes, and create the perfect mining setup to rank as high as possible on PepeNode’s mining leaderboard. When PepeNode’s TGE (token generation event) completes and its virtual mining simulator goes live, rewards in the form of free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FARTCOIN tokens will be distributed to the top players on the leaderboard. The best part about PepeNode is that, unlike traditional crypto mining, it’s extremely affordable and doesn’t require any technical know-how to get started. The only caveat is that you’ll need to experiment with different combinations of meme nodes, since each one carries unique characteristics, mining capabilities, and compatibility factors. Currently in presale, PepeNode has already raised over $2M from early investors, with each token priced at just $0.0011272. Based on our $PEPENODE price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $642 by the end of 2026, and potentially $2,300 by the end of 2030. Buy $PEPENODE today – and be part of the biggest next-gen mining platform. 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Donald Trump’s Personal Meme Coin Preparing for a Leg Up OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) absolutely skyrocketed immediately after listing, coming from nowhere to become the 5th biggest meme coin in the world. However, since then, Donald Trump’s declining popularity among market participants, largely due to his tariff wars, has led to a steady decline in $TRUMP’s price. Now though, in light of the U.S.’s latest trade deal with China and Donald Trump’s pro-crypto moves, most notably his pardoning of the hyper-popular Binance founder CZ, a strong revival has taken place in his own meme coin, which is now up over 40% in the last 10 days. Most importantly, $TRUMP has now broken out of a long-drawn downward-sloping resistance line and looks primed for a strong rally – one that could take it to around $24, representing a massive 220% gain from current levels. Fancy some PolitFi meme coin action? Buy $TRUMP on Binance today. Recap : With spot Solana ETFs posting record-breaking inflow numbers, the stage is set for low-cap coins to ride the trend. Top choices include Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , and OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP). Disclaimer : Invest in crypto only after doing your own research. The market is highly volatile and unpredictable. None of the above information is financial advice.

Analysis Company Warned Not to Fall Below This Level,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-expected-for-the-ethereum-eth-price-analysis-company-warned-not-to-fall-below-this-level/,"In its latest technical assessment for Ethereum (ETH), cryptocurrency analysis company MakroVision stated that the price is still moving within the falling trend channel and the consolidation process continues in the short term. According to the report, ETH is currently trading just above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement zone at around $3,596. The company argued that maintaining this level is critical for near-term stability. MakroVision stated that a stable outlook can be maintained as long as the $3,596 support level remains above. However, a break above this level could bring the next significant support level at $3,174 (0.5 Fibonacci level) into focus. It is anticipated that buyer interest in this area could increase again. Related News: Reason Behind Today's Notable Altcoin Surge Is Now Clear: Developers Will Only Get Paid If the Price Increases Fivefold According to the analysis, Ethereum could regain strong bullish momentum if $4,290 and the upper boundary of the falling channel are broken. This scenario is considered a key signal for a trend reversal in the medium-term. MakroVision noted that Ethereum is currently in consolidation mode, with the near-term support at $3,730 looking strong. However, they warned that a dip below this level could deepen the correction. ETH price is trading at $3,882 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What is Expected for the Ethereum (ETH) Price?

According to the agency, misuse of crypto and blockchain is growing more complex and organized, and that trend is stretching police resources across Europe. Europol Findings And Figures Based on reports and the agency’s own assessments, the warning followed the ninth Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Crypto Assets held on October 28–29. EU-SOCTA 2025, Europol’s broader assessment of organized crime, flagged the same issues. Analytics firms are backing up the concern: Chainalysis and TRM Labs have estimated illicit crypto flows in 2024 measured in the tens of billions of dollars. That figure helps explain why investigators say the problem cannot be ignored. Lawmakers and investigators cited concrete numbers during the event. A Spanish-led operation that police say laundered €460 million, roughly $540 million, was highlighted as an example of the scale and sophistication officials are facing. Other cases show criminals mixing on-chain methods with off-chain financial routes to hide money across borders. Law Enforcement Response Police in several countries have moved from small, local efforts to joint, cross-border investigations. Europol supported the recent €460 million probe by helping coordinate evidence and sharing forensic tools. Still, many national units report gaps in equipment and training that slow down tracing and seizure efforts. Training is needed, and standardized tools could help investigators follow funds faster across multiple blockchains and fiat systems. Ransomware groups, scams, and fraud rings now often use crypto as part of a larger toolkit. Reports show criminals combining hacked accounts, mixers, and private payment rails with traditional banking and shell companies. There’s also a rise in violent robbery tactics aimed at crypto holders, sometimes called wrench attacks, which has pushed the threat from purely financial to physical safety concerns as well. Industry Data And Trends Based on reports from industry analysts, detection and tracking tools have improved, but criminals adapt quickly. New laundering techniques and the use of AI to automate parts of schemes were both flagged in the EU-SOCTA briefing. That means even well-equipped teams must update methods often. Chainalysis and TRM Labs offer ongoing data that reporters and investigators watch closely for shifts in flow volumes and method changes. Europol has urged stronger international cooperation, saying that chasing crypto across borders needs shared standards and faster information exchange. There were calls at the conference for more public-private work between law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms. Some officials also asked for wider legal clarity so banks and exchanges can act faster when suspicious flows appear.

According to trader and market analyst Trader Tardigrade, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Dogecoin has settled at levels similar to those seen before price rallies in the past two years or so. This technical observation is based on Dogecoin’s steady uptrend along a long-standing support line since 2023 and points to its price action currently being in a possible early stage of accumulation before another leg upward. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashback: Mirror Move Hints At Record-Breaking Surge Dogecoin RSI Now Showing Pre-Breakout Signals The RSI is an indicator that has consistently aligned with Dogecoin’s strongest rallies in this cycle. According to the current 2-week candlestick setup shared by Trader Tardigrade, the RSI is currently trading stable within the same low range that has preceded Dogecoin’s previous upward rises since 2023. Each of the three major RSI dips, as shown on the price chart below, has coincided with price retests of the red ascending trendline. This event is notable because the first two dips were followed by significant upward movements in the Dogecoin price. Right now, the present RSI position is at its third dip, and it can be inferred that the meme coin may once again be approaching a launch point similar to those that led to past price surges. The long-term support trendline drawn from mid-2023 has acted as a reliable price base for Dogecoin’s recovery cycles. Price action has tested this line multiple times without breaking below it, and this has led to the creation of higher highs and higher lows. Dogecoin 2W Candlestick Price Chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade On X Although Dogecoin broke below the trendline in the middle of October, this breakdown was very brief with a long wick. Based on Dogecoin’s price action in October, the most recent interaction with this trendline is just above $0.17. This latest interaction has been highlighted with stability above this price level, and this is another early sign of technical strength. What To Expect If The Pattern Holds If this recurring structure between RSI and price maintains its consistency, Dogecoin could be about to embark on its third notable bullish run since early 2024. The most possible scenario is another rally that plays out over multiple weeks, as seen in the past two rallies. The last rally saw the Dogecoin price just around $0.5 in December 2024. Therefore, another rally from this point will see the creation of another higher high above $0.5 at least. The projection within the analyst’s chart, which is based on how the last rally plays out, points to a target around $0.8. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1877, up by 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Reaching $0.8 will translate to new all-time highs and a 228% increase from the current price level.

The country is presently facing a widespread illegal crypto mining crisis, with authorities noting that over 95% of the active 427,000 mining devices in the country are being operated without standard licenses and authorization. This development comes amid a report that places Iran in the fourth position when it comes to the largest crypto mining hubs worldwide. The report claims that the position was fueled by the heavily subsidized electricity prices, which have made the country a paradise for illegal crypto miners. These unlicensed operations have consumed more than 1,400 megawatts of power around the clock, putting great strain on the national grid and threatening the stability of the electricity supply in the country. Iran shuts down illegal crypto mining operations According to Akbar Hasan Beklou, CEO of the Tehran Province Electricity Distribution Company, the majority of the illegal miners in Iran disguise their activities as industrial facilities because of their access to cheap electricity. Beklous added that since the launch of the government’s effort against unauthorized crypto mining, about 104 illegal mining farms have been discovered in Tehran Province, with authorities seizing more than 1,465 mining devices. He mentioned that total energy consumption as a result of the criminals’ activities is around 3,359 kilowatts, which is equivalent to 10,000 household units. He mentioned that as a result of their activities, there has been reduced stability in power supplies to both residential and industrial consumers in the country. He added that over 95% of these devices are operated using unauthorized electricity, increasing the menace of power theft, wasting subsidized energy, and reducing the available electricity for legitimate users. In addition, he claimed that the government has also identified several hotspots where these activities are rampant. They include Pakdasht, Firuzkuh, Shahre Qods, Malard, Kahrizak, and industrial zones in the southwestern area of Tehran. He highlighted that during the crackdown in the first half of this year, about 80 unauthorized farms containing more than 1,300 mining devices were uncovered, with the farms consuming a cumulative power that can be used by 8,000 households. Beklou promises to intensify efforts Beklou said illegal crypto miners often go to great lengths and use sophisticated methods to conceal their electricity theft and illegal operations. For example, they dig underground tunnels, bury mining devices, and tap into subsidized industrial power lines, which makes detection difficult. Nevertheless, Beklou added that specialized inspection teams from the power company, working alongside security and law enforcement agencies, will continue to monitor these activities, with an aim to dismantle all illegal operations. Iran has been moving swiftly in its quest to combat this menace. In August, the country announced cash rewards to citizens who report illegal cryptocurrency mining operations. Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, CEO of state-run utility Tavanir, announced a reward of up to $24 (approximately 1 million toman) for every informant with credible information that leads to the seizure of an unauthorized mining device. Mashhadi blamed the activities of the illegal miners for the issues with the country’s power grid. According to a June report by CoinLaw, Iran ranks fifth globally in Bitcoin hashrate distribution. The country contributes 4.2% of the total network’s computing power. The United States leads the group with a dominant 44%, with Kazakhstan picking up the second spot with 12%, while Russia at 10.5% and Canada at 9% take up the rest of the spots.

Although the regulator is yet to greenlight such a product and the government shutdown endures, the XRP Army is hopeful that Canary Capital, through its latest update, could bypass the waiting line and launch its own spot ETF in two weeks. This is because the company removed the “delaying amendment” from its filing, which could result in a product launch on November 13, an approach taken by several ETF issuers lately. How High, XRP? Given the high probability of a spot XRP ETF reaching the markets in November or December at least, we decided to touch upon ChatGPT and see what it believes would be the impact on the underlying token in terms of price actions. It began with a brief history lesson on crypto ETFs, especially for BTC’s January 2024 launch and the subsequent ETH products in July of the same year. The AI solution noted that it would expect similar first weeks for XRP, which included a “pop” shortly after the launch, and a choppy “sell-the-news” window. However, it believes that these products will inevitably kick-start a “flows-driven” rally once they pick up the pace. It’s most optimistic prediction sees the asset surging to well beyond $7.50 and up to $10 within a year after the ETF launch, if the crypto market is in a “broad crypto risk-on regime and XRP wins significant institutional allocation (multi-billion-dollar AUM).” Within the next six months, ChatGPT noted that Ripple’s cross-border token can peak at around $5.50 if altseason and strong ETF flows align. Its short-term prediction is more cautious, indicating that the cryptocurrency will probably range somewhere between $2.70 and $3.40 once the approval hype fades. Bearish Scenario Although it believes the spot XRP ETF approvals would be a bullish development for the asset, it still outlined a few bearish scenarios in case the market mechanics flip and the overall global economy tumbles. As such, ChatGPT noted that if “macro tightens, flows fizzle, or regulatory headlines turn negative,” XRP’s price could slump to $1.50-$2.00 within the next six months. Moreover, it warned that Ripple’s token can plunge further to $1.20 in the year ahead if recession fears become reality and investors flock to risk-off assets. Despite the positive moves in the past few weeks, ChatGPT still highlighted potential risks ahead or even after the launch of these financial vehicles.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.5784 Market cap $616.45M Trading volume (24-hour) $12.31M Circulating supply 1.063B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $9.12 24-hour low $0.3505 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.45% (High) 50-day SMA $0.6596 14-Day RSI 39.18 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 37 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.7064 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos trades around $0.579, showing mild recovery after a drop. If the coin holds above $0.56, it could rebound to $0.62. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart As of November 2, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $0.5796, up 0.26% on the day, showing a mild recovery after recent declines. The price sits between the middle Bollinger Band at $0.593 and lower support near $0.564, indicating consolidation within a narrowing range. The upper band at $0.6218 acts as the key resistance level that bulls need to reclaim for momentum to strengthen. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD is showing a neutral tone, suggesting that bearish momentum is fading but not yet reversed. The RSI stands at 40.86, still slightly below the neutral 50 mark, pointing to subdued buying pressure and potential for a rebound if sentiment improves. If XTZ holds above $0.56, a short-term recovery toward $0.60–$0.62 remains possible. However, failure to maintain this support could cause the price to drop to $0.54. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Tezos is trading at around $0.5791, exhibiting minor intraday weakness. The Alligator indicator lines are slightly converging, showing that price movement has lost direction and may enter a phase of sideways accumulation. Resistance levels are clustered at $0.5814 and $0.584, while short-term support sits near $0.578–$0.576. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI reading of 47.27 reflects a balance between buyers and sellers, with neither side in firm control. A break above $0.582 could trigger a push toward $0.59, while rejection at current levels might lead to renewed weakness toward $0.57. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6353 SELL SMA 5 $0.6276 SELL SMA 10 $0.6332 SELL SMA 21 $0.6182 SELL SMA 50 $0.6596 SELL SMA 100 $0.7276 SELL SMA 200 $0.7064 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6210 SELL EMA 5 $0.6466 SELL EMA 10 $0.6888 SELL EMA 21 $0.7362 SELL EMA 50 $0.7542 SELL EMA 100 $0.7311 SELL EMA 200 $0.7406 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos is consolidating near support, showing reduced volatility and fading selling pressure. If the price sustains above $0.56, gradual accumulation could lead to a short-term breakout toward $0.60 or higher, but a drop below that level would likely extend the correction phase. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos (XTZ) October 2025 roundup! 🎃 The Tezos October Roundup is here!

In a recent post, he wrote that “$XRP is not heading to $10k-$50k per coin” and asked traders to “please stop with this nonsense.” His statement came in response to an argument suggesting that XRP’s value could soar to such levels if it achieved full-scale institutional adoption. The discussion began when another user suggested XRP’s price could trade between $10,000 and $50,000 if it became the foundation of global payment systems , such as SWIFT, DTCC, and central bank digital currencies. The post claimed that XRP would need to reach this range to sustain global liquidity flows without network congestion. ChartNerd, who is known for his technical analysis of digital assets, rejected that assumption outright. His dismissal made it clear that he views such expectations as detached from realistic market behavior. $XRP is not heading to $10K-$50K per coin Please stop with this nonsense. https://t.co/ALQ42EXNMM — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 31, 2025 Assessing Market Realities ChartNerd’s position aligns with a segment of analysts who emphasize measured forecasting over speculative optimism. His message reflects instances where traders rely on market structure and real-world behavior rather than hypothetical scenarios that ignore supply constraints and regulatory hurdles. While ChartNerd has previously shared bullish predictions for XRP , his choice of words indicated a clear disapproval of those who believe XRP could achieve such extraordinary valuations, as they fail to consider the realities of the crypto market. Community Divisions on XRP Expectations The post quickly received a range of responses reflecting the community’s divided outlook on XRP’s long-term potential. One commenter suggested that a more modest target near $6 or $7 would be reasonable and even achievable. ChartNerd agreed , replying that such a price was “easily attainable.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A different commenter argued that the analyst was overlooking potential future utility as blockchain adoption grows. However, ChartNerd dismissed this line of reasoning as well, stating directly, “It will not.” Balancing Optimism with Analysis Although the XRP community continues to debate what the asset’s future might hold, ChartNerd’s firm rejection of exaggerated valuations signals a broader caution to investors who may conflate long-term institutional adoption with guaranteed exponential returns. Price growth requires more than optimism, and credible forecasts must align with the realities of supply, demand, and utility.

Meanwhile, the T3 Financial Crime Unit froze $300 million in illicit funds, marking a major milestone in crypto security efforts. Business An account used by Samn Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has claimed the exchange was never insolvent, echoing arguments raised during his trial. Binance.US has denied claims that its USD1 listing was a form of payback for President Trump’s pardon of Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. Mastercard is in advanced talks to acquire crypto startup Zerohash in a deal valued between $1.5 and $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the deal. Crypto giant Coinbase has acquired onchain capital raising platform Echo in a $375 million deal which will enable Coinbase community members to raise capital more easily for growth. Web3 Crypto exchange BTCC has introduced a limited-time Halloween campaign, the Spooktacular Halloween Night of Fortune , which will have significant giveaways, including one full Bitcoin, for users who participate by completing a set of trading and deposit-based tasks, including a minimum deposit of 200 USDT and a cumulative futures trading volume of at least 50 million USDT While algorithmic trading bots have long been part of the crypto landscape, AI tools, especially large language models specifically designed for analytical work like Anthropic’s Claude has emerged as a particularly valuable resource for traders who need to process vast amounts of information quickly and accurately. TZ APAC's Fortify Labs announced that it is now inviting applications for its 2026 cohort. The program , scheduled to take place in Singapore will span seven months of focused development time, offering funding of up to $1.3 million while simultaneously delivering hands-on guidance for each participating project individually. According to the latest Crypto Adoption and Stablecoin Usage Report , US crypto activity surged by 50% between January and July compared to the same period last year, while adoption has also accelerated in key markets like South Asia and North Africa. As the world’s first omnibank, Digitap has introduced a no-KYC option, giving users the power to spend globally without the frustration of checks. Altcoins In his op-ed for BeInCrypto, Outset PR’s founder Mike Ermolaev warned that projects ignoring AI visibility are already fading from digital awareness. As crypto markets prepare for what could be a major rebound heading into 2026, early Solana (SOL) investors appear to be shifting part of their portfolios into newer, lower-cost altcoins, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). FUNToken has officially launched a fully transparent, audited Ethereum smart contract designed to automatically reward $FUN holders as the token grows from a $5 Million rewards pool that directly benefits long-term supporters and early stakers. Security The T3 Financial Crime Unit, a joint initiative by Tether, TRON, and TRM Labs, has frozen $300 million in tainted digital assets within its first year, signaling a major advancement in crypto industry-led financial crime prevention.

Specifically, Dubai stands out. Over 500 crypto-companies are housed in free zones such as Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC)’s Crypto & Blockchain Ecosystem alone. Dubai also hosts exchanges, VC firms, protocol teams and sovereign-backed initiatives that position the region as a magnet for startups and international projects. Visibility in the MENA region in general and Dubai in particular is paramount for a company that aims to scale. At the same time, success means navigating a robust regulatory framework and multicultural environment. With favourable tax policies, regulatory clarity and a globally visible ecosystem, Dubai offers a strong landscape for crypto-PR efforts, but only if campaigns are tailored, compliant and culturally fluent. Why PR in Dubai Requires a Different Approach Dubai has emerged as a leading hub for global Web3 activity. Success in this market depends on precision, cultural understanding, and alignment with local regulations. Public relations in Dubai follows its own set of dynamics: Regulatory-first storytelling: With VARA setting world-leading digital asset standards, crypto communications in Dubai must emphasize compliance, transparency, and risk-aware positioning. Speculative language and aggressive claims can damage credibility and attract scrutiny. Reputation economy: Dubai is a trust-driven market. Founders, investors, and regulators operate in tightly connected circles. Relationship-building, professionalism, and long-term reputation matter more than viral hype cycles. Bilingual narrative design: English drives investor and media conversations, but Arabic remains key for government relations and wider market trust. Effective PR blends both with cultural intelligence — not copy-paste translations. High-signal media environment: Coverage in outlets like The National, Khaleej Times, Arabian Business, and Gulf News carries strategic weight, and must be complemented by top-tier crypto media and curated KOL networks — especially on X and Telegram, where the UAE’s Web3 discourse thrives. Founder visibility is essential: In Dubai, narrative authority sits with leadership. Thought-leadership features, fireside chats, forums like Dubai FinTech Summit, and high-trust panels build credibility faster than paid placements. Event-driven marketing hub: Dubai’s nonstop calendar — from Token2049 to Dubai Web3 Festival, Future Blockchain Summit, and GITEX — makes offline presence and ecosystem access a fundamental part of a winning PR strategy. Cultural and business etiquette: The UAE values professionalism, diplomacy, and respectful messaging. Claims of disruption must be balanced with responsibility, partnership, and alignment with national innovation goals. Best Crypto PR Agencies in MENA Outset PR Delivers Campaigns with Proven Impact Global reach is a common marketing phrase among Western PR firms, yet Outset PR backs it with verified traction in the UAE and wider Middle East. The agency, founded by crypto communications specialist Mike Ermolaev , approaches PR as a precision craft, building campaigns from data, market context, and measurable outcomes rather than volume. What Defines Outset PR Uses in-depth analytics — from discoverability and domain strength to conversion likelihood — to choose publications with real impact instead of mass mailing lists. Merges international PR standards with local precision, offering Arabic localization and cultural adaptation for every campaign. Functions as a boutique consultancy, providing hands-on editorial strategy instead of prepackaged press release bundles. Case in Point — XPANCEO, Dubai XPANCEO, a Dubai-based deep-tech firm, sought support with complex English materials and Arabic translations for investor and internal communication. Outset PR assembled a team of subject experts to refine language, adapt tone, and reshape narratives to fit local context. The collaboration delivered stronger media visibility, sharper positioning across MENA, and investor messaging that was both clear and culturally fluent. Final Take Outset PR distinguishes itself through a rare blend of data-centric execution and regional literacy – an agency capable of operating seamlessly between European precision and Middle Eastern nuance. Web3 News Wire – Targeted Press-Release Distribution Web3 Newswire positions itself as a dedicated media-distribution and PR platform for the crypto/Web3/blockchain ecosystem. They offer press-release distribution and branding services tailored to Web3, claiming access to “300+ news sites” and emphasising features such as SEO boosting, multilingual templates, transparent pricing, editorial support, and no hidden fees. Pros: Wide distribution network (over 300 outlets), quick execution & turnkey distribution, affordable packages, SEO / links included. Cons: Less focus on strategy & narrative, does not offer PR writing services. Best for: speed and cost-effective distribution, crypto startups and Web3 events that need fast, wide-reach press coverage. Koinpr – Turning Web3 Strategy into Real Conversions Koinpr describes itself as a Web3-marketing platform offering a studio-style model and tailored growth packages for crypto projects. They emphasise speed (“5× faster execution”), conversion focus and ready-made packages for ICOs/presales. Koinpr offers three service models: Studio, an all-in-one platform for PR, content, and influencer campaigns; EOD, expert on-demand support for quick execution; and One, a full partnership model focused on strategy and conversions. Pros: Conversion-focused rather than just visibility, Web3-native packag­ing, streamlined campaign setup and execution across multiple channels (PR + influencers + content). Cons: Their emphasis is on execution speed and conversion; projects looking for long-term brand equity or complex regulatory positioning may need more bespoke strategy. Best for: Web3 / crypto projects that need fast, execution-driven marketing rather than drawn-out brand campaigns. Blockchain Marketing Ninja – Full-Stack Growth for Web3 Projects Blockchain Marketing Ninja positions itself as a crypto-native growth agency based in Dubai with over 11 years of Web3 experience. They emphasize full-stack execution for Web3 projects — from token launches and community growth to SEO, KOL/influencer programs, paid media, and PR. Their network includes 300+ global media partners, 1 000+ Web3 KOLs, and “+75 owned media channels” with large monthly reach. Pros: Web3 native approach, strong network & reach, comprehensive campaign support (execution across PR, social, influencers, community, SEO). Cons: If a project’s budget or scale is limited, the full-stack model may be over-resourced and possibly less cost-efficient than a more focused, boutique approach. Best for: Web3 / crypto projects that need a broad-scope marketing partner covering PR, influencers, community, SEO, paid media all in one. Cryptorsy – Integrated Marketing & Accelerator for Crypto Projects Cryptorsy presents itself as a full-service Web3 growth studio and accelerator, with dual locations in Dubai and Kyiv.They target crypto startups through services spanning fundraising support, media/PR/influencer campaigns, traffic & community growth, tokenomics and smart-contract packaging, and ecosystem acceleration (events, pitch sessions).They claim to reach 15 million+ audience, partner with 3,000+ projects, and work with 900+ KOLs or influencers. Pros: End-to-end service model, strong traffic/community focus, fundraising and listing support (strategic packages for pre-ICO and public sale phases: pitch decks, investor outreach (2,500+ VC/angel contacts), community build for investors) Cons: Because they offer bootstrap startup acceleration + traffic systems + full stack marketing + PR + tokenomics + development, the risk is less depth in each area compared to boutique specialists. Best for: Projects that value rapid traction, community growth, listing & fundraising acceleration rather than purely long-term brand building. Final Thoughts Dubai’s crypto ecosystem is growing at a pace few regions can match. With more than 500 blockchain and digital asset companies already registered and global players continuing to relocate to the city, the competition for visibility has never been higher. In this environment, PR is not a luxury — it’s a necessity. Strong public relations in Dubai go beyond simple exposure. The agencies highlighted above demonstrate the variety of strategies available in the market — from data-driven boutique storytelling to high-speed execution platforms and end-to-end acceleration studios. Choosing the right partner depends on your project’s stage, goals, and target audience. FAQ Section 1.

Citing a lengthy article by ZKsync co-founder Alex Gluchowski titled “Ethereum Becomes a Major Capital Markets Center for ZKsync,” Buterin argued that the project is working to “advance Ethereum’s financial layer.” He also expressed his eager anticipation for the upcoming new features. According to the article shared by Gluchowski, the ZKsync Atlas update will revolutionary improve system performance: 15,000+ TPS (transactions/second) capacity, Zero-knowledge proof (ZK proof) finality in 1 second, Almost zero transaction fees. But according to Alex, this is only the beginning: “These numbers are a small part of the story. What Atlas really opens up is that Layer 2s can, for the first time, directly use Ethereum as a real-time liquidity center for institutional capital.” Related News: Company Managing $5 Billion Reveals New Price Forecast for Ethereum With the Atlas update, ZKsync-based chains will no longer need to create their own internal liquidity pools. Instead, they will be able to access Ethereum's liquidity directly. This transformation marks a fundamental paradigm shift in the Layer 2 ecosystem. Ethereum is now becoming not just a foundation network but a real-time financial settlement layer. Following Vitalik Buterin's statements and the announcement of the technical details of the Atlas update, the ZK token gained more than 100% in value.

Key support levels are being scrutinized, raising questions about a potential trend reversal. The forthcoming analysis will shed light on whether SUI is preparing for a major turnaround or if further declines are looming. Delve into the details to discover which coins show promise amidst these market changes. In a fast-moving market where attention shifts quickly, timing and consistent visibility are crucial. That’s why data-driven agencies like Outset PR go beyond price charts and track the broader media landscape. With Outset Data Pulse, they deliver real-time insights that strengthen and sharpen PR execution. Sui (SUI) Eyes Resistance Level Amidst Steady Growth Indicators Source: tradingview Sui is currently holding between $2.45 and $2.79, reflecting a cautious upward trend. The coin is close to its recent resistance point of $2.91. If it breaks through, it could target another resistance level at $3.25, an increase of about 16%. The coin saw a dip of around 27% over the last month, but its short-term 10-day moving average suggests some recent stability. With a relative strength index near neutral, the token might be gearing up for bullish behavior. As sentiment improves, Sui might see a steady climb, though its future largely hinges on maintaining momentum above key support levels.

Dogecoin Shows Stability with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between just under 21 cents to a little over 19 cents. It faces resistance if it reaches around 22 cents, and its support level sits at almost 18 cents. With a 10-day moving average slightly below 19 cents, Dogecoin is showing stability. Over the past week, its price dipped by over 4%, and nearly 20% in a month, but it's up nearly 6% over half a year. The RSI is slightly above the midpoint, suggesting balanced trading activity. If Dogecoin can break through its resistance, it has room to grow, potentially reaching nearly 24 cents, a rise of over 13% from its current position. Rising Expectations: Can Ondo (ONDO) Climb Past Its Hurdles? Source: tradingview Ondo is experiencing a price movement between seventy and eighty-one cents. Its current price shows some upward potential but faces challenges breaking above 85 cents. The coin has recently dropped by over 21% in a month, showing recent pressure in the market. Ondo’s immediate support lies at 64 cents, while further support is around 54 cents. However, if it can break past 85 cents, it might aim for 95 cents, a climb of about 18%. The ten-day average is still slightly below the current rate, indicating some upward traction. The Relative Strength Index suggests neutrality, hinting that there may be room for potential growth if investor interest rises. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter?

Having reached Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already secured over $18.27 million, with over 85% of tokens already sold out, with very little time now left for early birds to act before the next price run-up. MUTM stands out with its dual-lending ecosystem, pairing Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending in maximizing capital efficiency and liquidity, a next-generation DeFi crypto model capable of outperforming conventional lending platforms. MUTM’s high growth potential foretells early presale backers are set to realize 10x or more profits when the token comes public on exchanges. In a market still buzzing with DOGE’s popularity, Mutuum Finance represents a rare opportunity to enter a fundamentally strong project, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest today for both utility and explosive upside. Dogecoin (DOGE) Gears Up for a Massive Breakout Cup and Handle Pattern Signals $1 Target Dogecoin (DOGE) may lag behind on the shorter time frames, but on the weekly timeframe, the story is dramatically different, one that’s trending throughout the market. A massive Cup and Handle pattern is emerging, a historically strong bullish formation that has the potential to propel DOGE past the $1 mark once validated. Short-termers are said not to be aware of this developing framework, but shrewd investors notice the potential of the pattern because accumulation remains underway quietly beneath. Patience is the key here as the structure for DOGE’s next explosive leg is already underway. But as the hype for Dogecoin’s technical setup in the long run increases, some investors are diversifying their wagers into high-growth DeFi crypto action such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rapidly rising project showing early signs of breakout potential akin to DOGE’s record-breaking spree and clearly standing as the best cryptocurrency to invest today before the next rally starts. Mutuum Finance Makes Huge Achievements and Hustles Towards New Frontiers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to make history as one of the quickest-growing 2025 crypto assets fueled by an all-time record presale that keeps shattering predictions. The project has achieved six back-to-back funding rounds that have raised $18.27 million from over 17,660 investors, a milestone that places it in the league of the most highly awaited DeFi crypto drops of the year. More than 85% of Phase 6 tokens have been sold and the token’s price is currently $0.035, and investors still have time to get in before the next 20% increase in price for the next round. For adopters early on in the lookout for a fast-growing project with good fundamentals and long-term value, Mutuum Finance is turning out to be the best cryptocurrency to invest today before the much-expected bull run in 2025. Aside from the thrill of its current presale, Mutuum Finance also offers real yield potential from its liquidity networks with which holders of MUTM can stake funds such as USDT and earn consistent annual percentage yields (APY) on a volume-trading basis. As an example, a $40,000 stake at 12% APY can potentially earn some $4,800 in a year, automatically compounded with time. This stable performance-driven source of returns places Mutuum Finance in contention for both short and long-term yield seekers, distinguishing it from speculatively oriented tokens and reaffirming its status as a utility, income, and growth-oriented DeFi crypto platform. $100,000 Community Rewards Program Ignites Global Participation In a significant show of commitment to community-led development, Mutuum Finance has initiated an exciting $100,000 giveaway , incentive scheme to stimulate its growing global community of investors. Ten individuals will receive $10,000 each in the form of MUTM tokens as part of this incentive scheme, in a gesture that highlights the project’s intent to reward engaged supporters as well as create sustained loyalty. It is easy to participate: investors can qualify by investing a minimum of $50 for the current presale and performing simple community outreach activities through Mutuum Finance’s official website. This project is ideally an expression of Mutuum Finance’s larger vision of building a networked, participatory, and value-aligned community. By combining user engagement with real-world economic rewards, the project is creating not only investors but active stakeholders in its DeFi crypto ecosystem, paving the way for a more inclusive and enduring financial future. Dogecoin’s bullish setup is aiming at $1, but it is Mutuum Finance that is stealing the spotlight. At $0.035 and 80% sold out, MUTM has amassed a total of a staggering $18.27M in its presale. Its two-lending DeFi crypto strategy and real yield potential make it the best cryptocurrency to invest today with strong fundamentals, passive income, and high leverage as 2025 approaches.

Western Union is piloting stablecoin settlements on Solana to cut costs and speed up cross-border transfers for its 150 million customers. The world’s largest remittance incumbent is now using stablecoins. The product-market fit is clear, and a host of leaner, more disruptive startups are ready to eat market share. While Western Union is testing the water, Digitap ($TAP) is already swimming out ahead. It has shipped its omni-banking app, a non-KYC Visa card, and has integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay. All while still in its presale. Anyone looking for the best altcoin to buy today needs to put $TAP on their list because this is where crypto rails meet everyday finance. Western Union begins the pivot On Western Union’s Q3 call, CEO Devin McGranahan framed the pilot. He believes (and is right) that by using stablecoins on Solana, Western Union can move money faster with greater transparency, at a lower cost, and bypass legacy correspondent networks. If the market leader in remittances is adopting stablecoins, it is proof that the banking boom thesis is likely the dominant narrative of 2025. On-chain rails for the back end, while consumers continue to use Western Union branches like normal—hopefully with lower costs. The timing is perfect, following the passage of the GENIUS Act, and this is rocket fuel for projects working on payments and consumer-facing apps. The exact spot where Digitap is building. The new playbook: Why omni-banking beats single chains Last year, nobody knew which chain would win the payments race. But it was the wrong question. The real question is: who owns the consumers, and who has the best distribution channels? Digitap has pioneered the omni-banking model, which means one login, one balance display, and all forms of value (fiat, crypto, and stablecoins) under a single account. This is how stablecoins begin to function like money for normal people. Users don’t need to know anything about blockchains; they log in to a neobank-style interface and watch their money move faster than ever. The ability to plug into all rails (legacy and blockchain) is Digitap’s superpower. As new, faster solutions for transfers such as Plasma come online, Digitap’s omni-bank model allows them to be integrated. That’s why $TAP ranks among the best altcoins to buy today—when everyone went after scaling, it went after the consumer, focusing on distribution instead of chain maximalism. Digitap’s distribution edge: Non-KYC Visa card plus Apple Pay and Google Pay At the end of the day, distribution wins. Digitap’s decision to issue Visa cards (available today) that can be added to Apple Pay and Google Pay means on-chain balances are already being spent with millions of merchants globally. Users tap their phone, the AI routing engine handles the conversion, and crypto now lives in the real economy. For privacy-sensitive users, Digitap offers non-KYC virtual issuance. And as the privacy narrative heats up again, with tokens like Zcash performing well, this has seen plenty of whales join the presale, sending total raised to more than $1.2 million in record time. The app is live on desktop, iOS, and Android, and thousands of new sign-ups are hitting the system daily. Presale demand continues to accelerate, and with Western Union giving the green light, the crypto banking boom is just beginning. Western Union starts banking boom: Why $TAP could be the best altcoin to buy today Western Union adopting stablecoins validates the crypto banking boom thesis. The big problem for retail is that they cannot get exposure to stablecoins. But now, with Digitap, they can gain exposure to the front end, disrupting the entire banking experience. Even better, holders of the native $TAP token enjoy buybacks and staking rewards, with 50% of Digitap’s profits allocated to supporting users and the token’s price. The current price of $0.0268 looks undervalued, and when Western Union starts adjusting course, it confirms that upside for disruptors will be enormous as incumbents modernize. But investors who want to become early Digitap adopters will have to move fast because $TAP will rise to $0.0297 in the next round, which could begin in a matter of days.

Interestingly, the latest market data shows that the exchange-traded funds have made a strong start to life, recording significant inflows in the first few trading days. Spot Solana ETFs Reach $500 Million Net Assets In Single Week According to data from SoSoValue , the two US-based spot Solana ETFs registered a total net inflow of $199.21 million in their first week of trading. This influx of capital reflects the optimism and growing demand for crypto-linked investment products in one of the largest global financial markets. The week’s star performer was Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (with the ticker BSOL), which recorded positive inflows in the first four trading days. On Friday, October 31st, the exchange-traded fund posted a total net inflow of roughly $44.5 million, bringing the debut week’s performance to over $197 million. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said about the Bitwise Solana ETF performance: What a week for $BSOL, besides the big volume, it led all crypto ETPs by a country mile in weekly flows with +$417m ($IBIT had a rare off week, it’ll be back). It also ranked it 16th in overall flows for the week. Big time debut. While Grayscale’s Solana Trust (GSOL) didn’t record any activity on Friday, it closed the week with a total net inflow of about $2.18 million. It is worth noting that the Grayscale fund launched a day after Bitwise’s spot Solana ETF, but both exchange-traded funds have a total net asset of over $500 million. Considering the impact of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on the assets’ prices, it would be interesting to see how the performance of the Solana ETFs affects SOL’s price in the coming months. As of this writing, the price of Solana stands at around $185, reflecting a more than 4% decline in the past seven days. Demand For Bitcoin And Ether ETFs Slows Down The US-based Bitcoin and Ether ETFs registered unconvincing performances in the past week, as investor sentiment in the market seems to worsen by the day. The Bitcoin exchange-traded funds posted a total net outflow of over $607 million in the past week. Meanwhile, the Ether ETFs snapped their streak of consecutive outflow weeks with a positive weekly influx of over $114 million. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that these crypto-linked investment products still ended the month of October with net positive inflows.",Solana|bitcoin ETFs|Bitwise|Ether ETFs|Grayscale|solana|Solana ETFs|Solana price,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 15:00:04

A report from CryptoQuant revealed that U.S. investors are exhibiting a slowdown in demand for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). This slow pace extends to both the spot and derivative markets, following a significant rally in late September that drove BTC and ETH to $126,000 and nearly $5,000, respectively. BTC and ETH Demand Weakens During the last rally weeks ago, investor appetite for exposure to BTC and ETH increased, as reflected in the demand for these assets and their related products. With enthusiasm waning, U.S. investors — both retail and institutional — have become cautious in their approach. CryptoQuant stated that all metrics in the spot, futures, and derivatives markets indicate profit-taking rather than renewed accumulation among investors. Data analyzed by experts collectively points to a cooling sentiment among investors. This also suggests that market participants in the U.S. are waiting for new catalysts before re-entering the risk market. In the U.S. Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETFs) market, outflows are now dominating. The seven-day average net outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs stands at 281 BTC, amounting to $30.6 million in negative flows. CryptoQuant states that this is one of the weakest records for these Bitcoin products since April, indicating that ETFs acted as net sellers of BTC last week. On the Ethereum ETFs front, inflows have slowed since mid-August and are currently almost at zero. Derivatives Markets Feel the Heat Furthermore, the Coinbase price premium indicates that spot demand on U.S. crypto exchanges has decelerated. The 24-hour moving average of the metric is falling close to zero for the first time since September 8. Positive coinbase premiums usually signal higher prices on the exchange, an indication that demand in the U.S. is growing faster. Meanwhile, investor demand in the Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets is at low levels. This can be seen in the decline of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) Futures annualized basis. For Bitcoin, the metric has fallen to 1.98%, its lowest in over two years. For Ethereum, the indicator has declined to 3.0%, the lowest since July 29. This indicates that the demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures with expiration dates in six months or longer has decreased as both assets have fallen from their all-time highs.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy recently transferred 22,704 BTC, a massive $2.45 billion across new wallets, reigniting curiosity among traders. This comes just after the firm reported a staggering $2.8 billion quarterly net income and holds over 640,000 BTC worth $70.28 billion. But as Bitcoin solidifies its dominance, a buzzing newcomer named La Culex ($CULEX) is quietly turning heads with its presale momentum. In today’s hunt for the best 1000x crypto, investors are increasingly shifting focus from legacy giants like Bitcoin and TRON to innovative presales that offer asymmetric upside. The La Culex Presale is leading this trend with strong fundamentals, unique tokenomics, and a community-driven approach. With its “Bug Spray Dip” stage live and ROI projections already exceeding 30,000%, this mosquito-themed marvel might just be the next big sting in the crypto jungle. La Culex Presale: The Buzz Around the Best 1000x Crypto La Culex presale has become the talk of the meme coin world, rising fast as the best 1000x crypto of 2025. Currently in Stage 3, aptly called the “Bug Spray Dip,” it trades at $0.00002274, with the next price target of $0.00002458 just around the corner. Over $8,000 has already been raised, more than 55 holders have joined, and over 400 million tokens have been sold. Analysts are calling it one of the few projects that blend meme energy with structured token mechanics. The La Culex Presale rewards early believers through an escalating pricing model, a new stage activates every five days or upon hitting funding milestones. This structure ensures price appreciation is built-in, making it a front-runner for those seeking the best 1000x crypto. A $1,000 investment at current levels equals 43.98 million tokens, which could be worth $307,828 at listing. The 8.091% upcoming price surge is another reason investors are swarming in. More than just hype, the La Culex Presale has a concrete foundation. Built on Ethereum, it features referral bonuses, staking rewards, and token burns to maintain scarcity. Its burn-and-reward system mirrors top performers from previous bull runs but with more transparency and an interactive community. In a market full of vaporware, this project has positioned itself as a tangible contender for the best 1000x crypto in 2025. Buying into La Culex is simple. Connect your wallet, fund it with ETH or USDT, and swap directly on the official presale portal. Once the presale concludes, tokens will be claimable instantly, ready for staking or holding long-term. The simplicity of its acquisition process adds to its appeal as the best 1000x crypto to join early before the price ascends to its next milestone. In essence, La Culex combines the meme culture’s virality with tokenomics precision. It’s designed for exponential returns, not random speculation. With presale metrics already outperforming other small-cap launches, La Culex stands firm as the best 1000x crypto for investors seeking serious upside potential this year. Bitcoin Holds Its Ground Amid the Best 1000x Crypto Search Bitcoin remains the bedrock of the cryptocurrency world, a benchmark for all digital assets. Priced at around $112,853, it continues to define market sentiment and attract institutional inflows. Yet, as investors search for the best 1000x crypto, Bitcoin’s maturity limits its explosive potential. Its strength lies in stability, security, and global recognition, not necessarily in massive multipliers. Still, every bull cycle begins with Bitcoin’s lead, setting the tone for other projects to follow. While Bitcoin may no longer be a contender for the best 1000x crypto, its ecosystem continues to evolve through ETFs, Lightning Network adoption, and institutional expansion. These developments ensure that Bitcoin remains the liquidity backbone of the market, the safe harbor from which traders pivot toward high-growth presales like La Culex. The balance between legacy trust and emerging innovation is what defines today’s crypto investment strategy. TRON’s Steady Growth and Its Role in the Best 1000x Crypto Race TRON, currently trading at $0.0946 with a $27.8 billion market cap, maintains its reputation as one of the most efficient blockchain networks. With over 2 billion daily transactions, TRON continues to thrive as a key player in DeFi and stablecoin settlements. However, its growth has slowed compared to early surges. While not the best 1000x crypto, TRON offers a steady and scalable option for those seeking lower risk with consistent returns. In contrast to the dynamic presale of La Culex, TRON’s focus on interoperability and stable infrastructure caters to a more conservative audience. Yet even TRON investors are watching new entrants like La Culex, realizing that early-stage opportunities often yield exponential results. As TRON continues to integrate with global payment systems, it complements, rather than competes with, the emerging best 1000x crypto prospects reshaping the landscape. Conclusion La Culex, Bitcoin, and TRON each bring something powerful to the table, but only one promises true exponential growth. While Bitcoin remains the titan and TRON ensures scalability, La Culex Presale captures the raw energy of early crypto days with verifiable progress and transparent growth mechanics. With a 30,683% ROI projection and active community buzz, La Culex earns its title as the best 1000x crypto of the year. The market’s message is clear: evolution favors innovation. Bitcoin built the path, TRON maintained it, but La Culex is flying ahead, poised to transform small investments into life-changing returns. Investors looking for the best 1000x crypto should keep their eyes on the buzzing presale before the next surge hits.

53948011,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=851219,1762096856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53948011.jpeg,Sunil Kavuri says FTX creditors will recover only 9–46% of their funds in real crypto,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ftx-creditors-face-low-crypto-recovery/,"FTX creditors will recover only 9–46% of their holdings in real cryptocurrency terms, according to a statement from Sunil Kavuri. The head of FTX’s largest creditor group posted on X, noting that FTX creditors remain unreconciled. He noted that even with a nominal payout of 143% of claims, the true value is lower due to higher crypto prices since the filing. Based on the table Sunil shared in the post, the BTC petition price was $16,871, compared to the current price of over $110,000. This means that a 143% fiat payout is equivalent to roughly 22% in real BTC value. In the same vein, 143% of Ether would actually equal 46%. Solana, on the other hand, would be paid out at a rate of 12%. Some payments imply a higher dollar sum than the initial claim’s nominal price. However, in actual crypto terms, creditors come out well below the projected recovery. Fraudsters target FTX creditors with scams and fake airdrops Sunil also warned creditors about scams and impersonators targeting them. He claimed that some actors impersonated recovery projects, while others claimed to have FTX partnerships and organized fake airdrops . He noted that these activities were done to recover from FTX creditors, which is why they were a high-value, largely targeted group. Sunil recommended that all creditors must verify everything. While there are a few legitimate crypto projects conducting airdrops to compensate FTX victims, Sunil advised against following any distributed links or visiting websites that were not verified by reliable sources. The initial round of FTX creditor payments for recipients with claims of under $50,000 was distributed on February 18, totaling $1.2 billion. It was followed by the FTX Recovery Trust establishing its second $5 billion payout to eligible creditors. The payment covered multiple claim categories, including Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims (72%), US Customer Entitlement Claims (54%), and Convenience Claims (120%). In the meantime, General Unsecured and Digital Asset Loan Claims are expected to get 61% distributions, with funds anticipated to be distributed to recipients via Kraken and BitGo within one to two business days. The bankruptcy plan came to an end in October 2024, leveraging over $15 billion in recovered assets, including cash reserves from FTX’s operations, recovered funds from clawbacks, and proceeds from selling investments like Bankman-Fried’s stake in AI studio Anthropic and brokerage Robinhood, as well as massive stockpiles of tokens like SOL and SUI. It may seem that the affected clients are still not receiving as much as they had hoped, but many of them did not expect to see any of their FTX funds anyway, so for them, the distribution is a more welcome financial reprieve Founder’s pardon stirs debate amid crypto politics Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the controversial founder of FTX, is presently serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy. Nevertheless, his name is being actively referenced in the political and crypto spheres. In October 2025, SBF’s odds of being pardoned by US President Donald Trump rose amongst Polymarket bettors following news that he had granted clemency to Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, a poll on the decentralized prediction market shows. Individuals in contact with SBF’s lawyers are confident that he is attempting to persuade the court that the case was not legally sound, specifically arguing that FTX was not legally insolvent. SBF emphasizes that FTX was never insolvent, arguing that the exchange’s assets always outweighed its liabilities and that every customer could’ve been made whole by late November 2022. At the beginning of October, the disgraced FTX founder took to social media to allege that “Biden’s anti-crypto SEC/DOJ went after me” and had arrested him in 2022 as a means of preventing his testimony on Capitol Hill the next day. “They had me arrested weeks before the crypto bill I was working on was set for a vote—and the night before I was set to testify before Congress,” a post on Bankman-Fried’s official Gettr account says. For now, SBF Bankman-Fried is expected to appear before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on Nov. 4. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

CZ's statement on X (formerly Twitter) included the following statements: Disclosure: I bought some Aster with my own money today, I made the purchase through Binance. I'm not a trader, I buy and hold. I kept all the tokens I bought in the first month of BNB's TGE 8 years ago (excluding expenses).

The token is still under its 20-day moving average, with caution needed until the breakout is confirmed. Traders are watching closely to see if XRP can reclaim this MA on strong volume, which would be a catalyst toward short-term upside targets. Meanwhile, one of the new crypto projects to capture investors’ interest is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At its current price of just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with more than 85% already sold, Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to invest in now, packing both DeFi utility and early-stage growth potential. Investors looking for some XRP alternatives will find MUTM a high-potential opportunity in the evolving altcoin market. XRP Shows Early Signs of Strength as Whales Return to Market XRP briefly touched $2.70 before a pullback to $2.53, keeping a market capitalization of $152 billion and almost $6 billion in daily volume. It had a minor retreat following the recent 0.25% rate cut by the Fed and cautious commentary on future policy by Jerome Powell that brought some short-term volatility to the cryptocurrency market. On-chain metrics, however, paint a different picture. For the first time in four months, the XRP Whale Flow 30-DMA has turned positive, indicating the beginning of accumulation by large investors. Such patterns have often come before significant recoveries in price action historically, which could mean XRP is setting up for a stronger move higher. While XRP shows early signs of recovery, many investors are currently focusing their attention on the new crypto called Mutuum Finance, which, with its ongoing Phase 6 presale already 85% sold, is considered the best crypto to invest in now in pursuit of high upside potential beyond established tokens. Presale Stage 6 Nears Completion Mutuum Finance continues to gain incredible traction within the DeFi space, further solidifying its position as one of the hottest crypto projects of 2025 and a serious dark horse contender for the next token to reach $1. Well into Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM is currently at $0.035, a sharp increase on the previous phase and the final opportunity for investors to secure tokens before its next price increase. With Phase 7 expected to push the price to $0.04, investor anticipation is now incredibly high. The presale has so far drawn more than 17,660 participants and raised over $18.35 million. More than 80% of Phase 6 has already been sold, a surge in demand that further underlines growing market confidence in Mutuum Finance’s longer-term prospects and positions MUTM as both a near-term profit opportunity and a durable DeFi investment. The best crypto to invest in heading into 2025, MUTM continues to impress, bridging real-world utility with high-growth prospects. Sepolia Testnet to Open Doors for DeFi Innovation The release of the MUTM decentralized lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia testnet will mark another important development milestone for Mutuum Finance in Q4 2025. It uses on-chain efficiency tied with token-based functionality for seamless experiences among both lenders and borrowers. Investors will be able to deposit assets into mtTokens and earn passive yield. Borrowers will also be able to pledge ETH or USDT as collateral in order to get liquidity without having to sell their tokens while earning extra MUTM rewards by staking mtTokens. More than just a record-breaking presale, Mutuum Finance is a new crypto platform that holds great potential to be the next $1 token in 2025, hence making it the best crypto to invest in for early investors seeking high-growth decentralized finance exposure. So far, MUTM has raised over $18.35 million from more than 17,660 investors, and the Phase 6 sale is already 85% sold at $0.035 per token. With its soon-to-be-launched Sepolia testnet, yield-generating mtTokens, and a dual-lending DeFi model, this new crypto is clearly the best crypto to invest in right now. While XRP does seem to be showing its recovery process, MUTM offers a very rare opportunity for early investors to get in before the next phase price increase. Head over to the Mutuum Finance official platform today and secure your tokens as you position yourself for the growth wave to hit DeFi in 2025.

According to real-time market monitoring, BTC has unexpectedly fallen below the crucial $110,000 threshold. Specifically, Bitcoin is now trading at $109,907.95 on the Binance USDT market. This recent movement underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of digital asset valuations, prompting many to question the underlying causes and potential future implications of this shift. What’s Behind the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the immediate triggers for a Bitcoin price drop can be complex, as various factors often converge to influence market sentiment. While no single event can be definitively pinpointed without deeper analysis, such movements are typically a confluence of several forces: Macroeconomic Trends: Broader economic indicators, interest rate changes, or global geopolitical events can ripple through traditional markets and impact crypto. Market Sentiment: News, regulatory updates, or even social media trends can quickly shift investor confidence, leading to rapid price adjustments. Technical Analysis: Breaking key support levels can trigger automated selling orders, accelerating a downward trend as traders react to established patterns. Whale Activity: Large transactions by significant holders (often called ‘whales’) can create noticeable market shifts due to their substantial volume. This particular dip highlights the importance of staying informed and understanding the diverse forces at play in the crypto ecosystem. The market’s reaction to this drop demonstrates its sensitivity to both internal and external pressures. Navigating Volatility: What Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for Investors? For many, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can evoke strong emotions, from concern to excitement. However, experienced investors often view such periods as opportunities.

Here are some considerations: Long-Term Perspective: Many seasoned investors advocate for a long-term “HODL” strategy, where short-term fluctuations are less impactful than the asset’s overall growth trajectory. They focus on the bigger picture. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. A dip can mean buying more Bitcoin at a lower average cost over time. Risk Management: It’s crucial to only invest what you can afford to lose and to diversify your portfolio beyond a single asset. This minimizes exposure to any one particular downturn. Every market movement, including this recent decline, offers valuable lessons. It reinforces the need for a well-thought-out investment strategy rather than reactive decisions based on daily price changes. Is This an Opportunity? Analyzing the Bitcoin Price Drop While a significant Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, it often presents a buying opportunity for those with a long-term vision. Historically, Bitcoin has shown resilience, recovering from numerous dips to reach new all-time highs. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and careful consideration is always advised. Before making any investment decisions, it is essential to: Conduct Thorough Research: Look beyond the headlines and understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader market. This includes technological advancements and adoption rates. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Determine how much risk you are comfortable taking on without impacting your financial stability. Consult Financial Advisors: Seek professional guidance tailored to your individual financial situation and goals. The current trading level of $109,907.95 on Binance USDT serves as a new data point for market analysts and investors alike, influencing their models and strategies moving forward. This event certainly provides a moment for reflection and strategic re-evaluation. The Future Outlook: Beyond the Immediate Bitcoin Price Drop The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, with innovation and adoption continuing at a rapid pace. Despite short-term price movements like this recent Bitcoin price drop , many proponents remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value and a decentralized digital currency.

When storing cryptocurrencies, it’s crucial to understand two main types of wallets and how they differ in terms of convenience and security. A hot wallet is a software-based wallet connected to the internet (mobile app, desktop software, web wallet). Because it’s online it’s easy to access and transact, but also more exposed to hacks, malware and other online risks. A cold wallet keeps your private keys offline (hardware device, paper wallet, air-gapped device) and is therefore much more resistant to online attack vectors. The trade-off is less convenience and often a purchase cost. Many experts recommend a hybrid approach: use a hot wallet for small and frequent transactions, and a cold wallet for long-term holdings you want to keep safe. If you’d like a deeper dive into the difference between hot vs cold wallets, check out this article from which explains the details. Top Crypto Wallets (Safest Picks) Below is a curated list of the top 5 crypto wallets for 2025, selected for their balance of safety, usability and reputation. All are non-custodial (meaning you hold the keys) unless noted. 1. Trezor Why it’s #1 for safety Trezor remains the industry benchmark for secure cold storage — combining transparency, usability, and advanced safety features. Trezor is a well-established hardware (cold) wallet brand that gives you full control of your private keys. For example, the Trezor Safe 5 features a Secure Element chip (EAL 6+), a touchscreen interface and broad coin/token support. Since private keys are stored offline, this aligns with the “safest crypto wallet” concept for long-term holdings. Best for: Crypto investors holding significant amounts who prioritise security over instant access. Buy Trezor hardware wallet here See also: Which Trezor wallet should you buy in 2025? Full guide 2.

When tech giants like Meta make monumental shifts, the ripples are felt across global markets, including digital assets. Recently, Meta AI spending has surged to unprecedented levels, but instead of inspiring confidence, it triggered a massive sell-off. What does this mean for the broader tech ecosystem and investor sentiment? The Soaring Costs of Meta AI Spending Meta is pouring billions into its AI ambitions, a scale of investment that even in Silicon Valley is turning heads. The company is constructing two colossal data centers, with reports suggesting an astounding $600 billion could be allocated to U.S. infrastructure over the next three years. While such figures might typically be seen as a sign of aggressive growth, they’ve started to unnerve Wall Street. This concern intensified following Meta’s recent quarterly earnings report, which revealed a $7 billion year-over-year jump in operating expenses and nearly $20 billion in capital expenditure. This financial outlay is a direct consequence of intense spending on AI talent and infrastructure, yet it has not yielded significant revenue returns. When pressed for details, Mark Zuckerberg indicated that this spending spree is only just beginning. “The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we’re doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we’re building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don’t have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity.” Zuckerberg’s attempt to reassure investors ultimately backfired. Meta’s share price plummeted, losing over $200 billion in market capitalization by the end of the week. While $20 billion in quarterly profit is impressive, the sheer scale of AI investment without clear revenue streams raised significant questions. Unpacking Meta’s Massive AI Infrastructure Investment The core of Meta’s current financial challenge lies in its colossal AI infrastructure investment . This includes not just the construction of massive data centers but also the recruitment and compensation of top-tier AI researchers and engineers. The company is essentially building the foundational layers for future AI capabilities, aiming to achieve “truly frontier models with novel capabilities.” This strategy, while potentially transformative long-term, demands immense upfront capital. Unlike some competitors, Meta’s investment is primarily in foundational compute and talent, with the promise of future products rather than immediate, tangible revenue generators. The challenge for Meta is articulating how this massive investment will translate into a sustainable business model that satisfies investor expectations. The Alarming Meta Stock Drop: What Triggered Investor Panic? The market’s reaction was swift and severe. The Meta stock drop , exceeding 12% and wiping out over $200 billion in market cap, was a direct response to the earnings call. While Meta’s quarterly profits were substantial, the absence of a clear budget for projected AI spending and the lack of an anchoring product for revenue forecasts created a vacuum of uncertainty. Investors typically seek clarity on return on investment, and Zuckerberg’s general claims about the “promise of AI” were insufficient to quell their anxieties. This situation highlights a critical disconnect: Meta is operating with a long-term, research-heavy approach, while the market demands short-to-medium term product visibility and financial projections. Decoding Zuckerberg’s AI Strategy: Promises vs. Products A major point of contention for investors is the perceived ambiguity in Zuckerberg’s AI strategy . Despite the immense spending, Meta currently lacks a breakthrough AI product that can justify the investment in the eyes of the market. Zuckerberg alluded to “all kinds of new products around different content formats” and “business versions,” as well as improvements to the core business through “more intelligent models.” However, these remain general statements. Current offerings like the Meta AI assistant , while having over a billion active users (likely boosted by Facebook and Instagram integration), aren’t seen as direct competitors to services like ChatGPT . Other experiments, such as the Vibes video generator and Vanguard smart glasses, are promising but are not yet fully formed revenue drivers. The pressure is mounting for Meta to move beyond promising experiments and deliver concrete, market-defining AI products. Why Competitors Thrive: The AI Product Development Contrast It’s crucial to understand why Meta’s spending is causing such a stir when other tech giants like Google and Nvidia are also investing heavily in AI and having successful quarters. The key difference lies in the visible impact of their AI product development . Google integrates AI into its search, cloud, and advertising services, generating clear revenue. Nvidia sells the very hardware that powers the AI revolution, directly profiting from the buildout. OpenAI , often cited for its massive compute needs, operates ChatGPT, one of the fastest-growing consumer services in history, reportedly generating $20 billion a year in revenue. This tangible product and clear revenue stream provide a strong rationale for its significant investments. Meta, in contrast, has yet to showcase an AI product with comparable market traction or a clear path to substantial, independent revenue generation, leaving investors skeptical about the immediate returns on their massive outlays. Zuckerberg’s response to questions about infrastructure spending often points to the “next generation” of models from the Superintelligence Lab, promising “novel models and novel products” in the coming months. However, on an earnings call, such future-oriented statements, without concrete product roadmaps or revenue forecasts, are wearing thin with investors. While it’s only been a few months since the restructuring of Meta’s AI team, the clock is ticking for the company to clarify its role in the new AI industry. Will Meta AI leverage its vast user data to compete with established AI models? Is Vibes a precursor to a new consumer entertainment play? Or are Zuckerberg’s hints at “business AI” signaling an enterprise pivot? The answers remain speculative, and the market is demanding clarity, and soon. Conclusion: The Imperative for Clarity in Meta’s AI Journey Meta’s ambitious foray into AI, marked by colossal spending on infrastructure and talent, has placed the company at a critical juncture. While the long-term vision of developing “frontier models” is compelling, the immediate lack of clear, revenue-generating products has created significant investor unease, leading to a substantial Meta stock drop . The contrast with competitors like OpenAI, who can point to rapidly growing consumer services, highlights Meta’s challenge. For Meta to regain investor confidence, it must translate its immense AI infrastructure investment into tangible products that demonstrate a clear path to profitability. Zuckerberg’s AI strategy needs to evolve from broad promises to concrete roadmaps, showcasing how its AI product development will leverage its unique position and user base. The coming months will be crucial as Meta endeavors to prove that its unprecedented Meta AI spending is not just an expense, but a strategic investment poised for revolutionary returns.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Meta’s AI Strategy Why is Meta spending so much on AI? Meta is investing heavily in AI to build two massive data centers and recruit top AI talent. This AI infrastructure investment aims to develop “frontier models” with novel capabilities, which Mark Zuckerberg believes will unlock massive latent opportunities and improve core business functions across the Family of Apps . What caused the recent Meta stock drop? The significant Meta stock drop followed the company’s quarterly earnings report, which showed intense AI spending without clear, immediate revenue streams. Investors were concerned by the lack of specific product roadmaps and financial forecasts for the massive capital expenditure, leading to uncertainty about return on investment. How does Meta’s AI spending compare to competitors like OpenAI or Nvidia? While companies like Google and Nvidia also invest heavily in AI, their investments are tied to clear revenue generators (e.g., Google’s AI-enhanced services, Nvidia’s GPU sales). OpenAI , despite high spending, has a rapidly growing consumer product in ChatGPT , which generates substantial revenue. Meta, in contrast, is investing in foundational AI without a comparable, established, revenue-generating AI product. What are Meta’s current AI products? Meta’s current AI products include the Meta AI assistant (with over a billion users, largely integrated into Facebook and Instagram), the Vibes video generator, and the Vanguard smart glasses. However, these are largely considered promising experiments rather than fully formed, independent revenue anchors in the context of their massive AI product development spending. What is Mark Zuckerberg’s long-term vision for Meta AI? Mark Zuckerberg’s AI strategy centers on building “truly frontier models” through the Superintelligence Lab to create novel products and enhance the core business, including improving recommendations and advertising across the Family of Apps .

Ultimate 2025 Guide,https://coinpaper.com/12050/what-is-a-cold-wallet-ultimate-2025-guide,"What Is a Cold Wallet? A cold wallet is a cryptocurrency storage device that keeps your private keys completely offline, disconnected from the internet. Because of this isolation, cold wallets are far less vulnerable to hacking, phishing, and malware attacks — making them one of the safest crypto wallet options available for long-term investors. Cold wallets are typically physical hardware devices or even paper backups that store your recovery phrase securely. Unlike online wallets or exchange accounts, a cold wallet ensures you — and only you — control access to your crypto. Cold Wallet vs. Hot Wallet The main difference between a cold wallet and a hot wallet lies in internet connectivity. Hot wallets are always online — examples include mobile apps, desktop wallets, or web wallets. They’re convenient for daily transactions but inherently riskier. Cold wallets, on the other hand, store private keys offline, cutting off exposure to online hacking attempts. How a Cold Wallet Works A cold wallet works by securely generating and storing your private keys (the cryptographic keys that control your crypto) within a hardware device or another offline medium. When you want to send crypto, you sign the transaction offline using the wallet, then broadcast it online without ever exposing your keys. This process makes it nearly impossible for hackers to intercept or steal your funds remotely. Common Cold Wallet Types: Hardware Wallets – Dedicated devices like Trezor or Ledger that store keys securely. Paper Wallets – Physical printouts or written records of your private and public keys (now considered less practical). Air-Gapped Devices – Computers or phones permanently disconnected from the internet, used solely for signing transactions. Why Use a Cold Wallet? If you hold significant crypto assets, a cold wallet provides maximum security and peace of mind. Key Advantages : Private keys never touch the internet. Immune to phishing, malware, and exchange hacks. Ideal for “HODLers” or long-term investors storing large amounts. Potential Drawbacks : Requires buying hardware (extra cost). Slightly less convenient for quick trades or frequent transfers. You must safely back up your recovery seed — losing it means losing access. Best Cold Wallets in 2025 If you’re looking for trusted options, here are some of the top-rated devices: 1. Trezor Safe 5 / Safe 7 – Open-source firmware, strong encryption, and simple UI. → Buy Trezor here 2. Ledger Nano X / S Plus – Great mobile integration, supports thousands of tokens. 3. Tangem Card Wallet – NFC-based, portable, and beginner-friendly.

Unlike cold wallets, which keep your private keys offline, a hot wallet stores them on an internet-connected device — making it more convenient but less secure. Hot wallets are perfect for traders, active users, or anyone who needs to send and receive crypto frequently. However, since they’re online, they’re also more exposed to potential cyber threats like hacking or phishing. Hot Wallet vs. Cold Wallet The biggest difference between the two wallet types is connectivity: Hot wallets stay online, providing instant access to your crypto via web, mobile, or desktop apps. Cold wallets remain offline, making them immune to online hacks but less convenient for fast transactions. For a full explanation, read our guide: What Is a Cold Wallet? How a Hot Wallet Works A hot wallet manages your private keys through software on your device. When you send a transaction, the wallet signs it automatically and broadcasts it to the blockchain network in real time. Because the keys are stored on an internet-connected device, hot wallets offer ease of use but rely heavily on device security and user caution. Common Hot Wallet Types: Mobile Wallets – Apps like Trust Wallet or MetaMask for Android/iOS. Desktop Wallets – Software such as Exodus or Electrum. Web Wallets – Exchange-linked wallets (Binance, Coinbase) or browser extensions. Why Use a Hot Wallet? Hot wallets are ideal for active traders or casual users who need instant access to their crypto. They’re user-friendly, often free, and require no special hardware. Advantages : Immediate access to funds for trading, staking, or payments. Usually free and easy to set up on any device. Great for smaller holdings or experimenting with new tokens. Disadvantages : Constant internet connection increases the risk of hacking. Vulnerable to malware, phishing, or exchange breaches. Not recommended for storing large amounts of crypto long term. Popular Hot Wallets in 2025 Here are a few hot wallets that stand out for their functionality, security, and design: Exodus – Sleek interface, built-in swap, and non-custodial. Ideal for beginners. MetaMask – Essential for DeFi and NFTs; browser and mobile compatible. Trust Wallet – Binance-backed, supports thousands of coins and tokens. For maximum protection, experts recommend pairing a hot wallet for daily use with a cold wallet for long-term storage — ensuring both convenience and safety.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-02 16:45:04

This development follows the asset management’s achievement in launching the first-ever US Solana Spot ETF last week on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Bitwise Re-submits S-1 Form For XRP Spot ETF, Eyes Launch In 20 Days According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Bitwise recently filed an amendment to its S-1 registration form for the Bitwise XRP ETF. The filing, labeled Amendment No.4, includes new key details such as the exchange listing venue (NYSE) and a management fee of 0.34%. Balchunas describes these updates as “the last boxes to check,” indicating that Bitwise may have reached the final stage of approval. The amendment filing suggests the asset manager has completed major rounds of feedback with the SEC, with the proposed XRP Spot ETF now awaiting launch. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart also confirmed the development, noting that Bitwise and VanEck have joined the growing list of issuers positioning to launch new crypto-based ETFs in November. Earlier last week, Fidelity and Canary Funds had also filed similar updates for Solana-based products, while Canary additionally filed for an XRP-linked ETF. In particular, Seyffart notes that Bitwise’s XRP Spot ETF application contains a “shorter language” than others, i.e., looking more finalized, especially with all critical data, and could now trigger the SEC’s 20-day clock. Therefore, alongside Canary’s XRP Spot ETF , the Bitwise XRP ETF could automatically launch within 20 days following no further request or changes by the SEC. XRP Market Overview At press time, XRP continued to trade at $2.50, reflecting a minor 0.01% decline in the last day as the asset remained in consolidation. On larger time frames, XRP form reflects bearish dominance with losses of 4.55% and 17.27% on the weekly and monthly charts, respectively. According to renowned market analyst Ali Martinez, XRP’s Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap identifies its immediate resistance levels at $2.80 and $3.00. Meanwhile, the next support zone is around $2.15. Following the recent submissions by Bitwise and other asset managers, XRP looks set to join the elite league of cryptocurrencies with a US Spot ETF. The introduction of the XRP spot ETF is expected to significantly drive institutional interest in altcoin, resulting in long-term demand and price growth. Last week, Bitwise and Grayscale launched the first set of US Solana spot ETFs, which have gained much traction as indicated by a cumulative total net inflow of $199.21 million in four trading days.",XRP|Bitwise|Bloomberg|Eric Balchunas|James Seyffart|SEC|XRP Cost Basis Distribution|XRP spot ETF,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-02 17:00:16

While the month started in typical fashion—on a bullish tear, the intense downturn didn’t begin until October 10, when US President Donald Trump threatened new trade tariffs on China. Now, although the United States and China seem to have found a temporary truce, the cryptocurrency market has been unable to find similar relief. In fact, the latest on-chain data suggests that US investors are still less optimistic about the digital asset market, specifically Bitcoin. Negative Coinbase Gap Premium Coincides With Massive ETF Outflows In a November 1st post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Maartunn revealed that the world’s largest cryptocurrency has seen extremely low demand in the United States in recent days. The relevant indicator here is the Coinbase Premium Gap, which has entered a deep red territory in the past few days. Related Reading: Bitmine Buys 44,036 Ethereum Worth $166M During Market Dip – Details This on-chain metric measures the difference between the Bitcoin price on the US-based Coinbase exchange (USD pair) and the global Binance exchange (USDT pair). A positive difference indicates that the flagship cryptocurrency has a higher value on Coinbase than on Binance. When the Coinbase Premium Gap is positive, it implies that US-based investors are purchasing Bitcoin aggressively. On the flip side, a negative Coinbase Premium Gap typically indicates heavy selling pressure for the market leader. According to data highlighted by Maartunn, this on-chain metric is back around -$80, reflecting significant selling pressure from the US institutional players. This reduced demand can be seen with the disappointing performance of the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent days. Data from SoSoValue shows the Bitcoin ETFs registered a total net outflow of more than $191 million on Friday. This marked the third consecutive day of negative outflows, having seen withdrawals of nearly $500 million each on Wednesday and Thursday. From a historical perspective, a negative Coinbase Premium Gap is often correlated with periods of sluggish or downward movement for the BTC price. Hence, with the current intense selling pressure from large US investors, it is difficult to see the premier cryptocurrency making a strong recovery in the coming days. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $110,200, reflecting a measly 0.9% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down exactly 1% in the last seven days.

Recent data from the Steph Is Crypto X-post has drawn attention to the XRP Ledger’s dramatic drop in active addresses —from over 25,000 to 12,819. The sharpness of the move warrants closer examination of what’s happening beneath the surface of XRPL network usage. What the Data Shows According to Steph, daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) have dropped by about 50%, contrasting with previous reports of a significant surge. For example, other on-chain services previously recorded levels near 295,000 interacting addresses over short bursts, up from a 35,000–40,000 baseline. Some datasets show around 21,000 active addresses, reflecting an 80% decline since December. The current figure of approximately 12,819 suggests the downward move could be even deeper than some third-party snapshots. BREAKING: $XRP ACTIVE ADDRESSES JUST FELL FROM 25,000+ → 12,819. A SHARP COOL-DOWN IN NETWORK USAGE. pic.twitter.com/cHZSAo66fN — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 1, 2025 Possible Drivers of the Decline Several factors could underlie this cooling in XRPL on-chain activity. One possible explanation is that past spikes were fueled by one-time events such as airdrops or specific campaigns, and the recent drop is a return to normal. The network’s metrics, such as active addresses, have historically been highly volatile. Another theory is that retail engagement is fading or migrating to competing chains, trimming daily transaction counts. Additionally, exchange flows, whale movements, or concentration of activity among fewer addresses could skew the count of ‘active’ addresses without indicating true utility declines. Why It Matters For Market Structure Active addresses serve as a real-time proxy for network utility and user engagement. A halving of active participants can reduce fee flows, lower visible liquidity, and reduce speculative buying pressure that drives the price up. For XRPL, this suggests a challenge: without sustained growth in address activity or other demand drivers (such as institutional flows or real-world asset issuance), price may face headwinds. In an environment where on-chain metrics are considered forward-looking, this downturn raises questions about whether earlier bullish narratives around XRPL usage remain intact. A Silver Lining: Holders Are Growing In response to Steph’s post, Hannah offered a positive outlook. She noted that trading volume has dropped, but holder numbers are increasing. That, she said, is a strong sign of confidence. According to Hannah , once XRP’s price rises, more coins will return to circulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Increased price action could reignite network activity and restore balance between holding and spending. Her comment captures the optimism of long-term supporters. Many believe this cool-down represents strength, not weakness. What To Watch Next The coming days and weeks deserve close attention. Key signals will include whether active address counts stabilize around their new level, or rebound sharply—suggesting the drop was temporary. Exchange outflows and inflows into major wallets, as well as announcements involving tokenization or real-world asset (RWA) issuance on XRPL , should also be monitored. If the drop persists and is coupled with muted transaction volume or flat wallet creation, a broader rethink of XRPL’s short-term adoption thesis may be required. In conclusion, Steph’s alert to the active address plunge serves as a timely reminder: network metrics often reveal market undercurrents ahead of price moves. While the true cause of the drop on the XRPL remains open, the magnitude demands attention from traders, analysts, and institutional observers alike. For XRP stakeholders, the next chapter may depend largely on whether this cool-down is a temporary breath-holder or the onset of a deeper structural shift.

The Pudgy Penguins price prediction is a topic generating significant buzz among investors and enthusiasts alike. With their distinctive aesthetic and growing ecosystem, Pudgy Penguins have carved out a unique niche in the digital asset space. But how high can PENGU, their associated token, truly go? This comprehensive article dives deep into the factors influencing its potential trajectory, offering insights into its prospects from 2025 through 2030 and beyond. Prepare to explore the journey of these delightful digital collectibles and their impact on the broader Web3 landscape. What are Pudgy Penguins and the PENGU Crypto Token? Pudgy Penguins emerged as a collection of 8,888 unique NFT avatars on the Ethereum blockchain, quickly gaining a loyal following due to their endearing, whimsical designs. Beyond just digital art, Pudgy Penguins have evolved into a robust brand, extending their reach far beyond the initial NFT drop. The project is renowned for its strong community, innovative leadership, and a clear vision for intellectual property (IP) utilization. The PENGU crypto token is a more recent development, designed to further enhance the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. While the NFTs themselves represent ownership of a unique digital asset, the PENGU token aims to introduce utility, governance, and perhaps even fractional ownership or rewards within the expanding Pudgy World. It represents a strategic move to build a more interconnected and dynamic environment for holders and enthusiasts, fostering greater engagement and potential economic incentives. Key aspects of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem include: NFT Collection: The original 8,888 Pudgy Penguins and their Lil Pudgys counterparts.

PENGU Token: The native cryptocurrency intended to power future initiatives and provide value within the ecosystem. Key Drivers Shaping Pudgy Penguins Future Value Several critical factors will influence the Pudgy Penguins future and its associated PENGU token. Understanding these drivers is essential for any informed price prediction: 1. Brand Strength and IP Expansion Unlike many NFT projects that remain solely digital, Pudgy Penguins has successfully ventured into mainstream retail with its line of Pudgy Toys. These toys are not just merchandise; they are linked to the digital realm via unique QR codes, bridging the physical and digital worlds. Further IP licensing deals, media partnerships, and brand collaborations could significantly boost visibility, adoption, and ultimately, the value of both the NFTs and the PENGU token. 2. Community Engagement and Development A strong, active community is the backbone of any successful Web3 project. Pudgy Penguins boasts one of the most vibrant communities in the NFT space. Continued engagement, community-led initiatives, and effective communication from the leadership team (especially CEO Luca Netz ) will be vital. A growing and passionate user base directly contributes to demand and market stability. 3. Utility of the PENGU Crypto Token The long-term success of PENGU crypto hinges on its utility. If the token provides tangible benefits such as governance rights, staking rewards, exclusive access to events or merchandise, or serves as a medium of exchange within a growing Pudgy World metaverse or gaming ecosystem, its demand will naturally increase. A clear roadmap for token utility is crucial for sustainable growth. 4. Broader NFT Market Trends The overall health and sentiment of the NFT market forecast play a significant role. If the broader NFT space experiences a resurgence in interest and investment, projects like Pudgy Penguins, with established brands and strong fundamentals, are likely to benefit disproportionately. Conversely, a prolonged bear market in NFTs could exert downward pressure. 5. Macroeconomic Conditions and Cryptocurrency Adoption The wider cryptocurrency market and global macroeconomic factors also influence PENGU. Interest rates, inflation, regulatory clarity, and the overall adoption of digital assets by institutions and retail investors will impact liquidity and investment flows into the crypto and NFT sectors.

The NFT market forecast will also likely mature, favoring projects with strong communities and proven real-world integration. Potential Range: PENGU could comfortably trade between $40 and $70, reflecting its status as a blue-chip Web3 collectible and a recognized brand. Further adoption of its physical products and integration into digital experiences could drive this growth. Key Catalyst: Successful expansion into gaming, metaverse integrations, or major entertainment partnerships could propel PENGU significantly higher. Pudgy Penguins Price Prediction 2028-2030 By 2028-2030, if Pudgy Penguins maintains its leadership position and continues to innovate, the PENGU token could become a cornerstone of the Web3 collectibles market. The project’s ability to evolve with technological advancements (e.g., Layer 2 scaling, cross-chain interoperability) will be paramount. Long-Term Potential: In an optimistic scenario, where Pudgy Penguins becomes a global entertainment and lifestyle brand, PENGU could reach impressive highs, potentially ranging from $100 to $250 or even more. This would depend on the token’s widespread adoption for various services within its expansive ecosystem and its recognition as a premier Web3 collectible . Considerations: Competition from new projects, shifts in consumer preferences, and unforeseen technological disruptions remain risks. However, a strong brand like Pudgy Penguins is better equipped to weather such storms. Potential Roadblocks for Pudgy Penguins’ Growth While the outlook for the Pudgy Penguins future appears promising, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks that could impact its growth trajectory: NFT Market Volatility: The NFT market is notoriously volatile. Sudden shifts in investor sentiment, economic downturns, or a loss of interest in digital collectibles could negatively affect both NFT floor prices and the PENGU token. Competition: The Web3 space is highly competitive. New projects constantly emerge, vying for attention and investment. Pudgy Penguins must continuously innovate to maintain its edge. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and NFTs is still evolving. Adverse regulations could impact the operability of projects, the utility of tokens, and investor confidence.

The exchange earned a net income of $433 million, up from last year’s $75.5 million. Q3 Financial Results Coinbase shared on Thursday that its total net revenue for the quarter ended September 30 climbed to $1.8 billion, driven by higher trading volumes and growth in institutional services. Trading volume reached $295 billion, while assets on the platform totaled $516 billion, including $300 billion in assets under custody. On the other hand, transaction revenue jumped to $1.05 billion, compared to $572.5 million a year ago, as more traders took advantage of market volatility. Subscription and services revenue also rose by 34.3% year over year to $747 million. Adjusted net income stood at $421 million, and adjusted EBITDA reached $801 million. The company posted earnings of $1.50 per share, compared to $0.28 in the same period last year. Market analysts from LSEG had projected a profit of $1.06 per share. After the results were released, Coinbase’s stock gained more than 3% in after-hours trading. Digital assets rallied in July as crypto-friendly policies by U.S. President Donald Trump attracted institutional investor interest, sending Bitcoin to new highs. However, weak economic data in August caused fears of a potential recession, triggering a selloff as investors pulled back from riskier assets. Crypto exchanges often benefit from such volatility, as more trading means higher revenue from transaction fees. Expanding Market Reach and Stablecoin Growth Coinbase completed its acquisition of Deribit in Q3, with the two recording over $840 billion in notional derivatives trading volume. The company also introduced the first 24×7 perpetual-style crypto contracts in the U.S.. The firm achieved 90% coverage of the total crypto market capitalization and added support for trading more than 40,000 assets through its DEX integration while also reporting all-time highs in institutional loan balances and stablecoin usage. Stablecoin revenue reached $355 million, up 7% quarter over quarter, while the USDC market cap climbed to an all-time high of $74 billion. Additionally, the average USDC held in its products rose by 9% to $15 billion. Coinbase is also expanding its crypto utility, with over $100 million in One Card spending since launch. The platform credited part of this growth to the GENIUS Act, passed earlier this year, which established a regulatory framework for stablecoins. In a letter to shareholders, the firm said it is focused on “building the everything exchange,” a single platform for all tradable assets. “Coinbase is cash-rich and growth-ready,” said David Bartosiak, Stock Strategist at Zacks Investment Research. “The company isn’t just trading coins anymore. It’s building the backbone of the new financial internet.” The post Coinbase Q3 Net Income Soars 475% as Crypto Volatility Fuels Trading Boom appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-02 17:16:32

The chipmaker’s rise has shaken not just Wall Street but also the structure of the global economy. It has grown so large and powerful that entire markets now move in reaction to its earnings and outlook. The company is no longer just part of the system; it is the system. Nvidia’s surge has made it larger than six of the eleven sectors in the S&P 500 Index and more valuable than most national stock markets. Its influence now stretches far beyond technology, shaping how capital flows, how governments plan industrial policy, and how investors define risk. “This is obviously a massive outlier from a historical perspective, really something to behold for the ages,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at Manulife John Hancock Investments. Nvidia drives markets as AI spending explodes Since the start of 2023, Nvidia has been the main engine behind the market’s rally, minting billions for shareholders and turning CEO Jensen Huang into one of the world’s richest men. Just last week, the company announced new deals with Nokia, Samsung Electronics, and Hyundai Motor Group, tightening its grip across sectors that depend on advanced chips. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have all promised to spend even more on AI infrastructure, with combined capital outlays expected to climb 34% to $440 billion over the next year, according to Bloomberg data. Those investments are the reason Nvidia’s revenue forecast has exploded from $11 billion in 2020 to a projected $285 billion in the next fiscal year. At Nvidia’s GTC conference, Jensen tried to calm worries about a bubble, saying the enthusiasm was justified by technological progress. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, during his press conference on Wednesday, also pushed back on comparisons to the late-1990s dot-com mania. But the sense of imbalance is hard to ignore. “Trends like this reach a climax point and reverse, and we expect that will happen eventually,” Miskin said . “For the time being, companies at the epicenter of the AI race are doing the best in terms of earnings. Still, it does feel like the S&P 500 is putting a lot of eggs into one basket.” Analysts split as Nvidia towers over global markets As the largest company in the world, Nvidia now makes up 8.5% of the S&P 500, a share greater than the bottom 240 firms combined, according to Howard Silverblatt of Standard & Poor’s. Apple’s record weight once peaked at 7.7%, and Microsoft’s at 7.4%, but both now sit behind Nvidia. Together, the seven biggest U.S. tech stocks hold more than 36% of the entire S&P 500’s value. Globally, Nvidia’s size dwarfs many economies. It’s worth more than the stock markets of the Netherlands, Spain, the UAE, and Italy combined, and trails only the U.S., China, Japan, Hong Kong, and India. Nearly 91% of Wall Street analysts rate it a buy. HSBC’s Frank Lee recently lifted his price target to $230, implying a potential $8 trillion market cap. Still, one holdout remains: Jay Goldberg of Seaport Global Securities, who’s kept a sell rating since April with a $100 target, even as the stock more than doubled. While most large firms slow down after reaching massive scale, Nvidia hasn’t. It expects 60% revenue growth this fiscal year after two years of 126% and 114% jumps. By comparison, Microsoft is forecast to grow 15%, and Apple just 6.2%. Jensen’s fortune now sits at $176 billion, up more than $60 billion this year alone, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He owns 3.5% of Nvidia through personal and family trusts, filings with the SEC show.

Among the thousands of digital assets, Ethereum Classic (ETC) holds a unique position, often sparking intense debate and curiosity among investors. As a legacy blockchain, it carries a history distinct from its more prominent sibling, Ethereum. Many are now asking: What does the future hold for this resilient cryptocurrency? Specifically, what does the Ethereum Classic Price Prediction look like for 2025, 2026, and even 2030? And perhaps the most compelling question of all: Can ETC reach $100 ? Understanding Ethereum Classic (ETC): A Brief Overview To truly grasp the potential trajectory of ETC, it’s crucial to understand its origins and fundamental principles. Ethereum Classic emerged in 2016 following a contentious hard fork of the original Ethereum blockchain. This split occurred after a major hack of The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization built on Ethereum. While the majority decided to reverse the hack through a hard fork, a minority believed in the immutability of the blockchain, adhering to the principle that ‘code is law’. This group continued on the original chain, which became Ethereum Classic. Key characteristics of Ethereum Classic include: Immutability: A core tenet, meaning transactions, once recorded, cannot be altered or reversed. Proof-of-Work (PoW): Unlike Ethereum, which transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), ETC continues to use a PoW consensus mechanism, similar to Bitcoin. Fixed Supply: ETC has a capped supply, similar to Bitcoin, making it a deflationary asset. This can potentially influence its long-term value. Smart Contract Functionality: It supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), providing a platform for various blockchain-based innovations. These foundational elements play a significant role in shaping the long-term outlook and ETC Price Prediction . What Drives ETC Price Prediction? Unpacking Key Market Factors Predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently complex, influenced by a multitude of interconnected factors. For Ethereum Classic, several key drivers dictate its market performance and future potential: Overall Market Sentiment: The broader crypto market’s health significantly impacts individual assets. Bull runs tend to lift all boats, while bear markets can drag down even strong projects. Technological Developments and Upgrades: While ETC maintains its PoW ethos, ongoing developments like network security enhancements, scalability solutions, and interoperability improvements can boost its appeal. Adoption and Utility: The more dApps built on ETC, the more users it attracts, and the more transactions occur, the greater its utility and perceived value. Hash Rate and Security: A robust hash rate indicates strong network security, which is vital for a PoW chain. Higher security can attract more users and investors. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical events can all influence investor risk appetite and capital flow into cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Landscape: Clear and favorable regulations can provide certainty and encourage institutional investment, while restrictive policies can hinder growth. Competition: The blockchain space is crowded. ETC competes with numerous Layer 1 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and others, for developer and user attention. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any realistic Ethereum Classic Price Prediction . Ethereum Classic 2025: What’s on the Horizon for ETC? As we look towards the mid-decade, Ethereum Classic 2025 presents an interesting point for analysis. The crypto market operates in cycles, and by 2025, we could be in a different phase than today. Several factors will influence ETC’s performance: Post-Halving Dynamics: While ETC doesn’t have a Bitcoin-style halving, its supply schedule is deflationary. The broader market often reacts to Bitcoin’s halving events, which could have a ripple effect on altcoins like ETC. Increased Institutional Interest: If mainstream adoption continues to grow, more institutional money might flow into established, albeit niche, cryptocurrencies like ETC, seeking diversification. Technological Maturation: Continued stability and minor upgrades could solidify ETC’s position as a reliable, immutable blockchain for specific use cases, such as IoT or secure data storage. Developer Activity: A sustained increase in developer engagement and new projects on the ETC chain would be a strong bullish signal. Considering these points, here’s a plausible outlook for Ethereum Classic 2025 : Scenario Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price Bearish $15 $25 $35 Moderate $20 $40 $60 Bullish $30 $55 $80 These figures are speculative and depend heavily on market conditions and ETC’s own development trajectory. ETC Price Prediction 2026: Navigating the Mid-Term Landscape Moving into 2026, the crypto market will likely have matured further. For ETC Price Prediction in this period, we need to consider sustained trends and potential new narratives. If ETC successfully carves out a niche for itself, perhaps in areas where immutability and PoW security are paramount, its value proposition could strengthen. Key considerations for 2026: Ecosystem Growth: Are there new, significant projects or partnerships forming on the Ethereum Classic blockchain? Security Enhancements: Continued investment in network security and resilience against 51% attacks will be vital for investor confidence. Broader Crypto Adoption: If cryptocurrencies become more integrated into mainstream finance and commerce, ETC could benefit from the rising tide. Regulatory Clarity: Clear global regulations could open doors for larger institutional investments, impacting ETC’s liquidity and price. The path for ETC Price Prediction in 2026 could see a continuation of 2025 trends, potentially with increased volatility as the market reacts to new developments. Looking Ahead: Ethereum Classic 2030 and Beyond Projecting to Ethereum Classic 2030 requires a long-term vision, acknowledging the rapid pace of innovation in the blockchain space. By this time, the crypto landscape could be vastly different. ETC’s ability to remain relevant will depend on its adaptability while staying true to its core principles. Long-term drivers for Ethereum Classic 2030 : Technological Relevance: Can ETC maintain its competitive edge against newer, faster, or more scalable blockchains? Its PoW model might be seen as an advantage for certain use cases, or a disadvantage for others. Community Resilience: A strong, active, and dedicated community is essential for sustained development and adoption over the long haul. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with enterprises or other blockchain projects could unlock new utility and demand for ETC. Scarcity Effect: With a fixed supply, if demand increases significantly over time, the scarcity factor could drive its price upwards. The range of possible outcomes for Ethereum Classic 2030 is wider, reflecting greater uncertainty but also greater potential for significant growth or decline. The Ultimate Question: Can ETC Reach $100? This is the question on many investors’ minds. Can ETC reach $100 ? To answer this, we need to consider both historical performance and future potential. ETC has seen prices above $100 in the past, notably during the 2021 bull run, reaching an all-time high of over $170. This demonstrates that such a price point is not unprecedented for the asset. For ETC to consistently hold or surpass $100 in the future, several conditions would likely need to align: A Robust Bull Market: A general upswing in the entire cryptocurrency market, driven by significant capital inflow and positive sentiment. Increased Utility and Adoption: The development of compelling dApps and services on the ETC blockchain that attract a substantial user base and transaction volume. Strong Network Security: Continued vigilance and investment in securing the PoW chain, mitigating risks of 51% attacks. Positive Narrative: ETC needs to maintain a clear and attractive value proposition that differentiates it from other Layer 1 blockchains. Its immutability and PoW security could be its strongest selling points. Reduced Competition or Niche Dominance: While unlikely to overtake Ethereum, ETC could dominate specific niches where its characteristics are highly valued. While achieving $100 is ambitious, it is certainly within the realm of possibility, especially in a strong bull market scenario by 2025 or 2030. However, it requires sustained growth, development, and favorable market conditions. Key Drivers for Ethereum Classic’s Growth For ETC to thrive and potentially reach higher valuations, several growth drivers must be active: Developer Engagement: A vibrant ecosystem of developers building and maintaining tools, dApps, and infrastructure on ETC. Community Support: A strong, active, and passionate community that champions the project and contributes to its decentralization. Interoperability: Solutions that allow ETC to interact seamlessly with other blockchains, increasing its reach and utility. Enterprise Adoption: If businesses or institutions find specific use cases for ETC’s immutable ledger, such as supply chain tracking or secure data logging, it could significantly boost demand. Marketing and Awareness: Effective communication of ETC’s unique value proposition to a broader audience. Challenges and Risks for Ethereum Classic (ETC) No investment is without risk, and Ethereum Classic faces its share of challenges: Competition from Ethereum: Ethereum, with its larger developer base, ecosystem, and transition to PoS, remains a formidable competitor. Security Concerns: As a PoW chain with a smaller hash rate compared to Bitcoin, ETC has historically been vulnerable to 51% attacks. While measures have been taken, this remains a concern. Lack of Innovation: Critics argue that ETC has not innovated as rapidly as other blockchains, potentially leading to a decline in relevance. Market Volatility: Like all cryptocurrencies, ETC is subject to extreme price fluctuations, making it a high-risk asset. Funding and Resources: Ensuring adequate funding and resources for ongoing development and security is a continuous challenge. Is Ethereum Classic a Good Investment? Actionable Insights Deciding whether Ethereum Classic is a good investment depends entirely on an individual’s risk tolerance, investment goals, and market outlook. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Thoroughly investigate ETC’s technology, team, community, and market position. Understand the Risks: Be aware of the inherent volatility and security risks associated with ETC and the broader crypto market. Consider Long-Term Potential: If you believe in the principles of immutability and PoW, and see a niche for ETC, a long-term holding strategy might be suitable. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into one asset. Diversification helps mitigate risk. Invest Only What You Can Afford to Lose: Cryptocurrencies are speculative assets. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes affecting ETC.

He stated that although the MACD indicator moves into negative territory during horizontal consolidation periods, this time this signal is not decisive due to the lack of a clear five-wave bearish structure starting from above. The medium-term trend has remained intact since 2022, with highs and lows gradually increasing. Market sentiment is far from the level of over-optimism typically seen ahead of major peaks. According to Newton, when these indicators are combined, it appears that the “market top” narrative has yet to gain support.

According to Lee, many market participants expect Bitcoin's next peak to be in early 2026, but he noted that “when everyone is thinking the same way, that view is often proven wrong.” *This is not investment advice.

53951888,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=850545,1762104600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53951888.jpeg,Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: XRP Slips Back Below $2.60 as Investors Eye a New Crypto with Higher Upside,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-slips-back-below-2-60-as-investors-eye-a-new-crypto-with-higher-upside/,"Ripple (XRP) has dropped back below $2.60 in recent times, hitting key levels of support, and causing short-term traders to tread carefully. Analysts are highlighting that XRP’s consolidation could cause investors to seek new crypto opportunities with greater potential. Step in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a Phase 6 presale DeFi crypto selling for as low as $0.035 per token, that has exceeded 80% sold and collected over $18.27 million thus far. Through its revolutionary double-lending platform uniting Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending, MUTM gives investors an early-bird chance to invest in a project that is built for scalability and maximum capital efficiency. While XRP remains a top-shelf altcoin, Mutuum Finance is picking up traction among investors looking for greater potential for upside in the changing DeFi crypto landscape. XRP Displays Resilience After Fed Announcement, Bullish Trend in Sight? Ripple’s XRP has shown its moderate strength after the recent Federal Reserve announcement, and it is one of the strongest in the market. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and other big-shot assets, the decline of XRP was insignificant, an indication of the fundamental strength and increasing investor confidence. Technical analysts indicate that this short-term correction will most likely be a prelude to more bullish action, and XRP can be set to go even higher if momentum continues. As the anticipation builds for XRP to bounce back, investors also start considering alternate plays in the DeFi crypto segment with coins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gaining momentum rapidly for their explosive potential in the upcoming cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Paces the Pack with Explosive Presale Action Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains one of the top investment cryptos to watch in 2025, remaining highly sought by investors. Demand for the project has increased exponentially in its current multi-stage presale, with Stage 6 currently selling tokens at $0.035, last opportunity before a 20% token price hike in Stage 7. In another move towards increased accessibility, Mutuum Finance rolled out a significant upgrade that allows investors to buy MUTM with credit or debit cards . The new payment channel empowers both retail as well as institutional investors to accumulate MUTM tokens with ease without the legacy bottlenecks of DeFi crypto onboarding. In the meantime, the upcoming Q4 2025 lend & borrow protocol launch on Sepolia testnet is a milestone moment for Mutuum Finance. Launch will feature liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an auto-liquidator bot, with ETH and USDT supported upon launch. Additional assets will follow later, changing the project’s on-chain liquidity landscape and cementing its position as one of the best new crypto investments to provide utility, innovation, and community growth. MUTM Buyback System: Driving Long-Term Value Appreciation Another one of Mutuum Finance’s most innovative aspects is its buyback and redistribution process, designed to trigger long-term appreciation of tokens. Fees collected on the platform are utilized to buy MUTM tokens from the public market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This process generates predictable buy pressure, linking token value to genuine platform usage instead of speculative demand. By linking ecosystem utility to real rewards, Mutuum Finance forms a balanced and sustainable cycle of value for active users and long-term holders alike, a feature of the top new crypto investments of the year. Fostering Community Involvement through Leaderboards and Daily Rewards While the investor’s passion continued to grow, Mutuum Finance is growing its reward-based contributor network. There has been the introduction of an active 24-hour leaderboard sorting contributors by their daily deposits, resetting at 00:00 UTC each day. As part of an attempt to encourage regular contribution, the daily depositor for the day receives a $500 MUTM bonus, a mechanism designed to encourage positive competition and regular contributions. This reward system not only rewards community engagement but also aligns with the larger mission of Mutuum Finance: creating a prosperous, interactive DeFi crypto community in which effort and dedication are directly rewarded. As XRP falls under $2.60, investors are shifting their focus to Mutuum Finance, a new crypto priced at $0.035 and more than 80% sold out after it raised $18.27M. Its two-way lending strategy, buyback feature, and planned testnet place MUTM among the leading new crypto projects to invest in, with greater potential for upside and actual utility in DeFi crypto 2025.

When a company at the forefront of the AI revolution, like OpenAI, discusses its financial health, it sends ripples across every sector, including those exploring decentralized technologies. Recent comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman regarding the company’s OpenAI revenue have sparked considerable discussion, not just about the numbers themselves, but about the audacious future bets being placed in the burgeoning AI market . During a candid joint interview on the Bg2 podcast with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella , Altman addressed persistent questions about OpenAI’s financial performance and its colossal commitments to computing infrastructure. His responses, while sometimes delivered with a hint of exasperation, painted a picture of a company not just surviving, but thriving and planning for an unprecedented future. How is OpenAI’s Revenue Driving the AI Revolution? Reports had circulated that OpenAI was generating around $13 billion in annual revenue. While a substantial figure by any measure, it seemed dwarfed by the staggering multi-trillion-dollar commitments for computing infrastructure that the company has laid out for the next decade. When pressed on this by host Brad Gerstner , Sam Altman was quick to correct the record, stating, “First of all, we’re doing well more revenue than that.” This declaration immediately shifted the narrative, indicating a more robust financial standing than publicly understood. The conversation highlighted the intense scrutiny faced by companies leading the AI charge. Every financial disclosure, every growth projection, is dissected for clues about the sustainability and trajectory of this transformative technology. For the broader tech and crypto communities, OpenAI’s financial health is a bellwether, signaling confidence in the underlying technologies that could power everything from advanced trading algorithms to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). A strong OpenAI revenue stream suggests significant adoption and monetization of its AI models, which in turn fuels further research and development, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation. Key Financial Insights from the Discussion: Revenue Exceeds Estimates: Altman confirmed OpenAI’s annual revenue is “well more” than the reported $13 billion. Aggressive Growth Trajectory: Altman countered a speculative $100 billion revenue target by 2028 or 2029 with a confident “How about ‘27?” Investor Confidence: Altman’s offer to find a buyer for shares, and Gerstner’s immediate interjection of “Including myself,” underscores strong investor appetite. Is OpenAI’s Massive AI Spending Sustainable? The elephant in the room for many investors and analysts is OpenAI’s commitment of over $1 trillion in AI spending for computing infrastructure over the next decade. This colossal figure raises legitimate questions about how a company, even one with rapidly growing revenue, plans to finance such an ambitious endeavor. Altman’s response, while assertive, was rooted in a deep conviction about the future value creation of AI. He acknowledged the “breathless concern” from critics but dismissed their skepticism, even wishing for a public listing so they could short the stock and “get burned on that.” This fiery retort underscores his belief in the company’s long-term vision and its ability to generate the necessary capital. The spending is not merely an expense; it’s an investment in foundational technology that Altman believes will unlock unprecedented value across multiple domains. OpenAI’s Strategic Investments: The significant AI spending is earmarked for: Computing Resources: Securing access to vast amounts of computational power, essential for training and running advanced AI models. Research and Development: Pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities, from general intelligence to specialized applications. Infrastructure Development: Building the necessary data centers and networks to support a global AI ecosystem. This massive investment is a bet on the future, predicated on the idea that the value generated by increasingly capable AI systems will far outstrip the cost of developing them. For those in the crypto space, this mirrors the early days of blockchain infrastructure, where significant capital was deployed to build networks whose true value was yet to be fully realized. What Does the Microsoft Partnership Mean for OpenAI’s Future? A critical component of OpenAI’s financial stability and strategic advantage is its deep Microsoft partnership . Satya Nadella, who chuckled through much of Altman’s passionate defense, affirmed Microsoft’s confidence in OpenAI, stating that the company has “beaten” every business plan it has given Microsoft as an investor. This endorsement from one of the world’s largest and most influential tech companies is invaluable. The partnership provides OpenAI with crucial resources, including significant cloud computing infrastructure (Azure AI Supercomputer), capital investment, and access to Microsoft’s vast enterprise customer base. This symbiotic relationship allows OpenAI to focus on its core mission of advancing AI, while Microsoft integrates these cutting-edge capabilities into its products and services, creating a powerful synergy that benefits both entities. Benefits of the Microsoft Partnership: Benefit Area Impact on OpenAI Impact on Microsoft Funding & Investment Crucial capital for R&D and infrastructure. Strategic stake in leading AI innovator. Compute Resources Access to vast Azure AI Supercomputer capacity. Drives Azure cloud adoption and innovation. Market Access Broader reach into enterprise and consumer markets. Enhances product offerings (e.g., Copilot). Technological Collaboration Shared expertise and accelerated development. Keeps Microsoft at the forefront of AI. This strategic alliance mitigates some of the financial risks associated with OpenAI’s aggressive AI spending and provides a stable foundation for its ambitious growth plans. The confidence expressed by Nadella further solidifies the perception of OpenAI as a long-term player with strong backing. Sam Altman’s Vision: Public Company or Private Powerhouse? Despite the strong financial performance and ambitious growth targets, Sam Altman was quick to dismiss recent reports of an imminent IPO for OpenAI. “No no no, we don’t have anything that specific,” he stated, adding, “I’m a realist, I assume it will happen someday, but I don’t know why people write these reports. We don’t have a date in mind, we don’t have a board decision to do this or anything like that.” However, his earlier comments about wishing critics could short the stock if OpenAI were public reveal a nuanced perspective. While not actively pursuing an IPO, the idea of public accountability and market validation clearly holds some appeal. For now, it seems OpenAI prefers the flexibility and long-term focus afforded by its private status, allowing it to make massive, long-term investments without the quarter-to-quarter pressures of public markets. The decision to remain private for the foreseeable future allows OpenAI to continue its strategic AI spending without immediate shareholder pressure for short-term returns. This is particularly relevant for a company engaged in foundational research and development, where payoffs may be years away but potentially revolutionary. Navigating the Explosive AI Market: Where Does OpenAI Stand? Altman’s forward-looking vision for OpenAI extends beyond its current successes with ChatGPT. He articulated a broad strategy to become a dominant force across multiple facets of the AI market . This includes not only the continued growth of ChatGPT but also establishing OpenAI as a significant “AI cloud” provider, developing a “consumer device business,” and creating AI that can “automate science” to generate immense value. This expansive vision positions OpenAI not just as a developer of AI models, but as a full-spectrum AI company, aiming to influence infrastructure, end-user products, and even fundamental scientific discovery. The rapid growth of the AI market , fueled by advancements in large language models and increasing computational power, presents both immense opportunities and fierce competition. OpenAI’s Future Growth Pillars: ChatGPT Expansion: Continuous improvement and broader adoption of its flagship conversational AI. AI Cloud Services: Offering its powerful AI models and infrastructure to other businesses as a service. Consumer Devices: Exploring hardware integration to bring AI directly to users in new ways. Automating Science: Developing AI tools to accelerate scientific research and discovery, creating societal and economic value. The aggressive pursuit of these diverse growth avenues underscores OpenAI’s ambition to not just participate in, but to define the future of the AI market . The company’s ability to execute on these fronts will be critical to sustaining its impressive OpenAI revenue growth and justifying its monumental AI spending . Conclusion: A Bold Bet on the AI Future Sam Altman ‘s recent remarks offer a compelling glimpse into the mind of a leader at the helm of a company poised to reshape the world. While questions about the sheer scale of OpenAI’s financial commitments are valid, Altman’s confidence, backed by strong OpenAI revenue growth and a robust Microsoft partnership , suggests a firm belief in their trajectory. The company is making a monumental bet on the future of AI, anticipating that the value created by its innovations will not only justify its massive AI spending but also establish it as a dominant force in the rapidly expanding AI market . This vision, while audacious, is precisely what drives technological revolutions. For those watching from the cryptocurrency space, OpenAI’s journey offers valuable parallels and insights into the power of decentralized innovation and the transformative potential of cutting-edge technology. The future of AI, much like the future of blockchain, promises to be nothing short of extraordinary. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is OpenAI’s current annual revenue?

The company said on Sunday that its “focus is now on ensuring stability of supply to customers,” according to statements shared with reporters. Nexperia did not comment on remarks made by its Chinese subsidiary, which said it intends to accelerate steps toward operating more independently. Dutch officials said they are still holding talks with their Chinese counterparts, the U.S. government, and representatives from the auto and semiconductor sectors to find, as they described it, a “constructive way forward.” The dispute over control of the company has already triggered shortages and raised alarms across the global auto industry. Automakers around the world rely on Nexperia for large volumes of basic semiconductor components used in nearly every car model on the road. Those components are small and inexpensive, but they connect batteries to motors, run sensors, manage braking systems, control airbags, power entertainment screens, and operate electric windows. Disruption in supply has left automakers warning of production cuts if the situation drags on. Governments respond to ownership and national security fight Nexperia is owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, and the Dutch government took control of the chipmaker in October under a national security law from the Cold War era. Officials said they were concerned that Wingtech planned to shift intellectual property to another business it controls. A Dutch court suspended Nexperia CEO Zhang Xuezhen on grounds of mismanagement during the same period, adding another layer of tension to the dispute. China responded weeks later by blocking Nexperia chips made or processed in China from leaving the country. That immediately hit the supply chain, since about 70% of Nexperia’s chips begin production in Europe but are assembled and tested in China before being shipped to automakers in Europe and other regions. With shipments halted, Nexperia told car manufacturers it could no longer guarantee supply. Meanwhile, Western governments have increased scrutiny of companies linked to Chinese technology networks. The United States added Wingtech to a government blacklist in December 2024, alleging the company “aided China’s government’s efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.” The blacklist restricted Wingtech’s access to American technology and intensified the diplomatic pressure surrounding Nexperia. Talks show signs of progress but risks remain Meetings took place on Saturday in Europe as officials attempted to lower tensions. Reports on Friday said the United States plans to allow Nexperia to resume exports under a framework worked out during discussions between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. On Saturday, Chinese officials said they will exempt certain Nexperia products from export controls. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would “comprehensively consider the actual situation of the enterprise and exempt eligible exports.” The ministry did not specify which products would qualify. Automakers, including Volkswagen, Nissan, and Mercedes-Benz, had already warned in late October that supply problems could lead to production cuts. While carmakers typically maintain small chip reserves and can sometimes shift to backup suppliers, they emphasized that switching suppliers quickly is difficult because these chips are deeply embedded in vehicle engineering and safety systems. Nexperia reported $2 billion in sales last year. The company produces billions of the foundation-level chips that power everyday electronics, not just automobiles. These components are present anywhere electricity flows. If the exemptions and export framework are finalized, they could ease immediate pressure on automakers. But the broader fight over who controls Nexperia, how its technology is governed, and how security oversight is handled remains unresolved. The negotiations are not finished, and the supply chain remains fragile. Get seen where it counts.

Some argue that cryptocurrency embodies the energy expended in its creation. Others argue that energy is merely consumed, not retained. The discussion highlights deep misconceptions about how Proof-of-Work (PoW) actually functions and what it secures. The Misconception About “Stored Energy” The idea that energy is stored in Bitcoin is scientifically inaccurate. Electricity powers computers that perform cryptographic work, but once used, that energy is gone. Bitcoin does not contain the energy—it records proof that work was done. Each block is evidence of computation, not a battery of stored power. It's stored in the Bitcoin protocol, every block is mined according to the difficulty of the network at that time. Hence the name, Proof of Work, every block is a proof that a certain amount of Work that costs energy went into it. If i want to double spend on Bitcoin, i need… — Vet (@Vet_X0) October 31, 2025 Understanding Proof-of-Work Proof-of-Work is the backbone of Bitcoin’s security. It requires miners to solve mathematical puzzles using computational energy. When a miner finds a valid hash, a new block is created. That block becomes a verifiable record of the work done, ensuring the blockchain’s immutability. The greater the network’s difficulty, the more energy miners expend to maintain it. Why Energy Use Matters The energy used in Bitcoin mining is what makes it expensive to attack. To alter previous transactions, an attacker must redo the work for all affected blocks. This would require enormous energy and cost. Thus, Bitcoin’s security depends on the total energy expended—not on the idea of energy being stored within the tokens. Vet’s Clarification on X In a detailed post on X, prominent analyst Vet addressed the debate. He explained that Bitcoin’s blocks represent cryptographic proof of the energy used to mine them. Each block’s difficulty reflects the hashpower required to produce it. According to Vet, this is why the network is secure: the “stored work” makes double-spending costly and nearly impossible.

His point was clear—proof of energy use doesn’t automatically create value. Spending energy shows effort, not worth. Vet agreed, stating that Bitcoin’s energy cost, while unrelated to price, serves as a tangible measure of the work done. The Cost of Security Independent research from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance shows Bitcoin’s annual power use in the tens of terawatt-hours. This immense consumption provides economic protection but raises environmental concerns. The expense of reproducing that energy is what keeps Bitcoin’s network secure against attacks. Can XRP Adopt Proof-of-Work? Vet suggested introducing PoW to XRP, sparking reactions. Yet the XRP Ledger operates on a consensus model that requires minimal energy. Adding PoW would undermine its efficiency, speed, and sustainability. XRP’s protocol achieves consensus through validators rather than miners, prioritizing low cost and eco-friendly operation. A Clearer View of Proof-of-Work Vet’s insight underscores a crucial truth. Bitcoin doesn’t store energy—it proves that energy was used to build and secure its ledger. That distinction defines the essence of Proof-of-Work. Understanding it separates myth from mechanism and clarifies how Bitcoin’s strength comes not from stored energy, but from verifiable effort and cost.

These factors are ever-changing, and leveraging them for profits can be an uphill task. According to ElonTrades, the “space is a dumpster fire.” What used to run on retail hype and halving memes now runs on macro liquidity and institutional flows. Narratives shape market liquidity and crypto pricing dynamics, and for someone who has been in the space since 2017 and experienced multiple crypto cycles, there are lessons to be learnt. ElonTrades is an outspoken voice on X, famous in crypto circles for his honest, no-frills take on crypto. In this edition of the Cryptopolitan Meet Your KOL, ElonTrades dispenses tips you can employ to survive crypto burnout and profit from the market cycles. Getting into crypto Q: What first pulled you into crypto was it curiosity, opportunity, or something else entirely? A: Oh, absolutely, a monetary opportunity, but fueled by an understanding of why people would value sovereign money and its programmability long-term. Writing was on the wall for me in 2017. Q: How has your perspective on this space changed since you started? What surprised you the most about how the industry evolved? A: Near absolute disillusion. The space is a dumpster fire, but despite that, money will always be made riding liquidity cycles and flipping narratives. Surviving crypto burnout Q: Many people enter crypto hoping to “make it.” What separates those who survive from those who burn out fast? A: Burn out will happen regardless. What separates people who make it vs people who don’t is persistence, patience and the proper amount of greed. As with anything in life, that means don’t give up after failing a few times, wait for low entries and high exits, which could take 12-24 months (swing and long-term holders generally outperform high frequency traders), and start selling when the amount of money is life-changing, not necessarily yacht-making. Chasing insane wealth always leads to round-tripping. Q: You often talk about health, discipline, and a healthy lifestyle. Do you think that balance, from diet training, actually helps you make better investing decisions and stay calm and focused in the market’s chaos? A: A healthy mind and body help you make sounder investment decisions. Meditation and diet are more important than resistance and cardio. ElonTrades on market cycle strategies Q: You often encourage people to hold long-term instead of chasing every short-term move. What key things do you consider before deciding that a project is worth holding through the noise? A: Generally, buying mid- to late-bear and beginning to sell midway into a bull market is the most stress-free and profitable method. I look for decent tokenomics, a passionate founder, a popular cycle narrative, and real-world application and/or revenue generation. Q: If you could give one honest piece of advice to someone entering crypto now, what would it be, beyond the usual “do your own research”? A: It’s a PVP market, so don’t get left holding the bag; most of this stuff is worthless. A PVP market in this context means you are trading against people trying to outsmart you. Traders push hype, spin stories, and exit before others realize the game, and therefore, you must be strategic, skeptical, and fast when investing in the space.

Between Trump’s unpredictable tariffs, a court case that threatened $20 billion in annual revenue, and criticism over weak AI products, Apple’s problems stacked up fast. In April, the company’s value dropped to $2.6 trillion, wiping away its crown as the world’s most valuable company. Six months later, it passed $4 trillion, without a breakthrough device. That’s more than 10x the size of Apple when Tim took over 14 years ago. He didn’t need a shiny new product to get there. While critics kept asking why Apple wasn’t first to jump into big AI features, Tim focused on keeping the machine running. His strategy wasn’t flashy. He made it political, legal, and operational, and it worked. Behind the scenes, Apple survived tariffs, sidestepped antitrust fallout, and convinced users to keep spending on services. It was enough to avoid collapse. Tim dodges Trump’s tariff threats without giving much up The worst moment came on “Liberation Day” in April. Trump announced massive tariffs on Chinese-made goods. Since most iPhones are still made in China, Apple’s stock nosedived over 20% in a few days. Trump had already gone after the company’s supply chain before, saying it should come back to the U.S. “We’re not interested in you building in India. India can take care of themselves,” Trump said in May. But Tim had already started moving iPhone assembly to India years earlier. So when Trump fired the tariff gun, Apple was able to quietly ship India-made iPhones to the U.S. to escape it. The supply chain, built over 20+ years in Asia by Tim himself, isn’t moving back to America. There’s no cheap, skilled labor base in the U.S. that can replace what exists in China, India, and Vietnam. Knowing Trump liked headlines more than outcomes, Tim leaned into it. In 2018, Apple promised to “invest $350 billion” in the U.S. over five years, spending they already planned to do anyway, according to insiders. In 2019, facing more tariffs, Tim gave Trump a tour of a Mac Pro plant in Texas. “Today I opened a major Apple manufacturing plant in Texas,” Trump claimed. The plant had actually been open since 2013. Tim said nothing. In August this year, Tim did it again. This time, the number was $600 billion in U.S. investments. Same trick. Same playbook. Most of the spending was already budgeted. He made the announcement standing next to Trump in the Oval Office, handing him a gold-plated plaque. Projects included a $2.5 billion deal with Corning in Kentucky, a $500 million rare-earth deal, and some AI server manufacturing in Texas. But none of it was about making iPhones in the U.S. Trump liked what he saw. Apple got exempted from full electronics tariffs. The smaller China tariffs were cut in half. Tim escapes Google antitrust ruling and calms investors with iPhone 17 Then came the Google case. A judge was reviewing whether Google’s deal with Apple, to remain the default search engine on Safari, was legal. If that contract were struck down, Apple could lose over $20 billion a year. That’s about 20% of Apple’s operating profit. Tim didn’t show up. He sent Eddy Cue, Apple’s services boss. Cue told the judge he had “lost a lot of sleep” over possibly losing the deal. He warned that the tech market moves fast enough to sort itself out. The judge agreed, calling the market “already shifting” due to AI, and said ending search deals would hurt companies like Apple. That was it. Case over. As one analyst put it, “Apple didn’t just dodge a bullet; they dodged a missile.” After that, Tim got back to the product. Just after Labor Day, Apple hosted hundreds at its campus to show off the iPhone 17 series. The iPhone Air was the headline device, but customers didn’t love it; worse camera, single speaker, weaker battery, and high price. It didn’t matter. Apple added just enough new stuff to the rest of the iPhones to keep people upgrading. Now Apple’s predicting up to 12% revenue growth this holiday quarter, which is double what Wall Street expected. While critics call Apple slow on AI, the company still buys back $100 billion worth of its own stock each year. And thanks to subscriptions, App Store ads, and services like Apple News (which includes a deal with News Corp), Apple passed $100 billion in service revenue this year. Those services make more profit than the devices. Nine years ago, people laughed at AirPods. Now they’re everywhere. Same for the Apple Watch. Tim didn’t rush. He just kept growing the business. He’s not a “product guy” like Steve Jobs. He doesn’t live in the design studio. But under Tim, Apple now designs its own chips. Some say he should be replaced by someone more visionary when he eventually leaves. That day isn’t coming soon. When he steps down, he’s expected to stay on as executive chairman.

Analysts say that this lukewarm move indicates while BTC is still the market leader, genuine potential in the next few months could be with up-and-coming altcoins with potential to outdo. With investors seeking the best crypto to buy in renewed “risk-on” conditions, attention is now being focused on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a fresh DeFi project trading at a low of $0.035. Now at Phase 6 of presale with over 80% sold and over $18.27 million raised, Mutuum Finance is rapidly being referred to as the next big crypto to keep an eye on in 2025. With its two-part lending framework, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending, there is greater efficiency in capital and real utility compared to other speculative tokens. With the Fed move serving as a positive risk asset backdrop, analysts think initial Mutuum Finance buyers may be positioning themselves for one of the year’s best crypto to buy opportunities and strongest DeFi breakouts. Bitcoin (BTC) Bounces Near $111K Following Fed Rate Cut Bitcoin (BTC) stands at about $111,323, with minimal to no reaction to the recent Fed rate cut, and actually down by about 2% within the past 24 hours. As much as there is increased trading volume and overall risk-on sentiment, BTC is still bounded below pivotal resistance, the Ichimoku Cloud and the 100-day moving average (100MA), with the 200-day moving average (200MA) being the key support. A break over the Cloud and 100MA would confirm fresh strength, but a fall beneath the 200MA could set in motion deeper losses. As Bitcoin takes a break, investors are busily searching for the next big crypto with greater upside than the currently limited gains of BTC, and that search is increasingly focusing on newly emerging DeFi projects with early-stage momentum like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is quickly being recognized as the best crypto to buy in the current market climate. Mutuum Finance Presale Nears Complete Sell-Out in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the talk of DeFi right now as its presale is racing towards a full sell-out in Phase 6. The tokens are available at $0.035, the last price entry point before the next planned price hike of almost 20% to $0.04 in Phase 7. The project has progressed through its initial five stages at a phenomenal rate, earning admiration as one of the next big cryptos for 2025. Over 17,660 investors have already joined the bandwagon, pushing the presale to an all-time high of $18.27 million so far. The level of support demonstrates increasing investor confidence and makes Mutuum Finance one of the best crypto to buy today for those looking to leverage near-term potential and long-term value growth in the DeFi market. With Built-In Security, Stability, and Intelligent Risk Management On the back of a risk-weighted lending platform that is secure and programmed to protect the users and the protocol as its basis, Mutuum Finance works. With its Loan-to-Value (LTV) framework having borrowing caps held in decent collateral ratios so risk exposures are low, every asset that is supported carries an individualized liquidation point depending on its risk profile, it is therefore an equilibrated and cut-and-dry setup. The protocol also incorporates a reserve factor, an internal buffer of safety against market shocks or defaults. Riskier assets have larger reserves, which spread protection and stability overall for investors. Mutuum Finance’s multi-tiered risk management makes it one of the most secure and stable DeFi lending platforms in existence, with the ability to carry on with smoother operations even in times of darkness. What’s Coming Next on the Roadmap: Adoption of Stablecoin and DeFi Expansion In addition to its presale record, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself to take the next step in its ecosystem. Among the things in store are the release of a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin that will be backed by on-chain-verified assets. This stablecoin will be a central feature of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem because it will act as a base asset for lending and borrowing activities. By correlating loan value and repayment with a stable, fixed asset, the protocol will essentially eliminate exposure to market volatility, providing stable returns for lenders and borrowers. This will be yet another milestone in turning Mutuum Finance into the next big crypto and a leading sustainable and transparent decentralized finance solution. As Bitcoin tucks into $111K following the Fed reduction, investors are opting for faster-growing plays. At $0.035 and more than 80% sold following an $18.27M raise, Mutuum Finance is being touted as the best crypto to buy right now, as well as the next big crypto leading 2025’s bull cycle.

FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried recently claimed that all creditors had received over 100% recovery. According to Sunil, this rate could actually be even lower due to the current high levels of crypto prices. Sunil stated that despite the nominal 143% payout to be made as part of FTX’s bankruptcy process, creditors “will not be able to fully recover their losses” in actual crypto value.

He explained that Paradex has already airdropped tokens to FTX creditors, and that other projects are expected to follow suit. Sunil made the following statement: The actual crypto recovery rate in the FTX bankruptcy is between 9% and 46%. However, due to high crypto prices, this is likely lower. I've observed a tendency in some circles to protect scammers and attack projects that help creditors. Additional recovery will come from airdrops projects will make to FTX creditors.

The figure has more than doubled in just three months, climbing from $400 million in August. Launched less than a year ago, RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and backed by deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents, offering stability and security to users. Ripple’s RLUSD Growth Over $1.5 million in renewed University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) grants have already been funded entirely in RLUSD. Just last week, Brale, a platform that allows businesses to issue USD-backed stablecoins, integrated with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to enable settlement in RLUSD. Shortly thereafter, Ripple also completed the acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road in a $1.25 billion deal, which will now operate as Ripple Prime. The firm’s clients are reportedly using RLUSD as collateral or holding their balances in the stablecoin. The updates were shared by Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of Stablecoins at Ripple. As reported by CryptoPotato , VivoPower International PLC’s electric vehicle subsidiary, Tembo e-LV, began accepting payments in RLUSD in September. The main objective behind the move is to streamline international payments by addressing long settlement times and high costs often associated with traditional wire transfers. According to Tembo, transactions made with the stablecoin can be completed almost instantly and at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods. The company expects the shift to RLUSD to improve operational efficiency, reduce transaction costs, and expand its treasury options within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The decision to use RLUSD instead of Ripple’s more established cryptocurrency, XRP, has prompted curiosity among observers. While the company did not clarify its reasoning, the choice likely stems from RLUSD’s price stability, which makes it more suitable for payment and settlement use cases compared to XRP’s volatility. RLUSD and XRP Can Coexist Alexis Sirkia, Captain of the Yellow Network, recently said that he views Ripple’s RLUSD as a complement, and not a rival, to XRP. According to him, the stablecoin acts as a “liquidity amplifier,” which could support XRP’s role rather than competing with it. Sirkia explained that RLUSD’s integration within the US banking system gives it the compliance and infrastructure needed to function as a reliable settlement layer for institutions. As RLUSD activity grows, so does the demand for XRP as a bridge asset within the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. He noted that the stablecoin is already being used in African markets through payment platforms like Chipper Cash and Yellow Card and is facilitating real-time swaps with tokenized money market funds. With expanding institutional engagement, including ETFs, and RLUSD’s broader integration, Sirkia expects transaction volumes across the network to accelerate and thereby strengthen the link between traditional financial systems and decentralized finance.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $11.16, with a possible maximum trading value of $11.91 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $17.86 and $19.35, with an average price of $18.60. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

Ripple price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events, as the price movement is in an upward direction. The coin’s price has increased to a high of $2.54 over the last 24 hours. The coin has gained up to 1.73 percent of its value. Technical indicators give bearish signals, but the price charts project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying interest took hold, bringing the price to $2.54 during the day. The RSI increased to 48.29 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.72 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the start of the next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $19.35 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that the Canary XRP ETF will launch in November. Asset manager, Canary, has submitted an updated S-1 registration statement to the SEC for its XRP spot ETF, which, according to the news, is set to start trading on November 13, 2025. XRP price prediction November 2025 According to the Ripple price prediction, in November 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.60.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October, XRP was trending near the $2.90 mark, and in November, it has fallen to the $2.40 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-02 18:49:57

The meme cryptocurrency burned over 1 million tokens in the past 24 hours, according to data from Shibburn. Recent blockchain data shows 1,069,637 SHIB tokens were removed from circulation in the last day. However, the daily burn rate fell by 86.53% during this period. The seven-day burn metric tells a different story. A total of 61,170,467 SHIB tokens were burned over the past week, representing a 139.46% increase in the weekly burn rate. October Losses Set Stage for November Recovery October proved challenging for Shiba Inu holders. The token recorded a nearly 16% decline, marking its first red October in several years. This performance occurred during Q4, typically a period of positive growth for cryptocurrency markets. At press time, SHIB trades at $0.00001, down 1.3% in the last 24 hours. The token faces immediate resistance at $0.0000113, with a secondary barrier at $0.0000126. Support levels hold in the $0.000009 range. Technical analysts note the asset remains in consolidation mode. SHIB Price, Source: CoinMarketCap Market participants are closely watching whether SHIB can break above its current resistance zones. A sustained move higher would signal the start of a genuine recovery. Failure to hold support could lead to further downside. Historical November Performance Shows Mixed Results November has produced varied outcomes for Shiba Inu over the years. In November 2021, the token dropped 29.61% after reaching all-time highs earlier that year. The following November in 2022 saw another decline of 24.9%. The trend shifted in November 2023 when SHIB posted a 6.55% gain. Last November, in 2024, the token delivered strong results, with the token surging 49.33%. This inconsistent historical pattern makes November 2025 particularly interesting for traders. Recent developments have added legitimacy to the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

This development comes as the general crypto market continues to show high levels of volatility driven by macro influences, as seen in the majority of October. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Investors Back In Accumulation Mode? On-Chain Data Says ‘Possibly’ Bitcoin Dominance To Retest 53% Level: Altcoin Capital Rush? In an X post on November 1, renowned market expert with the username PlanD outlines an insightful analysis of the Bitcoin Dominance chart, which measures the percentage of Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Generally, a rise in Bitcoin Dominance indicates the premier cryptocurrency is outperforming other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) while a vice versa indicates the opposite, with extreme situations representing an altseason. According to PlanD, the Bitcoin Dominance is now forming a similar trend, which mirrors the altcoin rally in July 2025. Notably, the BTC.D sustained an uptrend of approximately 50 days before breaking down to significant levels, representing a heavy rotation of capital to other cryptocurrencies outside Bitcoin. The crypto analyst notes that the Bitcoin Dominance is at the peak level of this similar structure, with the technical groundwork now complete for another sharp breakdown. If the BTC.D follows the same pattern, PlanD predicts a potential fall to around 53%. With the present total crypto market cap around $3.71 trillion, this projection could represent a heavy influx of approximately $222.6 billion into altcoins over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Loading: Bullish Factors That Point To A Massive Surge The Altseason Signal To Watch Out For As previously noted, an altseason occurs when altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin over an extended period. While PlanD’s analysis suggests an impending altcoin rally, its duration remains uncertain. However, fellow analyst Ted Pillows has pointed to a key indicator that would confirm the start of an altseason. In a recent post on X, he explained that altseason is only validated once the total altcoin market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, reaches a new all-time high. At present, this benchmark stands at $1.03 trillion, whereas the current altcoin market cap (excluding stablecoins) is approximately $718.89 billion. Considering PlanD’s prediction, there is much potential to hit this required threshold in the short term. Meanwhile, recent macro developments are also encouraging for projected altcoin inflows. Notably, two Solana Spot ETFs marked their trading debut this week, marking the significant expansion of institutional interest beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. At press time, the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index stands at 31, suggesting that the market is still firmly in Bitcoin season, and altcoins require a major outperformance to shift the scale.

He also repeated a long-held forecast that Bitcoin could reach $1 million, and called silver the “biggest bargain,” saying it could triple in price. Institutional Flows And Regulatory Signals Strengthen Bitcoin Based on reports, Bitcoin has been drawing heavy interest from big investors. Institutional adoption and clearer rules have pushed fresh money into crypto ETFs, and BTC has hit new all-time highs as a result. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s price moved 0.70% to $110.780 while trading volume climbed 35% to $29 billion. Market watchers point to improvements in the Lightning Network and growing ETF inflows as factors helping Bitcoin trade more efficiently and attract larger holders. MASSIVE CRASH BEGININING: Millions will be wiped out. Protect yourself. Silver, gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum investors will protect you. Take care — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 1, 2025 Kiyosaki’s Calls Have Been Repeated Over Years Kiyosaki’s warnings are familiar. He predicted crash events in 2011, 2016, 2020 and early 2023, and those previous calls did not match the catastrophic timing he described. Critics say his calls often arrive early or overstate the harm. Reports have disclosed that this pattern has reduced his credibility among some analysts, even though many agree that debt levels, inflation pressures and tech-driven job shifts are real concerns. Why Some Investors Are Listening Investors who fear a downturn are shifting part of their portfolios. Many prefer assets they view as stores of value. Gold and Bitcoin are being named as likely destinations for capital if a market unwind accelerates. Kiyosaki argues that conventional savings and fiat holdings are unsafe, calling them “fake money,” and advises people to own precious metals and selected cryptocurrencies to protect purchasing power. Middle Markets Still Show Mixed Signals While institutional flows into crypto products have been reported as record-setting, other measures are less certain. Trading volumes have fallen at times even as prices climb, and some analysts warn that rapid inflows can be followed by volatile exits. Based on reports, exchanges and funds are monitoring liquidity and investor behavior closely. That monitoring is meant to prevent sudden stress in markets where leverage or thin order books can magnify moves. Silver, Gold And Crypto Remain Central To The Debate Kiyosaki’s strategy centers on moving wealth into physical and digital assets. He places a strong bet on silver, expects a large move into gold, and highlights Bitcoin and Ethereum as crypto choices. Whether that rotation happens on a wide scale will depend on investor appetite and how central banks respond to inflation and debt pressures in the months ahead.

Supporters see it as a bridge currency that could unify the financial world. Yet, despite this powerful vision, success depends not on hope but on measurable progress. Recent network data shows a sobering gap between belief and actual traction. Vibhu’s Candid Assessment A longtime engineer and analyst, Vibhu shared a detailed post on X, highlighting XRP’s real performance metrics. His argument is not anti-Ripple but pro-truth. He insists that the community must confront facts rather than rely on faith. Vibhu’s observations are based on data from XRPSCAN, a highly trusted source for XRP Ledger analytics. I want Ripple and XRP to succeed at an insane degree such that the entire industry moves forward. But the fact is that the community does not argue with facts, even though the data is readily available. And as a longtime engineer and truth seeker, that bothers me. It is totally… pic.twitter.com/2U6tOmG8sI — vibhu (@vibhu) November 1, 2025 XRPL’s User Activity Stagnation According to XRPSCAN, daily active accounts on the XRP Ledger hover around 25,000 . That figure has shown little to no improvement over the last three years. In contrast, Solana currently averages over 2.5 million daily active accounts, about 100 times higher than XRP’s. This gulf in user activity reveals how far XRP still needs to grow in adoption and engagement. Payments and Transaction Comparison XRP’s “successful payments” metric has grown roughly 50% year-over-year. However, total daily transactions, around 1.5 million per day, pale in comparison to Solana’s 100 million daily average. Both networks offer ultra-low transaction fees, yet Solana appears to attract more consistent, high-volume activity. That reality questions the long-held assumption that low fees alone can guarantee network growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Volume and Economic Activity Vibhu’s data also highlights that XRP’s monthly transfer volume sits around $50–60 billion. Meanwhile, Solana processed nearly $2 trillion in stablecoin transfers in October alone, according to verified Blockworks data. Even after removing suspected bot activity, the gap remains vast. This signals Solana’s growing role as a settlement layer for real-world digital value. Debunking the “Bot Theory” Some XRP supporters argue that bots influence Solana’s. Vibhu counters that claim using verified analytics that exclude wash trading. Given that both Solana and XRP have similar transaction costs, it is unlikely bots would target one chain over the other. Without evidence, this argument fails to explain the disparity in activity. The Takeaway for XRP Holders None of this means XRP cannot win. Ripple sustains its growth through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, leveraging its established resources. Yet, the reality is clear — current network traction remains mediocre when compared to competitors. Investors and builders should track data closely and demand transparency. A Call for Measured Optimism Vibhu’s analysis is not a dismissal of XRP’s future. It is a call for data-driven optimism. Belief should follow evidence, not precede it. If XRP adoption accelerates in payments, stablecoins, and on-chain finance, then its long-awaited breakout could finally begin. Until then, facts — not feelings — should guide the community’s conviction. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the proposal, the buybacks would be activated when the price of ETHFI falls below $3. At the time of writing, ETHFI is currently trading at $0.96. The community vote launched via Snapshot on Friday, November 1st and is progressing with 100% support. Voting will close on November 4, 2025. If approved, this will be Ether.fi's third buyback program. Previous buybacks were conducted for liquidity support under proposals #8 and #10. Related News: Expert Analyst Tom Lee's Fund Revealed Whether “Bitcoin and Altcoins” Have Peaked According to the proposal, “The Foundation’s goal is to gradually increase repurchase capacity in proportion to protocol revenues; specifically, while the ETHFI price remains below $3, it is to use surplus revenues to strengthen market confidence and reduce circulating supply.” This strategy aims to align the revenue performance of the Ether.fi ecosystem with the interests of token holders. All transactions will be transparently recorded on-chain, and results will be publicly available on the Dune Analytics dashboard. According to Coin data, the ETHFI token is trading at $0.9635, down 3.74% in the last 24 hours. The token's market capitalization is $543.56 million. *This is not investment advice.

The details were discussed during an interview aired this week, according to the broadcast. Jensen made it clear that the deal kept China accessible at a time when the White House demanded that critical chip manufacturing return to the United States. He said the White House pushed the company from the moment President Donald Trump took office for the second time. “When President Trump first took office, he wanted us to manufacture these critical technologies on shore. He wanted to re‑industrialize the United States,” Jensen said. He explained that Trump tied U.S. leadership in AI to physical control of the supply chain. “He wants to have energy growth. He wants to make sure that the United States is a leader in artificial intelligence.” The Trump–Xi agreement, Jensen said, prevented a full commercial cutoff with China while the U.S. began rebuilding advanced semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Nvidia begins full production of Blackwell chip in Arizona Jensen described AI as something much larger than a single product line. “AI is an industrial revolution, and this is the most important technology of our time, potentially the most important technology of all time,” he said. Jensen linked the technology to applications across healthcare, robotics, manufacturing, science, and commercial industries that rely on machine models and computing power. That is why, he said, Nvidia needed to ensure the capability to manufacture its newest AI chip inside the U.S. He said Trump wanted the manufacturing shift done “at the speed of light.” Jensen told him Nvidia would do it in nine months. Nvidia partnered with TSMC, Foxconn, Wistron, Amkor, and SPIL to build the production chain necessary in Arizona. “We’ve been able to manufacture now the most advanced AI chip in the world completely in the United States and Arizona,” Jensen said. He described how mechanical engineers, electricians, plumbers, and construction workers worked without pause to meet the deadline. “Nine months later, we’re now in volume production of the most advanced AI chip in the world.” Part of the production will supply U.S. military systems. The company confirmed the chip is intended for national defense applications, in addition to commercial use. Jensen said the cost of producing chips in the U.S. is higher than Taiwan, but that cost is expected to come down as manufacturing efficiency improves. He said the first plants always carry the heaviest expense during the transition. $5 trillion valuation and expansion across multiple sectors Last week, Nvidia reached a $5 trillion market valuation, closing at $207.04 per share with a market value of $5.03 trillion. Jensen said it took the company thirty years to build the technology base now driving AI investment. He described this moment as the beginning of a long infrastructure cycle as organizations build out AI computing capacity. During Nvidia’s GTC conference in Washington, the company announced a $1 billion investment in Nokia for a 2.9% stake, a partnership with the Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers, and new agreements across healthcare, transportation, and commercial enterprise operations. Those include Eli Lilly for drug research, Palantir for enterprise‑scale AI systems, and Uber for the development of a robo‑taxi fleet. Jensen also explained why national security was part of the push to move production to Arizona. “We can’t afford to have the critical manufacturing of things that are so important to national security being manufactured around the world and can’t be manufactured here.” He tied it to supply chain stability and long‑term employment in high‑skill jobs. He said production of chips and AI systems inside the U.S. will lead to “millions of jobs” over time. He said Trump’s three priorities guiding this policy are re‑industrialization, energy growth, and leadership in artificial intelligence, and that the Trump–Xi trade deal is what allowed Nvidia to continue operating in China while carrying out that policy inside the U.S. “These three initiatives are going to transform America’s position in the world completely,” said Jensen. “And so it’s such a great vision, and I’m all behind it. That is very optimistic.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|Nvidia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-02 19:19:30

53955055,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88411,1762112703,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,10 Tokens That Could Explode: Which One Is the Next 100x Crypto in Q4?,https://timestabloid.com/10-tokens-that-could-explode-which-one-is-the-next-100x/,"Crypto season feels like someone shook the hive and told every digital asset to wake up. Charts look louder, timelines look busier, and traders everywhere are giving that look that says, “Yeah, this might be the one.” With Q4 2025 taking shape, one theme stands clear. New cycles tend to crown new winners. Blue chips power the foundation, but fresh meme plays often carry the punch that breaks wallets into fireworks. At the heart of this charge sits La Culex , a mosquito-themed presale that seems determined to bite every narrative and draw attention the same way early Doge and SHIB once did. Serious investors are treating it like a meme with a plan rather than just a playful trope, and that sets it apart fast. But before breaking down why this buzzing little token has analysts scratching, here are nine more names that matter as November and Q4 roll into frame. 1. La Culex: The Mosquito Ready To Bite First and Count Profits Later When a mosquito buzzes, something is coming. And right now in presale territory, La Culex feels like the insect with the sharpest sting for anyone chasing the next 100x crypto in Q4 narrative. The La Culex presale has crossed into Stage 4, carrying a La Culex price of $0.00002458, with over 50 holders and 400 million tokens sold, proving that early believers are already stacking their swarm before the crowd catches the scent. Current raise? Over $8,000, and that tally keeps rising as the token aims for a listing target of $0.007. Early backers have already bagged 26.2 percent growth, and if that listing target hits, the projected ROI lands at 28378 percent. For perspective? A $5,000 entry today equals more than 203 million tokens and could see a projected payoff north of $1.42 million if price objectives hold. That is the kind of math that turns heads, not whispers. Stages shift every five days or when the milestone fills, so timing is its own strategy here. Miss SHIB? Miss PEPE? Miss DOGWIFHAT? The Culex presale might sting if missed. It already has that familiar replay energy circulating among meme coin sharps. It acts fast, it plays loud, and it is not asking permission to join the top table. This is why analysts label it the best crypto to buy in this presale window. 2. Dogecoin Dogecoin remains the veteran of meme culture. While many coins chase structure, DOGE already owns the crown for mainstream parody power. It still pushes key catalysts, from social media catalysts to sentimental trust among older crypto traders. Analysts point to Dogecoin’s transaction strength and persistent wallet expansions, suggesting it has plenty of life as long as meme DNA holds value. DOGE’s future in Q4 2025 looks sturdy, especially if large-cap inflows return and risk appetite strengthens. But new explosive upside requires fresh catalysts. That is why many investors pair DOGE exposure with a fresh bet like La Culex to chase the next 100x crypto in Q4 while holding a proven veteran. 3. Shiba Inu SHIB built the modern meme empire and set the blueprint. It showed that a joke can turn into a billion-dollar ecosystem and that community force can rewrite what a meme coin can be. As SHIB continues developing utility layers like Shibarium, it strengthens its staying power. Still, the explosive returns of early SHIB days cannot be repeated at current size. This is why traders watching SHIB today often turn toward fresh memes with runway. Enter La Culex as that buzzer bringing the next storyline for anyone chasing the next 100x crypto in Q4. 4. Pepe Pepe stamped summer runs and made absurdity profitable. It also proved that no mascot era is ever over and that markets always have room for weird brilliance backed by liquidity and velocity. While Pepe still carries volume in bursts, many early backers already cashed in, meaning its next run needs new energy, not nostalgia alone. Investors eyeing upside potential now look at presales like La Culex for that early-curve entry, especially given its structured phase mechanics and calculated supply drops. Many meme veterans now argue the Culex presale sits in the same psychological zone where Pepe first stirred before liftoff. 5. Official Trump Love or hate political meme coins, they bring movement. Official Trump thrives on social chatter and election-cycle interest. The token tracks sentiment shifts around global headlines and digital politic chatter. With election aftershocks still in the global spotlight through 2025, this token might ride cycles tied to narrative spikes. But political assets tend to fade fast after thematic peaks, which is why many risk-balanced traders prefer a meme token tied more to universal humor than political heat. The La Culex presale enters that lane perfectly, running pure meme energy instead of seasonal attention curves, which helps lock its case as the next 100x crypto in Q4 for those seeking longevity. 6. Bonk Bonk brought Solana back to life in late 2023 and showed what chain-native meme ignition can do. It turned Solana’s turnaround moment into a cultural one. Now, BONK enjoys lasting validation as the Solana emoji of meme trades. Yet Bonk also carries a huge market cap now. That makes it more stable but less explosive. Anyone wanting a shot at Bonk-like entry levels often scans earlier stages of new projects. La Culex price today still sits tiny compared to where established memes like BONK rest, feeding the FOMO loop for anyone targeting the next 100x crypto in Q4 return profile. 7. Floki Floki blends meme identity with utility ambitions, pairing Norse meme culture with ecosystem expansion. It built branding strength through marketing deals and community cohesion. It is now an established mid-cap, trading with credibility earned over multiple cycles. But like other giants, rally scale shrinks with size. Floki is a tank, not a rocket. Newer investors scanning for raw liftoff energy often position in emerging names like La Culex and then ride established names for safe mid-caps. This two-lane approach keeps portfolios balanced while keeping doors open for the next 100x crypto in Q4 prize-hunt. 8. Dogwifhat This token’s hat alone became part of digital culture. Dogwifhat followed simple meme purity, then blasted across screens. It remains one of the most beloved expressions of “meme first, everything else later.” But it is maturing into a known entity. Dogwifhat now sits at the point where big players track it rather than discover it. It turned into a benchmark. And when benchmarks stabilize, traders look for under-the-radar mascots with tiny supply levels like La Culex, where market cap still sits in pre-launch territory. This is what makes La Culex a standout candidate for the next 100x crypto in Q4 slot. 9. Pudgy Penguins Pudgy Penguins built an empire beyond meme charts, especially in collectibles and brand IP extension. Its community culture is strong, and its toy deals and media expansion make it unique in the meme category. Yet the brand-driven nature limits raw degen upside. It acts more like a Disney pipeline project now. Smart traders stack it for long-term value but turn to tokens like La Culex for more aggressive moves in cycles where meme mania revives. That mix keeps exposure wide while still chasing that next 100x crypto in Q4 story. 10. Brett Brett has become the friend-meme coin of choice. It is relaxed, funny, and credible within Degensphere call groups. Yet again, size maturity puts a cap on wildness. Brett feels like a “solid but predictable” choice, which is why many new meme hunters mix it with La Culex entry positions today. Because La Culex is fresher, smaller, and built for a cycle just starting, it sits perfectly aligned for the next 100x crypto in Q4 tag. Brett might cruise, but the mosquito wants to fly straight into candle charts like they owe it something. Final Bite: Why La Culex Leads This Pack All top meme tokens listed here have made their mark already. They built the world that allows a mosquito to even buzz this loud. But cycles reward the new, not the crowned. La Culex has the tiny cap, the structured presale, the token velocity and the cultural spark to rise. The La Culex presale carries meme chaos with strategy precision. And in a market where sentiment swings decide million-dollar nights, traders chase two traits: humor and heat. This mosquito has both. Which is why it runs first in analyst lists targeting the next 100x crypto in Q4 . For More Information: Website: Visit the Official CULEX Website Telegram: Join the CULEX Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow CULEX ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About the Next 100x Crypto in Q4 How does La Culex compare to past meme launch winners? La Culex follows the same “meme with math” formula that powered SHIB and FLOKI in early stages, with a tiny starting price, distribution mechanics, and growing holder count, making it a realistic contender for the next 100x crypto in Q4 if momentum continues. Why is early presale entry important? Presale entries allow access before demand surges. With stage pricing set to jump every five days, entering early keeps cost bases lower while riding upside. That is why many treat this mosquito as the next 100x crypto in Q4 with urgency. Can La Culex really hit the projected listing price? The target price of $0.007 is speculative but supported by early volume strength and community traction. If targets hit, it could position La Culex as the next 100x crypto in Q4 with upside aligning to breakout cycles. Summary Q4 2025 is shaping into the season of comeback charts and new meme champions. Legacy picks like DOGE, SHIB, and WIF remain core culture anchors, but new energy flows toward asymmetric opportunities. And right now, nothing buzzes louder than a mosquito preparing to sting the leaderboard. With momentum, meme power, and stage pricing scheduled to rise, La Culex stands ready for the next 100x crypto in Q4 spotlight while the rest of the pack watches.

53955766,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=850560,1762113600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53955766.jpeg,3 Best Ethereum Cryptos to Buy Now in November,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/3-best-ethereum-cryptos-to-buy-now-in-november/,"Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to lead in the smart contract race, creating a new wave of ERC-20 tokens that capture much of the investors’ attention. Among them, Shiba Inu keeps its place, using the impressive community of more than 1.5 million holders to stay relevant despite the turbulent markets. Its support around $0.00001000 has been resistant, and although short-term rallies face resistance at $0.00001121, SHIB’s long-term momentum remains appealing for speculative investors in search of growth. The other token is Pepe, which is showing strong accumulation with a rapidly growing holder base. According to analysts, the on-chain activity of PEPE and higher lows are bullish signals, making it a top pick for anyone looking for the next meme-driven breakout. However, the most compelling opportunity may lie in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035 during Phase 6 of its presale. MUTM’s dual-lending DeFi model combines Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending, providing real financial utility alongside the excitement of early-stage growth. Many analysts now view MUTM as the best crypto to watch within Ethereum’s ecosystem for November 2025, offering both upside potential and sustainable DeFi innovation for investors aiming to diversify beyond meme coins. This combination positions Mutuum Finance as one of the top cryptocurrencies leading the market momentum this year. Shiba Inu Price Analysis Shiba Inu (SHIB) is setting up for a possible breakout following several months of consolidation. A bullish pattern in price has formed, and momentum is building slowly. If support holds, then SHIB could be targeting the next resistance around 0.00001300. Traders will need to keep a very close eye on sentiment now, along with events that could lead to volatility, which may mark the next few hours as critical for confirmation of this upward move. Proper risk management remains key, but this setup currently suggests promising potential for investors keeping an eye on Ethereum-based meme coins. While SHIB is high in momentum, built on a grassroots-style community movement, many investors are equally looking toward emerging DeFi projects with early-stage growth potential and the likes of Mutuum Finance, which is gaining momentum quickly and attracting the attention of traders in pursuit of the next breakout altcoin. As one of the best crypto assets gaining exposure, it is increasingly being recognized within discussions of top cryptocurrencies to hold for 2025. Pepe Coin Demonstrates First Signs of Stabilization PEPE has been in a downtrend for a while, but the recent action shows that the token is finding stability close to its lower support zone. If this level can sustain and buying momentum returns, PEPE may bounce up toward 0.0000080–0.00001000, indicating a possible short-term recovery. Traders are closely watching as the market is positioning for a possible near recovery move. While PEPE’s stabilization attracts community interest, for investors looking to combine DeFi utility with early-stage growth, Mutuum Finance is increasingly seen as a more convincing alternative. This further reinforces why Mutuum Finance is considered the best crypto and remains part of the top cryptocurrencies in the upcoming bull cycle. A New Generation of DeFi MUTM is gradually but steadily turning out to be one of the most innovative and energetic cryptocurrency projects in the DeFi space. With its ongoing presale, it has already attracted over 17,660 investors and gathered more than $18.35 million, way above early expectations. Such a remarkable performance has made it a target for both investors and analysts, who eye it as a hot contender for short-term gains and long-term stability. The early adopters expect returns of almost 2x since the first round of the MUTM presale. Each presale round has swiftly sold out, indicating tremendous investor confidence and laying a sound base of early liquidity in advance of the mainnet launch. This supports the continuous demand because Mutuum Finance is not just a speculative opportunity but rather a next-generation DeFi protocol that has real-world utility and will be able to attain long-term growth. As such, it stands tall as the best crypto for investors seeking exposure to top cryptocurrencies before 2026. Redefining Borrowing: A Crystal Clear and Stable DeFi Model At the core of Mutuum Finance lies a novel lending system designed to bring predictability, stability, and fairness in DeFi. Borrowers can negotiate repayment fees upfront, while interest rates dynamically adjust according to market conditions. Although fixed-rate lending may at first be higher than variable rates, it offers critical protection from sudden spikes in rate and market volatility. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $18.35 million from over 17,660 investors, with Phase 6 already 85% sold out, a sure sign of very strong market confidence. With the token price standing at only $0.035, early adopters have a rare opportunity to secure exposure ahead of the mainnet launch. Combining groundbreaking dual-lending DeFi utility with real-world financial mechanisms, MUTM will offer growth potential with sustainable long-term value. Investors looking to diversify from meme coins like SHIB and PEPE should not wait any longer. Participate and position for the next wave of Ethereum-based DeFi growth through the best crypto in 2025, as Mutuum Finance leads the top cryptocurrencies shaping the decentralized future.

Rather than focusing on who holds a token, the conversation is increasingly about what it connects. That perspective frames XRP not simply as a speculative asset , but as a piece of digital infrastructure capable of linking global value flows. According to Brad Garlinghouse, there’s a “fundamental difference between speculation and infrastructure” — a distinction that underscores the evolving role of crypto-assets in the real world. Clarifying the role of XRP versus Ripple “People say things like, ‘XRP has a CEO.’ I’m like, who is it?” Garlinghouse asked during remarks reported by Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist. He continued: “Ripple has a CEO — that’s me. There are scores, if not a hundred other CEOs, building around the XRP ecosystem.” The message is clear: while Ripple uses XRP in its product stack, it does not own or govern it in isolation. Brad Garlinghouse gets it. $XRP isn’t about who holds it, it’s about what it connects. In the digital financial system, value will reflect the magnitude of global value it moves. That’s the difference between speculation and infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/DowkMMiUJk — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 2, 2025 Open-source governance and the XRPL The governance model underlying the XRP Ledger (XRPL) reinforces that separation. Protocol amendments only activate once a supermajority of participants endorse them. Garlinghouse cited this threshold when he stated: “There have been amendments passed to the XRP open source technology that we opposed — and they still passed. That’s okay. That’s open source technology.” In other words, Ripple’s preferences don’t dictate ledger evolution; the community does. That dynamic underpins the argument that XRP functions as infrastructure, not a corporate-controlled asset. Why connection matters more than ownership If the long-term value of crypto is tied to what it enables, then XRP’s architecture sets it apart. Garlinghouse first noted this when emphasizing utility over control: “We use XRP in our product stack, but there are scores of other companies building in and around the XRP ecosystem.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As Aljarrah highlighted in his post, the narrative shifts from “who holds it” to “what it connects.” In global finance, value is realized through volume, throughput, and reach — not simply token scarcity or distribution. Implications for investors and builders For investors, this recalibration implies a different lens: assess not just token supply or short-term momentum, but the network’s ability to facilitate cross-border value transfer, interoperability, and institutional adoption. For developers and institutions, the focus shifts to creating services that integrate with XRPL’s infrastructure and enhance liquidity, rather than solely pursuing token accumulation. Final thoughts Versan Aljarrah’s coverage of Garlinghouse’s remarks serves as a timely reminder that in the world of digital assets, infrastructure wins often look subtle. The story of XRP is less about ownership and more about connectivity — about a protocol working as the backbone of global value exchange. In that context, understanding “what it connects” becomes far more important than “whose token it is.” Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
