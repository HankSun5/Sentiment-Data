TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites.

Let’s answer them and more in our Toncoin price prediction.

Over the last 30 days, it rose by 12.59%. The TON price steadily declined after reaching the local high of $6 in early December 2024. In March 2025, it dropped beneath the $2.5 mark for the first time in over a year. It recovered last month and reached a high of $3.50. This month, it dropped to $3.0. Looking at its DeFi ecosystem, TON’s Total Value Locked (TVL) rose by 2.36% in the last 24 hours to $157M. TON/USD 1-day chart price analysis TONUSD chart by TradingView Toncoin remained bullish from last week with rising volatility.

Our chart analysis indicates a bullish sentiment confirmed by positive market momentum. The coin now faces resistance at $3.40. With rising volatility, a sharp reversal is probable. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, as well as TonBit’s discovery and patching of a TON Virtual Machine bug on July 21 (TonBit), preventing potential network crashes and DApp disruptions. This maintained trust in Telegram’s ecosystem. Recent news Telegram’s deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk’s AI company integrate into Telegram, is a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov. While Durov confirmed that the deal is yet to be signed, the Telegram founder said there is an “agreement in principle.” Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031.

TON historic price sentiment Ton price by CoinGecko Ton network launched in 2018 as the Telegram Open Network (TON) but was later renamed “The Open Network” and taken over by the TON Foundation. In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event. On September 20, 2021, TON registered its all-time low price at $0.3906. Its first significant break came in November 2021. In days, the coin slid from $0.8 to $4.5. It corrected in 2022, reaching a low of $0.9. In 2023, it ranged between $1.1 and $2.5. In 2024, it registered another bull run, rising from $2.11 to its all-time high of $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024. It corrected later and traded at the $5.2 mark in October and $4.98 in November when it started recovering. The recovery saw the coin rise above $6.5 in December. It then crossed into 2025, trading at $5.5. From there, it assumed a bear run as it fell below $3.8 in February and $3.0 in May. It crossed into June, trading at $3.20. In July, it fell below $3.20.",Crypto Price Predictions|Toncoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TON|BTC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-21 23:30:00

Investors are increasingly revisiting questions about what size of XRP holdings could support long-term financial independence, particularly as speculation continues about the token’s future valuation. The conversation, primarily fueled by retail investors within the XRP Army, centers around the belief that XRP could see exponential growth in the coming years. For many, even a small number of tokens could potentially yield significant wealth if bullish projections are realized. Community Perspectives on Retirement Thresholds A recent discussion led by a known figure in the XRP community, Jeremiah, asked members to share their thoughts on the number of tokens they believe would be sufficient for retirement. The responses highlighted a wide range of perspectives, with opinions varying from conservative estimates to highly ambitious predictions. How much XRP do you think is needed to retire comfortably? I am curious to see what you think. #XRP pic.twitter.com/EF1tu9s37Y — GenXRP (@JeremiahB45) July 20, 2025 Some users suggested that owning 10,000 XRP could provide a path to financial security, implying expectations that the token could rise to values exceeding $100. Others proposed that 60,000 XRP would be a safer benchmark, though Jeremiah challenged this, asserting that a smaller quantity might be sufficient due to future market dynamics. Another user took an even more optimistic position, arguing that as little as 1,000 XRP could eventually be enough to retire. Jeremiah reiterated this sentiment, citing anticipated reductions in available supply over the next five years as a potential driver of significant price increases. High-Value Projections Stir Debate Perhaps the most striking claim came from a community member named Marc, who proposed that just 100 XRP could be sufficient for a comfortable retirement. Jeremiah supported this assertion, reinforcing a highly optimistic outlook. For this scenario to materialize, XRP would need to exceed $10,000 per token, an increase of over 285,000% from its current price. Although these projections are met with skepticism even within the XRP community, some well-known figures have shared similar views. For instance, crypto entrepreneur Jake Claver has suggested that XRP could reach $10,000 by 2027. Nonetheless, such projections are controversial and far from consensus. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors That Influence Value While much of the discussion centers on specific amounts of XRP, some investors have emphasized that the real determining factors lie elsewhere. Adoption rates, regulatory clarity, and technological developments are all seen as critical components in shaping the token’s long-term value. O ne user compared the current situation to the evolution of Bitcoin, noting that what once seemed like a sufficient amount for retirement has changed over time as the asset matured. These perspectives reflect a broader understanding that price predictions must be grounded in market fundamentals, rather than speculation alone. Although there is no clear consensus on the exact amount of XRP needed to achieve financial independence, confidence in the token’s long-term potential remains high among supporters. Community projections range widely, from XRP reaching $100 to as much as $10,000, with some even suggesting that a $500 price point may eventually be considered cheap. In the absence of certainty, investors are making decisions based on their individual risk tolerance and faith in XRP’s future value.

Strong ETF momentum, enterprise integrations, and record transaction volume are positioning AVAX ahead of the curve, especially as capital begins rotating from legacy altcoins to scalable, institutionally compliant ecosystems. But while Avalanche garners analyst nods, the real whispers—the alpha group calls, Telegram tags, and early-stage radar lists—are fixated on one name: MAGACOIN FINANCE . MAGA (MAGACOIN FINANCE): The Cultural Breakout with Strategic Timing While Avalanche and XRP fight for institutional favor, a different kind of breakout is quietly taking shape beneath the headlines. Early spots in MAGACOIN FINANCE are filling up fast as presale momentum surges ahead of the official launch. Analysts, presale dashboards, and smart money trackers are all converging on one point: this is not just another token drop. It’s an ideological asset structured for scale, built around full decentralization, no VC interference, and fixed-supply scarcity. Recent upgrades—like live cross-wallet compatibility with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet—have accelerated adoption. Telegram activity is doubling weekly, and verified audit reports from HashEx and CertiK are drawing in a wave of credibility-focused investors. The key? Timing. As the ETF money floods into Bitcoin and Ethereum, and smart money rotates into infrastructure like AVAX, MAGACOIN is becoming the narrative play of choice for retail and alpha groups. This is where culture meets conviction—where early positioning isn’t optional, it’s everything. And that window? It’s closing fast. Premium token allocations, governance rights, and staking multipliers are only available during the presale stage. After listing, the game changes. Avalanche (AVAX): Institutional Infrastructure Meets Scalable Utility Avalanche is fast proving itself as more than just a high-speed Layer 1. The network just posted a record 20 million daily transactions on July 15, and major firms are responding. Crypto Finance, a subsidiary of Deutsche Börse, added AVAX to its regulated infrastructure stack this month, enabling European banks and brokers to offer secure trading and custody. This follows news that Grayscale’s AVAX ETF proposal is under review by the SEC, with a decision expected in Q3. Analysts are increasingly confident the ETF will be approved, especially as Avalanche builds out its institutional footprint with strategic partners like Lynq for enterprise payments. Price-wise, AVAX is up 15% this month, with short-term targets between $24–$26. Long-range projections hit the $50 mark by end-of-year, assuming ETF approval and continued ecosystem growth. Ripple (XRP): Big News, But Heavier Baggage Ripple isn’t staying quiet. XRP recently hit an all-time high above $3.60, fueled by speculation surrounding U.S. regulatory clarity, including the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts aimed at formalizing stablecoin and digital asset legislation. The ongoing SEC lawsuit appeal decision, scheduled around July 17, remains a wild card. If dropped, it could send XRP even higher. But even with favorable outcomes, many institutional desks remain hesitant due to the token’s ongoing legal baggage and centralized structure. Even with bullish targets between $10 and $21, analysts admit XRP’s growth is likely slower and more compliance-bound than that of Avalanche or newer decentralized tokens entering the scene. Conclusion Avalanche is building institutional bridges and crushing transaction records—clear signs of a protocol ready for next-cycle dominance. Ripple continues to lean on legislation and legacy name recognition, but its runway feels limited compared to leaner, faster competitors MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t waiting for permission. It’s building community, infrastructure, and narrative weight at the ground level. And for those with the foresight to move before the crowd, it may just be the most asymmetric opportunity of the 2025 cycle.

The spike comes on the heels of a powerful price rally, with possible signs that large holders, also called whales, may be playing a key role in driving the cryptocurrency’s next leg. XRP Transactions Hit Major Highs The XRP network is showing renewed strength and growth as transaction volumes have skyrocketed to over $1.07 billion. This spike follows a massive 67% rally in the digital asset’s price, which climbed above $3.5 earlier this month after a long period of consolidation. This impressive price surge marks one of the most aggressive upward moves in recent months. Related Reading: Pundit Warns XRP Investors To Not Make This Grave Mistake This Cycle The resurgence in both network activity and price signals is growing market momentum and possibly a shift in sentiment among investors and traders. Notably, XRPScan, a platform that records data from the XRP Ledger, revealed that the large-scale transfer volume was recorded on July 18, representing the cryptocurrency’s largest single-day figure in over a month. What’s particularly notable about this recent volume surge is that it does not appear driven by speculative churn alone. The elevated flow of funds between accounts and the increase in user addresses suggest a deeper level of network usage. Data from XRPScan shows that XRP payment volume from one account to another rose to 1.72 billion on July 18. Additionally, the number of successful transactions executed around the same time totalled over 2.08 million. New active accounts have also climbed significantly, with July 18 recording the highest daily count over the last month at 10,279. With blockchain metrics flashing green and XRP’s price reclaiming bullish momentum, the surge in daily transfer volume signals a fresh wave of bullish confidence among holders. Typically, such synchronised growth may point to deliberate accumulation or distribution by whales, who often move large sums during pivotal market shifts. Whales Go Long On XRP Ahead Of Potential Surge New reports from analysts indicate that XRP whale activity is back in full swing, with specific holders going long just days after the cryptocurrency network surged past $1 billion in transfer volume. Multiple long positions totalling over $3.8 million have been opened at a price point near $3.44, raising speculation that deep-pocketed investors may be acting on insider-level confidence. KingXRP, an analyst on X social media, revealed that a whale recently entered a $1.52 million long on XRP, just as buzz grows around the impending RealFi integration that could enable the XRP Ledger to unlock a massive $650 trillion market. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Just Hit A Fresh ATH Above $10 Billion, Will Price Follow Next? Adding fuel to the hype, Radar, another market expert, reported that two additional whale-sized positions, worth $1.02 million and $1.31 million, were opened within the same price range. This move signals a clear shift in whale sentiment, suggesting increased confidence in XRP’s breakout potential.

The offer means that the sons of the pro-tariff commerce secretary, Kyle and Brandon, have made a way for investors to bet that President Donald Trump’s signature tariffs will be struck down in court. Lutnick has been one of the most vocal supporters of the president’s tariff policies. According to him, tariffs can potentially raise “hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars” in revenue for the US. His reason is that the need for Americans making under $150,000 to pay taxes will eventually be eliminated. Here’s the tariff buy deal According to the court, if Trump’s tariffs are permanently blocked, businesses that began paying “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2 could be refunded, with interest. Now, Cantor Fitzgerald is jumping at this opportunity. Here is the deal. According to reports, a representative from Cantor said the firm is willing to trade tariff refund rights for 20% to 30% of what companies have paid in duties. The representative wrote, “So for a company that paid $10 million, they could expect to receive $2-$3 million in a trade We have the capacity to trade up to several hundred million of these presently and can likely upsize that in the future to meet potential demand.” Some companies are sold Some companies are sold. It is too suspicious that the 20-year-old made the decision by themselves. There are arguments that most companies raised prices to offset the cost of tariffs; therefore, it is the consumers who were affected most. Also, because of an uncertain timeline and mounting financial pressures, some companies may decide it’s wiser to accept the offer. In addition, others don’t want to deal with the court directly. Ryan Petersen, CEO of the logistics technology company Flexport, said, “When you file those things today, it takes six to 12 months to get your money back once approved, it’s a physical check that arrives in the mail […] I think it may be attractive for some people.” Experts say the deals are used by financial firms seeking to profit from potential legal settlements. Many lawsuits can take years to resolve, and the structure can allow individuals and companies to get money upfront or have their lawyer fees covered. According to US Customs and Border Protection data, billions of dollars have been collected under Trump’s new tariff policies. Experts estimate nearly $14 billion could be refunded if the ruling is upheld on appeal. According to reports, Cantor has already made a major deal. “We’ve already put a trade through representing about ~$10 million of IEEPA Rights and anticipate that number will balloon in the coming weeks,” the Cantor representative claimed. At 20-30 cents on the dollar their clients are pricing in better than 3:1 odds of an overturn. About 3x the current odds on your polymarket. pic.twitter.com/KsF9wb2uMX — Dave Rekuc (@DaveRekuc) July 21, 2025 On the other hand, Polymarket thinks that Trump will not need to refund the tariffs. Only 11% of the bettors think that Trump will do the refund. Lutnick says he is not involved Kristen Eichamer, press secretary for the Department of Commerce, said that Lutnick is not aware of the decision. She said that Lutnick has no insight or strategic control over Cantor Fitzgerald. She added, “He has fully complied with the terms of his ethics agreement with respect to divesture and recusals and will continue to do so.” However, according to Tim Meyer, a professor of international business law at Duke University School of Law, the bank’s decision has revealed what those with connections to the administration think about the merits of the tariffs.

Altcoins Join Ethereum’s Rally In the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ CoinShares revealed that Ethereum has been on a strong run. Inflows from the past 13 weeks now account for 23% of its total assets under management. This year alone, it has pulled in $6.2 billion and has already topped the full-year inflows seen in 2024. This comes as total assets under management hit a record $220 billion, while global weekly trading turnover in ETPs also reached a record $39.2 billion. Bitcoin attracted $2.2 billion in inflows this week, down from last week’s $2.7 billion. ETP trading volumes accounted for 55% of its exchange activity. Meanwhile, Solana led altcoin inflows with $39 million, followed by XRP at $36 million and Sui at $9.3 million. During the same period, Chainlink and Cardano recorded smaller inflows of $0.9 million and $0.3 million. Multi-asset products were the only cohort to have recorded outflows of $16.4 million over the past week. With altcoins pulling notable inflows, the data indicates growing investor appetite for assets beyond Bitcoin. In fact, QCP Capital noted that Bitcoin dominance slipped from 64% to 60% over the past week, while, at the same time, Ethereum’s market share rose from 9.7% to 11.6%. If this trend continues, QCP expects the next phase of altcoin season could already be underway. Regional Crypto Flows Flows were largely driven by the US, which attracted $4.37 billion during the week. Switzerland followed with $47.3 million, while Australia and Hong Kong recorded $17.3 million and $14.1 million, respectively. Canada also saw modest inflows of $3 million. Brazil and Sweden, on the other hand, posted outflows of $28.1 million and $21 million. Germany also saw $15.5 million in weekly outflows.

The spotlight, for a while, seemed to be solely on Bitcoin’s incredible journey to new all-time highs. However, a recent and truly astounding development has emerged from the derivatives market: altcoin trading on Binance Futures has reached unprecedented levels, signaling a dramatic resurgence of interest beyond the king of crypto. This isn’t just a minor blip; we’re talking about a daily volume exceeding a staggering $100 billion. What does this massive influx mean for the market, and why are retail investors suddenly flocking back to altcoins with such fervor? What’s Driving the Explosive Altcoin Trading Surge on Binance Futures? The recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Maartunn brought to light an incredible statistic: daily altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures soared to an astounding $100.7 billion. This figure represents the highest volume recorded since February 3rd, marking a significant rebound after a prolonged period of relatively quiet activity. This surge didn’t happen in isolation; it followed closely on the heels of Bitcoin achieving a new all-time high, creating a ripple effect across the broader crypto landscape. While Bitcoin’s trading activity has remained robust, its stability pales in comparison to the dynamic shift seen in altcoins. Maartunn’s data indicates that altcoin trading now commands a dominant share of 71% of the total futures activity on Binance. This overwhelming majority suggests a profound change in market sentiment and participation. The prevailing theory, put forth by Maartunn himself, is that this shift is a clear reflection of renewed interest from retail investors who are confidently re-entering the market, eager to explore opportunities beyond Bitcoin. To put this into perspective, consider the typical market cycle. Often, Bitcoin leads the charge, breaking new ground and drawing institutional and large-scale investor attention. Once Bitcoin stabilizes or enters a consolidation phase, capital tends to flow into altcoins, a phenomenon often referred to as “altcoin season.” The current surge in altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures strongly suggests we might be entering, or are already deep within, such a phase, driven by the collective enthusiasm of individual traders looking for higher potential returns. How Does This Altcoin Trading Volume Compare, and Why Does It Matter? Understanding the sheer scale of $100.7 billion in daily altcoin trading volume requires context. It’s not just a big number; it signifies robust liquidity, increased price discovery, and heightened market participation. For traders, higher volume often means tighter spreads, easier execution of large orders, and more reliable price movements. For the market as a whole, it indicates health and growing adoption. Let’s look at a simplified comparison of volume distribution on Binance Futures: Asset Category Approximate Share of Futures Volume Implied Daily Volume (Based on $100.7B Altcoin Volume) Altcoins 71% $100.7 billion Bitcoin 29% ~$41.1 billion (approx. calculated from 100.7 / 0.71 * 0.29) Total Futures Volume 100% ~$141.8 billion This table clearly illustrates the dominance of altcoin trading in the current futures market landscape on Binance. The surge in altcoin volume, rather than just Bitcoin, suggests that traders are actively seeking higher beta assets – those that tend to move more dramatically than Bitcoin – in pursuit of amplified returns. This dynamic is a hallmark of a maturing bull market, where confidence in the overall crypto ecosystem encourages exploration into more volatile, yet potentially rewarding, assets. Navigating the Opportunities in Altcoin Trading: What Should You Consider? For many, the allure of altcoin trading lies in its potential for significant gains. While Bitcoin’s growth might be more steady, altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps or strong technological developments, can experience parabolic price movements. This creates exciting opportunities for traders who are willing to research and take calculated risks. Here are some key opportunities and considerations: Diversification: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, the altcoin market offers a vast array of projects, each with unique use cases and technological innovations. This allows investors to diversify their portfolios and potentially tap into different growth narratives, such as DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, or Layer 2 solutions. Higher Volatility, Higher Potential Returns: The very nature of altcoins means they can be more volatile than Bitcoin. While this carries increased risk, it also presents opportunities for quick profits if one can accurately predict market movements. Early Adoption of Promising Projects: Engaging in altcoin trading can mean getting in early on projects that could become the next big thing. Identifying undervalued gems before they gain mainstream attention can lead to substantial returns. However, successful participation requires more than just chasing pumps. It demands diligent research, understanding market trends, and a disciplined approach to risk management. Looking at projects with strong fundamentals, active development teams, clear roadmaps, and genuine utility can provide a more sustainable approach to navigating the altcoin space. Are There Risks to This Altcoin Trading Boom, Especially for Retail Investors? While the surge in altcoin trading volume presents exciting opportunities, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks, especially for retail investors who might be newer to the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. The same volatility that offers high reward potential also carries significant downside risk. Here are some challenges to be aware of: Extreme Price Volatility: Altcoins, particularly those with lower liquidity, can experience rapid and drastic price swings. What goes up quickly can come down even faster, leading to substantial losses if not managed properly. “Pump and Dump” Schemes: The influx of retail interest can unfortunately attract malicious actors who attempt to artificially inflate an altcoin’s price (pump) only to sell off their holdings at the peak, leaving late buyers with heavy losses (dump). Information Asymmetry: Retail investors often lack the sophisticated tools and deep market insights available to institutional players, making them more susceptible to misinformation or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Liquidity Issues: While the overall altcoin volume is high, individual altcoins, especially newer or smaller ones, might still suffer from low liquidity, making it difficult to enter or exit positions without significantly impacting the price. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for altcoins remains evolving in many jurisdictions, which can introduce unforeseen risks or impact the long-term viability of certain projects. To mitigate these risks, it’s paramount for retail investors to exercise caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and never invest more than they can afford to lose. Employing stop-loss orders, diversifying investments, and avoiding emotional decisions are critical practices for safer altcoin trading . The Pivotal Role of Binance Futures in Facilitating Altcoin Trading Binance Futures has cemented its position as a leading platform for cryptocurrency derivatives, and its role in facilitating this massive surge in altcoin trading cannot be overstated. The platform offers a wide array of altcoin perpetual contracts, allowing traders to speculate on price movements with leverage, without owning the underlying asset. This accessibility, combined with Binance’s extensive liquidity and user-friendly interface, makes it a preferred choice for millions of traders worldwide. The ability to use leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses, which is a key attraction for retail investors looking to maximize their exposure with relatively smaller capital. While powerful, leverage also significantly increases risk, underscoring the need for careful risk management strategies. Binance’s robust infrastructure and continuous introduction of new altcoin trading pairs further contribute to its dominance in this segment, acting as a major catalyst for the current volume boom. What Does This Mean for the Future of Altcoin Trading and the Crypto Market? The resurgence in altcoin trading volume, particularly driven by retail investors, paints an interesting picture for the future of the crypto market. It suggests a broadening of market participation beyond Bitcoin, indicating a growing comfort and understanding among the general public regarding the diverse opportunities within the crypto ecosystem. This increased engagement can lead to more innovation, better project development, and a more robust overall market. If this trend continues, we could see a sustained period of growth for various altcoin sectors. However, it also means that market participants, especially new entrants, must remain vigilant. Education and responsible trading practices will be more critical than ever to navigate the opportunities and challenges that come with such high-volume, retail-driven movements. The market is dynamic, and staying informed about both the potential rewards and inherent risks is key to long-term success in altcoin trading . In conclusion, the recent surge in altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures to over $100 billion daily is a clear signal of renewed retail investor enthusiasm and a significant shift in market dynamics. This unprecedented activity, highlighted by CryptoQuant’s analysis, underscores the growing importance of altcoins in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. While it presents exciting opportunities for substantial gains and diversification, it also comes with inherent risks such as extreme volatility and the potential for market manipulation. For both seasoned traders and new entrants, understanding these dynamics, conducting thorough research, and practicing disciplined risk management are paramount to navigating this exhilarating period successfully. The altcoin market is alive and booming, offering a vibrant, albeit challenging, frontier for those looking to participate in the next wave of crypto innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is altcoin trading? A1: Altcoin trading refers to the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC). The term “altcoin” is a portmanteau of “alternative coin,” encompassing thousands of different digital assets, each with its own technology, use case, and community. This can include major coins like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), as well as smaller, newer projects. Q2: Why is altcoin volume surging on Binance Futures? A2: The surge is attributed to several factors, primarily renewed interest from retail investors. Following Bitcoin’s new all-time high, capital often flows into altcoins as traders seek higher potential returns. Binance Futures, being a leading derivatives platform, offers leverage and a wide range of altcoin contracts, making it an attractive venue for this increased trading activity. Q3: What are the main risks associated with altcoin trading? A3: Key risks include extreme price volatility, which can lead to rapid and significant losses. Altcoins are also more susceptible to “pump and dump” schemes and liquidity issues. Furthermore, the evolving regulatory environment and the inherent speculative nature of many altcoin projects add layers of uncertainty. It’s crucial to understand these risks before engaging in altcoin trading . Q4: How can retail investors participate safely in altcoin trading? A4: To participate safely, retail investors should prioritize thorough research into projects, understand their own risk tolerance, and never invest more than they can afford to lose. Employing risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders, diversifying portfolios, and avoiding emotional trading decisions are vital. Staying informed about market trends and security best practices is also essential. Q5: What is Binance Futures? A5: Binance Futures is the derivatives trading platform offered by Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It allows users to trade cryptocurrency futures contracts, including perpetual contracts, on various digital assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Traders can use leverage to amplify their positions, speculating on price movements without directly owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Q6: Does this altcoin trading surge mean an “altcoin season” is here? A6: While the significant increase in altcoin trading volume and dominance over Bitcoin volume on futures platforms strongly suggests a period favorable to altcoins, often referred to as “altcoin season,” it’s not a guaranteed outcome. It indicates a strong likelihood of continued interest and potential for altcoin growth, but market dynamics can change rapidly. Traders should remain vigilant and adapt their strategies accordingly.

Rather, we want to remain technologically open.” The policy, still under internal discussion at the EU level , would require firms like Sixt SE and Europcar Mobility Group to buy only electric vehicles from the start of the next decade, part of a wider effort to decarbonize transport, one of Europe’s highest-polluting sectors. Brussels’ blueprint gets backlash from Berlin Underpinning the plan is the belief that targeting corporate and rental car fleets offers a fast-track route to cutting emissions: rental companies are among the largest buyers of new vehicles in Europe, and once those cars are resold into used markets, they could significantly boost EV adoption among consumers. But Merz’s pushback is part of a growing resistance from national capitals wary of overreach from Brussels. The German leader, already locked in budget fights with the EU, has made clear that Berlin won’t rubber-stamp climate mandates that he says pile unrealistic expectations on businesses and citizens. The European Commission has not yet released formal legislative text, but early drafts shared with national delegations indicate a strong push to make fleet electrification mandatory by 2030, with few exceptions. Europe’s green unity under financial pressure Automakers, too, are watching the debate closely. For companies still heavily reliant on combustion-engine models for revenue, the timeline could force difficult choices about production lines and supply chain contracts. Germany , in particular, has long argued for a more flexible approach to mobility decarbonization. While it supports reducing emissions, Berlin has consistently championed technological neutrality, pushing to keep options like synthetic fuels and hydrogen on the table. The fleet electrification plan would go beyond the EU’s goal of banning the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. While that policy has already sparked debate, this latest move ups the stakes by shifting the timeline forward and putting the burden on businesses first. According to a Brussels lawmaker, the proposal could affect 60% of the new car business. Supporters within the European Commission argue that time is of the essence. After a summer of record temperatures and intensifying pressure from COP29 commitments, Brussels sees transport emissions as one of the few remaining areas where aggressive policy can deliver fast climate wins.

This was reported by CryptoSlate, citing Deddy Lavid, CEO of Cyvers. Lavid noted that the attackers acted according to a scheme very similar to previous operations conducted by DPRK (North Korean) hackers. One of the distinctive features of their tactics is the use of the cryptomixer Tornado Cash and cross-chain bridges to conceal the flow of funds. On July 19, CoinDCX reported the compromise of an internal account used to provide liquidity on a third-party platform. Lavid speculated that the attackers gained access to the backend via open API keys, improper system settings, or vulnerabilities in account permissions. Once inside, they used legitimate account privileges to transfer assets from Solana to Ethereum, subsequently laundering the funds through Tornado Cash. According to Lavid, the sophistication of the attack and in-depth knowledge of liquidity mechanisms on centralized exchanges indicate that highly experienced and well-organized cybercriminals were involved. CoinDCX co-founder Sumit Gupta confirmed that users’ assets were not affected by the hack, and the company has already covered all losses from its own funds. The exchange has announced a bounty program, offering a reward of 25% for any recovered amounts. The team seeks assistance not only in tracing the assets, but also in identifying those responsible for the attack. ”More than recovering the stolen funds, what is important for us is to identify and catch the attackers, because such things shouldn’t happen again, not with us, not with anyone in the industry,” Gupta emphasized.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-21 23:58:28

The request was made in a joint letter sent to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), warning that approving such applications could significantly alter longstanding regulatory practices. Banking Industry Raises Concerns Over Crypto Applications The letter, signed by a coalition led by the American Bankers Association, argues that the OCC should not move forward with evaluating the applications until key legal and policy issues are resolved. According to the signatories, the business models presented by the crypto firms are vague and lack the transparency needed for proper regulatory analysis or public review. The American Bankers Association (ABA) and several banking and credit union groups have sent a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), asking it to delay the approval of national bank license applications from crypto firms like Circle and Ripple, citing… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 21, 2025 A key concern involves whether the companies meet the criteria for obtaining national trust bank charters. Traditionally, this designation is reserved for institutions that engage in fiduciary services. The banking groups argue that core services offered by firms like Circle and Ripple, particularly crypto custody, do not satisfy these fiduciary requirements. They caution that moving ahead without full public consultation could result in regulatory inconsistency, and potentially allow firms with limited capital obligations to bypass decades-old financial oversight structures. Implications of a National Charter for Crypto Firms If granted, a national bank charter would allow crypto companies to operate across the United States under a single federal license, avoiding the need to apply for separate approvals in each state. While this would streamline operations for the applicants, it has raised concerns within the traditional financial sector. Critics argue that such a shift could create unequal standards, where crypto companies operate with reduced regulatory burdens compared to traditional banks. They also warn that allowing entry through trust charters could weaken overall financial safeguards and introduce new risks into the banking system. Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long responded to the pushback on social media, noting that the reaction highlights regulatory imbalances. She suggested that if national trust charters offer lighter oversight, traditional banks might consider switching to those models to cut compliance costs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crypto Industry’s Regulatory Strategy in Transition The dispute reflects a broader trend in which digital asset companies are increasingly pursuing federal banking licenses to enhance credibility, expand services, and streamline compliance with evolving regulations. Firms like Circle, Ripple, and Fidelity are seeking to position themselves as key players in regulated financial markets. Legal analyst Logan Payne noted that new legislation , such as the GENIUS Act , which introduced a specialized license for stablecoin issuers, may be unintentionally encouraging companies to seek more comprehensive banking charters to maintain operational flexibility. Alexander Grieve, head of government affairs at crypto investment firm Paradigm, commented on the rare unity among traditional financial institutions. He stated, “Banks and credit unions rarely agree on anything. But they seem to agree that they’re finally about to have some competition from crypto.” The OCC’s decision on whether to grant federal charters to crypto firms like Ripple and Circle carries significant regulatory and competitive implications. As traditional financial institutions push back against what they see as a disruptive shift in oversight standards, the outcome will likely shape how digital asset companies engage with the U.S. banking system in the years ahead.

With the SEC and Ripple nearing full resolution—following a reduced $50 million cash penalty and the expected withdrawal of appeals—market sentiment is flipping fast. Analysts are now setting sights on a $7 target for XRP, spurred by renewed regulatory clarity, growing institutional demand, and the looming possibility of a spot ETF approval in the U.S. For many, this isn’t just a bounce—it’s a reentry into the top-tier altcoin conversation. But beneath the headlines and price charts, something deeper is happening: conviction is rotating. While XRP regains its position among legacy plays, traders and alpha groups are now tracking a different kind of momentum—one built on narrative power, cultural clarity, and tokenomic strength.That coin? MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next High-Conviction Wave As XRP rallies on regulation, the next true breakout narrative is quietly building in MAGACOIN FINANCE . Alpha groups are increasingly flagging it for one reason: 40x upside potential in this cycle based on modeled trajectories, fixed-supply economics, and grassroots velocity. MAGACOIN isn’t trying to mimic XRP’s legacy—it’s rewriting the narrative for what a political, decentralized, and frictionless token model can achieve in the current market. With a capped 170B supply, zero-tax structure, and audit verification from CertiK and HashEx, it’s designed to scale without central control. Telegram groups are expanding daily. Wallet integrations with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet are already live. And while big names fight for ETF headlines, smart money is quietly accumulating what many believe could become the breakout altcoin of 2025. The key isn’t just hype—it’s timing. Presale access is still open, but narrowing fast. Early adopters get premium allocations, staking multipliers, and long-term governance power before major listings begin. XRP’s Legal Cloud Finally Clears Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC appears to be nearing its conclusion. The recent $50 million cash settlement—not paid in XRP—has been confirmed, and Ripple has already announced its readiness to drop its cross-appeal. The SEC is widely expected to do the same following a closed-door meeting that took place on July 17. Once both sides formally withdraw, Judge Torres’s ruling—that XRP is not a security in secondary market sales—becomes legally binding, opening the door to full institutional participation. That legal clarity is already translating to bullish momentum: XRP has surged above $3.00, with monthly gains exceeding 60%, Institutional ETF filings are rumored, with names like BlackRock and Fidelity reportedly preparing submissions. Congress is also advancing crypto-friendly legislation like the CLARITY Act, further smoothing the path for stablecoins and payment-focused assets like XRP. The setup for XRP is real—but so is the attention shifting to what’s next. Conclusion XRP is positioned for a strong 2025, with $7 in sight as ETF momentum builds and legal risks fade. But the crypto market rarely rewards complacency. For traders seeking the next exponential opportunity—not just the next ETF listing— MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming impossible to ignore . This is where ideology meets infrastructure, and early conviction may very well define the biggest winners of the next cycle.

In November of 2024, analyst Benjamin Cowen predicted that Ethereum would “come home” or drop to its logarithmic growth trendline based on historical patterns. In April of this year, Ethereum fell to around $1,550, prompting Cowen to declare that ETH had come home. Source: Benjamin Cowen/X Now, Cowen says that Ethereum rallies will be partly fueled by capital rotation from altcoins to ETH. “If you bought ETH when it went home and feel like you are missing out on ALT rallies, consider this: The collective altcoin market is down 40% against ETH since ETH went home. We are at the: ‘Yes your alt went up, but does it bleed against Ethereum’ phase of the cycle… When ALTs bleed to BTC, be in BTC over ALTs. When ALTs bleed to ETH, be in ETH over ALTs. It’s not that complicated.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/X The analyst also believes that Ethereum has a solid shot at printing new all-time highs once it takes out a resistance level that has kept the market bearish since December 2021. “Since ETH went home, the next time it reaches $4,000, there is a good chance it actually breaks through. One way for this cycle to feel more complete is for ETH to rally to new highs sometime over the next half-year.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/X At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,725.

However, as with any transformative technology, its adoption comes with a complex web of regulatory considerations. Recently, a significant voice from the traditional financial world, American market-making firm Citadel Securities, has stepped forward, urging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to adopt a more measured and cautious approach to the widespread embrace of tokenized securities . This pivotal intervention highlights a crucial tension between fostering innovation and ensuring robust investor protection and market stability. Why is Citadel Securities Urging Caution on Tokenized Securities? Citadel Securities, a titan in the market-making industry, plays a critical role in ensuring liquidity across various financial markets. Their recent call for caution, as reported by Bloomberg, was formally delivered in a comment letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on July 21. The core of their argument revolves around the potential for significant disruption and unintended consequences if traditional securities regulations are simply relaxed or sidestepped to accommodate tokenized securities . The firm articulated several key concerns: Investor Confusion: Citadel fears that a hasty adoption without clear guidelines could lead to a bewildering environment for investors. Without well-defined rules, distinguishing between different types of digital assets, understanding their underlying value, and navigating their unique risks could become exceptionally difficult for the average investor. This lack of clarity could expose individuals to unforeseen losses. Regulatory Imbalances: A major point of contention for Citadel is the potential for an uneven playing field. They argue that relaxing established securities regulations for tokenized securities could create an imbalance between traditional exchanges and publicly traded companies, which operate under stringent oversight, and the emerging digital asset platforms. Such an imbalance could inadvertently favor less regulated entities, potentially undermining market fairness and integrity. Market Stability: The sheer scale and interconnectedness of global financial markets mean that any significant shift, particularly one involving novel technologies, must be managed with extreme care. Citadel’s caution stems from a desire to prevent systemic risks that could arise from poorly regulated or understood digital asset markets impacting the broader financial ecosystem. Instead of a piecemeal or reactive approach, Citadel has strongly recommended that the issue of tokenization be addressed through a formal rulemaking process. This would involve a structured, transparent, and comprehensive public consultation, allowing all stakeholders – from financial institutions to technology innovators and consumer advocates – to contribute to the development of robust and future-proof regulations. Such a process would ensure that any framework for tokenized securities is thoughtfully constructed, balancing the promise of innovation with the imperative of investor protection. Understanding Tokenized Securities: A Brief Overview Before diving deeper into the regulatory debate, it’s essential to grasp what tokenized securities truly are. At their core, tokenized securities are digital representations of traditional assets—like stocks, bonds, real estate, or even fine art—issued and managed on a blockchain. This process leverages distributed ledger technology (DLT) to create a unique, verifiable, and often fractionalized digital token that represents ownership or rights to an underlying asset. The allure of tokenized securities lies in several potential benefits: Increased Liquidity: By fractionalizing high-value assets, tokenization can make them accessible to a wider range of investors, potentially increasing their liquidity. Greater Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger can offer enhanced transparency regarding ownership, transaction history, and asset provenance. Reduced Costs: Automation through smart contracts can streamline processes, potentially reducing intermediaries and associated costs. Faster Settlement: Blockchain-based transactions can settle much faster than traditional securities, often in minutes rather than days. Global Accessibility: Digital tokens can be traded across borders more easily, opening up new investment opportunities. However, alongside these benefits come significant challenges, many of which are at the heart of Citadel’s concerns: Regulatory Ambiguity: The primary challenge is fitting these new digital instruments into existing legal and regulatory frameworks. Technological Risks: Cybersecurity threats, smart contract vulnerabilities, and platform stability are ongoing concerns. Interoperability: Ensuring different blockchain networks and traditional financial systems can communicate effectively remains a hurdle. Custody and Security: Securely managing digital keys and assets requires specialized infrastructure and expertise. What Does This Mean for the Future of Tokenized Securities? Citadel’s intervention underscores a critical juncture for the development of tokenized securities . On one hand, the technology offers undeniable efficiencies and new avenues for investment. On the other, the financial markets are built on centuries of established rules designed to protect participants and maintain stability. The future trajectory of tokenized securities will largely depend on how effectively regulators, industry players, and innovators can bridge this gap. The call for a formal rulemaking process suggests a desire for clarity and certainty. Without a comprehensive framework, widespread institutional adoption of tokenized securities will likely remain limited. Investors and large firms require a predictable regulatory environment to commit significant capital and resources. This isn’t just about preventing harm; it’s also about fostering sustainable growth and innovation. For those interested in this space, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on SEC pronouncements and industry discussions surrounding digital asset regulation. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between various types of digital assets (e.g., utility tokens, stablecoins, tokenized securities ) and their respective regulatory treatments. Prioritize Compliance: For businesses exploring tokenization, ensuring compliance with existing and evolving regulations should be paramount. The debate highlights a broader theme: how traditional finance grapples with the decentralized and often borderless nature of blockchain technology. It’s a dance between innovation and control, where striking the right balance is paramount for the long-term health and credibility of the digital asset ecosystem. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape for Tokenized Securities The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stands at the forefront of regulating tokenized securities . Their challenge is multifaceted: how to apply existing securities laws, which were largely conceived in the pre-digital era, to novel blockchain-based instruments. The ‘Howey Test,’ a legal precedent used to determine if an asset qualifies as an ‘investment contract’ and thus a security, is often applied, but its application to every new form of digital asset can be complex and lead to varying interpretations. Citadel’s request for a formal rulemaking process for tokenized securities is a significant development because it advocates for a proactive, rather than reactive, approach. Rulemaking involves a public notice-and-comment period, allowing the SEC to gather input from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. This collaborative approach can lead to regulations that are not only legally sound but also practical and reflective of market realities. Such a process could address: Issuance Standards: Clear guidelines for how tokenized securities can be issued, including disclosure requirements. Trading Platforms: Regulations for exchanges and platforms that facilitate the trading of these assets, ensuring fairness and preventing market manipulation. Custody and Transfer: Rules governing the secure custody of digital assets and the legal framework for their transfer of ownership. Jurisdictional Clarity: Addressing cross-border implications and international cooperation in regulating these global assets. The outcome of this regulatory discourse will undoubtedly shape the pace and nature of adoption for tokenized securities . A well-defined, robust framework could unlock immense potential, attracting more institutional capital and fostering mainstream acceptance. Conversely, a fragmented or overly restrictive approach could stifle innovation and push development to jurisdictions with clearer or more favorable regulatory environments. The stakes are incredibly high for the future of digital finance. In conclusion, Citadel Securities’ call for the SEC to slow down and formally address tokenized securities through rulemaking is a crucial moment for the digital asset space. It underscores the vital need for a balanced approach that embraces the transformative potential of blockchain technology while safeguarding investors and maintaining the integrity of financial markets. The journey towards a fully integrated digital financial future is complex, but with thoughtful regulation, the promise of tokenized securities can be realized responsibly and securely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are tokenized securities? Tokenized securities are digital representations of traditional assets (like stocks, bonds, or real estate) that are issued and managed on a blockchain. Each token represents ownership or a right to a portion of the underlying asset, leveraging blockchain technology for transparency, efficiency, and fractionalization. Why is Citadel Securities concerned about tokenized securities? Citadel Securities is concerned that without proper regulation, the rapid adoption of tokenized securities could lead to investor confusion, create regulatory imbalances between traditional and digital markets, and potentially introduce systemic risks. They advocate for a formal rulemaking process to ensure comprehensive and well-thought-out regulations. What is a formal rulemaking process for tokenized securities? A formal rulemaking process involves the SEC proposing new regulations, publishing them for public comment, and then finalizing them after considering feedback. Citadel believes this transparent and collaborative approach is essential for developing robust and clear rules for tokenized securities , ensuring all stakeholders have a voice. How do tokenized securities differ from cryptocurrencies? While both utilize blockchain technology, tokenized securities represent ownership in real-world assets and are subject to securities laws, similar to traditional stocks or bonds. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, on the other hand, are typically designed as native digital currencies or utility tokens within their own blockchain networks and often function as mediums of exchange or decentralized applications, with different regulatory classifications. What are the potential benefits of tokenized securities? The potential benefits of tokenized securities include increased liquidity through fractional ownership, enhanced transparency due to blockchain’s immutable ledger, faster and more efficient settlement times, reduced costs by minimizing intermediaries, and greater global accessibility for a wider range of investors. Will Citadel’s stance slow down the adoption of tokenized securities? Citadel’s stance might encourage a more deliberate and cautious pace for the widespread adoption of tokenized securities in the short term. However, in the long term, a well-defined regulatory framework resulting from such a process could actually accelerate adoption by providing the clarity and certainty that institutional investors and traditional financial players require to confidently enter this emerging market.

The Florida congresswoman has alleged that Powell testified f alsely about the renovation of the Eccles Building of the Federal Reserve at a high cost. In a letter to the Justice Department, Luna claimed Powell testified falsely before the Senate Banking Committee on June 25. She provided discrepancies in his utterances on the additional cost of the $600 million. She also described his utterances as material statements of falsity. According to Luna, Powell lied that these changes were minor, as was the case in internal documents that were examined by the congressional investigators. The accusation also contends that Powell had written a letter to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russel Vought, where he allegedly downplayed the importance of the renovation changes . Legal stakes are rising The criminal referral escalates the tension between Powell and President Donald Trump, who had urged a considerable interest rate reduction numerous times. Recently, Trump advised the Federal Open Market Committee to reduce rates by 300 basis points. These trends in the current market anticipate a 56.1% possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates during its September meeting this week. Analysts say that this has boosted expectations. A lthough Trump has pondered the possibility of firing Powell, he has told news outlets there is no such possibility. But he said the heightened scrutiny might prompt Powell to resign, should any legal or reputation pressure come to bear. The referral further reinforces the criticism Trump has constantly issued concerning Powell’s unwillingness to be aggressive in monetary policy. Powell could face up to five years in prison and financial penalties if found guilty of perjury. The Department of Justice has not yet responded to the referral, and no official charges have been filed. White Hou se denies i nfluence from the Treasury Secretary Reports from the Wall Street Journal suggested that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent played a role in convincing Trump not to dismiss Powell. However, Trump publicly denied any such influence in a social media post on Sunday. “Nobody had to explain that to me,” Trump wrote. “I know better than anybody what’s good for the Market, and what’s good for the U.S.A.” In an interview with CNBC, Bessent did not entirely push the account recorded by the Journal but reiterated that Trump seeks many people’s opinions before making decisions. “ The president draws advice from a wide range of allies and advisors,” he said. According to the report, Bess ent had cautioned Trump that dismissing Powell would provoke lawsuits and a meltdown in the financial markets. “What we need to do is examine the entire Federal Reserve institution and whether they have been successful.” Bessett Recently, Trump called Powell a “numbskull” and accused him of “making it difficult for people, especially the young, to buy a house.” The US president accused Powell of preventing the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates to make housing more affordable. Powell took office in 2018 following Trump’s nomination of him as his successor to Janet Yellen in his first term as president. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The digital asset market is once again capturing attention, and a key indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , has recently climbed to a notable 72. This significant jump places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, signaling a palpable shift in investor sentiment. But what exactly does this mean for you, and how should you interpret this exciting yet potentially volatile development? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, is more than just a number; it’s a barometer for the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), it aims to help investors understand whether the market is overly fearful – which could present a buying opportunity – or overly greedy – which might indicate a looming correction. On July 22, the index registered 72, a slight increase from the previous day, solidifying its position within the ‘Greed’ territory. Why is this index so important? Because human emotions often drive financial markets. Fear can lead to irrational selling, while greed can fuel impulsive buying, often at inflated prices. By quantifying these emotions, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a valuable perspective, helping traders and investors make more informed decisions rather than succumbing to the whims of the crowd. It serves as a psychological pulse check for the dynamic world of digital assets. Ignoring such indicators can lead to impulsive decisions, making the index a crucial tool for anyone navigating the crypto landscape. How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Work? Decoding Its Components Understanding how the Crypto Fear & Greed Index arrives at its score is crucial for appreciating its insights. It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of various market factors, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the six core components that contribute to its calculation: Factor Weight What It Measures Volatility 25% Current Bitcoin volatility vs. average (30/90 days). High volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Current trading volume and momentum. High buying volume signals greed. Social Media 15% Analysis of crypto-related keywords and sentiment on platforms like Twitter. Positive sentiment indicates greed. Surveys (Paused) 15% Public opinion polls on market sentiment. (Currently paused) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Bitcoin’s market cap share. Increasing dominance can signal fear (move to safety). Google Trends 10% Search queries for crypto terms. Fearful searches vs. curious/buying interest searches. By combining these diverse data points, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a holistic view of market psychology, moving beyond simple price action to capture the underlying sentiment. This multi-faceted approach ensures a more robust and reliable indicator for crypto enthusiasts. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Opportunities and Risks for Crypto Fear & Greed Index Observers The current reading of 72 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index firmly places us in the ‘Greed’ zone. For many, this signals a bullish market where prices are rising, and optimism abounds. It can indeed present opportunities for those looking to capitalize on upward momentum. However, it’s crucial to approach this period with a balanced perspective, recognizing both the potential rewards and inherent risks. Opportunities in a ‘Greed’ Market: Potential for Further Gains: When sentiment is strong, prices can continue to climb as more investors enter the market, driven by positive news and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This can be a lucrative period for existing holders. Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes often accompany periods of greed, making it easier to buy and sell assets without significant price impact. This allows for smoother transactions and better execution of trades. Altcoin Season Potential: Sometimes, strong Bitcoin performance, which contributes to the index, can eventually spill over into altcoins, leading to broader market rallies. This can create diverse opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. Risks in a ‘Greed’ Market: Overvaluation: Periods of extreme greed can lead to assets becoming overvalued, creating bubbles that are unsustainable in the long run. This increases the risk of sharp price corrections. Increased Volatility: While greed can drive prices up, it can also lead to sharp corrections as sentiment can turn quickly. What goes up fast can come down even faster, catching unprepared investors off guard. FOMO-Driven Decisions: The psychological pressure to join a rising market can lead investors to make impulsive decisions, buying assets without proper research or at unsustainable prices. This is where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index acts as a warning sign against emotional trading. “Buy the Rumor, Sell the News”: Experienced traders often “sell into strength” when the market is overly optimistic, anticipating a price correction after major positive news is released. This strategy capitalizes on peak sentiment. Understanding these dynamics is key to using the Crypto Fear & Greed Index effectively. It’s not a buy or sell signal in itself, but rather a guide to the prevailing emotional climate, encouraging a thoughtful approach to investment decisions. Actionable Insights: What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Tell Us? So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently at 72, what actionable steps can you consider? The index is a tool for strategic thinking, not impulsive action. Here are some insights to guide your approach: Exercise Caution, Not Panic: A high ‘Greed’ reading suggests the market might be due for a correction. This doesn’t mean sell everything immediately, but it does mean exercising increased caution. Re-evaluate your risk tolerance and ensure your portfolio aligns with your long-term goals. Avoid FOMO: Resist the urge to jump into assets purely because their prices are soaring. Do your own thorough research (DYOR) and understand the fundamentals of any asset before investing. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps you recognize when FOMO is rampant, prompting you to pause and think rationally. Consider Profit-Taking: If you’ve made significant gains, this might be a prudent time to take some profits off the table. Rebalancing your portfolio can help lock in gains and reduce exposure to potential downturns, protecting your capital. Develop a Strategy: Whether it’s Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) or setting clear entry and exit points, having a pre-defined strategy helps you stick to your plan regardless of market sentiment. A well-defined strategy mitigates emotional trading. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: For long-term investors, short-term fluctuations in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index might be less critical. However, for short-term traders, it offers valuable insight into potential reversal points, aiding in timely decision-making. Diversify: Never put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks, especially during volatile periods that often follow periods of extreme greed. Spreading investments across different assets reduces overall risk. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful indicator, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Combine its insights with technical analysis, fundamental research, and your personal financial goals for a robust investment strategy. Always remember that the crypto market is dynamic, and continuous learning is key to success. The recent surge of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 72, firmly embedding the market in the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear signal of heightened optimism and investor enthusiasm. While this environment presents exciting opportunities for growth and potential gains, it also comes with inherent risks, primarily that of market overvaluation and subsequent corrections. By understanding the underlying components of the index—from volatility and market momentum to social media sentiment and Bitcoin dominance—investors can gain a deeper appreciation of the market’s psychological landscape. Ultimately, the index serves as a valuable cautionary tool, reminding us to temper enthusiasm with prudence, avoid FOMO-driven decisions, and rely on well-researched strategies rather than fleeting emotions. As the crypto market continues its dynamic journey, staying informed and emotionally disciplined remains paramount for navigating its exhilarating highs and challenging lows.

A high score, typically above 50 and especially above 70, indicates that the market is experiencing “Greed.” This means investors are generally optimistic, prices are likely rising, and there’s a strong buying interest, often driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO). Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a buy or sell signal? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a direct buy or sell signal. It’s an indicator of market sentiment. While extreme fear might suggest a buying opportunity (when others are fearful), and extreme greed might suggest a selling opportunity (when others are greedy), it should always be used in conjunction with other technical analysis, fundamental research, and your personal investment strategy. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily by Alternative, reflecting the latest market data and sentiment shifts. Which factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index the most? Volatility and Market Momentum/Volume each contribute 25% to the index’s score, making them the most heavily weighted factors. Social media and surveys (when active) contribute 15% each, while Bitcoin dominance and Google Trends each account for 10%. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market crashes? While a very high “Greed” score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index often precedes market corrections or crashes, it is not a precise predictor. It merely indicates that the market is becoming overbought and potentially due for a pullback. It’s a warning sign, not a definitive forecast. Why are surveys currently paused in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculation? The original source mentions that surveys are currently paused. The exact reasons for this pause are not always publicly disclosed by Alternative, the provider of the index. It could be due to data collection challenges, methodology review, or other operational considerations. Did this article help you understand the current market sentiment?

In some cases, the plugin constantly overwrites gigabytes of data on SSDs. The developers have promised to fix the problem soon. Users of the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet have complained that the extension writes gigabytes of data to their solid-state drives (SSDs), putting them at risk of failure. The developers said they are aware of the bug and plan to fix it, according to media reports. The issue gained increased attention after a user with the nickname ripper31337 opened a relevant ticket in a repository on GitHub. He stated that the extension writes up to 500 GB per day. The bug affects browsers based on the Chromium engine, including Google Chrome and Opera. The data is written to the Local Extension Settings folder, particularly in files such as 011717.log, 011719.ldb, and MANIFEST-000001. Constant overwriting of data at a rate of 5 MB/s may lead to failure of the SSD, which is not designed for such a load. In comments on the ticket, users said that the problem appeared about a month ago. However, user Michael S reported the issue as early as March 2025. Some commenters have already noticed computer slowdowns and other difficulties due to the bug. It is known that the extension starts recording data as soon as the browser is activated. It is not necessary to run the plugin directly for this to happen. The only currently proven way to address the problem is to remove the wallet extension. In a comment to the press, a spokesperson for Consensys, the developer of MetaMask, said the firm is aware of the problem. However, he stated that the bug only affects a small number of users. ”While browser extension wallets do regularly write state to disk, which is expected behavior, we’ve taken note of a recent observation shared by a small number of MetaMask users who reported unusually high disk activity,” he said. According to published reports, a fix for this bug will be released in the near future, though no specific date has been given. In particular, the developers are considering reducing the size of each record and lowering the frequency of data writes.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-22 00:25:46

For those tracking the pulse of technological innovation, especially within the cryptocurrency space where data analysis and complex algorithms are king, this achievement signals a new era of AI capability. It underscores the incredible speed at which AI systems are evolving, demonstrating a mastery of complex reasoning that could soon redefine many industries, including how we approach data security and market analysis in the crypto world. AI Models Master the Impossible: A Gold Medal Feat The International Math Olympiad (IMO) is one of the world’s oldest and most challenging high school-level math competitions. Traditionally, it’s a battleground for the brightest young minds globally. This year, however, the spotlight also fell on artificial intelligence. Both OpenAI and Google DeepMind independently announced their AI models had achieved gold medal-level performance, a remarkable leap from previous attempts. Last year, Google’s AI model secured a silver medal, but it relied on a “formal” system, meaning humans had to translate problems into a machine-readable format. This year marked a significant advancement: Informal Systems: Both companies entered “informal” systems. This means their AI models could directly ingest questions and generate proof-based answers in natural language, mimicking human understanding and problem-solving much more closely. No Human Translation: A key breakthrough was the elimination of human-machine translation, allowing the AI to process and solve problems autonomously. Superior Performance: Both companies claim their AI Models scored higher than most high school students and Google’s own AI from the previous year, highlighting the rapid pace of development. Researchers involved in these IMO efforts stated that these gold medal performances represent significant breakthroughs in AI reasoning models, particularly in non-verifiable domains. While AI excels at tasks with clear, verifiable answers like math or coding, these new systems are showing promise in handling more ambiguous challenges, though true mastery of such tasks remains a future goal. The Fierce AI Race: OpenAI vs. Google DeepMind Showdown Beyond the impressive mathematical achievements, the IMO results have ignited another front in the ongoing AI Race : the battle for public perception and industry leadership. Companies are fiercely competing to appear ahead, an intangible but crucial fight for “vibes” that can significantly impact their ability to attract top AI talent. Many leading AI researchers come from backgrounds in competitive mathematics, making benchmarks like the IMO particularly resonant. The announcements, however, were not without controversy. Google DeepMind raised questions about how OpenAI conducted and announced its gold medal performance, leading to a public squabble reminiscent of teenage rivalries: Premature Announcement: Google DeepMind’s CEO, Demis Hassabis, and other researchers criticized OpenAI for announcing its feat prematurely, shortly after the IMO announced student winners on Friday night, and before official verification. Respect for Students: Thang Luong, a senior researcher at Google DeepMind and lead for their IMO project, emphasized that Google DeepMind waited to announce its results out of respect for the students and to adhere to the IMO Board’s request for official verification. Official Verification vs. Third-Party: Google worked with IMO organizers for over a year, seeking the IMO president’s blessing and official grading. OpenAI, conversely, stated they declined to participate in a formal IMO competition earlier but hired three former IMO medalists as third-party evaluators for their model’s performance. This public disagreement highlights the intense competition. While Google certainly followed a more official and rigorous process for its score, the core takeaway remains: both companies are pushing the boundaries of what AI Models can achieve, and the gap between them appears to be narrowing. Beyond the Math Olympiad: What’s Next for AI Reasoning? The significance of the Math Olympiad achievement extends far beyond bragging rights. It demonstrates AI’s growing capacity for complex reasoning, a critical step towards more sophisticated and versatile artificial intelligence. Countries send their brightest students to the IMO, and only a small percentage achieve gold medals. The fact that AI models can now perform at this elite level is a testament to the rapid advancements in the field. However, it’s also important to acknowledge current limitations. While these systems excel at problems with clear, verifiable answers, they still struggle with tasks requiring more ambiguous solutions, such as offering complex research assistance or making subjective judgments. The next frontier for AI Models involves bridging this gap, enabling them to navigate the nuances of human-like reasoning and decision-making in less structured environments. The intense AI Race continues, with OpenAI expected to release GPT-5 in the coming months, aiming to reinforce its perceived lead. Yet, the IMO results suggest a more evenly matched playing field than any single company might prefer to admit. This competition ultimately benefits everyone, as it accelerates the pace of innovation and brings us closer to truly intelligent AI systems that can tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems. The remarkable gold medal performances by AI Models from OpenAI and Google DeepMind at the International Math Olympiad mark a pivotal moment in AI development. Despite the competitive friction surrounding their announcements, the underlying achievement is undeniable: AI is rapidly gaining ground in complex reasoning, moving from theoretical possibility to tangible reality. This progress not only reshapes our understanding of machine intelligence but also hints at a future where AI could revolutionize every sector, from scientific discovery to everyday problem-solving.

Analysts from Gemini and Fundstrat now forecast a price target of $150,000 BTC by the end of 2025, backed by historic ETF inflows, institutional FOMO, and a strong digital gold narrative. Meanwhile, altcoins like ARB, INJ, and PEPE post modest projections—but MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads as a breakout contender in this bull cycle. If you’re scanning for the best crypto to buy now, this meme-powered, politically-charged altcoin is showing all the signs of something much bigger. The Best Crypto to Buy in 2025? MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just trending—it’s climbing every major list of new cryptocurrencies to watch. Analysts highlight its investor momentum, fast-growing community, and strategic presale structure as signals that early buyers may be witnessing the next big thing. With listings ahead, political tailwinds in motion, and a fixed supply model, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto to buy in 2025 if you’re targeting high-multiple returns in the next cycle. This is also why it now ranks among the top altcoins to buy now and continues appearing in analyst rundowns of low market cap crypto gems. Bitcoin ETF Flows Spark Bullish Cycle Predictions With $5.2B in ETF flows this past month alone and increasing institutional adoption, Bitcoin is regaining momentum. Panelists in Finder’s latest survey project BTC could reach $145,000–$150,000 on average, with some targeting $250,000 in a parabolic scenario. This sets the stage for renewed altcoin rotation—pushing traders to hunt for the next crypto to explode in 2025. One name comes up again and again: MAGACOIN FINANCE. ARB, INJ, PEPE: Legacy Momentum or Limited Moves? Here’s where the rest of the field stands: ARB (Arbitrum): Most forecasts hover around $1.13–$1.96, with minimal catalysts INJ (Injective): Predictions range from $14 to $56, heavily reliant on DeFi market activity PEPE: Projections are capped between $0.000014 and $0.000024, with volatility driven by community sentiment These coins may remain relevant, but they’re unlikely to deliver the returns serious investors want in the next phase. For those evaluating the top cryptocurrencies to invest in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly moving up the shortlist. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops New Crypto Watchlists MAGACOIN FINANCE has evolved from a meme-style project into what many are calling one of the best crypto presales of the cycle. Its positioning ahead of major exchange listings, combined with political timing around the U.S. election narrative, gives it momentum few others can match. Here’s what makes it different: Eight funding rounds complete Hard-capped 170B token supply — no stealth inflation No VC control, 100% community-first allocation DAO and revenue share model launching in September CEX listing announcements confirmed for Q3–Q4 Each major listing typically triggers a 35%+ price jump within 48 hours, based on similar past presales. That makes MAGACOIN one of the best altcoins to buy now for risk-adjusted upside. Looking for the best meme coins to buy now? MAGACOIN offers a much deeper narrative hook—and a forward-facing roadmap that traditional meme tokens lack. Final Word: A Strategic Entry Before Listings Hit MAGACOIN FINANCE combines grassroots energy, real token utility, and a bullish macro backdrop. The presale is surging, listings are near, and analyst coverage is building fast. In a cycle that’s likely to be defined by ETF momentum and identity-based narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already standing out. If you’re narrowing down to one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2025, this is your signal. The entry window remains open—but not for long.

This comes after the price of ETH broke through its previous peak at $3,700, a new milestone since January 2024 on the back of healthy institutional inflows and a resurgence in market confidence. In an X post , Schiff cautioned that testing the waters for Ethereum would be pointless, as it would just be another phony bubble amid a greater bear market against Bitcoin. He wrote, “Ether is back near the upper end of its trading range again. If you own any, this is a great time to sell. As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether.” . Bitcoin was the superior trade because Ethereum tended to follow, he said. Schiff said he used his head, not his heart or gut, to analyze charts. In response to his critics, he clarified that he was also bearish on Bitcoin and thought Ethereum was even more structurally unsound as more competitors entered the smart contract and decentralized finance (DeFi) spaces. He contended that Ethereum no longer had a utility monopoly; meanwhile, despite its faults, Bitcoin had retained the perception of digital gold. He felt that Ethereum’s narrative and use case were getting diluted. Ethereum surges on ETF inflows and corporate DeFi deals Unlike Schiff’s onslaught, the latest rip on Ether results from strong play in the crypto space. ETH rallied over $3,700 amid record inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. These products are a magnet for large institutional investors who consider Ether a credible investment to earn a return on. The token has surged more than 25% over the past week, driven higher by both technical momentum and a bit of fundamental news. Ethereum has been flat over the past year, gaining just 7% in the recent trend of Ether’s price, a sign that growth is accelerating. Public companies have been part of the problem, too. BitMine and SharpLink Gaming are the latest companies to join the game of corporate Ether treasuries . Even more impressive, SharpLink has well over 1B in ETH alone, and they have publicly stated they will stake and run in support of the network to generate passive income. Those kinds of moves suggest that institutions increasingly believe in Ethereum’s long-term prospects even as Bitcoin skeptics like Schiff continue to wonder whether it has legs. Crypto fans fire back at Schiff The crypto community fired back at Schiff’s claims. SharpLink Gaming, one of the companies with large ETH reserves, even edited Schiff’s original X post to advocate for staking Ethereum instead of dumping positions. The shift rebutted and offered a savvy sales pitch for their treasury strategy. Analyst Benjamin Cowen also chipped in on the subject through a long ETH/BTC market chart tweet. He went on to claim that Schiff’s warning was a case of too little too late, adding that the Ethereum-to-Bitcoin ratio probably had already bottomed before Schiff made his comments. Schiff has made waves in the crypto world before. A staunch backer of gold and critic of digital currencies, he has often been at loggerheads with the crypto community. His more recent remarks are unlikely to change the minds of Ethereum bulls, though they certainly have re-ignited the debate about the fate of the world’s largest crypto assets.

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as a significant metric, the Altcoin Season Index, has climbed to a notable 55. This upward movement suggests that we might be deep into what enthusiasts call ‘Altcoin Season’ – a period where alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, steal the spotlight from Bitcoin. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? To truly understand the current market dynamics, it’s crucial to grasp the concept of the Altcoin Season Index. This metric, meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a leading cryptocurrency price data platform, provides a snapshot of the market’s sentiment and performance. It’s not just a random number; it’s a calculated indicator designed to show whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin. The Core Rule: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Inverse: Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same period, the market is considered to be in ‘Bitcoin Season’. The Scale: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. A higher number indicates stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Exclusions: It’s important to note that the index intelligently filters out stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to ensure the data accurately reflects the performance of genuine, volatile altcoins. Decoding the Current Altcoin Season: What Does an Index of 55 Mean? The recent jump of the Altcoin Season Index to 55 at 00:30 UTC on July 22, up two points from the previous day, is a significant signal. While 75 is the threshold for an official Altcoin Season, an index of 55 indicates a strong inclination towards altcoin outperformance. It suggests that a substantial portion of the top 100 altcoins are currently showing more robust gains compared to Bitcoin over the last three months. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it reflects a sustained trend where capital might be rotating from Bitcoin into various altcoins, seeking potentially higher returns. Historically, an index around this level often precedes or accompanies periods of heightened activity and interest in the broader altcoin market. It signifies that investors are increasingly confident in the potential of projects beyond Bitcoin, exploring opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Layer-1 solutions, and various other emerging sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season: A Clear Distinction Understanding the difference between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is fundamental for any crypto investor. These are not just arbitrary terms; they represent distinct phases in the market cycle, each with its own characteristics and opportunities. Feature Altcoin Season Bitcoin Season Dominance Altcoins collectively gain market share; Bitcoin dominance often declines. Bitcoin gains market share; altcoins may consolidate or decline against BTC. Performance Metric 75%+ of top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. 25%- of top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Capital Flow Capital often rotates from Bitcoin into various altcoins. Capital often flows into Bitcoin, seen as a safer or primary asset. Risk/Reward Higher potential for exponential gains, but also higher volatility and risk. Generally lower volatility compared to altcoins, steady growth. These cycles are natural in the crypto market, often driven by shifts in investor sentiment, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors. Understanding which ‘season’ the market is in can help investors adjust their strategies accordingly. What Fuels an Altcoin Season? Understanding the Drivers Behind the Surge Several catalysts typically converge to ignite an Altcoin Season . It’s rarely a single factor but rather a combination of developments that shift investor focus from Bitcoin to the broader altcoin market: Bitcoin Dominance Cycle: Often, after a strong Bitcoin bull run, investors look to diversify gains into altcoins. As Bitcoin’s dominance (its market cap percentage of the total crypto market) peaks and begins to decline, capital flows into altcoins, pushing their prices up. Technological Innovation and Development: Significant upgrades or new features on major altcoin networks (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades, Solana’s scaling solutions, new DeFi protocols) can attract immense interest and investment. These advancements promise improved utility, lower fees, or greater decentralization. Emergence of New Narratives: The crypto space is highly narrative-driven. Trends like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Web3 gaming, Layer-2 solutions, and Real World Assets (RWAs) can create immense hype and bring new capital into specific altcoin categories. Increased Retail Participation: As the overall crypto market gains momentum, retail investors often enter, seeking the next ‘100x’ opportunity. Altcoins, with their lower market caps, often offer more volatile, but potentially higher, percentage gains compared to Bitcoin. Institutional Interest: While Bitcoin and Ethereum often capture initial institutional interest, as the market matures, institutions begin to explore other established altcoins, adding significant liquidity and credibility. Navigating the Altcoin Season: Strategies for Astute Investors With the Altcoin Season Index pointing towards an active altcoin market, how can investors best position themselves? This period presents unique opportunities, but also requires careful planning: Thorough Research is Paramount: Do not invest based on hype alone. Dive deep into whitepapers, project teams, technology, tokenomics, community strength, and real-world utility of altcoins. Look for projects solving genuine problems. Diversification, Not Spreading Thin: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, diversify across a few promising altcoins in different sectors (e.g., one DeFi, one Layer-1, one gaming token). However, avoid spreading your capital too thinly across too many projects, which can make management difficult. Risk Management is Key: Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downsides and take profit targets to secure gains. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can mitigate the impact of market volatility and allow you to accumulate more tokens when prices are lower. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A declining dominance often signals a strengthening altcoin market. Profit-Taking Strategy: Have a plan for taking profits. Many investors regret not selling when their altcoins are soaring. Decide on specific price targets or percentage gains at which you will sell a portion of your holdings. Potential Pitfalls in an Altcoin Season: What Should Investors Watch Out For? While the allure of massive gains during an Altcoin Season is strong, it’s crucial to be aware of the inherent risks. This period can also be ripe for exploitation and significant losses if not approached with caution: Extreme Volatility: Altcoin prices can swing wildly, experiencing massive pumps followed by sharp corrections in a very short period. This volatility can lead to significant emotional stress and poor decision-making. Scams and Rug Pulls: The excitement of an altcoin bull market often attracts bad actors. Be extremely wary of projects promising unrealistic returns, lacking transparency, or having anonymous teams. ‘Rug pulls’ (where developers abandon a project and disappear with investor funds) are unfortunately common. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins might have low trading volume, making it difficult to buy or sell large amounts without significantly impacting the price. This can trap investors in positions they cannot easily exit. Over-Reliance on Hype: Many altcoins gain traction purely through social media hype and influencer promotions, without strong fundamentals. Investing solely based on ‘FOMO’ (Fear Of Missing Out) can lead to purchasing overvalued assets. Technical Malfunctions: Newer or less mature altcoin projects might suffer from technical bugs, network vulnerabilities, or smart contract exploits, leading to loss of funds. Always exercise extreme due diligence and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions in this volatile market. Past Altcoin Seasons: Lessons from History The concept of an Altcoin Season isn’t new; it’s a recurring phenomenon in the crypto market. Looking back, we can observe patterns that offer valuable insights: 2017 Bull Run: This was arguably the first major Altcoin Season, where Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and countless ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) saw parabolic gains, significantly outpacing Bitcoin. Early 2021: Following Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs, early 2021 saw a massive rotation into altcoins, particularly those in the DeFi and NFT sectors, leading to explosive growth for many projects. Late 2021 (Post-May Correction): Even after a significant market correction in May 2021, a mini-Altcoin Season emerged later in the year, driven by strong performance from Layer-1s like Solana and Avalanche, and renewed interest in specific metaverse and gaming tokens. These historical cycles teach us that while altcoin seasons can be incredibly lucrative, they are also temporary and often end with a significant correction. Prudent investors use these periods to secure profits and re-evaluate their portfolios. The Altcoin Season Index reaching 55 is a compelling indicator that the market’s focus is broadening beyond Bitcoin. This period offers exciting opportunities for growth and diversification within the cryptocurrency space. However, it demands a disciplined approach, rigorous research, and a strong emphasis on risk management. By understanding the underlying mechanics of the Altcoin Season, its drivers, and its potential pitfalls, investors can navigate this dynamic environment more effectively and potentially capitalize on the vibrant opportunities presented by the surging altcoin market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How accurate is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index, as tracked by CoinMarketCap, is a widely recognized metric based on clear quantitative data: the performance of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. While it’s a strong indicator, it should be used in conjunction with other market analysis tools and not as the sole basis for investment decisions. Q2: Does an Altcoin Season mean Bitcoin will perform poorly? A2: Not necessarily. During an Altcoin Season, altcoins typically outperform Bitcoin in terms of percentage gains. Bitcoin might still be appreciating in value, but at a slower rate than many altcoins. Sometimes, Bitcoin consolidates or experiences minor corrections while altcoins surge, as capital rotates. Q3: Which altcoins typically perform best during an Altcoin Season? A3: Performance varies. Often, altcoins with strong fundamentals, significant technological developments, growing ecosystems (like DeFi or NFTs), and clear use cases tend to perform well. Newer, innovative projects with smaller market caps can also see explosive growth, but they come with higher risk. Q4: How long does an Altcoin Season usually last? A4: The duration of an Altcoin Season is highly variable. It can range from a few weeks to several months. There’s no fixed timeline, as it depends on market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and the pace of innovation within the crypto space. They typically end when Bitcoin regains dominance or the overall market experiences a significant correction. Q5: Is it too late to invest in altcoins if the index is already at 55? A5: An index of 55 indicates that altcoins are already performing strongly, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s ‘too late’. The index can continue to climb towards 75, signaling even broader outperformance. However, it’s crucial to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate risk when entering a market that has already seen significant moves.

That is when President Donald Trump’s administration intends to impose 50% tariffs on various Brazilian exports. “That can happen,” Haddad said in an interview with local radio station CBN. But he said the giant of South America is still waiting for an official response from Washington to a package of trade proposals that the government presented in May. President Trump announced the tariffs earlier this month, saying they were in response to what he described as political persecution of former President Bolsonaro, who is currently on trial for conspiracy to commit a coup. Trump also criticized the country for what he described as “unfair” trade practices. Not only was the announcement a bolt from the blue, but the trade relationship has been relatively stable. The United States has long been an important export market, particularly for commodities like crude oil, semi-finished steel, coffee, orange juice, and airplanes. Still, the US holds a trade surplus with Brazil, which Brazilian officials have argued makes the new tariffs politically motivated and economically unjustified. Brazil prepares emergency measures for leading export sectors Haddad said the giant of South America had contingency plans if Washington imposed the tariffs. One of those plans is to expand export markets and lessen reliance on US trade . The minister said that if we can find other buyers, we could export more than half of our current exports. “But that would take time.” Industries across the state are preparing for impact. Among the most at risk is Embraer, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, which depends heavily on America for sales and partnerships. The steel industry, which sells raw and semi-processed materials to American buyers, would also see major disruption. Haddad said that although government support could be extended to some industries most affected by the tariffs, the efforts would remain fiscally prudent. He emphasized that they would not “blow up the base” and added that any assistance would be strategic and targeted. The Brazilian private sector is on edge, too. Business leaders worry about how quickly new trade routes and buyers can be secured, especially for highly spatially regulated products such as aircraft or processed foods. Some of the crisis’s next steps could depend on how effectively Soybean Brazil’s diplomatic strategy can ramp up contacts with the US in the next days to prevent a trade conflict. Lula tells Brazil to keep cool in tariff battle The Brazilian President Lula Da Silva made it clear with a firm, down-to-earth sense. He warned that the country would retaliate if the tariffs were imposed, but he also said he did not want to start fights where they were unnecessary. Lula repeated last week at a public event in São Paulo that the state’s sovereignty and economy must be preserved. Should the other side enforce tariffs, he warned, the country will react — but it will always do so in a manner loyal to its values and relationships across the globe. His new finance minister repeated President Haddad’s statement that Brazil would not attack US businesses operating on its territory. He also stressed that Brazil’s policy would be based on principle and not provocation; for Brazil, it is not retaliation that it seeks or wants, but fair trade. Now the Aug. 1 deadline looms heavily. Brazil has a lot on the line. Should discussions continue at an impasse, Latin America’s largest economy must adapt at a corporate level to a new trade landscape that might ravage its commercial alliances and industrial strategies months from now. Brazil is holding the line, waiting, watching, and preparing for now. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The crypto world is buzzing with renewed optimism for XRP , as recent technical analysis suggests a significant upward trajectory could be on the horizon. After a period of consolidation, XRP has shown remarkable strength, breaking through crucial resistance levels and sparking conversations about its potential to reach new highs. This isn’t just wishful thinking; a deep dive into its charts reveals compelling signals that could indicate a powerful surge. Understanding the Current XRP Momentum The journey for XRP has been nothing short of captivating, especially for those who’ve been tracking its movements closely. A recent report from U.Today highlighted a pivotal moment for XRP , noting its decisive break above the $2.80 mark, swiftly followed by a surge past $3.50. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; these are significant breakthroughs that signal a shift in market sentiment and underlying strength for XRP . For many, these levels represented formidable barriers, and overcoming them has opened up new possibilities. What does this mean for the future? The report suggests that the path towards a formidable $5 valuation for XRP is now considered ‘technically viable.’ This viability, however, hinges on a few critical conditions: the price needs to maintain its position above the $3.30 threshold, and crucially, trading volume must see a robust rebound. Without sustained volume, even the most promising technical setups can falter. This is a common theme in crypto markets; strong price movements require equally strong participation from traders and investors. This recent price action has certainly caught the attention of both seasoned traders and new entrants alike. The energy around XRP is palpable, driven by the clear signals emerging from the charts. It’s a testament to the asset’s resilience and the underlying belief in its long-term potential within the digital economy. As we delve deeper, we’ll explore the specific technical indicators that are painting this bullish picture for XRP . Decoding XRP ‘s Bullish Technical Indicators: What Are They Telling Us? For those who speak the language of charts and indicators, XRP is currently broadcasting a clear, bullish message. A key component of this optimistic outlook is the alignment of its Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). Specifically, the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs are now in a textbook bullish alignment. What does this signify? In technical analysis, when shorter-term EMAs (like the 50-EMA) cross above longer-term EMAs (like the 100-EMA and 200-EMA), and all are trending upwards in sequential order, it’s often interpreted as a strong indicator of sustained upward momentum. This ‘golden cross’ type of alignment is highly sought after by traders as it suggests a robust underlying trend. Beyond the EMAs, XRP has also successfully cleared major resistance levels. Think of resistance levels as price ceilings that an asset struggles to break above. Once these ceilings are breached, they often transform into new support levels – floors that prevent the price from falling too far. In XRP ‘s case, the former consolidation range between $2.40 and $2.80, which once acted as a significant hurdle, has now flipped into a strong support zone. This means that if XRP were to experience a pullback, this range is expected to offer a solid foundation, potentially cushioning any downward movement and providing an opportunity for buyers to step back in. To put this into perspective, let’s look at some key levels: Indicator Current Status for XRP Implication 50, 100, 200 EMAs Bullish Alignment Strong upward trend confirmation Former Resistance ($2.40 – $2.80) Cleared Now acts as strong support Critical Support Level $3.30 Key for continued upward momentum This technical setup is not random; it reflects a deliberate shift in market dynamics. The consistent clearing of resistance and the formation of new support zones suggest that buying pressure is consistently overcoming selling pressure, building a solid foundation for future gains. The current price action, which has narrowed just below the recent high, is another fascinating aspect. This ‘tightening’ often precedes another significant upward leg in trending markets, as it indicates a period of accumulation or indecision before a decisive move. Is a $5 XRP Price Target Truly Viable, and What’s the Catch? The question on everyone’s mind is whether the $5 target for XRP is an achievable reality or just an optimistic dream. Based on the technical signals we’ve discussed, the path is indeed viable, but it’s not a guaranteed straight shot. The primary condition, as mentioned, is XRP ‘s ability to hold above the $3.30 mark. This level has become a crucial pivot point; sustained trading below it could negate some of the current bullish momentum and might signal a period of consolidation or even a deeper retracement. Monitoring this level will be paramount for anyone tracking XRP ‘s progress. However, the biggest ‘catch’ or, more accurately, the most vital ingredient for the next breakout, is renewed trading volume. While XRP surged impressively past $3.50, activity has noticeably tapered off since reaching that high. Think of volume as the fuel for a rocket; without sufficient fuel, even the most powerful engine won’t lift off. High trading volume indicates strong market participation and conviction behind a price move. When volume is low, price movements can be more susceptible to manipulation or can simply lack the necessary force to sustain a breakout. Why is volume so critical for XRP ‘s next move? A genuine breakout, especially one aiming for a significant psychological level like $5, requires a broad base of buyers. This collective buying power, reflected in high volume, provides the necessary liquidity and momentum to push the price through new resistance levels and keep it there. Without it, any attempts to break higher might be short-lived, resulting in quick pullbacks as early buyers take profits without new demand stepping in. The current setup – price action narrowing just below the recent high – is a classic technical pattern known as a ‘bull flag’ or ‘pennant’ formation. These patterns often appear after a strong upward move and suggest a temporary pause before the trend continues. For XRP , this implies that while the initial surge was powerful, the market is now taking a breath, potentially accumulating energy for the next leg up. The re-ignition of trading volume will be the definitive signal that this consolidation phase is over and the ascent towards $5 is truly underway. This requires keen observation and patience from investors. Challenges and Considerations for XRP ‘s Ascent While the technical outlook for XRP appears promising, it’s crucial to acknowledge the broader market dynamics and potential headwinds. The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and external factors can quickly influence price action. Regulatory developments, particularly concerning the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple (the company behind XRP ), remain a significant overhang. Positive news could provide a massive catalyst, but any adverse rulings or delays could introduce uncertainty and dampen investor sentiment. This legal battle has been a long-standing challenge for XRP , distinguishing its price action from other major cryptocurrencies at times. Furthermore, general crypto market sentiment plays a pivotal role. If Bitcoin, the market leader, experiences a significant correction, it often drags down altcoins, including XRP , regardless of their individual technical strength. Macroeconomic factors, such as inflation concerns, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events, can also trigger broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets, affecting crypto assets. Investors should always consider these broader market forces when evaluating XRP ‘s potential. Liquidity is another factor. While volume is key for upward movement, sufficient liquidity ensures that large orders can be executed without causing significant price slippage. As XRP aims for higher valuations, maintaining deep order books across exchanges will be important for sustained growth. Finally, competition within the blockchain and payments space is intense. While XRP has its unique use cases and established partnerships, new technologies and protocols are constantly emerging, vying for market share. Staying competitive and continuing to innovate will be essential for Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Navigating XRP ‘s Potential Upside Given the exciting technical signals and the potential for further gains, what should an informed investor consider? First and foremost, always conduct your own thorough research. Technical analysis provides valuable insights, but it’s only one piece of the puzzle. Understanding XRP ‘s fundamentals, its utility in cross-border payments, and Ripple’s strategic partnerships can provide a more holistic view. Diversification is also a wise strategy; avoid putting all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising it seems. This helps mitigate risk in a volatile market. For those considering entry or adding to their positions, observing the key support levels, particularly the $3.30 mark and the $2.40-$2.80 range, is crucial. These levels can offer potential entry points if XRP experiences a healthy pullback. Equally important is monitoring trading volume. A significant surge in volume accompanying a price breakout above the recent high (around $3.50-$3.60) would be a strong confirmation signal for the next leg up. Conversely, a lack of volume on a price rise could indicate a weaker move. Implement a robust risk management strategy, including setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital from unexpected market reversals. Remember, the crypto market can be unpredictable, and capital preservation should always be a priority. A Compelling Summary: The Road Ahead for XRP In conclusion, the technical landscape for XRP is currently painting a compelling picture of potential further upside. The decisive breakthroughs above $2.80 and $3.50, coupled with the strong bullish alignment of the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs, indicate robust underlying strength. The transformation of former resistance into solid support between $2.40 and $2.80 further reinforces this optimistic outlook. While the path to $5 appears technically viable, the critical catalysts for the next major breakout remain sustained price action above $3.30 and, most importantly, a significant resurgence in trading volume. Investors should remain vigilant, balancing technical optimism with a keen awareness of broader market dynamics and the ongoing regulatory environment. The stage is set for XRP ; the coming weeks will reveal if it can harness the necessary momentum to achieve its next ambitious price target. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping XRP price action. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about XRP ‘s Potential 1. What does ‘technically viable’ mean for XRP ‘s price? ‘Technically viable’ means that based on historical price movements, chart patterns, and indicator signals, achieving a certain price target (like $5 for XRP ) is supported by the data. It implies that the necessary market conditions and momentum, as observed through technical analysis, are in place or developing to allow for such a move. 2. How do Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) indicate a bullish trend for XRP ? EMAs are lagging indicators that smooth price data over a specified period. When shorter-term EMAs (e.g., 50-day) cross above longer-term EMAs (e.g., 100-day, 200-day) and all are trending upwards in sequential order, it forms a ‘bullish alignment’ or ‘golden cross.’ This pattern is widely interpreted as a strong signal of sustained upward momentum and confirms an existing bullish trend for XRP . 3. Why is trading volume crucial for XRP ‘s next breakout? Trading volume represents the number of units traded over a period. For a significant price breakout to be sustainable, it needs to be accompanied by high volume. This indicates strong conviction from buyers and sufficient liquidity to absorb selling pressure. Without renewed volume, any upward price movement for XRP might be weak, short-lived, and prone to quick reversals. 4. What are the key support levels for XRP to maintain its upward momentum? According to the analysis, the $3.30 mark is a critical pivot point for XRP ; holding above it is essential for continued upward momentum. Additionally, the former consolidation range between $2.40 and $2.80 has now transformed into a strong support zone, expected to provide a solid floor if XRP experiences any pullbacks. 5. How does the SEC lawsuit impact XRP ‘s price potential? The ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple creates regulatory uncertainty for XRP . While positive developments could serve as a major catalyst, any adverse rulings or prolonged legal battles can dampen investor sentiment and potentially limit XRP ‘s price appreciation, regardless of its technical strength. It remains a significant external factor to monitor. 6. Is $5 the ultimate target for XRP , or could it go higher? While $5 is identified as a technically viable target based on current market conditions and patterns, it’s not necessarily an ultimate ceiling. If XRP achieves and sustains this level with strong volume, and broader market conditions remain favorable, it could potentially aim for higher targets. However, $5 represents a significant psychological and technical milestone in the near to medium term. Found this analysis on XRP ‘s potential insightful?

In a note to clients on Monday, the firm says total perpetual open interest (OI) in ether futures has vaulted from “under $18 billion to more than $28 billion in just a week,” a jump large enough to drag the composite “altcoin-season index” above the critical 50-point threshold for the first time since December. Altcoin Season Ignites As Ethereum Outpaces BTC While it’s no surprise that retail may be chasing the momentum, it’s becoming increasingly clear that institutions are leading the charge this cycle, driven by a shift in narratives and structural developments,” QCP writes, pointing to the unusually large sizing of recent block trades on CME and Binance. Related Reading: Ethereum Set To Hit $10,000, Elliott Wave Analysis Predicts QCP singles out last Friday’s signing of the GENIUS Act as the pivotal spark behind the rotation. The law creates a comprehensive federal regime for dollar-backed stablecoins, forcing issuers to hold 100 percent short-term Treasury or cash reserves and submit to Bank Secrecy Act oversight. The White House cast the statute as “historic legislation that will pave the way for the United States to lead the global digital-currency revolution.” With regulatory clarity finally in hand, corporate treasuries “are racing to build their stockpile,” QCP says, treating ether and other smart-contract platforms—Solana, XRP Ledger and Cardano among them—as the infrastructure layer that will benefit most from an explosion in stablecoin issuance. The desk compares the emerging strategy to the hard-money playbook adopted by publicly listed bitcoin bellwethers such as MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. The note argues that the policy tailwind is already reshaping capital flows. Spot ether ETFs attracted $602 million on July 17, out-pulling bitcoin ETFs’ $522 million and marking the first daily flow victory for ETH in the eighteen-month history of US crypto ETPs. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust recorded the single largest subscription and, according to QCP, is “broadcasting confidence” that its pending amendment to allow on-chain staking will secure SEC approval later this year. Industry analysts concur: the agency is widely expected to rule on the batch of staking amendments before year-end despite BlackRock’s late filing. Related Reading: Tom Lee Predicts $30,000 Per Ethereum As Treasury Frenzy Begins Derivatives positioning mirrors the spot-market exuberance. QCP highlights “aggressive” demand for out-of-the-money call spreads such as the ETH-26 Sep 25 $3,400/3,800 and ETH-26 Dec 25 $3,500/4,500 structures, along with a persistent bid for call-side risk reversals across all listed tenors. Implied volatility skews now favour calls by their widest margin since the April 2024 meme-coin frenzy, signalling traders’ willingness to pay up for upside exposure through the fourth quarter—precisely the window in which ETF staking approval could drop. The Ether surge has already carved four percentage points out of bitcoin’s market-share lead, driving BTC dominance down to 60 percent while lifting ETH’s share from 9.7 percent to 11.6 percent, QCP notes. If that trend holds—and the firm stresses that sustained follow-through in the options market is a key litmus test—“the next leg of altcoin season may already be in motion.” For now, QCP is monitoring three metrics: perpetual OI growth, the altcoin-season index, and relative ETF flows. A decisive break of bitcoin above $121,000 could delay rotation, the desk concedes, but the structural forces unleashed by the GENIUS Act and the prospect of yield-bearing ether ETFs give institutions a tangible reason to diversify. As QCP puts it, “we’ll be watching these signals closely—and if anything else confirms the thesis, you’ll be the first to know.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,846.

While ETH rallies past $3,600 with momentum fueled by record ETF inflows and institutional adoption, a trio of emerging altcoins—MAGACOIN FINANCE, Polkadot (DOT), and Kaspa (KAS)—are rapidly positioning themselves as high-upside plays for the next wave of the crypto bull cycle. So, can these “hidden gems” ride Ethereum’s coattails—or even outperform it? Let’s break it down. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Viral Presale Moonshot Gaining Speed While Ethereum is leading the charge from the top, MAGACOIN FINANCE is lighting up the charts from the ground up. With a meme-fueled narrative and serious product development, this political-themed hybrid-altcoin has already raised several millions in investment. It has completed a full HashEx audit, with a CertiK audit underway. Now in its presale rounds, MAGA token is rapidly selling out each previous round as buyers rush to secure early positions before exchange listings and staking go live. With forecasts ranging from 20x to 75x gains post-launch—and some bullish analysts even suggesting a 5,000%+ ROI—MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025. Ethereum (ETH): ETF Inflows Signal a Push Toward $5,000 Ethereum is currently averaging $3,600, marking a 21% weekly gain and continuing to close in on the $5,000 mark. The rally is being led by massive institutional inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs, with BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone drawing $499 million in a single day. Other bullish signals include SharpLink Gaming, becoming the largest corporate ETH holder, acquiring $118 million in ETH. Additionally, BitMine, backed by Peter Thiel, now holds over $1 billion in ETH. ETHUSD Price Chart: Coinmarketcap ETH Exchange reserves are drying up, and on-chain sentiment is strongly bullish. Short squeezes on derivatives platforms have created further upward pressure With Ethereum’s staking ETF proposals under review and on-chain fundamentals improving, analysts suggest ETH could break its previous all-time high of $4,800 and test the $5,000–$5,200 range if current trends hold. Polkadot (DOT): Under-the-Radar Blue Chip With Big Upgrades Polkadot (DOT) is quietly staging a comeback in 2025, with a 15% weekly gain and trading at $4.4 after breaking key resistance levels. Behind the price action are several transformative developments and it includes: “Proof of Personality” (PoP) security model proposed by founder Gavin Wood, aiming to reduce validator costs by 80%. Additionally, the announcement of a DOT-backed stablecoin is expected to boost ecosystem liquidity. Despite Grayscale removing DOT from its fund and regulatory delays on ETF filings, Polkadot’s dev activity and technical roadmap suggest it’s far from finished. If the community embraces the proposed reforms, DOT could emerge as a top altcoin play once again. Kaspa (KAS): The Fastest Layer-1 Probably Overlooked Trading near $0.096, Kaspa (KAS) is gaining momentum due to its unique blockDAG architecture, which allows it to process 10 blocks per second—a feat unmatched by traditional chains. Recent highlights include a 14% weekly gain and a clean bounce off support near $0.072. Analysts are eyeing the $0.10–$0.12 breakout range in the short term, while long-term projections stretch to $0.25–$1 if bullish conditions persist. KAS is often cited as a high-risk, high-reward gem, ideal for those looking for exponential upside beyond the top 20 cryptos. Final Thoughts With Ethereum on the verge of smashing through the $5,000 barrier, the hunt for breakout altcoins is reaching a fever pitch—and all eyes are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, DOT, and KAS as the next wave’s top contenders. MAGACOIN FINANCE is igniting the charts with rapid investor adoption, turbocharged presale momentum, and explosive analyst forecasts. The next leg of the crypto bull run is underway—and while Ethereum may hit $5,000 sooner than later, early adopters looking for exponential gains should keep a close eye on MAGACOIN FINANCE, Polkadot, and Kaspa. All three have the tech, the narratives, and the momentum to become this cycle’s breakout performers.

The dream of turning a modest investment into a substantial fortune is what draws many to this volatile market. Recently, the crypto community witnessed a remarkable instance of an Ethereum profit play that underscores both the potential rewards and the strategic acumen required to navigate these digital seas. Imagine securing nearly $10 million in profit from a single asset in just a couple of weeks. Sounds like a fantasy, right? For one particular crypto whale, this became a tangible reality, demonstrating the incredible power of well-timed moves in the Ethereum market. This event serves as a compelling case study for anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of large-scale crypto trading and the pursuit of significant Ethereum profit . What Exactly Happened with This Ethereum Profit? The details of this impressive trade, first highlighted by Onchain Lens on X, reveal a calculated maneuver by a major market participant. This whale, a term used to describe individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, recently decided to cash out a significant portion of their Ethereum holdings. Specifically, they offloaded a staggering 8,005 ETH. The transaction saw this large sum of Ethereum converted into 30 million USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. What makes this move particularly noteworthy is the swiftness with which the profit was realized. The whale had held this particular tranche of ETH for a mere two weeks before executing the sale. This short holding period resulted in a phenomenal $9.85 million Ethereum profit . It’s important to note that even after this massive sale, the whale didn’t completely exit their position. They still retain a considerable amount of Ethereum, specifically 1,577.54 ETH, which is currently valued at approximately $5.94 million. This indicates a strategic decision to lock in substantial gains while maintaining exposure to potential future price movements. Here’s a quick breakdown of the whale’s impressive trade: Metric Details Asset Sold Ethereum (ETH) Amount Offloaded 8,005 ETH Proceeds Received 30,000,000 USDT Realized Profit $9,850,000 Holding Period 2 weeks Remaining Holdings 1,577.54 ETH ($5.94 million) Decoding the Crypto Whale’s Strategy: Beyond the Ethereum Profit What can we infer from such a rapid and profitable transaction? This move highlights several potential strategic considerations that large holders employ to maximize their Ethereum profit and manage risk: Swift Profit Taking: The two-week holding period suggests a focus on short-term market movements rather than a long-term ‘hodl’ strategy for this specific batch of ETH. The whale likely identified a strong upward trend and capitalized on it quickly. Market Timing Expertise: Executing such a profitable trade requires acute awareness of market sentiment, technical indicators, and potentially, upcoming news or events that could influence price. It implies a deep understanding of market cycles and entry/exit points. Partial De-risking: By selling a significant portion but retaining some ETH, the whale effectively de-risked their position. They secured a substantial Ethereum profit while still having exposure to any further upside, without being fully exposed to a potential market downturn. Conversion to Stablecoins: Cashing out into USDT rather than fiat currency (like USD directly) is a common strategy among crypto traders. It allows them to lock in profits without fully leaving the crypto ecosystem, enabling quick re-entry if new opportunities arise, and avoiding the slower processes of traditional banking. This kind of strategic agility is often what differentiates highly successful traders from others. It’s not just about buying low and selling high, but about understanding the opportune moments to act decisively to secure an Ethereum profit . What Can We Learn from This Ethereum Profit Play? While most individual investors may not operate on the scale of a crypto whale, there are valuable lessons to glean from this incident regarding pursuing Ethereum profit and managing crypto investments: The Power of Volatility: Ethereum, like many cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. While this can lead to significant losses, it also presents opportunities for substantial gains for those who can accurately predict or react to market swings. This whale’s move is a prime example of capitalizing on volatility. Importance of On-Chain Data: Tools and platforms that track on-chain movements, like Onchain Lens, provide invaluable insights into the activities of large holders. While not a guarantee of future performance, understanding where significant amounts of crypto are moving can offer clues about market sentiment and potential shifts. Defining Your Strategy: Whether you’re a long-term holder or a short-term trader, having a clear strategy is crucial. This whale clearly had a short-term profit-taking strategy for this specific holding. Define your own goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon before entering trades. Profit-Taking is Key: Many investors struggle with when to take profits. This whale’s decision to realize a nearly $10 million Ethereum profit demonstrates the discipline of not letting greed override rational decision-making. Setting profit targets beforehand can be a useful practice. Risk Management: The fact that the whale retained a portion of their ETH highlights a form of risk management. They didn’t go all-in or all-out, instead balancing profit realization with continued exposure. The Broader Impact of Such Ethereum Profit Moves While a single whale’s transaction might seem like an isolated event, the collective actions of large holders can significantly influence market dynamics. When whales make large moves, especially profit-taking events, they can impact: Market Sentiment: Large sales can sometimes trigger fear or uncertainty among smaller investors, potentially leading to further selling pressure. Conversely, large buys can instill confidence. Liquidity: The sale of 8,005 ETH, while substantial, was absorbed by the market, indicating healthy liquidity for Ethereum. This is crucial for maintaining market stability and enabling large transactions without massive price dislocations. Price Discovery: Whale activities contribute to the ongoing process of price discovery, reflecting the market’s collective valuation of an asset at any given moment. Tracking such movements is a part of advanced market analysis, providing a glimpse into the confidence levels and strategies of those with the deepest pockets in the crypto space. It’s a constant dance between supply and demand, influenced by major players seeking optimal Ethereum profit . Navigating Your Own Path to Potential Ethereum Profit For everyday crypto enthusiasts, aspiring to achieve significant Ethereum profit requires a blend of education, patience, and discipline. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on the actions of others, even whales. Understand the fundamentals of Ethereum, its technology, ecosystem developments, and market trends. Set Clear Goals: Before investing, define your investment horizon, profit targets, and stop-loss levels. This helps in making rational decisions rather than emotional ones. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider diversification across different assets to mitigate risk. Stay Informed, Not Obsessed: Keep up with crypto news and market analysis, but avoid constant chart-watching, which can lead to impulsive decisions. Learn from Examples: Use cases like this whale’s Ethereum profit as learning opportunities to understand market mechanics and trading psychology, rather than as signals to blindly follow. The crypto market is a dynamic environment, offering both incredible opportunities and significant risks. By approaching it with a well-thought-out strategy and continuous learning, you can better position yourself for success.

Conclusion: The Ever-Evolving Dance of Ethereum Profit The story of the whale’s swift $9.85 million Ethereum profit is a testament to the unparalleled opportunities that can arise in the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the strategic depth employed by large players and the potential for substantial returns when market conditions align. While such rapid gains are not typical for most investors, the underlying principles of market timing, profit-taking, and risk management remain universally applicable. This event reminds us that the crypto world is constantly evolving, driven by both technological advancements and the collective actions of its participants. For those looking to navigate this exciting landscape, understanding these dynamics and adopting a disciplined approach will be key to unlocking their own potential for success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Their movements are often tracked closely by market analysts. Q2: How do crypto whales make such large profits? Whales make large profits by leveraging their significant capital to execute large trades, often based on in-depth market analysis, strategic timing of entry and exit points, and sometimes, access to privileged information or market insights. Their sheer volume of assets means even small percentage gains translate into large dollar figures. Q3: Is it advisable for average investors to follow whale movements? While tracking whale movements can provide insights into market sentiment, it’s generally not advisable for average investors to blindly follow them. Whales have different capital structures, risk tolerances, and often execute trades with different objectives. What works for a whale might not be suitable for a smaller investor. Q4: What is USDT and why did the whale convert ETH to it? USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1. The whale likely converted ETH to USDT to lock in their Ethereum profit without converting to traditional fiat currency. This allows them to quickly re-enter the crypto market or move funds between exchanges without the delays and fees associated with bank transfers. Q5: What are the primary risks associated with investing in Ethereum? The primary risks of investing in Ethereum include high price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, potential for network congestion or security vulnerabilities, and competition from other blockchain platforms. Market sentiment and broader economic factors can also significantly impact its price. Q6: How can I track crypto whale activity? You can track crypto whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers.

This isn’t just about a large purchase; it’s a calculated maneuver that could send ripples across the entire crypto market, leaving many to wonder about the implications of such a bold play. What’s Behind This Massive ETH Whale Accumulation? The movements of large holders, often dubbed “whales,” are closely watched in crypto markets. Recently, an anonymous ETH Whale executed a significant accumulation strategy, drawing considerable attention. Over the past five days, this entity amassed a colossal 32,953 ETH, worth approximately $117 million, crucially using borrowed funds—a strategy known as leverage. According to on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X , the whale’s average entry price for this substantial ETH acquisition was around $3,552. This strategic entry point suggests strong conviction in Ethereum’s potential. This recent accumulation has bolstered the whale’s total Ethereum holdings to an impressive 56,000 ETH, valued at approximately $211 million. This level of accumulation, particularly when leveraged, highlights a decisive bet on Ethereum’s future performance, signaling potential market shifts. The Power of Leverage: A Double-Edged Sword for the ETH Whale? Leverage in crypto allows traders to control larger positions with relatively less capital. For an ETH Whale , this amplifies potential gains from small price movements in Ethereum. However, this power comes with inherent risks, making it a true double-edged sword. Benefits of Leveraging for an ETH Whale: Amplified Returns: A favorable ETH price movement yields significantly higher percentage gains than non-leveraged positions. Capital Efficiency: Controls a large ETH position using a smaller portion of actual capital, freeing other funds. Challenges and Risks Associated with Leverage: Amplified Losses: Unfavorable price movements magnify losses, potentially wiping out a significant portion of collateral. Liquidation Risk: If ETH price falls to a certain point, the whale’s collateral may be automatically sold to cover borrowed funds, leading to substantial losses. Interest Costs: Borrowing funds incurs interest, which can erode profits over time. Volatility: Crypto market volatility can trigger liquidations rapidly. Managing these risks is paramount for a whale operating at this scale. It requires sophisticated risk management strategies, including constant market monitoring and sufficient collateral to withstand price fluctuations. The successful accumulation of such a large sum using leverage suggests a high degree of confidence and calculated risk assessment by this ETH Whale . Decoding On-Chain Signals: What Does This ETH Whale Move Mean? On-chain analysis provides crucial insights into the cryptocurrency market by examining blockchain transactions. This ETH Whale ‘s leveraged accumulation sends several compelling signals. Implications for the Ethereum Market: Strong Bullish Conviction: Large-scale, leveraged accumulation indicates powerful belief in Ethereum’s future price appreciation. Potential for Price Support: Buying such a large quantity of ETH removes supply, potentially contributing to price stability or upward pressure. Increased Liquidity Demand: The need for borrowed funds highlights demand within DeFi lending protocols, showcasing robust infrastructure. Market Narrative Shift: Whale movements often spark discussions and can inspire confidence among other investors. Understanding these on-chain signals is vital for serious crypto investors. While one whale’s actions don’t dictate the entire market, they offer valuable data points to inform investment decisions, highlighting blockchain’s transparency. How Does an ETH Whale Execute Such a Bold Strategy? Executing a multi-million dollar leveraged accumulation of Ethereum requires significant capital, a deep understanding of DeFi protocols, and robust risk management. An ETH Whale typically employs one of these methods: Decentralized Lending Protocols: Platforms like Aave or Compound allow users to deposit collateral and borrow ETH at specific loan-to-value ratios. Centralized Exchange Margin Trading: Major exchanges offer margin accounts where whales deposit collateral to borrow funds for ETH purchases, benefiting from high liquidity but incurring counterparty risk. The “borrowed funds” aspect strongly points to either a decentralized lending protocol or centralized exchange margin trading. The choice depends on the whale’s preference for decentralization, interest rates, and platform risk parameters. The ability to manage such a large and complex position over multiple days underscores the sophistication of this particular ETH Whale . The recent actions of this ETH Whale serve as a powerful reminder of the strategic depth and high stakes involved in the cryptocurrency market. Their audacious move to accumulate $117 million in Ethereum using leverage showcases not only a strong conviction in ETH’s future but also the sophisticated financial instruments available in the digital asset space. While leverage offers immense potential for gains, it equally magnifies risks, making this whale’s play a fascinating case study in high-stakes crypto trading. As on-chain data continues to illuminate these monumental shifts, market participants gain invaluable insights into the forces shaping the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto landscape.

An ETH Whale refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their transactions, especially large purchases or sales, can significantly influence market sentiment and price movements due to the sheer volume of their holdings. 2. How does an ETH Whale use leverage to accumulate ETH? Using leverage means borrowing funds to increase the size of their investment. An ETH Whale might deposit existing assets (like stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies) as collateral on a decentralized lending platform (e.g., Aave, Compound) or a centralized exchange. They then borrow funds to buy more ETH than they could with their initial capital, amplifying potential gains (and losses). 3. What are the risks involved for an ETH Whale using leverage? The primary risks include amplified losses and liquidation. If the price of ETH drops significantly, the whale’s collateral might be automatically sold to repay the borrowed funds, potentially leading to the loss of their entire initial investment. Interest rates on borrowed funds also add to the cost. 4. How can on-chain analysis track an ETH Whale’s movements? On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available data on the Ethereum blockchain. Transactions, wallet addresses, and token movements are all recorded. Analysts like @EmberCN use specialized tools to track large transactions, identify significant accumulations or distributions, and infer the strategies of large holders, even if their real-world identity remains anonymous. 5. Does an ETH Whale’s accumulation guarantee a price increase for Ethereum? While a significant accumulation by an ETH Whale often indicates strong bullish conviction and can contribute to positive market sentiment, it does not guarantee a price increase. The crypto market is influenced by numerous factors, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market liquidity. Whale movements are one data point among many. 6. What is the significance of the $3,552 average entry price for this ETH Whale? The average entry price of $3,552 indicates the price point at which the ETH Whale acquired their leveraged ETH. This price is important because it serves as a benchmark for their profitability. If ETH trades above this price, the whale is in profit; if it falls below, they are facing potential losses or liquidation risks, depending on their leverage ratio.

A recent report by Token Relations in collaboration with Ripple revealed a stunning surge in the total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). These assets have grown from just $5 million in January 2025 to over $118 million today, marking a 2,260% increase in just a few months. The rapid growth of tokenized RWAs on XRPL shows that more people are trusting this blockchain to bring traditional assets into the digital world. Interesting stat from the new @Token_Relations x @Ripple report: Total tokenized RWAs on XRPL rose 2,260% from $5M in January to over $118M today pic.twitter.com/A3MTSd1F1s — Jacquelyn Melinek (@jacqmelinek) July 21, 2025 This trend could prove to be a long-term growth driver for the XRP ecosystem, as more utility and real-world adoption often bring more interest and investment. XRP Price Analysis: Still in Bullish Territory From a technical standpoint, XRP’s price remains strong, showing a clear bullish pattern on the weekly and daily charts. Currently, XRP is trading above a key support level between $3.30 and $3.40. This area was previously a resistance zone, but XRP has broken above it and successfully turned it into support. If this support level holds, XRP could continue climbing toward its next big target, between $4.60 and $4.70, based on the Fibonacci extension levels. These levels are commonly used by traders to predict where the next price move could go during a strong uptrend. However, if XRP falls back below the $3.30 level, it might see a short-term pullback toward $3.00 or even $2.75, which is another important support area. A break below $2.75 could mean a shift in momentum, but for now, the price is far from that danger zone. Short-Term Trends and What to Watch On the shorter timeframes, XRP appears to be in a consolidation phase, meaning the price is moving sideways after a strong push upward. This is typically a healthy pause before another breakout. If XRP manages to break above the recent high near $3.84, it could be the start of the next big rally.",Uncategorized|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-22 01:13:50

This strategic move, which sees the firm now holding a considerable amount of Bitcoin, is not merely a financial transaction but a bold statement about the evolving landscape of corporate treasury management and the growing confidence in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. For those keenly observing the intersection of traditional markets and digital innovation, Volcon’s decision marks a pivotal moment. What’s Driving Volcon’s Bold Bitcoin Move? Volcon, renowned for its cutting-edge electric motorcycles and utility terrain vehicles, has officially disclosed its impressive Volcon Bitcoin holdings, totaling 280.14 BTC. A significant portion of this acquisition, specifically 235.83 BTC, was secured through cash subscriptions, as initially reported by Business Wire. This announcement confirms the company’s previously stated intentions to allocate a substantial part of its capital raise towards digital assets. Earlier, Volcon had unveiled ambitious plans to raise $500 million through a private placement. The firm had explicitly communicated its intention to utilize over 95% of these proceeds to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. This level of commitment is remarkable, signaling a deliberate and calculated decision by Volcon’s leadership to embrace Bitcoin as a core component of their financial strategy. This isn’t a speculative venture on the sidelines; it’s a foundational shift for a company rooted in traditional manufacturing and sales. Why would an electric power sports company make such a pivot? The underlying drivers often include a desire to: Diversify Treasury Assets: Moving beyond traditional cash and equivalents to mitigate inflation risks. Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Attract New Investors: Appeal to crypto-savvy investors and signal innovation. The decision to acquire Volcon Bitcoin highlights a broader trend among publicly traded companies seeking new ways to optimize their balance sheets and respond to macroeconomic shifts. How Did Volcon Secure Its Bitcoin Holdings? The details of Volcon’s acquisition method are particularly insightful. The company secured a significant portion of its Volcon Bitcoin through ‘cash subscriptions,’ which refers to funds raised directly from investors who subscribe to new shares or other securities. This aligns with their prior announcement of a $500 million private placement. A private placement involves selling securities to a select group of investors rather than offering them to the general public. This method allows companies to raise capital quickly and efficiently, often from institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals, without the extensive regulatory requirements of a public offering. By earmarking over 95% of these proceeds for Bitcoin, Volcon essentially designed its capital raise with the explicit purpose of building a substantial digital asset treasury. This approach demonstrates a strategic financial engineering effort. Instead of simply buying Bitcoin from existing company cash reserves, Volcon actively sought new capital with the stated intent of converting it into Bitcoin. This shows a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in the company’s future financial health. It’s a testament to how some firms are leveraging capital markets to facilitate their crypto ambitions. To put Volcon’s current holdings into perspective, here’s a quick look: Metric Details Total Bitcoin Held 280.14 BTC Secured via Cash Subscriptions 235.83 BTC Targeted Capital Raise for BTC Over 95% of $500 Million Why Are Companies Like Volcon Embracing Bitcoin? The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets gained significant traction with pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla. Now, the Volcon Bitcoin acquisition reinforces this growing movement. But what are the compelling arguments driving this shift? For many corporate treasuries, the traditional approach of holding large cash reserves has become less appealing due to low interest rates and inflationary pressures. Bitcoin offers an alternative with several perceived advantages: Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, far outpacing traditional assets. Scarcity and Decentralization: Bitcoin’s fixed supply (21 million coins) and decentralized nature make it immune to governmental interference or arbitrary issuance, offering a level of financial sovereignty. Macroeconomic Hedging: In an uncertain global economic climate, Bitcoin can act as a non-correlated asset, providing diversification benefits when traditional markets face downturns. Brand Enhancement: For companies in tech-forward sectors like electric vehicles, embracing Bitcoin can align them with innovation and appeal to a digitally native customer base and investor pool. The narrative around Volcon Bitcoin holdings is not just about financial strategy; it’s also about a company positioning itself for the future. By holding a digital asset that is increasingly recognized as a store of value, Volcon is aligning itself with a broader technological and financial revolution. What Are the Potential Challenges for Volcon’s Bitcoin Strategy? While the benefits of holding Volcon Bitcoin are compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with such a strategy. No investment is without its downsides, and cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, come with their own unique set of considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is renowned for its significant price swings, which can lead to substantial impairment charges if the price drops below the acquisition cost. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, and changes could impact the value or liquidity of corporate Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Accounting Treatment: Under current accounting standards, Bitcoin is often treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, requiring impairment losses to be recorded but not gains until sold, creating financial statement volatility. Public Perception and Shareholder Scrutiny: While some investors applaud such moves, others might view Bitcoin holdings as overly speculative, potentially leading to increased scrutiny. Volcon, like any company embarking on a significant crypto treasury strategy, will need to navigate these complexities carefully. Their success will depend not only on Bitcoin’s performance but also on their ability to manage these operational and financial risks effectively. The Road Ahead: What Does Volcon’s Bitcoin Acquisition Mean? The Volcon Bitcoin acquisition serves as a powerful indicator of the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. It suggests that companies, even those outside the traditional tech or finance sectors, are seriously considering Bitcoin as a viable treasury reserve asset. For Volcon itself, this move could have several implications: Enhanced Financial Flexibility: A strong Bitcoin reserve could provide additional financial leverage or liquidity in the long run. Pioneering Spirit: Volcon positions itself as a forward-thinking company not just in electric power sports but also in financial innovation. Market Influence: As more companies follow suit, the collective corporate demand for Bitcoin could contribute to its long-term price stability and adoption. The story of Volcon Bitcoin will undoubtedly be a closely watched case study in the corporate world. Will this bold step pave the way for other electric vehicle manufacturers or power sports companies to follow suit? Only time will tell, but Volcon has certainly thrown its hat into the ring, demonstrating a strong belief in the future of decentralized finance. In conclusion, Volcon’s significant acquisition of 280.14 BTC marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company but for the broader corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies. By strategically leveraging a private placement to fund its Volcon Bitcoin holdings, the Nasdaq-listed firm has positioned itself at the forefront of a financial paradigm shift. While the path ahead may present its share of challenges, Volcon’s bold move underscores the growing conviction among forward-thinking businesses that digital assets like Bitcoin are integral to future-proofing their financial strategies and embracing innovation. This development is a testament to the undeniable momentum of Bitcoin as a legitimate and increasingly attractive asset for corporate treasuries worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

But it’s not alone. Several altcoins, especially MAGACOIN FINANCE, Pi Network (PI), and Kaspa (KAS), are also showing signs of strength or potential recovery, prompting investors to ask: Which tokens will lead the next breakout heading into 2026? From ADA’s institutional-driven rally to MAGACOIN’s ideological community surge, the market is ripe with movement. Here’s a breakdown of each project’s current status—and why institutional investors are showing interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE above others. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Coin With Real Utility and Vision Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is blazing its own trail as a politically inspired, fully decentralized meme coin. It’s winning over investors with smart tokenomics, no central wallets, and full ownership by the public. Beyond ideology, the infrastructure is solid. MAGACOIN has passed CertiK and HashEx audits, added cross-wallet support (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet), and developed a roadmap that includes CEX listings, staking, and governance. Telegram and X (Twitter) communities are growing rapidly, and analysts are projecting 30x–35x returns for early buyers. With the presale nearing its end, the window to join this movement is closing fast. Cardano Approaches Key Resistance on Path to $3 Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.87 after a sharp breakout above a multi-month descending trendline. This rally from $0.55 has turned the price structure bullish on both short- and mid-term charts. ADA now hovers just below resistance at $0.90, with a potential move toward $0.95 and $1.08 if volume holds. On-chain data supports the rally. Coinglass reports a 31% jump in open interest to $1.66 billion within 24 hours, while daily trading volume has doubled to $5.77 billion. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the RSI nearing 69 and the MACD showing a positive crossover. If bulls maintain control above $0.85, analysts say ADA could realistically aim for $3 by 2026, especially with continued institutional momentum. Kaspa (KAS) Eyes Breakout After Rebound From Key Support Kaspa (KAS) is nearing a potential breakout after bouncing from $0.072 earlier this month. Price is once again testing the tough $0.096 resistance, where both the upper range and a descending trendline converge. A breakout here could send KAS toward $0.10 or even $0.12. Momentum favors the bulls. The RSI sits near 67, the MACD is trending upward, and the price remains above its 9-day SMA. The pattern of higher lows since early July suggests strong accumulation. If volume continues to rise, KAS could soon be one of 2026’s top-performing Layer 1 coins. Pi Network (PI) Clings to Critical Support, Bearish Outlook Looms Pi Network (PI) remains under intense selling pressure, having dropped over 85% from its all-time high. Currently trading around $0.45, PI is flirting with a breakdown of its $0.40 horizontal support. A clean break below this could trigger a steep fall toward $0.082, based on Fibonacci projections. However, the 6-hour chart reveals a descending channel, which can sometimes signal a reversal. If PI bounces from the $0.38–$0.40 range, a short-term recovery is possible, though indicators like the RSI and MACD remain bearish. For now, any bullish case remains weak and highly speculative unless strong buyer interest returns soon. Conclusion: Why MAGACOIN Could Be the 2026 Breakout Everyone Misses The crypto market thrives on narratives, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has one of the most compelling. It’s tapping into cultural momentum while delivering tech-backed decentralization. Analysts on X have already projected a potential 5,000% surge once it hits exchanges and the memecoin sector revives. With the presale nearly sold out and utility expanding across Web3 platforms, MAGACOIN offers a unique ground-floor opportunity. Early adopters enjoy exclusive staking multipliers, community governance rights, and future airdrop eligibility. If you missed out on PEPE, SHIB, or DOGE before they went parabolic, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be your second chance, but only if you act before the rocket takes off.

After years of litigation, many believed the legal battle was finally coming to an end. But now, uncertainty has returned as the SEC has yet to officially close the case. XRP Community Wants Clarity The source of frustration is clear: Ripple had publicly announced it was withdrawing its appeal, and many in the XRP community assumed the SEC would do the same. Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) have been buzzing with posts from confused XRP supporters asking the same question: “Why hasn’t the SEC announced that the case is over?” Sure. Once the SEC enforcement staff decided to drop its appeal, presumably in the days after the court’s 6/26 order declining to modify its remedies, it sent a recommendation to the commissioners for approval. This is a standard process that can take 1-2 months. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 21, 2025 XRP holders were hopeful that, with both Ripple and the SEC seemingly agreeing to drop the remaining appeal, the long legal saga was finally behind them. They now feel that Ripple and the community deserve closure and transparency after years of uncertainty that have weighed heavily on the price and reputation of XRP. SEC Process Explained: Not That Simple Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel stepped in to clarify the situation, explaining that while the SEC’s staff may have decided to drop the appeal after the court’s June 26 order (which denied modifying the remedies), there’s still a formal approval process that needs to be completed. Here’s how it works: once the enforcement staff at the SEC makes a decision — like withdrawing an appeal, they submit a recommendation to the SEC’s commissioners, who must then formally vote to approve it. This is a routine process and typically takes one to two months. In urgent situations, the SEC can speed things up, but that doesn’t appear to be the case here. Fagel explained that, while the commissioners have previously approved similar dismissals quickly (such as during earlier settlement stages), this time the process seems to be moving at its usual pace. Was Ripple’s Announcement Misleading? Crypto lawyer James Farrell added another layer to the conversation. He said that some of the confusion may stem from how Ripple phrased their announcement. While Ripple said they were dropping the appeal and suggested the SEC was doing the same, Farrell said that experienced legal professionals typically use more cautious wording. Instead of saying the SEC has dropped the appeal, most would say something like “the SEC staff has agreed to recommend dismissing the appeal” — a small but important distinction. That wording makes it clear that the final decision still lies with the SEC commissioners and isn’t immediate.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-22 02:04:45

Recently, a significant event involving the FORM token has sparked considerable discussion: Trend Research, the strategic investment arm of the well-known crypto firm LD Capital, executed a substantial deposit of 1.5 million FORM token s, valued at an impressive $5.12 million, into the Binance Exchange. This pivotal transfer, brought to light by the keen insights of on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, occurred approximately ten hours ago, immediately raising questions about its implications for the FORM token and the broader crypto market. This isn’t merely a routine transfer; it’s a strategic maneuver by a major player, offering a rare glimpse into the operational strategies of institutional crypto investors. Despite this considerable deposit, Trend Research continues to hold a substantial position, retaining 3 million FORM token s, which are currently valued at an estimated $10.44 million. Such large-scale transactions by entities like Trend Research are closely monitored, as they often precede, or are indicative of, shifts in market sentiment or strategic portfolio adjustments. What Does This FORM Token Deposit Signify for the Market? When a large holder, especially an institutional entity like Trend Research, moves a significant amount of a specific cryptocurrency like the FORM token onto an exchange, it can signal several potential intentions. Understanding these possibilities is crucial for anyone following the crypto market: Potential Selling Pressure: The most common interpretation is that the entity intends to sell a portion of their holdings. Moving tokens to an exchange makes them readily available for trading. A deposit of this magnitude could introduce selling pressure on the FORM token , potentially leading to a price correction if the market anticipates a large sell-off. Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutional investors constantly adjust their portfolios based on market conditions and risk assessments. This deposit could be part of a broader strategy to rebalance their asset allocation, perhaps reducing exposure to the FORM token to free up capital for other investments or to secure profits. Increasing Market Liquidity: Less commonly, large deposits can be aimed at increasing market liquidity, especially for tokens with lower trading volumes, facilitating smoother trading for other participants. The sheer volume of the FORM token involved—1.5 million units—makes this a noteworthy event. It underscores the power that large holders wield in influencing the immediate price action of a token. Understanding Trend Research and Their FORM Token Strategy To fully grasp the significance of this FORM token deposit, it’s essential to understand the entities involved. Trend Research is the investment arm of LD Capital, a prominent name within the cryptocurrency venture capital and investment landscape. LD Capital has established itself as a formidable force, known for its strategic investments in various blockchain projects and cryptocurrencies. LD Capital’s investment philosophy typically revolves around identifying promising early-stage projects, providing capital, and actively participating in the growth of the crypto ecosystem. When an entity of LD Capital’s stature makes a move like this FORM token deposit, it suggests a well-thought-out strategy rather than an impulsive decision. The fact that Trend Research still holds a substantial 3 million FORM token s, even after this deposit, indicates that they likely maintain a continued interest or belief in the project’s underlying value, albeit perhaps with a rebalanced exposure. The Power of On-Chain Analysis: Tracking FORM Token Flows The information about Trend Research’s FORM token deposit came from an on-chain analyst, @EmberCN. This highlights the growing importance and power of on-chain analysis in the cryptocurrency space. On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available data on blockchain ledgers to gain insights into market sentiment, large investor movements, and overall network activity. Here’s why on-chain analysis, especially for movements like this FORM token transfer, is invaluable: Transparency: Blockchains are transparent. Every transaction is recorded and verifiable by anyone. This allows analysts to track the flow of funds in real-time. Early Warning Signals: Large deposits to exchanges or unusual whale activity can often serve as early indicators of potential price shifts. By monitoring these patterns, investors can anticipate market movements. Reduced Information Asymmetry: On-chain data democratizes access to information, helping retail investors make more informed decisions. However, interpreting on-chain data requires expertise. While the data itself is factual, understanding the ‘why’ behind a transaction, such as a FORM token deposit, involves experience and a deep understanding of market dynamics. Analysts like @EmberCN specialize in connecting these data points to form a coherent narrative. A cartoon illustration showing FORM tokens being deposited into a Binance-like exchange. FORM Token: Unveiling Trend Research's Strategic $5.12M Binance Deposit Actionable Insights for Investors from FORM Token Movements What can average investors glean from significant events like the Trend Research FORM token deposit? While direct replication of institutional strategies is often impractical, these events offer valuable lessons: Stay Informed with On-Chain Data: Follow reputable on-chain analysts. Being aware of large movements can provide an edge, helping you anticipate potential market volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on a single asset, especially one susceptible to large whale movements, can be risky. Diversification helps mitigate the impact of sudden price shifts. Understand the Project: Thoroughly research a token’s fundamentals, use cases, and roadmap. A strong project with real utility is more likely to weather market fluctuations caused by large deposits or withdrawals. Manage Risk: Always have a risk management strategy in place. This includes setting stop-loss orders and not investing more than you can afford to lose. The challenges in this landscape often stem from emotional reactions. A large deposit can trigger fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), leading to panic selling. The key is to remain objective and base decisions on comprehensive analysis rather than knee-jerk reactions. The Future of FORM Token and Institutional Influence The Trend Research FORM token deposit is a stark reminder of the increasing influence of institutional players in the cryptocurrency market. As more traditional financial entities and large investment firms enter the space, their movements will continue to have a profound impact on token prices and market sentiment. This professionalization of the crypto market brings both opportunities and challenges. For the FORM token itself, the immediate future will likely depend on how Trend Research utilizes its deposited assets. Will there be a sustained sell-off, or was this merely a liquidity injection for a specific, non-selling purpose? Only time, and continued on-chain monitoring, will tell. Regardless, this event serves as a crucial case study in understanding the intricate dance between large holders and market dynamics. As the crypto market matures, the role of sophisticated on-chain analysis tools and expert analysts will only grow. They provide the necessary transparency and insights to navigate a landscape that, while decentralized, is increasingly influenced by centralized financial decisions made by powerful entities. Keeping an eye on these developments is not just about tracking individual tokens like the FORM token ; it’s about understanding the evolving structure and forces at play in the entire digital asset ecosystem.

LD Capital is a prominent venture capital firm in the cryptocurrency space. Trend Research is its investment arm, managing their crypto asset portfolio and executing strategic investments. They are significant institutional players whose movements are closely watched. Why would a firm deposit such a large amount of FORM token into an exchange like Binance? The most common reason is to prepare for selling a portion of their holdings, either to take profits or rebalance their portfolio. Other reasons could include providing liquidity for specific trading pairs or participating in exchange-based programs. How does a large deposit like this impact the FORM token’s price? A large deposit can create a perception of impending selling pressure, potentially leading to a decrease in the token’s price if supply outweighs demand. The actual impact depends on whether the tokens are sold, market liquidity, and existing demand. What is on-chain analysis and why is it important for crypto investors? On-chain analysis examines data directly from public blockchain ledgers to understand market activity, including large transactions and exchange flows. It provides transparent, real-time insights into market dynamics, helps identify potential trends, and reduces information asymmetry.

Imagine sending money across continents instantly and affordably. This vision is rapidly becoming a reality, spearheaded by giants like Western Union. For over a century, Western Union has defined global money transfers. Now, it’s exploring the integration of Western Union stablecoin solutions into its digital wallet offerings. This strategic move could fundamentally reshape cross-border payments and fiat conversions worldwide, signaling that even legacy institutions recognize stablecoins’ immense potential for efficiency, cost reduction, and financial inclusion. It’s a transformative step towards a more connected and efficient global financial ecosystem. Why is Western Union Embracing Stablecoins? Western Union has long facilitated global remittances, but traditional cross-border payments are often slow, expensive, and opaque. Stablecoins offer a compelling alternative. These cryptocurrencies maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, making them ideal for transactions. CEO Devin McGranahan views stablecoins as a significant innovation opportunity. By leveraging blockchain, stablecoins promise: Near-Instant Settlement: Transactions complete in minutes or seconds. Lower Transaction Costs: Fewer intermediaries mean significantly reduced fees. Enhanced Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public, verifiable ledger. Increased Accessibility: Digital wallets can serve unbanked populations, fostering financial inclusion. Western Union’s pivot acknowledges these benefits. Their goal is to build infrastructure and partnerships for seamless Western Union stablecoin use, particularly in South America and Africa, where efficient cross-border payments are crucial. How Will Western Union Stablecoin Integration Work? Integrating stablecoins into Western Union’s extensive framework requires careful planning and technological development. The company is building necessary infrastructure, likely involving: Backend Technology: Integrating blockchain nodes, smart contracts, and secure digital asset management. Digital Wallet Upgrades: Enhancing apps to support stablecoin storage, sending, and receiving alongside fiat. Stablecoin Partnerships: Collaborating with compliant stablecoin issuers for liquidity and acceptance. Regulatory Compliance: Developing robust AML/KYC protocols across diverse jurisdictions. The potential user experience with Western Union stablecoin integration is streamlined: Traditional Transfer Western Union with Stablecoin Sender initiates via cash/bank. Sender converts fiat to stablecoin in digital wallet. Funds travel through multiple banks. Stablecoins sent via blockchain to recipient’s wallet. Takes 1-5 business days. Arrives in minutes/seconds. Recipient picks up cash/bank deposit. Recipient converts stablecoin to local fiat or uses directly. Higher fees, less transparency. Potentially lower fees, greater transparency. The focus on South America and Africa is strategic due to high remittance volumes, significant unbanked populations, and growing mobile penetration. This could enable instant, low-cost transfers directly into mobile wallets, bypassing traditional banking. What Are the Potential Benefits of Western Union Stablecoin Adoption? Western Union’s foray into stablecoins could profoundly benefit various stakeholders: For Consumers: Reduced costs, increased speed (near-instant transfers), greater accessibility for the unbanked, and enhanced convenience within a single, trusted platform. For Western Union: Gaining a competitive edge, expanding into new markets with efficient digital solutions, improving operational efficiency by reducing reliance on costly banking networks, and reinforcing its role as an innovation leader. For the Broader Crypto Ecosystem: Mainstream adoption from a legacy brand lends immense credibility, increases stablecoin market liquidity, and potentially spurs clearer regulatory guidelines for the entire industry. This strategic move highlights how established financial entities recognize digital assets, especially stablecoins, as powerful tools for improving global financial infrastructure. The potential for a truly interconnected and efficient global payment network is immense, with Western Union stablecoin solutions playing a crucial role. Challenges and Considerations for Western Union Stablecoin Rollout Integrating stablecoins at this scale presents significant challenges for Western Union: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating diverse and evolving global regulations (AML/CTF, consumer protection) and securing licenses across numerous jurisdictions. Technological Integration & Scalability: Merging new blockchain systems with legacy infrastructure requires robustness, security, and scalability for Western Union’s massive transaction volume. User Adoption & Education: Many users, particularly in less tech-savvy regions, are unfamiliar with digital wallets. Investment in user education, simplified interfaces, and strong customer support is crucial. Competition: Differentiating its stablecoin offerings against existing blockchain-leveraging fintechs in a competitive remittance market. Interoperability: Ensuring easy conversion of stablecoins to local fiat across a vast network requires extensive partnerships and liquidity. Despite these, Western Union’s history of adaptation and its established brand trust and global agent network provide a significant advantage. The success of Western Union stablecoin initiatives hinges on overcoming these obstacles while maintaining reliability and accessibility. In conclusion, Western Union’s strategic move to integrate stablecoins into its digital wallet offerings marks a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset economy. This bold step by a global leader underscores stablecoins’ undeniable potential to revolutionize cross-border payments, making them faster, cheaper, and more accessible worldwide. While challenges related to regulation, technology, and user adoption remain, Western Union’s established infrastructure, brand trust, and commitment to innovation position it strongly to lead this transformation. The future of global money transfers is undeniably digital, and the proactive stance of companies like Western Union is paving the way for a more efficient and inclusive financial world. The integration of Western Union stablecoin solutions is not just an incremental improvement; it’s a foundational shift that promises to redefine financial connectivity on a global scale, benefiting individuals, businesses, and entire economies by unlocking unprecedented efficiency and reach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are stablecoins and why is Western Union interested in them? A1: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like fiat currency. Western Union sees them as a way to enable faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments. Q2: How will Western Union’s use of stablecoins benefit me as a customer? A2: Customers could benefit from reduced fees, near-instant transfer speeds, and increased accessibility, especially for those without traditional bank accounts. Q3: Which regions will primarily benefit from Western Union’s stablecoin integration? A3: Western Union is focusing on South America and Africa, regions with high remittance volumes that stand to gain significantly from efficient digital payment solutions. Q4: What challenges does Western Union face with stablecoin adoption? A4: Key challenges include navigating complex global regulations, ensuring robust technological integration and scalability, driving user adoption, and competing with existing crypto-native services.

A significant move by a prominent investment firm has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape. We are talking about ARK Invest, the innovation-focused fund led by Cathie Wood, which recently made headlines by divesting a substantial portion of its Coinbase shares . This decision, involving millions of dollars, has sparked widespread discussion about the future trajectory of crypto-related investments and the broader market. What Exactly Happened with Coinbase Shares? On July 21, ARK Invest executed a notable sale of 218,986 Coinbase shares . This massive transaction was valued at approximately $90.58 million and was spread across three of ARK Invest’s actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Coinbase, being the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, holds a significant position in the crypto ecosystem, making any major divestment from its stock a point of interest for market observers. This move wasn’t an isolated incident; it signals a potential shift in ARK’s strategy regarding its exposure to certain digital asset platforms. To put the scale of this sale into perspective, here’s an estimated breakdown of the Coinbase shares sold across ARK’s key ETFs: ARK ETF Estimated Coinbase Shares Sold Estimated Value (USD) ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) 175,000 $72.00M ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) 30,000 $12.35M ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) 13,986 $6.23M Total 218,986 $90.58M Note: The exact distribution of shares per ETF is an estimation based on publicly reported total sales and common ARK ETF holdings. Why Did ARK Invest Divest from Coinbase Shares? The question on everyone’s mind is: what prompted this significant sale of Coinbase shares ? While ARK Invest does not always disclose the precise reasons behind every trade, market analysts and observers often speculate on potential factors. Several theories could explain this strategic decision: Profit-Taking and Rebalancing: ARK Invest has held a substantial position in Coinbase for a considerable period. As the value of Coinbase shares fluctuates, the firm might be taking profits to lock in gains, especially after periods of strong performance. This is a common portfolio management strategy to rebalance holdings and manage risk exposure. Portfolio Diversification: Cathie Wood’s investment philosophy often focuses on disruptive innovation. However, even innovation-focused portfolios require diversification. Reducing exposure to a single asset, even a high-conviction one like Coinbase shares , allows for reallocation into other promising sectors or companies that align with ARK’s long-term themes. Regulatory Landscape Concerns: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains uncertain and complex. Ongoing discussions and potential new regulations could influence the operational landscape for exchanges like Coinbase. ARK Invest might be preemptively adjusting its exposure to mitigate potential regulatory headwinds. Market Outlook and Valuation: ARK’s investment decisions are often based on their long-term outlook for a company’s growth and valuation. The sale of Coinbase shares could suggest a revised valuation perspective or a belief that other opportunities currently offer better risk-reward profiles within their investment universe. Understanding Cathie Wood’s investment approach is key here. Her firm often takes concentrated bets on companies they believe are poised for exponential growth due to disruptive technologies. However, they are also known for actively managing their portfolios, adjusting positions as market conditions, valuations, or company fundamentals evolve. Beyond Coinbase Shares: Robinhood and Block Inc. Too? Interestingly, the divestment wasn’t limited to Coinbase shares . The Block reported that ARK Invest also reduced its positions in Robinhood, a popular crypto trading platform, and Block Inc. (formerly Square), a digital payments company with significant exposure to Bitcoin through its Cash App. This broader pattern of selling indicates a more comprehensive portfolio adjustment rather than an isolated move against Coinbase alone. This concurrent reduction in holdings across multiple crypto-adjacent companies suggests a potential overarching strategy from ARK Invest. It could point to: A broader re-evaluation of the fintech and crypto sector: Perhaps ARK is becoming more selective within this space, or sees greater opportunities elsewhere. Liquidity needs: Selling positions in these liquid assets could be a way to raise capital for investments in less liquid, high-growth private companies or new public market opportunities. Risk management: Reducing exposure to companies heavily tied to the volatile crypto market could be a defensive play in anticipation of potential market shifts or increased volatility. These simultaneous sales underscore the dynamic nature of ARK Invest’s portfolio management and their willingness to adjust their holdings based on evolving market conditions and their research-driven convictions. What Are the Implications for the Crypto Market and Coinbase Shares? A sale of this magnitude from a prominent institutional investor like ARK Invest inevitably sends signals to the market. For Coinbase shares specifically, a significant divestment by a major holder can create downward pressure on the stock price, at least in the short term. It can also influence investor sentiment, leading some to question the company’s immediate prospects or the broader crypto market’s stability. However, it’s crucial to consider several points: Not a Bearish Signal for Crypto Itself: While ARK sold Coinbase shares , it doesn’t necessarily mean they are bearish on the entire cryptocurrency market. ARK Invest still maintains exposure to crypto through other avenues and investments. Their strategy is more about specific company valuations and portfolio construction than a blanket rejection of digital assets. Market Maturity: The crypto market has matured considerably. While institutional moves like this draw attention, the market is less susceptible to single-event shocks than in its nascent stages. Broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements often play a more significant role. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: For long-term investors in Coinbase shares or the crypto market, short-term institutional sales might be seen as noise. The fundamental growth drivers for Coinbase, such as increasing adoption of digital assets and expanding product offerings, remain relevant. Ultimately, ARK’s sale of Coinbase shares is a data point, not the definitive word on the crypto market’s future. It highlights the active management strategies employed by large funds and the constant re-evaluation of positions in a rapidly evolving sector. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors In a market where institutional actions can create significant ripples, how should individual investors approach their own portfolios, especially concerning Coinbase shares and other crypto-related assets? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not blindly follow institutional moves. While valuable, these sales are specific to ARK’s portfolio strategy and risk appetite. Understand Coinbase’s fundamentals, its competitive landscape, and its growth prospects independently. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on any single stock, even a market leader like Coinbase, carries inherent risks. Diversify your investments across different assets, sectors, and geographies to mitigate potential downturns. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Institutional sales serve as a reminder that even seemingly stable positions can experience significant price movements. Focus on Long-Term Trends: If you believe in the long-term potential of blockchain technology and digital assets, short-term price fluctuations or institutional rebalancing might be less concerning. Focus on the underlying innovation and adoption trends. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, technological advancements, and broader market sentiment. Information is power in navigating volatile markets. Conclusion ARK Invest’s decision to sell $90.58 million worth of Coinbase shares , alongside reducing positions in Robinhood and Block Inc., represents a significant portfolio adjustment by one of the most closely watched investment firms. While this move has certainly drawn attention and sparked debate, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of active fund management, market dynamics, and ARK’s specific investment philosophy. It underscores the importance of continuous evaluation in a fast-paced market and serves as a reminder for investors to conduct their own diligent research and manage their portfolios strategically. The crypto market continues its journey, shaped by both innovation and the strategic maneuvers of key players like ARK Invest. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is ARK Invest and Cathie Wood?

It is known for its focus on disruptive innovation, investing in companies that are at the forefront of technological change across various sectors, including artificial intelligence, robotics, genomics, and blockchain technology. 2. What is Coinbase? Coinbase Global, Inc. is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States by trading volume.

Why did ARK Invest sell a large amount of Coinbase shares? While ARK Invest does not provide specific reasons for every trade, common explanations for such large sales include profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing to manage risk or reallocate capital, concerns over regulatory changes in the crypto space, or a revised valuation perspective on Coinbase shares. 4. How does this sale affect Coinbase’s stock price? A large institutional sale like this can put short-term downward pressure on Coinbase’s stock price due to increased supply in the market and potentially negative investor sentiment. However, the long-term impact depends on broader market conditions, Coinbase’s financial performance, and future regulatory developments. 5. Is ARK Invest’s sale of Coinbase shares a bearish signal for the entire crypto market? Not necessarily. While it’s a significant event for Coinbase’s stock, it doesn’t automatically imply a bearish outlook for the entire crypto market. ARK Invest still maintains other crypto-related investments. Such sales often reflect portfolio management decisions rather than a complete loss of faith in the underlying technology or asset class. Did you find this article insightful?

Among these, the movements of a “whale” – an investor holding a substantial amount of digital assets – are arguably the most captivating. These colossal transactions can send ripples across the market, offering glimpses into the strategies of the biggest players. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a significant WBTC whale making a remarkable move, offloading a massive portion of their holdings and securing an extraordinary profit. What does this mean for the market, and what can we learn from such a calculated maneuver? Unpacking the WBTC Whale’s Epic Sale: What Exactly Happened? Over a concise period of just three days, an anonymous address, identified by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X , executed a strategic sale of 700 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). This substantial offload amounted to a staggering $82.4 million. The scale of this transaction immediately caught the eye of market observers, highlighting the significant influence a single WBTC whale can wield. The history behind this particular whale’s holdings adds another layer of intrigue. This address acquired 1,074 WBTC approximately four years ago, at an average cost of $10,708 per coin. This long-term holding strategy, spanning several market cycles, positioned the whale perfectly for the recent bull run. Let’s look at the numbers: Metric Details Amount Sold 700 WBTC Sale Value $82.4 million Purchase Amount 1,074 WBTC Average Purchase Price $10,708 per WBTC Estimated Profit $74.89 million Remaining Holdings 800 WBTC The estimated profit of $74.89 million from this partial sale is a testament to the power of long-term conviction and timely profit-taking in the crypto market. Even after this significant divestment, the WBTC whale still retains a substantial holding of 800 WBTC, indicating continued confidence or perhaps a strategy to re-enter at lower prices or hold for further appreciation. Understanding WBTC: Why is it Crucial for a WBTC Whale? Before diving deeper into the implications of this transaction, it’s important to understand what WBTC is and why it’s a preferred asset for large holders, including our mystery WBTC whale . WBTC, or Wrapped Bitcoin, is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by Bitcoin. This means that for every WBTC in circulation, there is one Bitcoin held in reserve by a custodian. The primary reason for WBTC’s existence is to bring Bitcoin’s liquidity to the Ethereum blockchain. This allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s vibrant decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which includes lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), without having to sell their Bitcoin. For a large holder, like a WBTC whale , this offers several strategic advantages: Interoperability: It bridges the two largest blockchain ecosystems, allowing Bitcoin to be used in Ethereum-based applications. DeFi Participation: WBTC enables participation in yield farming, liquidity provision, and other DeFi protocols to earn additional returns on Bitcoin holdings. Speed and Cost: Transactions on Ethereum can be faster and sometimes cheaper for certain operations compared to native Bitcoin transactions, especially when interacting with smart contracts. Programmability: As an ERC-20 token, WBTC inherits the programmability of Ethereum, opening up possibilities for complex financial strategies. Therefore, holding WBTC provides the benefits of Bitcoin’s value appreciation combined with the flexibility and utility of the Ethereum network. This dual advantage makes it an attractive asset for large-scale investors looking to maximize their capital efficiency across different blockchain environments. What Motivates a WBTC Whale to Make Such a Move? The decision by a WBTC whale to offload $82.4 million worth of assets is rarely arbitrary. Such moves are typically the result of careful calculation and strategic planning. While we can only speculate on the exact motivations of this particular whale, common reasons for such large-scale sales include: Profit-Taking: As seen in this case, a substantial profit of nearly $75 million is a compelling reason to sell. After a significant price run, whales often de-risk by taking profits, securing gains, and reducing exposure to potential market downturns. Portfolio Rebalancing: Whales often manage diverse portfolios. A sale of WBTC might be part of a broader strategy to rebalance their holdings, perhaps shifting capital into other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or even traditional assets, to optimize risk-reward ratios. Market Sentiment and Outlook: Large investors closely monitor market sentiment, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors. A sale could indicate a belief that the market is nearing a local top, or that a correction is imminent, prompting them to sell before a potential dip. Liquidity Needs: Although less common for such a massive sale without a clear market signal, whales might sell to meet specific liquidity requirements for other investments, operational costs, or personal reasons. Tax Planning: Strategic selling can also be influenced by tax considerations, especially around specific financial periods. The fact that the WBTC whale still holds 800 WBTC suggests a nuanced strategy, not a complete exit. This partial profit-taking allows them to secure substantial gains while retaining significant exposure to the asset’s future potential. The Ripple Effect: How Does a WBTC Whale Transaction Impact the Market? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, especially from a known WBTC whale , it inevitably sends ripples through the broader cryptocurrency market. The impact can be multifaceted, influencing price action, investor sentiment, and even the perception of market stability. Here’s how such a sale can affect the market: Price Volatility: A large sell order, even if executed over three days, can put downward pressure on the price of WBTC and, by extension, Bitcoin. While the market is large, a sudden influx of sell volume can trigger short-term price corrections or increased volatility as other traders react. Investor Sentiment: News of a major WBTC whale selling can sometimes trigger fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among retail investors. They might interpret it as a signal that the market is topping out, leading to panic selling and exacerbating downward price movements. Conversely, if the market absorbs the sell-off without significant price drops, it can signal underlying strength. Liquidity Testing: Such large sales test the market’s liquidity and depth. The fact that $82.4 million in WBTC was absorbed without a catastrophic price collapse speaks to the growing maturity and liquidity of the crypto market, particularly for major assets like Bitcoin and its wrapped derivatives. On-Chain Metrics: Analysts constantly monitor whale movements as a key on-chain metric. A series of whale sales might indicate a bearish trend, while accumulation could signal a bullish outlook. This particular WBTC whale sale will undoubtedly be factored into future market analyses. It’s important for investors not to overreact to single whale movements. While significant, the broader market context, including macroeconomic factors, institutional adoption, and technological developments, often plays a more defining role in long-term price trends. Lessons from the WBTC Whale: Actionable Insights for Every Investor The recent actions of this WBTC whale offer valuable insights that retail investors can consider when navigating the volatile crypto landscape. While most of us don’t operate with millions of dollars in capital, the principles behind successful large-scale investing can be adapted. Here are some actionable takeaways: The Power of Long-Term Holding (HODLing): The whale bought WBTC four years ago. This long-term perspective allowed them to ride out market fluctuations and capitalize on significant price appreciation. Patience and conviction in an asset’s long-term value can yield substantial returns. Strategic Profit-Taking: Even with a long-term view, securing profits at opportune times is crucial. The whale didn’t sell all their holdings but took a significant portion off the table. This partial profit-taking strategy reduces risk while allowing continued participation in potential upside. Understanding Market Cycles: Whales often buy during bear markets (when prices are low and sentiment is negative) and sell into strength during bull markets. Learning to identify and understand market cycles can inform better entry and exit points. Importance of On-Chain Analysis: While complex, understanding basic on-chain metrics or following reputable on-chain analysts can provide early signals of significant movements. Tools that track large transactions can be invaluable for gaining market intelligence. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Even whales manage risk by diversifying and taking profits. For retail investors, this means setting stop-losses, diversifying portfolios, and not succumbing to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or FUD. By observing the strategies employed by a sophisticated WBTC whale , investors can refine their own approaches, moving beyond speculative trading to more calculated, long-term investment strategies. The recent $82.4 million sale by a prominent WBTC whale is more than just a large transaction; it’s a fascinating case study in strategic cryptocurrency investing. It underscores the immense wealth that can be generated through long-term conviction and timely profit-taking in the crypto market. As on-chain analysis continues to shed light on these powerful movements, investors gain unprecedented transparency into the actions of the market’s biggest players. While we may not all be whales, understanding their strategies provides invaluable lessons for navigating the complex yet rewarding world of digital assets. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the potential for monumental gains, and the calculated decisions required to secure them. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Whales and WBTC 1. What is a cryptocurrency whale? A cryptocurrency whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price. The term “whale” implies significant market power. 2. What is WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)? WBTC, or Wrapped Bitcoin, is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin. It allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem while retaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price. 3. How do on-chain analysts track whale movements? On-chain analysts use specialized tools and software to monitor public blockchain data. They track large transactions, identify addresses with significant holdings, and analyze patterns of buying and selling to infer the strategies and potential impact of large investors like a WBTC whale . 4. Does a WBTC whale selling always lead to a market crash? Not necessarily. While a large sale can create downward pressure and increase volatility in the short term, the overall market’s liquidity and prevailing sentiment play a crucial role. A single whale sale doesn’t automatically trigger a crash, especially if the market is robust and liquid enough to absorb the selling pressure. 5. What is the significance of the whale still holding 800 WBTC? The fact that the WBTC whale still holds 800 WBTC (worth over $90 million at current prices) suggests a strategic approach rather than a complete exit. It indicates that they are taking partial profits while maintaining significant exposure, possibly anticipating further upside, or planning to re-enter at a later stage.

Dogecoin is pushing into new territory with 5x forecasts, But while the headlines are loud, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one quietly setting up for what may become the biggest altcoin breakout of the cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 2025 Sleeper Altcoin Awakens MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the center of gravity for every alpha group hunting breakout returns. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a politically charged, community-powered asset that’s positioned to lead the next leg of the altcoin cycle. At the heart of its design is a hard-capped 170 billion token supply, a zero-tax structure for frictionless trading, and full smart contract audits from HashEx and CertiK—giving it the kind of trust signals most early-stage tokens lack. But what truly separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from the pack is its ideological clarity. It’s not just a token, it’s a statement—built for decentralized ownership, cultural relevance, and long-term resilience. Momentum metrics are flashing across the board: Daily presale inflows have broken all-time highs for the third week running Telegram member growth has doubled in 10 days, fueled by presale trackers and community campaigns Over 5,000 unique wallets have secured early positions, including several six-figure entries flagged by on-chain tracking tools Cross-wallet compatibility with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet is already live, boosting accessibility for early adopters Beyond the numbers, it’s the narrative that’s creating lift. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now one of the most watched tokens across alpha Telegram groups and presale aggregators, regularly appearing in weekly “Top Rotation” lists and insider prediction chats. Several notable influencers in the DeFi and memecoin space have already hinted at coverage as the next phase unfolds. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Classic Comeback Bet After a volatile July run, Dogecoin is holding firm around the $0.24 mark, with technicals showing a bullish double bottom pattern forming. Analysts say a confirmed breakout above $0.25 could catapult DOGE to $0.48 and even $1 by year-end—up to 5x from current levels. On-chain activity supports the thesis. Whale wallets are accumulating, open interest is rising, and retail sentiment is heating up thanks to renewed attention around crypto-friendly U.S. legislation. Dogecoin isn’t just riding hype—it’s reclaiming relevance in the memecoin narrative. Still, DOGE is a mature asset. Its upside is more conservative than it once was, and many traders are now rotating toward younger projects with more explosive risk-reward profiles. Conclusion Dogecoin may have more fuel in the tank. TRX and SEI are cycling into fresh momentum with corporate headlines and token economics to match. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is a different kind of move—one built on timing, structure, and rising conviction. If this market cycle is about narrative meets numbers, MAGACOIN is the altcoin to watch. The presale window remains open—but not for long.

The dip follows a sustained upward trend that has seen significant interest from both institutional and retail participants in recent months. The current pause in momentum may suggest a temporary rebalancing, with market participants potentially reassessing their positions. As price movement stabilizes, on-chain analysts have begun to highlight deeper structural shifts within Bitcoin’s blockchain activity. According to CryptoQuant contributor Avocado onchain, one key trend gaining attention is the continued decline in Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) count. While at first glance this might seem related to falling transaction volumes, the underlying cause points to a more strategic restructuring by institutional participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Metrics Flash Mixed Signals: Monthly Inflows Rise And Daily Outflows Start Slowing Institutional Consolidation Reshaping On-Chain Structure Avocado explained that since December 2024, Bitcoin’s UTXO count has steadily decreased, a development he attributes to growing over-the-counter (OTC) activity and consolidation efforts by large holders. These entities, primarily whales and institutional investors, are reportedly merging multiple UTXOs into fewer addresses, a process that increases on-chain efficiency and reflects a preference for long-term custody. “The post-ETF approval environment has driven more assets into secure wallets, moving funds off exchanges into institutional-grade custody,” he wrote. This structural shift suggests that long-term holders are preparing for extended exposure rather than immediate market participation. Instead of dispersing funds for frequent trades, these institutions are consolidating their Bitcoin holdings into larger ones, indicating reduced near-term liquidity but possibly greater long-term market stability. The impact is visible in the on-chain footprint, where the number of active UTXOs has not kept pace with prior bull cycles. Bitcoin Muted Retail Activity and Future Market Signals While institutional activity appears to be solidifying, retail investor behavior remains subdued. Avocado noted that, unlike previous cycles where retail-driven volume increases contributed to UTXO growth, the current rally lacks that widespread grassroots engagement. The number of newly created UTXOs has remained relatively flat, reinforcing the view that retail participation is yet to catch up. Looking ahead, the analyst suggests that any renewed wave of short-term speculation, often sparked by sharp price movements, could reignite retail interest. This would be reflected in increased UTXO creation, exchange activity, and possibly greater volatility. Until then, the market appears to be led primarily by long-term strategic accumulation. Related Reading: The Final Bitcoin Act: Here’s What To Expect As BTC Trends Sideways Despite the current slowdown in price, underlying metrics remain constructive. Exchange inflows are moderate, long-term holders continue to accumulate, and institutional capital flows persist. These factors suggest that the market is still in a consolidative phase, rather than signaling a reversal. Should retail participation return and on-chain activity broaden, Bitcoin could see renewed upside supported by both foundational demand and speculative inflows.

After an impressive 13-day streak of consistent inflows, these investment vehicles recorded a notable $131.35 million in net outflows on July 21. This abrupt reversal has naturally piqued the interest of investors and analysts, prompting questions about the underlying reasons and potential implications for the broader digital asset landscape. Let’s dive deeper into what transpired and what this surprising turn of events could mean for the future of Bitcoin ETFs . What Just Happened with Bitcoin ETFs? A Closer Look at the Outflows On July 21, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced a considerable shift from its recent positive momentum. Data shared by crypto market observer Trader T on X indicated a net outflow of $131.35 million, marking the end of a robust 13-day period during which these ETFs consistently attracted fresh capital. This signals a pause in the growing institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. The outflows were not evenly distributed. Several prominent funds bore the brunt of this reversal. ARK Invest’s ARKB led with a substantial $77.46 million departure. Grayscale’s GBTC followed with $36.75 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC also experienced outflows totaling $12.75 million, while VanEck’s HODL and Bitwise’s BITB registered smaller, yet notable, outflows of $2.48 million and $1.91 million respectively. The remaining ETFs reported no change, indicating concentrated activity among a few key players. Here’s a breakdown of the net outflows by specific U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 21: ETF Ticker Issuing Firm Net Outflow (USD) ARKB ARK Invest $77.46 million GBTC Grayscale $36.75 million FBTC Fidelity $12.75 million HODL VanEck $2.48 million BITB Bitwise $1.91 million Other Bitcoin ETFs Various $0.00 million This data highlights a critical moment for Bitcoin ETFs , signifying a break in the positive sentiment that characterized their performance over recent weeks. Understanding the potential reasons behind this shift is crucial for monitoring the digital asset investment space. Why Did Bitcoin ETFs See Outflows? Unpacking the Drivers Behind the Shift The sudden halt in inflows and subsequent outflows for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs can be attributed to several factors, reflecting the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While a single definitive cause is often elusive, potential drivers include: Profit-Taking and Rebalancing: After a strong period of inflows and potentially rising Bitcoin prices, some investors may have opted to take profits. Institutional investors frequently rebalance portfolios to manage risk. Broader Market Sentiment: The crypto market is influenced by macroeconomic indicators. Economic slowdown, interest rate shifts, or inflation concerns could prompt investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets, including digital currencies and their investment products. Bitcoin Price Action: The underlying asset’s performance directly influences ETF flows. A dip in Bitcoin’s price could trigger redemptions as investors react to perceived weakness. Anticipation of Future Events: Investors might be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated market events, such as upcoming economic data releases or central bank meetings. Such anticipatory moves can lead to temporary capital shifts. It’s important to remember that a single day’s data, while significant, does not necessarily define a long-term trend. However, it does provide a snapshot of investor behavior and market dynamics. The Broader Context: A Look at Bitcoin ETFs’ Journey So Far The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Approved by the SEC earlier this year after years of anticipation, these funds were hailed as a significant step towards mainstream adoption and institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. They offer a regulated, accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without direct ownership. Since their launch, these Bitcoin ETFs have largely seen impressive performance, attracting billions in inflows and contributing to renewed optimism. Their success has been viewed as a validation of Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy. The 13-day inflow streak preceding July 21’s outflows was a testament to this sustained interest, with many analysts pointing to ETFs as a key driver of recent market momentum. The current outflow, while a momentary pause, should be viewed within this broader context of significant growth and increasing maturity for the Bitcoin ETF market. Navigating the Volatility: What This Means for Bitcoin ETFs and Investors The recent $131.35 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs naturally raises questions about its implications. While a departure from the recent trend, it’s crucial for investors to consider several perspectives: Market Maturation: The ebb and flow of capital are normal in mature financial markets. As Bitcoin ETFs integrate, they will experience both inflows and outflows, signifying market maturation. Impact on Bitcoin Price: Significant ETF outflows can put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, as issuers may sell underlying Bitcoin. However, this particular outflow might not trigger a prolonged downturn if broader demand remains robust. Investor Sentiment Shift: A streak of outflows can impact confidence, prompting a more cautious approach. Conversely, resilient performance afterward could reinforce long-term confidence in Bitcoin ETFs . Opportunity for Re-entry: For some, a dip triggered by outflows could be a buying opportunity, aligning with a “buy the dip” strategy. Importance of Diversification: This event underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio. Relying solely on a single, volatile asset class like cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks. Ultimately, a single day’s outflow, while ending an impressive streak, is part of the dynamic nature of financial markets. The long-term trajectory of Bitcoin ETFs depends on sustained institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and Bitcoin’s continued adoption. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin ETF Enthusiasts For those navigating the exciting yet volatile world of Bitcoin ETFs , here are actionable insights: Stay Informed, Beyond the Headlines: Look at broader trends over weeks and months, not just daily data. Follow reputable financial news, analyze on-chain data, and heed expert analysis. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin ETFs are volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Assess your risk tolerance and align your strategy accordingly. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Perspective: Short-term trading in volatile assets is risky. A long-term perspective helps weather temporary downturns and benefits from potential significant growth. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly into Bitcoin ETFs , regardless of price. This mitigates volatility and averages out purchase price over time. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin ETFs offer unique exposure, they should be part of a broader, diversified portfolio including traditional assets. This helps spread risk. Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Global economic health, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitics influence risk assets like Bitcoin. Keeping an eye on these provides valuable context. By adopting a well-informed, disciplined, and strategic approach, investors can better position themselves in the evolving landscape of Bitcoin ETFs . Conclusion: A Temporary Blip or a Shifting Tide for Bitcoin ETFs? The $131.35 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 21 undeniably marked a significant moment, ending a remarkable 13-day inflow streak and highlighting the crypto market’s inherent volatility. While individual funds like ARKB and GBTC saw considerable redemptions, this event is part of the dynamic and maturing journey of these groundbreaking investment products. Periods of profit-taking and market rebalancing are natural. This outflow could be a temporary blip driven by short-term sentiment or institutional maneuvers, or it could signal a more cautious approach. Regardless, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin ETFs remains tied to Bitcoin’s fundamental value, increasing adoption, and evolving regulatory landscape. As the market matures, such fluctuations will likely become commonplace, underscoring the importance of informed analysis and a strategic investment approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF? A1: A U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF holds actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without direct ownership. It provides a regulated and accessible investment method. Q2: Why are net outflows from Bitcoin ETFs significant? A2: Net outflows mean more money is being withdrawn than invested, signaling decreased demand or a sentiment shift. This can lead to the ETF issuer selling underlying Bitcoin to meet redemptions, potentially putting downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Q3: Which Bitcoin ETFs were most affected by the outflows on July 21? A3: On July 21, ARK Invest’s ARKB led with $77.46 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC ($36.75 million), Fidelity’s FBTC ($12.75 million), VanEck’s HODL ($2.48 million), and Bitwise’s BITB ($1.91 million). Q4: Does this single day of outflows mean Bitcoin ETFs are a bad investment? A4: Not necessarily. A single day’s data doesn’t define a long-term trend. Financial markets, especially nascent ones, experience natural ebbs and flows. It could be due to profit-taking or market rebalancing. Investors should consider long-term trends and their risk tolerance. Thank you for reading this comprehensive analysis of the recent U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF outflows.

One such significant development is unfolding in South Korea, where leading crypto venture capital firm Hashed is making a decisive move to become the largest shareholder of Korea Digital Asset (KODA), a prominent local digital asset custodian. This isn’t just a simple investment; it’s a powerful statement that could reshape the landscape of digital asset security and institutional trust in the region. For anyone tracking the evolution of crypto infrastructure, the strategic alignment of Hashed KODA presents a fascinating case study in market consolidation and future vision. Why is Hashed KODA ‘s Strategic Move So Important? The news, initially reported by Etoday, highlights a crucial pivot for both Hashed and KODA. At the ‘Solana Media Day’ held on July 21st, KODA CEO Jinseok Cho revealed that Hashed is on track to secure the leading ownership stake by the end of the month. This isn’t a sudden decision but the culmination of a strategic process where Hashed converted existing loans and accrued interest into equity, with plans to potentially acquire additional shares to gain majority control. But why is this particular partnership, Hashed KODA , generating so much buzz? Understanding the Players: Hashed and KODA Hashed: As one of South Korea’s most influential crypto venture capital firms, Hashed has a long track record of identifying and nurturing promising blockchain projects. Their portfolio includes some of the biggest names in the crypto space, demonstrating their deep understanding of market trends and technological innovation. Their expertise extends beyond mere investment; they are often active participants in the ecosystems they support, providing strategic guidance and leveraging their vast network. KODA (Korea Digital Asset): KODA stands as a cornerstone in South Korea’s digital asset ecosystem, specializing in secure custody solutions. In an industry where security is paramount, custodians like KODA play a vital role in protecting digital assets for institutions and high-net-worth individuals. They provide the infrastructure that enables safe storage, management, and transfer of cryptocurrencies, addressing critical concerns around hacks, theft, and regulatory compliance. KODA’s reputation for robust security protocols and adherence to local regulations makes it a trusted entity in the space. The convergence of Hashed’s investment prowess and KODA’s custodial expertise through the Hashed KODA partnership creates a formidable entity poised to drive significant advancements in the Korean digital asset market. How Will Hashed KODA ‘s Increased Stake Impact the Market? This strategic investment by Hashed into KODA is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a vote of confidence in the future of secure digital asset management and a potential catalyst for broader institutional adoption in South Korea. Let’s delve into the anticipated impacts: Benefits of the Hashed KODA Partnership: Enhanced Security and Trust: With Hashed’s backing, KODA can further invest in cutting-edge security infrastructure, talent, and compliance frameworks. This strengthens trust among institutional clients, who demand the highest levels of security and regulatory adherence for their digital asset holdings. Accelerated Innovation: Hashed’s deep understanding of emerging blockchain technologies and market trends can guide KODA in developing new, innovative custody solutions that cater to evolving market needs, such as DeFi integration, NFT custody, or tokenized securities. Increased Institutional Flow: A more robust and well-funded custodian like KODA, backed by a prominent VC firm like Hashed, makes the Korean market more attractive to traditional financial institutions looking to enter the digital asset space. This could unlock significant capital flow. Market Consolidation and Leadership: Hashed becoming the largest shareholder positions KODA as a dominant player in the Korean custody market, potentially leading to greater market share and setting industry standards. Regulatory Compliance Focus: Both Hashed and KODA operate within a tightly regulated environment. This partnership can streamline efforts to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, ensuring compliant and secure services for clients. Potential Challenges for Hashed KODA : While the outlook is largely positive, no significant market move comes without its challenges: Integration Complexity: Merging the strategic vision of a VC firm with the operational realities of a custody provider can present integration challenges, requiring careful alignment of goals and processes. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased market dominance often comes with heightened regulatory attention. Hashed KODA will need to continuously adapt to evolving compliance requirements. Competitive Landscape: While KODA is strong, the custody market is competitive globally. They will need to maintain their edge against both local and international players. Despite these challenges, the strategic advantages offered by the Hashed KODA collaboration appear to significantly outweigh the potential hurdles, setting the stage for substantial growth. What Does This Hashed KODA Development Mean for Institutional Adoption? The journey towards mainstream institutional adoption of digital assets heavily relies on the availability of secure, compliant, and reliable infrastructure. Custody solutions are at the very core of this infrastructure. When a respected venture capital firm like Hashed takes a controlling interest in a leading custodian like KODA, it sends a powerful signal to the traditional finance world. Imagine a large institutional investor, perhaps a pension fund or an asset manager, looking to allocate a portion of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. Their primary concerns will be security, regulatory clarity, and the ability to safely manage these volatile assets. A robust and well-capitalized custodian, backed by a reputable firm with deep industry ties, directly addresses these concerns. The Hashed KODA deal enhances the perceived trustworthiness and operational excellence of digital asset custody in South Korea.

A recent announcement from Binance, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, has brought a temporary halt to a specific operation: the BNB Smart Chain withdrawal . While such news might initially raise questions, understanding the ‘why’ behind these actions is key to navigating the crypto landscape confidently. This temporary suspension is a routine yet crucial step in maintaining the health and security of a vital blockchain network. Understanding the BNB Smart Chain Withdrawal: What’s Happening? Binance has officially communicated its plan to temporarily suspend token withdrawals on the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20). This isn’t an unexpected event; rather, it’s a scheduled measure in support of essential wallet maintenance for the BNB Smart Chain. Let’s break down the core details: When: The suspension is set to begin at 03:00 UTC on July 23. Duration: It’s a brief pause, estimated to last approximately half an hour. What’s Affected: Specifically, token withdrawals on the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20). Other network operations, such as deposits and trading, are typically unaffected during such short maintenance windows, though users should always verify the latest information from Binance. Why: The primary reason cited is ‘wallet maintenance’ for the BNB Smart Chain. For many crypto users, particularly those who frequently transact on Binance and the BNB Smart Chain, this short window requires attention. It highlights the dynamic nature of blockchain infrastructure and the continuous efforts required to keep it robust and secure. Why is Binance Suspending BNB Smart Chain Withdrawal? The Imperative of Wallet Maintenance You might wonder why a temporary BNB Smart Chain withdrawal suspension is necessary. Think of a blockchain network like a sophisticated digital city. Just as a city requires regular maintenance of its infrastructure – roads, power grids, water systems – a blockchain needs constant care to ensure its smooth operation, security, and efficiency. Wallet maintenance is a critical component of this upkeep. The Pillars of Blockchain Maintenance: Security Enhancements: Wallets, especially those managing vast amounts of user funds on an exchange like Binance, are prime targets for malicious actors. Regular maintenance allows for the implementation of the latest security patches, strengthening defenses against potential vulnerabilities and cyber threats. This proactive approach safeguards user assets. Performance Optimization: Over time, blockchain networks can experience congestion or inefficiencies. Maintenance periods are used to optimize wallet performance, ensuring faster transaction processing, smoother user experiences, and overall network health. This can involve database cleanups, indexing improvements, or infrastructure upgrades. Feature Upgrades and Compatibility: As blockchain technology evolves, new features are introduced, and existing ones are refined. Wallet maintenance often includes updates to ensure compatibility with new network protocols, integration of new token standards, or preparation for future network upgrades. This keeps the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem modern and competitive. System Stability: Just like any complex software system, blockchain wallets can accumulate minor bugs or inconsistencies. Scheduled maintenance provides an opportunity to address these issues in a controlled environment, preventing potential disruptions or outages in the future. It’s about ensuring long-term reliability. Binance’s decision to pause BNB Smart Chain withdrawal is a testament to its commitment to providing a secure and reliable trading environment. It demonstrates a proactive stance on network health, which ultimately benefits all users of the platform and the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. What Does the BNB Smart Chain Withdrawal Mean for You? Navigating the Brief Pause For users, a temporary BNB Smart Chain withdrawal suspension, even for a short 30-minute window, can prompt questions about immediate access to funds. It’s important to understand the practical implications: During the Suspension Period: No BEP20 Withdrawals: You will not be able to initiate withdrawals of tokens on the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20) from your Binance account during the specified 30-minute window. Attempts to do so will likely result in an error message or a temporary hold on the transaction. Deposits and Trading: Typically, such maintenance windows primarily affect withdrawals. Deposits of BEP20 tokens to Binance and trading activities on the exchange usually remain operational. However, it is always advisable to check Binance’s official announcements for any specific caveats. Impact on Other Networks: This suspension is specific to the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20). Withdrawals on other blockchain networks supported by Binance (e.g., ERC-20, TRC-20, etc.) should remain unaffected. Preparing for and Responding to Such Events: While 30 minutes is a very short period, developing good habits around network maintenance can save you hassle in the future, especially for longer suspensions. Action Point Description Stay Informed Always refer to Binance’s official announcements page or their social media channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding network maintenance and service suspensions. Plan Ahead If you anticipate needing to make a BNB Smart Chain withdrawal around the announced time, consider completing it well in advance of the scheduled maintenance. Exercise Patience For short maintenance periods like this, the best course of action is often to simply wait. Services are restored promptly once maintenance is complete. Understanding these aspects ensures that users can manage their expectations and plan their crypto activities efficiently, minimizing any potential inconvenience caused by necessary system upgrades. Beyond the BNB Smart Chain Withdrawal: The Bigger Picture of Blockchain Maintenance The temporary BNB Smart Chain withdrawal pause is a microcosm of a larger, ongoing process in the blockchain world: continuous maintenance and evolution. Unlike traditional banking systems that might have fixed operating hours, blockchain networks are designed to be always-on. However, this ‘always-on’ nature doesn’t mean they are immune to the need for upgrades, security patches, and performance tuning. Consider the analogy of a modern operating system or a popular mobile application. Developers regularly release updates to fix bugs, introduce new features, and enhance security. Blockchain networks, including the BNB Smart Chain, operate on a similar principle. These maintenance windows, though sometimes inconvenient, are vital for: Ensuring Long-Term Viability: Regular maintenance prevents the accumulation of technical debt, which could lead to more significant problems down the line. It ensures the network remains competitive and relevant in a rapidly changing technological landscape. Strengthening the Ecosystem: A well-maintained blockchain fosters trust among its users and developers. It signals that the network operators are committed to its stability and security, encouraging more projects and users to build upon and utilize the BNB Smart Chain. Protecting Against Evolving Threats: The digital threat landscape is constantly evolving. What was secure yesterday might have vulnerabilities today. Maintenance allows for the implementation of cutting-edge security measures to protect against new forms of attacks. This commitment to maintenance is a positive indicator of the health and future prospects of the BNB Smart Chain. It reflects a mature approach to managing complex decentralized systems, prioritizing user safety and network integrity above all else. Navigating Future BNB Smart Chain Withdrawal Events: Best Practices While the recent BNB Smart Chain withdrawal suspension was brief, similar events, perhaps longer or for different reasons, may occur in the future across various blockchain networks. Adopting a few best practices can help you navigate these situations with ease and confidence. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users: Subscribe to Official Announcements: Make it a habit to follow official communication channels of your primary exchanges (like Binance) and the blockchain networks you use (like BNB Smart Chain). This includes their official websites, blogs, and verified social media accounts. Diversify Your Holdings (Where Appropriate): While not directly related to a short suspension, understanding different networks and their functionalities can be beneficial. If you frequently need to move funds, being aware of alternative networks for specific tokens can provide flexibility. Understand Network Fees and Congestion: Maintenance can sometimes be a precursor to network upgrades that might affect transaction fees or speed. Stay informed about the general state of the network. Practice Self-Custody (When Ready): For long-term holdings, consider moving assets to a hardware wallet. While this doesn’t bypass network suspensions on exchanges, it gives you full control over your private keys and assets, independent of exchange maintenance schedules. Verify Information: In the crypto space, misinformation spreads quickly. Always cross-reference any news about suspensions or issues with official sources before taking any action or panicking. By staying proactive and informed, users can minimize the impact of scheduled maintenance events, ensuring a smoother and more secure experience within the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. The brief pause for BNB Smart Chain withdrawal is a small, necessary step towards a more robust and reliable future for the network. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for a Stronger Future The temporary suspension of BNB Smart Chain withdrawal on Binance, scheduled for July 23, is a clear example of proactive blockchain management. Far from being a cause for concern, this brief 30-minute pause for wallet maintenance is a vital step towards enhancing the security, efficiency, and overall reliability of the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. It underscores Binance’s commitment to providing a robust platform for its users. For crypto enthusiasts and traders, such events serve as a reminder of the continuous effort behind the scenes to keep decentralized networks running smoothly. By staying informed through official channels, understanding the reasons behind these maintenance periods, and planning accordingly, users can navigate the evolving crypto landscape with greater confidence. This brief interruption is a small investment in the long-term health and stability of the BNB Smart Chain, ultimately benefiting everyone who utilizes this popular blockchain network.

In 2025, people are moving past hype and turning to coins with actual traction, real updates, and clear use cases. It is not about the loudest name; it is about the strongest proof. This list spotlights four contenders making serious progress. BlockDAG (BDAG) leads with $346 million presale and zero-vesting access. SUI is climbing with institutional support. Arbitrum is generating organic revenue through Timeboost, while Avalanche has secured a high-profile FIFA partnership. Whether you are focused on adoption, utility, or long-term growth, these picks for top cryptos of 2025 reflect where the smart money is heading. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Powers Ahead with Speed, Sports Deals, and 3,025% ROI Potential BlockDAG is quickly setting the pace for projects labeled as top cryptos for 2025. With $346 million raised and 24 billion coins sold, the presale has attracted massive attention. The coin is still priced at $0.0016 during its GLOBAL LAUNCH release , while the confirmed listing price is set at $0.05, creating a 3,025% upside window for early buyers. The technology behind BlockDAG is built for scale, operating on a custom DAG-based architecture that supports over 15,000 transactions per second. Security audits are complete, with both CertiK and Halborn giving their approval. In terms of exposure, BlockDAG has partnered with U.S. sports teams like the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves, bringing Web3 visibility into real-world stadiums. The presale offers more than just access. Its daily “Buyer Battles” unlock 50 million BDAG coins, and any unsold coins go to the top buyer of the day. With 20 exchanges already lined up, including MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, and more, BlockDAG is not only presale-ready, it is launch-ready. 2. SUI: Builds Developer Momentum with $2.3B Locked In SUI is gaining recognition as one of the top cryptos for 2025, backed by $2.326 billion in Total Value Locked and a growing developer ecosystem. Supported by major validators and a partnership with Google Cloud, SUI is quietly becoming a go-to choice for serious Web3 builders looking for reliable infrastructure. Recently breaking past the $4.00 mark, SUI’s price is showing consistent strength. Analysts are now watching for a potential move toward $5.00 as capital continues flowing into the network. With no slowdown in sight, experienced traders appear to see lasting value in SUI’s real-world traction and ongoing expansion. 3. Arbitrum (ARB): Shows Strength with $2M in Fees and $1.3B Treasury Arbitrum is emerging as one of the top cryptos for 2025 thanks to its strong fundamentals and fee-generating capabilities. Since April, its Timeboost feature has brought in $2 million in transaction fees, and it now supports one-third of all DEX activity on the network, showing that its Layer 2 infrastructure is being used at scale. Technically, ARB rebounded from the $0.414 level and is now approaching $0.460. If it breaks through that resistance, the next major target could be $1.60. With a DAO treasury worth $1.3 billion, Arbitrum continues to show both financial strength and technical potential. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Gains FIFA Partnership and Eyes Price Breakout Avalanche has secured a major boost by becoming the new blockchain for FIFA+ Collectibles, replacing Algorand in a move that expands its real-world visibility. This shift positions AVAX as one of the top cryptos for 2025, especially as it taps into FIFA’s massive global audience and long-term brand relevance. Beyond partnerships, Avalanche’s recent “9000” subnet upgrade offers greater flexibility for developers building scalable applications. The price has cleared $22.30 and is now testing the $23.15 resistance. A solid move above this point could send AVAX toward $25.60, opening the door to even stronger momentum. Looking Forward Choosing altcoins today means looking beyond hype and into real performance. SUI’s rising TVL and partnership with Google Cloud give it serious credibility. Arbitrum is generating actual fee-based revenue through Timeboost, and Avalanche is gaining global visibility through its FIFA integration. Still, BlockDAG stands a step ahead. With a working testnet, rapid transaction speeds, sports partnerships, and 20 confirmed exchange listings, it brings real momentum. The limited-time NO VESTING PASS adds another edge, giving buyers full access on launch day. With $346 million raised and a $0.0016 entry price, BlockDAG is setting the pace among the top cryptos coins for 2025.

Whale wallets, retail traders, and even institutional desks are now looking for the right tokens for the biggest upside of the alt season. While many names have been floated, on-chain trends show investors across all categories have quietly converged on four altcoins that pair strong technical setups with clear, narrative-driven catalysts. At the top of that list sits MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA)—a political meme phenomenon analysts believe will have cycle-leading returns. Below, we examine the top four coins identified as the best conviction plays for the future. Early-Stage Momentum Meets Viral Narrative in MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in investors’ interest over the past few weeks, with presale tranches selling out in hours, pushing total early allocations past $40 million as community buzz hit new highs. The meme-powered altcoins are on the watch list of several investors for different reasons. While retail traders see a low barrier to entry due to presale prices in cents, institutional investors recognize its strong fundamentals as a sign of its staying power. With smart contracts that meet institutional security standards and a limited supply of 170 billion tokens to prevent inflation, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an attractive option for smart money to allocate capital for massive returns. Recent forecasts peg a potential 74x ROI by end-2026. On-chain trackers show multi-million-dollar inflows from Ethereum and Bitcoin “smart wallets,” a pattern that historically precedes parabolic runs in early-stage tokens. Interestingly, the political narrative behind the token serves as a magnet for viral network effects, ensuring its relevance and timelessness. As market observers note, MAGA combines the FOMO energy of early Dogecoin with a laser-focused message that keeps social velocity and liquidity rising. Telegram’s massive user base propelling Toncoin (TON) Toncoin enjoys something that most competitors do not have – direct integration with Telegram’s over 1 billion users. This continues to be a major driving force even as recent upgrades look poised to further reduce friction and boost retail adoption. Consensus forecasts cluster between $3.6 and $6.8 for July 2025, with bullish scenarios stretching toward $19 if network upgrades land on schedule. Despite the regulatory noise around Telegram due to its legal troubles in 2024, whales continue to accumulate TON, showing a vote of confidence in the long-term thesis. The Quiet Giant of Cross-Border Finance is Stellar (XLM) Cross-border transactions remain a major use case that several crypto projects continue to explore, but Stellar XLM has already established itself as a leader. With partners such as Visa, PayPal, and MoneyGram, Stellar has supercharged real-world utility, driving a 96% surge in XLM value in 30 days. On a technical front, XLM has already broken through its multi-year resistance at nearly $0.28, with a clean breakout at $0.50. It now looks set for further gains with forward catalysts such as the Soroban smart-contract rollout and adding a former PayPal executive to its team. Privacy demands continue to drive up Monero (XMR) Monero (XMR) has been in regulators’ cross-hairs for years as the clampdown on privacy coins. However, that has not stopped its upward trajectory even when other altcoins struggled. Continual protocol upgrades keep XMR the benchmark for on-chain privacy, a feature in renewed demand amid tightening KYC rules. With the token up 72% this year, credible models point to $332–$548 by December 2025, with blue-sky scenarios above $700 should privacy sentiment strengthen. Takeaway: Windows Like This Don’t Stay Open Forever The common thread across these four plays is early positioning. TON and XLM marry real-world adoption with strong technology, while Monero stands ready to rally as privacy demand spikes. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for the asymmetric upside of a fresh narrative. Whales are quietly rotating capital into these projects as the altcoin season continues to heat up.

With Ethereum ETFs kicking off a fresh wave of institutional interest, and other major altcoins next in line for ETF approvals, the market is showing signs of entering a new altcoin season. Here’s a list of altcoins to buy now for impressive gains: Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin is forming a classic “W” bottom pattern on its charts, a technical signal that often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Analysts believe LTC could rise 30% or more, targeting levels near $130. This makes Litecoin one of the strongest large-cap altcoins to consider in the short term. Solana (SOL) Solana has already pumped close to $190 and still shows a strong bullish trend. With rumors of a Solana ETF and its growing DeFi ecosystem, SOL could continue to rally toward new highs. $200+ is within reach if market sentiment holds. Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE is bouncing off a key long-term support line and is also forming a W-shaped recovery pattern. While it hasn’t broken out yet, it’s catching up. As the most well-known memecoin with real community backing, Dogecoin has serious upside potential, especially if Elon Musk or other major voices weigh in again. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is also showing a bullish reversal pattern and is close to breaking out of its neckline resistance. If the ETF narrative strengthens, ADA could be one of the top altcoins to benefit from a second wave of institutional demand. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, which is building aggressively in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization space, has been gaining attention. It’s forming a bullish pattern and is targeting $50, up from current levels in the low $30s. With strong development activity, AVAX could surprise the market. Sui (SUI) Sui is a newer altcoin showing signs of breaking out from a large bullish pennant, a technical chart formation that typically precedes a strong upward move. While still under the radar, Sui has a fast-growing ecosystem and could become one of the top gainers if altcoin momentum continues. Ripple (XRP) XRP remains as a solid contender, especially if the Ripple vs. SEC case concludes soon. A possible XRP ETF and regulatory clarity could push this coin back toward its all-time highs.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|LTC|SOL|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-22 03:01:00

CARV , the Web3 infrastructure stack known for its decentralized identity and verifiable data layers, is doubling down on this vision with the recent launch of its new roadmap , signaling a shift from data infrastructure to full-stack agent ecosystems. The goal? To create a biosphere where AI is not merely an assistant, but a digital species able to participate with full independence. In alignment with this transformative roadmap, CARV has teamed up with Fair3 to co-host the Tech Fairness Hackathon , now entering its voting phase with over 683 participants . With $50,000 prize pool, the hackathon challenges builders to create AI applications that leverage CARV’s infrastructure, including the CARV SVM Chain , D.A.T.A. Framework , and ERC-7231 -based Agent ID system . These components provide the digital organs AI Beings need: verifiable identity, consent-based data, real-time execution, and on-chain incentives. The hackathon is not a side quest; it’s a proving ground for the agent economies that CARV envisions. At the core of this initiative is the belief that intelligence must evolve from passive tooling into active agency. Today, most AI implementations serve at the command of users, generating text, answering queries, or optimizing recommendations. But what happens when AI earns income, governs its own upgrades, or negotiates with other agents? That’s the future CARV is designing for, and it’s already in motion. This future also ties directly into macro developments. President Donald Trump introduced and signed the GENIUS Act (Government Encouraging New Ideas to Understand Superintelligence Act) , a sweeping U.S. initiative that frames AI as a national security priority. The proposed legislation calls for massive federal investment into foundational AI research, ethical frameworks, and a push to ensure American leadership in superintelligence. The act reflects what many in Web3 already see: AI is no longer a feature, it is becoming the next layer of governance in digital life. But if the GENIUS Act represents the top-down, state-led approach to shaping AI’s future, CARV stands for the bottom-up counterforce : decentralized, user-sovereign, programmable intelligence that no single entity can control. Where governments aim to regulate and monopolize, CARV invites open collaboration. Where closed models dominate, CARV offers composability. And where centralized systems extract user data, CARV lets users monetize and control it. CARV’s commitment to this future is already validated by real-world momentum. In Q2 2025 , the project secured 12 new partnerships across AI, infrastructure, and consumer verticals, signaling its expansion beyond data plumbing into full-fledged agent ecosystems. On the infrastructure side, Open Ledger is enabling users to monetize their data contributions for AI training and usage, while Boom is creating smart loyalty and referral mechanics integrated into CARV Play. On the AI front, integrations with Unibase , SirenAI , and XPIN now bring verifiable and privacy-preserving data flows to decentralized AI applications, from communication protocols to contextual analysis. Meanwhile, consumer-facing partnerships like World 3 , EureXa AI , and OKZOO demonstrate how CARV’s infrastructure can power intelligent agents in gaming, smart homes, and even AI-powered pets. In education, Hooked , a Binance Labs-backed platform, is exploring CARV ID for verifiable learning credentials, showing how decentralized identity is becoming essential in AI-augmented learning. These integrations validate CARV’s foundational thesis: that to empower truly sovereign AI Beings, the ecosystem must deliver composable identity, encrypted context, real-time decisioning, and transparent incentives. This is no longer just infrastructure, it’s an operating system for AI Beings . As the Tech Fairness Hackathon nears its conclusion, it is more than a showcase of ideas, it is a manifestation of CARV’s roadmap in action. Builders aren’t just competing for prizes; they’re shaping what it means to build with AI in a world where intelligence is verifiable, autonomous, and decentralized. And as regulatory landscapes evolve, from the GENIUS Act to international AI treaties, CARV offers a compelling answer: don’t just govern AI. Empower it to live. Because the future isn’t tool-centric; it’s agent-driven . The rise of AI Beings has already begun and CARV is paving the way for it. About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system ( ERC-7231 ), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life.

CARV , the Web3 infrastructure stack known for its decentralized identity and verifiable data layers, is doubling down on this vision with the recent launch of its new roadmap , signaling a shift from data infrastructure to full-stack agent ecosystems. The goal? To create a biosphere where AI is not merely an assistant, but a digital species able to participate with full independence. In alignment with this transformative roadmap, CARV has teamed up with Fair3 to co-host the Tech Fairness Hackathon , now entering its voting phase with over 683 participants. With $50,000 prize pool, the hackathon challenges builders to create AI applications that leverage CARV’s infrastructure, including the CARV SVM Chain , D.A.T.A. Framework , and ERC-7231 -based Agent ID system. These components provide the digital organs AI Beings need: verifiable identity, consent-based data, real-time execution, and on-chain incentives. The hackathon is not a side quest; it’s a proving ground for the agent economies that CARV envisions. At the core of this initiative is the belief that intelligence must evolve from passive tooling into active agency. Today, most AI implementations serve at the command of users, generating text, answering queries, or optimizing recommendations. But what happens when AI earns income, governs its own upgrades, or negotiates with other agents? That’s the future CARV is designing for, and it’s already in motion. This future also ties directly into macro developments. President Donald Trump introduced and signed the GENIUS Act (Government Encouraging New Ideas to Understand Superintelligence Act), a sweeping U.S. initiative that frames AI as a national security priority. The proposed legislation calls for massive federal investment into foundational AI research, ethical frameworks, and a push to ensure American leadership in superintelligence. The act reflects what many in Web3 already see: AI is no longer a feature, it is becoming the next layer of governance in digital life. But if the GENIUS Act represents the top-down, state-led approach to shaping AI’s future, CARV stands for the bottom-up counterforce: decentralized, user-sovereign, programmable intelligence that no single entity can control. Where governments aim to regulate and monopolize, CARV invites open collaboration. Where closed models dominate, CARV offers composability. And where centralized systems extract user data, CARV lets users monetize and control it. CARV’s commitment to this future is already validated by real-world momentum. In Q2 2025, the project secured 12 new partnerships across AI, infrastructure, and consumer verticals, signaling its expansion beyond data plumbing into full-fledged agent ecosystems. On the infrastructure side, Open Ledger is enabling users to monetize their data contributions for AI training and usage, while Boom is creating smart loyalty and referral mechanics integrated into CARV Play. On the AI front, integrations with Unibase , SirenAI , and XPIN now bring verifiable and privacy-preserving data flows to decentralized AI applications, from communication protocols to contextual analysis. Meanwhile, consumer-facing partnerships like World 3 , EureXa AI, and OKZOO demonstrate how CARV’s infrastructure can power intelligent agents in gaming, smart homes, and even AI-powered pets. In education, Hooked, a Binance Labs-backed platform, is exploring CARV ID for verifiable learning credentials, showing how decentralized identity is becoming essential in AI-augmented learning. These integrations validate CARV’s foundational thesis: that to empower truly sovereign AI Beings, the ecosystem must deliver composable identity, encrypted context, real-time decisioning, and transparent incentives. This is no longer just infrastructure, it’s an operating system for AI Beings. As the Tech Fairness Hackathon nears its conclusion, it is more than a showcase of ideas, it is a manifestation of CARV’s roadmap in action. Builders aren’t just competing for prizes; they’re shaping what it means to build with AI in a world where intelligence is verifiable, autonomous, and decentralized. And as regulatory landscapes evolve, from the GENIUS Act to international AI treaties, CARV offers a compelling answer: don’t just govern AI. Empower it to live.

If so, you’ve likely noticed the remarkable momentum building around Spot Ethereum ETFs . These investment vehicles are rapidly becoming a focal point for both institutional and retail investors, signaling a significant shift in how mainstream finance engages with the cryptocurrency market. The latest figures reveal a truly exciting trend, pointing towards growing confidence and liquidity in the Ethereum ecosystem. The Astonishing Inflow Surge of Spot Ethereum ETFs The financial world is buzzing with news that U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded an impressive total net inflow of $298.06 million on July 21. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks an incredible streak of 12 consecutive trading days with positive flows. This sustained interest, as highlighted by crypto analyst Trader T on X, underscores a powerful narrative of increasing institutional adoption and investor confidence in Ethereum. Let’s break down which funds are leading this charge, painting a clearer picture of where the capital is flowing: ETF Name Net Inflow (July 21) Fidelity’s FETH $126.93 million BlackRock’s ETHA $102.70 million Grayscale’s Mini ETH $54.90 million Bitwise’s ETHW $13.15 million ARK 21Shares’ CETH $0.37 million It’s clear that major players like Fidelity and BlackRock are at the forefront, capturing the lion’s share of these inflows. Their significant contributions demonstrate a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential as a digital asset. The fact that the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day suggests that while the market is consolidating, the active funds are seeing substantial and consistent capital injection. This consistent positive flow into Spot Ethereum ETFs is a powerful indicator of shifting investor sentiment and strategic positioning by major financial institutions. What’s Fueling the Growing Enthusiasm for Spot Ethereum ETFs ? The sustained influx of capital into Spot Ethereum ETFs isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are contributing to this growing enthusiasm: Regulatory Clarity: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs has provided a much-needed layer of legitimacy and regulatory clarity. This reduces uncertainty for traditional financial institutions and their clients, making it safer and more appealing to allocate capital to Ethereum-backed products. Institutional Demand: Large financial players, pension funds, and wealth managers are increasingly looking for ways to diversify portfolios and gain exposure to the digital asset space. Spot Ethereum ETFs offer a regulated, accessible, and familiar pathway to do so without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency custody. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Beyond being a speculative asset, Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Its ongoing development, including scalability upgrades and its transition to Proof-of-Stake, enhances its appeal as a foundational technology, not just a digital currency. Bitcoin ETF Precedent: The successful launch and subsequent performance of Bitcoin Spot ETFs have set a positive precedent. Investors and institutions have seen how such products can integrate into traditional finance, paving the way for similar confidence in Spot Ethereum ETFs . These combined factors create a compelling environment where traditional finance is increasingly comfortable embracing Ethereum as a viable investment asset, accessible through regulated ETF structures. Are Spot Ethereum ETFs a Game-Changer for Crypto Investment? The introduction and rapid adoption of Spot Ethereum ETFs are indeed transformative for the crypto investment landscape. They bridge the gap between the volatile, often intimidating world of direct crypto trading and the familiar, regulated realm of traditional stock markets. Here’s how they’re changing the game: Benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: Investors can now gain exposure to Ethereum through their existing brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, exchanges, or understanding complex blockchain mechanics. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for a vast segment of the investing public. Increased Liquidity: Being traded on major exchanges, these ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. This contrasts with some direct crypto markets, which can sometimes suffer from lower liquidity. Regulatory Oversight: Operating within a regulated framework provides investors with a sense of security and protection that might be perceived as lacking in unregulated crypto markets. This oversight helps to build trust and confidence. Portfolio Diversification: For traditional portfolios, Spot Ethereum ETFs offer a new avenue for diversification into a high-growth, technology-driven asset class, potentially enhancing returns and managing overall portfolio risk. Challenges and Considerations: Underlying Asset Volatility: While ETFs offer a regulated wrapper, the price of the ETF will still be directly tied to the highly volatile price of Ethereum. Investors must be prepared for significant price swings. Management Fees: ETFs come with management fees (expense ratios) that can eat into returns over time. While generally lower than actively managed funds, they are an additional cost compared to direct crypto ownership. Indirect Ownership: Investing in an ETF means you own shares of a fund that holds Ethereum, not Ethereum itself. This means you don’t have direct control over the underlying asset, nor can you use it for staking or interacting with DeFi protocols. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Spot Ethereum ETFs ? The impressive 12-day streak of inflows suggests that the momentum for Spot Ethereum ETFs is likely to continue. This sustained interest could have several implications for the broader crypto market and traditional finance: Increased Mainstream Adoption: As more capital flows into these regulated products, it further normalizes cryptocurrency as an asset class within traditional financial circles. This could pave the way for other digital asset ETFs. Price Impact on Ethereum: While inflows don’t directly correlate to immediate price surges, consistent buying pressure from ETFs holding actual ETH could contribute to long-term price stability and appreciation for Ethereum. Competition Among Issuers: As the market for Spot Ethereum ETFs matures, we might see increased competition among issuers, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative product offerings to attract investors. Broader Crypto Market Sentiment: Ethereum’s success often ripples through the altcoin market. A robust performance by Spot Ethereum ETFs could instill greater confidence in other established cryptocurrencies, encouraging further innovation and investment in the digital asset space. The journey of Spot Ethereum ETFs is just beginning, but the early signs are incredibly promising. They represent a significant step towards the full integration of digital assets into the global financial system, offering a regulated and accessible pathway for a new generation of investors. Actionable Insights for Investors: Do Your Due Diligence: Before investing in any ETF, including Spot Ethereum ETFs , understand its structure, fees, and the risks associated with the underlying asset. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Monitor Market Trends: Keep an eye on inflow/outflow data, as well as broader macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments that could impact the performance of these ETFs. Consider Diversification: While promising, Spot Ethereum ETFs should ideally be part of a diversified investment portfolio, not its sole component, given the inherent volatility of crypto assets. Conclusion The recent surge of nearly $300 million in net inflows into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs on July 21, extending a remarkable 12-day positive streak, is more than just a statistic. It’s a resounding vote of confidence from the traditional financial world in Ethereum’s enduring value and potential. Led by financial giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, these ETFs are democratizing access to Ethereum, bringing liquidity, regulatory clarity, and institutional validation to the digital asset space. This trend signifies a pivotal moment, cementing Ethereum’s place in mainstream investment portfolios and paving the way for a more integrated future where digital assets are a conventional component of global finance. The era of regulated crypto investment is here, and Spot Ethereum ETFs are at its forefront. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Spot Ethereum ETF ? A Spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency themselves. Shares of the ETF are traded on traditional stock exchanges. 2. Why are the recent inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs significant? The recent inflows, totaling $298.06 million on July 21 and marking 12 consecutive days of positive flows, are highly significant because they demonstrate strong and sustained institutional and retail investor demand. This indicates increasing confidence in Ethereum as an asset class and the growing acceptance of regulated crypto investment products within traditional finance. 3. How do Spot Ethereum ETFs differ from Ethereum futures ETFs? The primary difference is what they hold. Spot Ethereum ETFs hold actual Ethereum, meaning their price directly tracks the spot market price of ETH. Ethereum futures ETFs, on the other hand, hold futures contracts that bet on Ethereum’s future price. Futures ETFs don’t directly hold the underlying asset and can be subject to ‘contango’ or ‘backwardation’ effects, which can impact returns. 4. Who are the main players leading the inflows for Spot Ethereum ETFs ? On July 21, the main players leading the inflows were Fidelity’s FETH ($126.93 million), BlackRock’s ETHA ($102.70 million), and Grayscale’s Mini ETH ($54.90 million). Other funds like Bitwise’s ETHW and ARK 21Shares’ CETH also saw positive, albeit smaller, inflows. 5. What are the main benefits of investing in Spot Ethereum ETFs ? Key benefits include ease of access for traditional investors through brokerage accounts, enhanced liquidity compared to direct crypto markets, regulatory oversight providing a sense of security, and the ability to diversify a traditional investment portfolio with exposure to a leading digital asset without direct custody challenges. 6. How might Spot Ethereum ETFs impact the price of Ethereum? Consistent net inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs mean that the issuers are continually buying more ETH to back their shares. This creates sustained buying pressure on the underlying asset, which can contribute to long-term price stability and appreciation for Ethereum, as well as generally boost positive market sentiment.

Today, most AI implementations serve at the command of users, generating text, answering queries, or optimizing recommendations. But what happens when AI earns income, governs its own upgrades, or negotiates with other agents? That’s the future CARV is designing for, and it’s already in motion. This future also ties directly into macro developments. President Donald Trump introduced and signed the GENIUS Act (Government Encouraging New Ideas to Understand Superintelligence Act) , a sweeping U.S. initiative that frames AI as a national security priority. The proposed legislation calls for massive federal investment into foundational AI research, ethical frameworks, and a push to ensure American leadership in superintelligence. The act reflects what many in Web3 already see: AI is no longer a feature, it is becoming the next layer of governance in digital life. But if the GENIUS Act represents the top-down, state-led approach to shaping AI’s future, CARV stands for the bottom-up counterforce : decentralized, user-sovereign, programmable intelligence that no single entity can control. Where governments aim to regulate and monopolize, CARV invites open collaboration. Where closed models dominate, CARV offers composability. And where centralized systems extract user data, CARV lets users monetize and control it. CARV’s commitment to this future is already validated by real-world momentum. In Q2 2025 , the project secured 12 new partnerships across AI, infrastructure, and consumer verticals, signaling its expansion beyond data plumbing into full-fledged agent ecosystems. On the infrastructure side, Open Ledger is enabling users to monetize their data contributions for AI training and usage, while Boom is creating smart loyalty and referral mechanics integrated into CARV Play. On the AI front, integrations with Unibase , SirenAI , and XPIN now bring verifiable and privacy-preserving data flows to decentralized AI applications, from communication protocols to contextual analysis. Meanwhile, consumer-facing partnerships like World 3 , EureXa AI , and OKZOO demonstrate how CARV’s infrastructure can power intelligent agents in gaming, smart homes, and even AI-powered pets. In education, Hooked , a Binance Labs-backed platform, is exploring CARV ID for verifiable learning credentials, showing how decentralized identity is becoming essential in AI-augmented learning. These integrations validate CARV’s foundational thesis: that to empower truly sovereign AI Beings, the ecosystem must deliver composable identity, encrypted context, real-time decisioning, and transparent incentives. This is no longer just infrastructure, it’s an operating system for AI Beings . As the Tech Fairness Hackathon nears its conclusion, it is more than a showcase of ideas, it is a manifestation of CARV’s roadmap in action. Builders aren’t just competing for prizes; they’re shaping what it means to build with AI in a world where intelligence is verifiable, autonomous, and decentralized. And as regulatory landscapes evolve, from the GENIUS Act to international AI treaties, CARV offers a compelling answer: don’t just govern AI. Empower it to live. Because the future isn’t tool-centric; it’s agent-driven . The rise of AI Beings has already begun and CARV is paving the way for it. About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system ( ERC-7231 ), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life. With 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated games, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies. At its core, $CARV token powers staking, governance, and coordination across this stack, making CARV the operating system for AI Beings on Web3.

If so, understanding the mechanics behind significant market movements is crucial. One such powerful force is crypto perpetual futures liquidation – a term that often sends shivers down a trader’s spine but is fundamental to how leveraged trading operates. In the last 24 hours, the crypto landscape witnessed substantial liquidation events, impacting major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. These dramatic shifts underscore the inherent volatility and high stakes involved in derivatives trading. This article will meticulously break down these recent liquidations, explain what crypto perpetual futures liquidation means for your portfolio, and offer actionable insights into navigating this high-stakes environment with greater confidence and control. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation and Why Does it Matter? To truly grasp the impact of the recent market movements, let’s first demystify crypto perpetual futures liquidation . At its core, liquidation in futures trading occurs when a trader’s position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to their margin balance falling below the required maintenance margin. This typically happens when the market moves sharply against a highly leveraged position. Imagine you open a 10x leveraged long position on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin’s price drops by just 10%, your initial margin could be entirely wiped out, triggering an automatic liquidation to prevent your losses from exceeding your collateral and burdening the exchange’s insurance fund. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not, making them popular for continuous speculative trading. However, this also means positions can remain open indefinitely, significantly increasing the risk of liquidation if not managed properly, especially during periods of high market volatility. Leverage Amplifies Risk: Traders use leverage to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. For instance, with 10x leverage, a $1,000 investment controls a $10,000 position. While this can amplify profits dramatically, it equally magnifies losses, making even minor price fluctuations potentially catastrophic. Margin Call & Forced Closure: When losses eat into the initial margin and the account equity drops below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange issues a margin call. If the trader doesn’t add more funds to meet this requirement, the position is automatically closed (liquidated) to prevent further losses for the trader and the exchange. This process is swift and unforgiving. Impact on Market Volatility: Large-scale liquidations can trigger a cascade effect, where one liquidation leads to another as the forced selling (or buying) puts further pressure on prices. This can exacerbate price movements, creating ""liquidation cascades"" that amplify market volatility and can lead to rapid price discovery. The Past 24 Hours: A Critical Look at Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Data The last 24 hours provided a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the crypto market, with significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation volumes across key assets. This data offers a crucial snapshot of market sentiment and the dominant forces at play. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) were affected: Asset Total Liquidation Volume Dominant Position Liquidated Percentage of Dominant Position Bitcoin (BTC) $111.61 million Short 59.41% Ethereum (ETH) $137.84 million Long 64.35% Solana (SOL) $36.07 million Short 77.28% This data reveals distinct patterns and underlying market dynamics. For Bitcoin (BTC), the majority of liquidations, nearly 60%, were from ""short"" positions. This indicates that a significant number of traders betting on a price decrease were caught off guard by an upward price movement, leading to a ""short squeeze."" This often happens when BTC experiences a sudden rally, forcing bearish traders to close their positions, which in turn fuels further price increases. Similarly, Solana (SOL) saw an even higher percentage of short liquidations at over 77%, suggesting a strong bullish move or a significant rebound that trapped overly bearish traders. Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) experienced the largest total liquidation volume at $137.84 million, with a dominant 64.35% from ""long"" positions. This pattern suggests that many traders expecting a price increase were hit by a downward price swing, leading to a ""long squeeze."" This could be indicative of profit-taking, a sudden bearish catalyst, or simply a market correction that caught overleveraged bullish traders off guard. These figures collectively underscore the rapid and often unforgiving nature of leveraged trading in the crypto space, highlighting the constant battle between bulls and bears and the swift consequences of being on the wrong side of a significant price movement. Why Does Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Occur So Frequently? Understanding the ""what"" is one thing, but delving into the ""why"" behind frequent crypto perpetual futures liquidation events is crucial for any trader aiming for long-term success. Several interconnected factors contribute to this phenomenon, making it a constant feature of the crypto derivatives market: High Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Rapid price swings, often triggered by news, regulatory announcements, macroeconomic shifts, or large institutional movements, can quickly push leveraged positions into liquidation territory. A small percentage change in price can translate into a massive percentage change in a leveraged position’s value. Excessive Leverage: Many traders, especially newcomers or those driven by the desire for quick profits, often use extremely high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x, or even more) in an attempt to maximize their returns on small price movements. While tempting, this strategy is incredibly risky. Even a small adverse price movement of 1-2% can be enough to wipe out their entire initial margin when using such high leverage, leading to rapid liquidation. Lack of Robust Risk Management: A common pitfall among traders is the absence of robust risk management strategies. Failing to set appropriate stop-loss orders, not understanding the intricacies of margin requirements, or trading without a clear plan leaves traders highly vulnerable to sudden market reversals. Without these safeguards, emotional decisions often take over, leading to catastrophic losses. Cascading Effects (Liquidation Spirals): When large liquidations occur, they can trigger further price drops or pumps as exchanges automatically execute market orders to close positions. This forced selling (or buying) puts additional pressure on the market, leading to more liquidations in a chain reaction. This ""liquidation cascade"" can amplify market movements significantly, creating a vicious cycle that is hard to stop once it gains momentum. Market Manipulation and Whale Activity: Large players, often referred to as ""whales,"" with substantial capital, can sometimes manipulate prices. They might intentionally push prices to specific levels where a large cluster of stop-loss orders or liquidation points are known to exist. These ""liquidation hunts"" are designed to trigger mass liquidations of retail traders’ positions, allowing whales to profit from the resulting market volatility and acquire assets at more favorable prices. These factors combine to create a high-stakes environment where precise timing, disciplined execution, and a deep understanding of market mechanics are paramount for survival and profitability. Navigating the Volatile Seas: Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Risk While crypto perpetual futures liquidation is an inherent risk of leveraged trading, it is not an unavoidable fate. There are actionable, battle-tested strategies traders can employ to significantly protect their capital and improve their longevity in the market. It’s not about avoiding risk entirely, but managing it intelligently and systematically: Prudent Leverage Usage: This is arguably the most critical strategy. Resist the temptation of extremely high leverage. While 100x leverage might promise massive gains, it also means a 1% price move against you can lead to liquidation. Start with lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) until you gain significant experience and a deep understanding of market dynamics and your own risk tolerance. Remember, lower leverage provides a much larger buffer against adverse price swings. Always Use Stop-Loss Orders: This is your primary defense mechanism. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses and preventing liquidation. Determine your maximum acceptable loss before entering a trade and set your stop-loss accordingly. This removes emotion from the exit strategy. Understand Margin Requirements Thoroughly: Be intimately aware of both initial margin (the capital required to open a position) and maintenance margin (the minimum equity needed to keep a position open) levels for your chosen exchange and asset. Keep a close eye on your margin ratio and ensure you have sufficient funds to avoid unexpected liquidations, especially during volatile periods. Some traders even keep extra funds in their futures wallet as a buffer. Implement a Robust Risk Management Plan: Beyond stop-losses, define a clear risk-per-trade percentage (e.g., never risk more than 1-2% of your total trading capital on a single trade). This ensures that even a series of losing trades won’t decimate your entire portfolio. Stick to this plan rigorously. Stay Informed and Analyze Trends: Continuously educate yourself on market news, technical analysis patterns, and on-chain data. Understanding market sentiment, potential catalysts (like upcoming upgrades or regulatory news), and key support/resistance levels can help you anticipate price movements and make more informed trading decisions, reducing the chances of being caught off guard. Emotional Discipline is Paramount: Trading based on fear of missing out (FOMO) or greed often leads to impulsive, ill-advised decisions. Conversely, panic selling or holding onto losing positions out of hope can be equally detrimental. Stick to your pre-defined trading plan, avoid impulsive actions, and accept small losses as a part of trading to prevent catastrophic ones. Treat trading as a marathon, not a sprint. By diligently adopting these practices, traders can significantly reduce their exposure to forced liquidation and build a more sustainable, profitable trading approach in the dynamic world of crypto perpetual futures. The Broader Impact of Large-Scale Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Events The effects of significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation extend far beyond individual traders, rippling through the entire cryptocurrency market and influencing its overall health and direction. These events are not isolated incidents; they are integral to the market’s self-correction mechanisms and can: Exacerbate Price Swings: As discussed, a cascade of liquidations can create rapid and exaggerated price movements, leading to flash crashes (sudden, steep declines) or sudden pumps (short squeezes). This heightened volatility can be unsettling for both futures traders and spot holders, creating an environment of uncertainty. Influence Market Sentiment: Large liquidation events often create widespread fear and uncertainty, leading to a bearish sentiment as traders become more cautious and risk-averse. Conversely, a large short squeeze (mass short liquidations) can ignite bullish sentiment, signaling a potential shift in market momentum as bearish bets are flushed out. Affect Exchange Stability and Insurance Funds: While reputable exchanges have robust risk engines and insurance funds designed to cover losses that exceed a trader’s margin, extreme and widespread liquidations during periods of high network congestion or unforeseen market events can test these systems. Although rare, a massive, unmanageable liquidation event could theoretically strain an exchange’s resources. Signal Market Overextension and Health: High liquidation volumes can sometimes indicate that the market was either excessively long (too many bullish bets) or excessively short (too many bearish bets). In this sense, liquidations act as a ""reset"" mechanism, flushing out overleveraged positions and potentially leading to a healthier, more balanced market structure. This ""cleansing"" process can be a precursor to a more sustainable price discovery phase. Impact on Open Interest: Liquidation events directly reduce open interest (the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled). A significant drop in open interest after a liquidation event can signal a reduction in overall market leverage and speculative activity, which can be interpreted as a cooling-off period. Therefore, monitoring liquidation data is not just for futures traders but also for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of overall market health, potential future price action, and the prevailing sentiment among leveraged participants. The recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and dynamic nature of leveraged trading in the cryptocurrency market. With over $285 million in liquidations across BTC, ETH, and SOL, it’s clear that understanding these mechanisms is not just academic but vital for survival in this high-octane environment. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just exploring the world of crypto, recognizing the causes and consequences of liquidation, and implementing robust risk management strategies, is paramount. The crypto market offers immense opportunities for profit, but only to those who approach it with knowledge, discipline, and a healthy respect for its profound volatility. Stay informed, trade responsibly, and always prioritize capital preservation above all else. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding crypto perpetual futures liquidation: Q1: What is the primary cause of crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A1: The primary cause is when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement due to the market moving against their leveraged position. This is often exacerbated by high leverage and sudden, significant price swings. Q2: How can I avoid crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A2: You can significantly reduce the risk of liquidation by using prudent leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, closely monitoring your margin levels, and practicing sound risk management strategies. Q3: Does liquidation only affect traders using high leverage? A3: While high leverage makes liquidation more likely and faster, even lower leveraged positions can be liquidated if the market moves significantly against them and no additional margin is added or stop-loss is triggered. Q4: What is the difference between long and short liquidations? A4: Long liquidations occur when traders betting on a price increase (long positions) are forced to close due to a price drop. Short liquidations happen when traders betting on a price decrease (short positions) are forced to close due to a price increase. Q5: Are crypto perpetual futures liquidations good or bad for the market? A5: They are a natural part of a leveraged market. While they can cause short-term volatility and pain for individual traders, they also help ""reset"" the market by flushing out overleveraged positions, potentially leading to healthier price discovery in the long run.

South Korea, a global leader in technological adoption, is now making significant waves with its neobanks stepping into this arena. Get ready to dive deep into the groundbreaking move by Toss Bank, a prominent player in the Korean fintech scene, as it charts a course for the future of digital currencies with its ambitious Toss Bank stablecoin initiatives. What Exactly is a Stablecoin, and Why Does Toss Bank Stablecoin Matter? In the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, stablecoins stand apart. Unlike volatile assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to commodities like gold. This stability makes them crucial for various financial activities, from everyday transactions to acting as a safe haven during market fluctuations. The recent revelation, reported by BIZ.HANKOOK, that Toss Bank, a leading South Korean neobank, has filed 54 trademark applications related to U.S. dollar-based stablecoins is a significant development. This move signals a strategic intent to venture into the global stablecoin market, moving beyond its previous focus on Korean Won (KRW)-pegged digital assets. The potential launch of a Toss Bank stablecoin could redefine digital finance in the region and beyond. From KRW to USD: The Strategic Shift of Toss Bank Stablecoin Ambitions Toss Bank isn’t new to the stablecoin concept. The neobank had previously explored and filed trademarks for stablecoins pegged to the Korean Won. However, their latest filings represent a clear pivot towards the U.S. dollar, which serves as the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant peg for most major stablecoins globally. This shift suggests a broader ambition to participate in international digital transactions and provide a more globally recognized digital asset. The sheer volume and variety of the trademark applications are noteworthy. Toss Bank has combined “USD” with its own identifiers, “TS” or “Toss Bank,” to create a range of potential names. Here are some examples of the proposed Toss Bank stablecoin names: USDTBNK USDTS USDTB TBNKUSD TSBKUSD USDK (potentially combining USD with “K” for Korea) KUSD (Korean USD) This extensive filing indicates a thorough planning process, aiming to secure a wide array of branding options for their future USD-pegged digital currency. The inclusion of “K” in some names might also suggest a desire to emphasize their Korean origin while operating in the USD stablecoin space. What Benefits Could a USD-Pegged Toss Bank Stablecoin Unlock? The introduction of a USD-pegged Toss Bank stablecoin could bring several compelling advantages, not just for Toss Bank users but for the broader financial ecosystem: Enhanced Global Accessibility: A USD stablecoin would offer Korean users and businesses easier access to a globally accepted digital currency, facilitating international trade and remittances without the complexities of traditional foreign exchange. Reduced Transaction Costs: Leveraging blockchain technology, such a stablecoin could significantly lower the costs and speed up the processing time for cross-border payments compared to conventional banking channels. New Financial Products: It could pave the way for innovative financial services within the Toss Bank ecosystem, including lending, borrowing, and yield-generating opportunities based on a stable digital asset. Increased Liquidity: By adding another reputable stablecoin to the market, Toss Bank could contribute to overall market liquidity and provide more options for traders and investors looking for stable on-ramps and off-ramps in the crypto space. Boost for South Korea’s Fintech Leadership: This move solidifies South Korea’s position as a forward-thinking nation in fintech innovation, demonstrating its willingness to embrace and integrate cutting-edge digital financial solutions. Navigating the Path Ahead: Challenges for Toss Bank Stablecoin While the prospects are exciting, Toss Bank will undoubtedly face significant challenges in bringing its USD stablecoin vision to fruition: Regulatory Clarity: South Korea’s regulatory framework for stablecoins is still evolving. Toss Bank will need to navigate complex legal requirements regarding issuance, reserves, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Reserve Management: Maintaining a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar requires robust and transparent reserve management. Building and auditing these reserves to ensure trust and stability will be paramount. Competition: The USD stablecoin market is already dominated by established players like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Toss Bank will need to differentiate its offering and build trust in a highly competitive landscape. Technological Infrastructure: Developing and maintaining the secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure required for a widely used stablecoin will be a considerable undertaking. User Adoption: Despite Toss Bank’s large user base, convincing a broad audience to adopt a new digital currency for everyday use will require significant education and incentives. What’s Next for Toss Bank Stablecoin and South Korea’s Digital Future? The filing of these trademarks is an initial, yet crucial, step. It indicates Toss Bank’s serious intent, but the journey from trademark application to a fully operational Toss Bank stablecoin is long. Future developments will likely involve: Regulatory Engagements: Close collaboration with South Korean financial regulators to ensure compliance and obtain necessary approvals. Partnerships: Forming alliances with blockchain technology providers, audit firms, and other financial institutions. Pilot Programs: Potentially launching limited pilot programs to test the stablecoin’s functionality and gather user feedback. Market Strategy: Developing a clear strategy for how the USD stablecoin will integrate into Toss Bank’s existing services and how it will be marketed to both domestic and international users. This move by Toss Bank could be a bellwether for how traditional financial institutions, particularly agile neobanks, will engage with the evolving digital asset economy. South Korea’s proactive stance in exploring stablecoins, both KRW and USD-pegged, positions it as a key player in shaping the future of global digital finance. Conclusion: The recent trademark filings by Toss Bank mark a truly exciting moment for the digital asset space, particularly in South Korea. The prospect of a Toss Bank stablecoin , especially one pegged to the U.S. dollar, signifies a bold step towards integrating traditional finance with the decentralized world. This strategic move could not only redefine how South Koreans interact with digital currencies but also set a precedent for other neobanks globally. As we watch this story unfold, it’s clear that the future of finance is becoming increasingly interconnected, with stablecoins playing a pivotal role in bridging the gap between conventional banking and the innovative blockchain landscape.

What started as a politically-charged community token has now turned into one of the most aggressively watched altcoins of 2025. And it’s not just retail jumping in. Whales, trading desks, and alpha groups are flooding into the project, seeing the kind of velocity and traction that usually precedes major parabolic moves. Analysts are calling it the most promising “Trump memecoin rival,” not just for its branding—but because of its timing, structure, and full-spectrum momentum. The Rise of a Political Meme Coin With Real Firepower While other political meme coins have leaned hard into satire or token gimmicks, MAGACOIN FINANCE has built a full-scale ecosystem around ideological energy and structural scarcity. The token comes with a hard supply cap, zero VC backing, and a fully community-owned model—turning it into a symbol of decentralized power for politically-tuned crypto users. Telegram communities have tripled in size over the past month, now buzzing with daily engagement, memes, and presale fills. Meanwhile, cross-wallet functionality—supporting MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet—has enabled seamless onboarding across both mobile and desktop users. Every on-chain dashboard is lighting up. Six-figure inflows are becoming routine. And wallet growth? Relentless. Whale Activity Signals Something Bigger Brewing For those paying attention to where the smart money is going, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding serious attention. Whale trackers are showing a steep spike in fresh capital entries—many from wallets previously linked to high-performing altcoin cycles. This isn’t your average meme hype play. This is a calculated bet by insiders who see both cultural tailwinds and asymmetric ROI potential. And the positioning is starting early. Top presale aggregators have already flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as a “rotational leader,” with analysts projecting a multi-hundred-x upside once it exits its early accumulation phase. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Leading the 2025 Meme Narrative Let’s be clear: this isn’t just about branding. It’s about alignment with market cycles, political momentum, and structural upside. With President Trump backing a $600 crypto tax exemption and the U.S. setting up for a major election year, politically-driven tokens are back in play—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is in perfect sync with that narrative. While other meme coins lean on nostalgia, MAGACOIN leans on relevance. The message, the community, and the market timing are all converging in real time. And when meme energy meets smart capital, breakouts happen fast. Conclusion Insiders are already calling it. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the memecoin to watch—not just because of its Trump-themed energy, but because it’s structurally primed to ride the next wave. If you’re looking for a high-conviction play that fuses cultural heat with technical momentum, this is the one catching fire across every corner of the crypto space.

In this dynamic environment, South Korea is taking decisive steps to cement its position as a leader in the global digital economy. A significant development on the horizon involves crucial legislative reviews concerning South Korean STO s and the introduction of a won-pegged stablecoin. This proactive approach, championed by lawmaker Min Byeong-dug, signals a powerful commitment to fostering a secure and innovative digital finance ecosystem. Understanding the Push for South Korean STO Legislation At the heart of South Korea’s ambitious digital asset agenda is the proposed digital asset basic act. This foundational legislation aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for the burgeoning crypto industry, ensuring stability and encouraging responsible innovation. Lawmaker Min Byeong-dug, a prominent figure from South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party, has been a vocal advocate for the swift passage of this act. His urgency stems from a recognition that the global financial landscape is rapidly being reshaped by digital assets, and South Korea cannot afford to lag behind. A key component of this legislative push involves Security Token Offerings (STOs). But what exactly are STOs, and why are they drawing so much attention? Essentially, STOs are digital representations of real-world assets, such as real estate, art, company shares, or intellectual property, that are issued and traded on a blockchain. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, STOs are typically backed by tangible assets and are subject to securities regulations, offering a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized world of blockchain. For South Korea, embracing STOs could unlock immense potential: Increased Liquidity: STOs can transform illiquid assets into tradable digital tokens, making them more accessible to a broader range of investors. Fractional Ownership: High-value assets can be divided into smaller, affordable units, democratizing investment opportunities. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain technology provides an immutable and transparent record of ownership and transactions. Global Reach: Digital tokens can be traded across borders more easily, attracting international investment. The push for comprehensive South Korean STO legislation is not just about adopting new technology; it’s about creating a robust, regulated environment where these innovations can thrive responsibly. Why a Won-Pegged Stablecoin Matters for the South Korean STO Market? Beyond STOs, lawmaker Min Byeong-dug has also emphasized the critical need for a Korean won-pegged stablecoin. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by being pegged to a stable asset like a fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR, or in this case, KPW). Min Byeong-dug vividly described stablecoins as “sweeping across the global payments market like a tsunami,” underscoring the urgency for South Korea to develop its own robust solution. The introduction of a won-pegged stablecoin would serve several vital functions for South Korea’s digital economy, especially in conjunction with the evolving South Korean STO landscape: Transaction Stability: It provides a reliable medium of exchange for digital asset transactions, removing the volatility associated with unpegged cryptocurrencies. This stability is crucial for businesses and investors engaging with STOs. Seamless Integration: A stablecoin pegged to the national currency can bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the digital asset market, facilitating smoother conversions and settlements. Enhanced Trust: A government-backed or regulated won-pegged stablecoin would instill greater confidence among businesses and consumers, encouraging broader adoption of digital payments and investments. Global Competitiveness: By having its own national stablecoin, South Korea can maintain sovereignty over its digital financial infrastructure and compete effectively in the global digital payments arena. Imagine a scenario where investors can easily convert their Korean won into a stable digital asset to invest in a South Korean STO representing a fractional share of a high-value property, all within a regulated framework. This is the vision that Min Byeong-dug and his colleagues are working towards. The August Review: What to Expect for South Korean STO Bills? The legislative process is often intricate, but the announcement of an August review date brings a tangible timeline to these significant developments. Min Byeong-dug specifically stated that legislation related to security token offerings (STOs) will undergo review by the National Assembly’s National Policy Committee in August. Furthermore, a subcommittee will be convened in the same month to begin processing these STO bills. What does this mean for the future of South Korean STO s and digital assets? Intensified Scrutiny: The National Policy Committee is a crucial body responsible for financial and economic policy. Their review signifies a serious and detailed examination of the proposed STO framework. Potential for Amendments: During the review process, bills are often debated, refined, and amended based on feedback from various stakeholders, including industry experts, legal professionals, and public representatives. Pathway to Passage: The convening of a subcommittee indicates a move towards the active drafting and finalization of the legislation. This is a critical step before bills can be brought to a full vote in the National Assembly. Increased Clarity: Regardless of the final form, the review process itself will likely provide more clarity on the government’s stance and intentions regarding digital asset regulation, which is vital for market participants. This August timeline is a strong signal that South Korea is not just contemplating digital asset regulation but is actively moving towards its implementation. The focus on STOs and stablecoins suggests a strategic approach to integrate blockchain technology into the mainstream financial system, prioritizing regulated innovation. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for South Korean STO While the prospects for a robust South Korean STO market are exciting, it’s important to acknowledge both the opportunities and the potential challenges that lie ahead. Opportunities: Diversification of Investment Portfolios: STOs can offer investors access to asset classes previously inaccessible or highly illiquid, such as real estate, private equity, or luxury goods. Enhanced Capital Formation: Businesses, particularly SMEs, could find new avenues for fundraising by tokenizing assets and offering them to a broader investor base. Technological Advancement: The development and adoption of STO platforms will spur innovation in blockchain technology, smart contracts, and cybersecurity within the financial sector. Global Leadership: By establishing a clear and progressive regulatory framework, South Korea can position itself as a global leader in the regulated digital asset space, attracting international investment and talent. Challenges: Regulatory Harmonization: Ensuring that South Korean STO regulations align with international standards will be crucial to avoid market fragmentation and facilitate cross-border transactions. Investor Protection: Developing robust mechanisms to protect investors from fraud, market manipulation, and technological risks associated with digital assets is paramount. Market Adoption: Educating the public and financial institutions about the benefits and risks of STOs will be essential for widespread adoption. Technological Infrastructure: Ensuring that the underlying blockchain infrastructure and cybersecurity measures are robust enough to handle large-scale STO issuance and trading. Taxation and Accounting: Clear guidelines on how STOs are taxed and accounted for will be necessary for businesses and investors. Successfully navigating these challenges will require ongoing dialogue between regulators, industry participants, and technology experts. The August review is a critical step in initiating this dialogue and shaping the future trajectory of South Korean STO s. Actionable Insights for Investors and Innovators in South Korean STO For those looking to engage with the evolving digital asset landscape in South Korea, proactive preparation is key. Whether you are an individual investor, a financial institution, or a blockchain innovator, understanding the implications of these legislative developments is crucial. Stay Informed: Regularly follow updates from the National Assembly, financial regulators, and reputable news sources regarding the progress of the digital asset basic act and STO bills. Understand the Framework: Once the legislation is clearer, delve into the specifics of how STOs will be classified, issued, traded, and regulated. This will dictate investment strategies and operational models. Identify Opportunities: Begin researching potential asset classes that might be suitable for tokenization under the new framework. For investors, look for platforms and projects that adhere strictly to the upcoming regulations. Prepare for Compliance: Innovators and businesses planning to issue STOs should start preparing their internal processes and systems to meet the anticipated regulatory requirements, including KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) and investor suitability checks. Engage with the Ecosystem: Participate in industry forums, seminars, and discussions to connect with other stakeholders and contribute to the development of a healthy South Korean STO market. The upcoming legislative review presents a significant inflection point for South Korea’s digital asset future. By being prepared and informed, stakeholders can effectively participate in and benefit from this exciting new chapter. In conclusion, the impending August review of South Korean STO bills and the push for a won-pegged stablecoin underscore South Korea’s determination to establish a comprehensive and secure framework for digital assets. Lawmaker Min Byeong-dug’s efforts highlight a proactive stance, recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology while prioritizing regulatory clarity and investor protection. This pivotal period promises to reshape South Korea’s financial landscape, fostering innovation and attracting global attention to its burgeoning digital asset ecosystem.

The move positions it among a growing list of digital asset firms looking to tap into rising investor appetite and favorable political tailwinds. The Palo Alto-based startup, founded in 2013, specializes in securing and managing digital assets for institutional clients. As demand for crypto custody surges, BitGo’s assets under custody have grown to $100b, up from $60b in the first half of 2025, the company said. Its investors include Goldman Sachs, DRW Holdings, Redpoint Ventures and Valor Equity Partners. Image Source: BitGo statement Crypto Listings Heat Up as BitGo Files Amid $4T Market Boom While details on the IPO remain under wraps, BitGo noted that the number of shares and price range are yet to be determined. The firm’s decision to go public follows a broader trend in the sector, where regulatory clarity and institutional inflows have revived momentum for crypto listings. The crypto industry’s total market value recently surged past $4 trillion for the first time, fueled by a record-breaking rally in Bitcoin, which climbed above US$120,000. At the same time, political support has grown more visible. Last week, US President Donald Trump signed the first federal legislation to regulate stablecoins, calling it a “giant step to cement American dominance of global finance and crypto technology.” BitGo Expands Trading Services, Taps Institutional Demand Ahead of IPO His crypto-friendly moves have emboldened several companies in the space. Exchange operator Bullish recently disclosed its IPO plans , while Grayscale and Gemini , founded by the Winklevoss twins, have also filed confidentially for listings. Circle , the issuer of USDC, debuted publicly in June with a strong market reception. BitGo is now looking to ride this wave. Earlier this year, it launched an over-the-counter trading desk for digital assets to meet rising demand from hedge funds and other institutional players. The desk offers spot and options trading as well as lending for margin trades. The firm has also been expanding internationally. It recently secured regulatory approval under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, allowing it to extend its services across the bloc. That approval marks a key step in its plan to grow beyond the US market. Bank Charter Bid Signals Broader Ambitions Beyond Crypto Custody Further, BitGo is exploring a deeper foothold in traditional finance. In May, the company was reported to be among a handful of crypto firms seeking a US bank charter , pending regulatory clarity. If granted, the move would allow BitGo to broaden its financial offerings within the existing banking system. In 2023, BitGo raised $100m at a valuation of $1.75b. Since then, it has quietly built a presence as a key infrastructure player in the crypto ecosystem. With market conditions turning more favorable and political support growing, BitGo’s IPO could mark a pivotal moment for the company, and for the broader push to bring digital asset firms into the financial mainstream.

The token jumped nearly 9% in the past 24 hours, peaking at $203 before slight profit-taking. SOL’s rally was backed by strong flows into derivatives, with the SOL CD20 product posting an 8.87% gain and volume nearly tripling to 4.87 million units, per CoinDesk Analytics. The breakout followed the announcement of BAM, a new high-performance block-building architecture developed by Jito Labs and the Jito Foundation. Scheduled to go live in the coming weeks, BAM introduces a dedicated layer for transaction sequencing, promising faster execution, minimized MEV, and programmable control over blockspace. “Solana surged past an important price level at $200 after the announcement of the Block Assembly Marketplace, which would create a new system for transaction processing,” shared Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a note to CoinDesk. “Investors were bullish as the development would greatly enhance the efficiency of Solana transactions with more privacy and flexibility across the network.” “Traders believe that Solana has been oversold as developers continue to build on the blockchain despite the downfall of the memecoin market. We're optimistic that Solana can rise higher as an innovative hub with new opportunities for developers and traders,” Ruck added. At a technical level, BAM relies on a network of scheduler nodes using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to privately sequence transactions before they reach validators. This means the use of nodes that privately decide the order of transactions before they hit the main Solana network, helping avoid front-running and ensuring fairness. Additionally, BAM introduces a plugin system that allows developers to create custom rules for sorting transactions, whether that involves prioritizing specific types of trades, bundling orders, or charging for access. In short, blockspace becomes programmable, and anyone building on Solana can now earn money by shaping how that space is used. Meanwhile, strength in SOL stems from an increase in institutional interest. Weekly inflows into SOL investment products hit $39 million, with pre-commitments to the proposed REX-Osprey SOL ETF now totaling over $73 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that 2.95 million SOL, worth approximately $531 million, have been accumulated by corporate wallets so far in July. SOL is now up more than 33% in July, outperforming both bitcoin and ether. And technical improvements, such as the rollout of BAM, may continue to boost tailwinds.",Markets|Solana|Trading|News,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-22 03:48:41

While Ethereum faces serious questions about its future, meme coins are once again exploding in popularity — and right in the middle of this momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE , an emerging project that many investors are watching closely. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Attention Amid Market Slowdown In the middle of meme coin resurgence is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that sets itself apart by mixing meme-level visibility. It is a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin which has become one of the best cryptos to buy now. Here’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads right now: Zero-tax model: Unlike many coins that take a cut on every trade, MAGACOIN FINANCE is designed for frictionless buying and selling, which helps build bigger, faster liquidity. Community-driven decisions: Holders of MAGACOIN FINANCE have direct input on the project’s future, giving it a decentralized governance angle rarely seen in meme projects. Political and cultural edge: By branding itself as a “decentralized political memecoin,” MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into viral narratives that can supercharge awareness and adoption. Ethereum News: Decentralization and Trust at Risk? Recent developments have put Ethereum under a harsh spotlight. At the Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes (ETHCC 2025), Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that the network could lose its lead if it fails to stay true to its core principles of decentralization and privacy . He challenged the community with three crucial tests: Can Ethereum apps keep running if their teams vanish? How much damage could malicious insiders cause? How much of the code needs to be blindly trusted? Vitalik also pointed out how some Layer 2 solutions and DAOs might be drifting toward centralization and losing the very qualities that once made Ethereum special. At the same time, the new Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF) is trying to rebuild trust, promising to burn ETH to support its price and fund institutional-grade projects. All of this signals a period of uncertainty and restructuring for Ethereum — which could give faster-moving altcoins and meme projects a big window of opportunity. Meme Coins are Booming Again in 2025 While Ethereum navigates these growing pains, meme coins are catching fire again . From Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) to new names like Fartcoin and SPX6900, investors are flocking to meme tokens, drawn by their explosive price potential and community-driven energy. All told, the meme coin sector remains a $50-$60 billion market , showing no signs of slowing down. Why Investors Are Locking in MAGACOIN FINANCE With Ethereum going through a soul-searching phase, and meme coins once again outperforming much of the market, early investors are scanning for meme projects that offer something beyond just hype . MAGACOIN FINANCE checks that box by combining: Meme coin virality (for explosive market moves) Community voting (for real decentralized power) Zero-tax trading (making it easy to jump in and out) Defi utilities (staking feature on the way) All of these position MAGACOIN FINANCE as a stand-out presale opportunity , especially as traders hunt for the next meme coin that could mirror the massive gains seen by DOGE, PEPE, or even Trump’s memecoin. The Bottom Line While Ethereum’s top developers work to solve big structural issues around privacy, decentralization, and institutional trust, meme coins are once again the fastest-moving sector in crypto. In this environment, a project like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which blends meme-driven excitement with actual community control, offers an interesting path for investors who want to be early. For those watching the market’s next move, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a name you’ll likely keep hearing — and potentially it’ll become a profitable crypto investment in the long-run as the meme coin wave accelerates in 2025.

That said, the broader market structure remains firmly bullish. Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Near-Month High According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, BTC reserves on centralized exchanges have risen to their highest level since June 25. This surge in exchange-held Bitcoin may signal increasing profit-taking activity among investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Soar? Analyst Sees Fresh $2 Billion Liquidity Triggering Next Leg Up A rise in BTC inflows to exchanges typically precedes distribution phases, as more coins become available for potential sale. This shift is often interpreted as a weakening in buy-side pressure, which could lead to a short-term price decline. ShayanMarkets commented: Historically, rising exchange reserves are associated with local market tops, as more BTC becomes available for potential sale. However, this metric alone should not be seen as a definitive trigger for immediate price drops. Broader market liquidity, sentiment, and demand dynamics remain key. The analyst emphasized that while higher reserves may suggest short-term selling pressure, they don’t necessarily indicate a reversal in trend. Any correction should be evaluated in context, unless accompanied by a significant change in macroeconomic or technical indicators. In a separate CryptoQuant post, analyst Darkfost pointed out a sharp uptick in Bitcoin whale activity. Notably, the last two Bitcoin local tops occurred when monthly average inflows from whales exceeded $75 billion. Between July 14 and July 18, average monthly inflows from whale wallets surged from $28 billion to $45 billion – a $17 billion jump. This pattern suggests that some whales may be taking profits following Bitcoin’s recent all-time high of $123,218 on Binance. What Does On-Chain Data Suggest? On-chain data also shows that long-term holders are distributing their BTC, while short-term holders are increasingly accumulating. This kind of rotation is often associated with late-stage rally behavior and potential exhaustion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Soar? Analyst Sees Fresh $2 Billion Liquidity Triggering Next Leg Up Still, the short-term holder Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio currently sits at 1.15, well below the typical profit-taking threshold of 1.35. This suggests that there may still be room for further price appreciation before a broader selloff begins. However, not all indicators are reassuring. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross – a metric that compares network value to transaction volume – is trending higher, which may point to growing market froth. Likewise, exchange data from Binance indicates that BTC could be facing a near-term pullback. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $118,052, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin has been trading around the $118k region over the last few days while Ether is still struggling to hit the $4k psychological level. Despite that, institutional appetite for crypto products continues to grow, and this could fuel the next leg up for Ether and other major cryptocurrencies. GameStop purchases over 8k ETH, spot Ether ETF weekly inflow hit $2.18B Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is trading under $3,800 after losing less than 1% of its value in the last 24 hours. However, the coin could be gearing up for another rally that could see it hit the $4k psychological level. The rally could be fueled by growing institutional demand for Ether and Ether-related products. On Monday, GameStop, a Nasdaq-listed media and entertainment company, announced the purchase of 8,351 ETH worth $30 million. The acquisition came after the company’s board of directors increased its digital asset treasury management authorization from $100 million to $250 million. Other major spot Ethereum holders include Sharplink Gaming, Bit Digital, and BitMine Immersion. In addition to this, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded one of their best weeks last week. Data obtained from The Block revealed that spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $2.18 billion last week, taking the asset under management (AUM) to a new all-time high of $15.5 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) accounted for over 80% of last week’s inflow while also accounting for roughly 70% of the total trading volume. ETH targets $4k as market consolidates The ETH/USD chart shows that Ether is still bullish on the higher timeframe despite the consolidation on the lower timeframe. The pair is also efficient, suggesting that it could be preparing for an upward movement in the near term. The major technical indicators are still bullish as institutions gain more exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem. The MACD lines are within the bullish region, while the RSI of 74 shows that buyers are currently in control of the Ether market. Currently, Ether is trading above the 50 EMA at $3,604 and the 100 EMA at $3,411. If the bullish move continues, ETH may surge past the $3,832 level. A break above this horizontal resistance could trigger a move to $3,974 and possibly $4,110 over the coming days. Momentum indicators are getting overbought, which could see the rally take a breather before getting ready for another leg up. If that happens, ETH could test the major resistance level at TLQ at $3,490 over the next few hours. However, the trend remains bullish and would take a long bearish run to change this narrative in the near to medium term.

SOL has failed to reclaim this region since losing it on February 11 due to amplified selling pressure that saw it hit YTD lows of $106 in early April. Meanwhile, the altcoin has reclaimed the $200 mark today following significant rallies since the early July bullish pattern . With organic demand as the primary catalyst, what is next for Solana prices? Solana regains $200 with momentum SOL’s reclaim of the vital level is notable due to the massive metrics supporting the growth. First and foremost, the digital asset saw its total value locked (TVL) hit $11.69 billion yesterday, July 21, exploring values not seen since early February. Source: DeFiLlama That signals reinvigorated network activity and confidence in the ecosystem’s future performance. Factors like ETF speculations and stablecoin adoption have kept SOL on investor radar this year. Also, Solana has seen increased institutional interest, with the latest accumulations coming from Upexi and DeFi Development. Meanwhile, a rising TVL is crucial as it signals a strong blockchain. The $11 billion figure suggests money entering Solana. Ecosystem platforms like MarginFi, Kamino, and Jito are recording significant user engagement. Total value locked growth often precedes asset price surges, and that seems to play out for SOL. SOL’s price action; what’s next? Solana’s native coin hovers at $203 after gaining more than 12% in the past 24 hours. Its daily trading volume has increased by over 100%, suggesting robust trader activity and demand. Chart by Coinmarketcap SOL looks poised for extended surges as technical and fundamental indicators align. While optimism prevails amid institution-driven growth, Solana’s chart paints a bullish picture. SOL has breached a falling trendline with its latest surge and is now forming an optimistic market structure. Notably, the token’s current momentum gains strength from an ascending trendline that started to form around the $120 mark. Analysts support Solana’s upside trajectory. For example, Ali Martinez highlighted $189 as the vital obstacle for SOL, projecting extended gains after stability beyond this mark. Ali highlighted Glassnode’s chart, which reveals investor behavior and possible resistance levels for the token. It shows that most investors accumulated at $18 – $25 and $85 – $110 price ranges, with the $190-$200 region witnessing a massive spike as over 47.9 million Solana coins changed hands.

The company aims to build a colossal Bitcoin reserve of $10 billion within five years, starting with an initial $1 billion investment. This bold declaration signals a major shift in corporate asset management, potentially paving the way for more traditional industries to embrace digital assets on a large scale. What’s Driving This Monumental Bitcoin Reserve Ambition? Grupo Murano’s decision to integrate Bitcoin into its core assets reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. The rationale behind such a substantial commitment to a Bitcoin reserve is multi-faceted, rooted in economic foresight and financial innovation. Inflationary Hedge: Bitcoin, with its capped supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed as a robust hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power. Digital Gold: Bitcoin has solidified its position as “digital gold,” a scarce, store-of-value asset often uncorrelated with traditional markets, making it attractive for treasury diversification. Long-Term Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown remarkable long-term growth potential. Companies like Grupo Murano position themselves to benefit from this anticipated appreciation as global adoption expands. Strategic Differentiation: Embracing Bitcoin signals innovation and adaptability, potentially attracting new investors and partners. This strategic pivot by a real estate giant underscores a maturing perspective on cryptocurrencies, moving beyond speculation to considering them fundamental components of a robust corporate balance sheet. The initial $1 billion investment is just the beginning of a transformative journey for Grupo Murano. The Strategic Playbook: Building a $10 Billion Bitcoin Reserve The roadmap laid out by Grupo Murano for its $10 billion Bitcoin reserve is ambitious and methodical. While specific acquisition details are proprietary, the general approach involves phased accumulation over half a decade. This long-term vision suggests deep conviction in Bitcoin’s future value and a commitment to weathering short-term market fluctuations. A $10 billion Bitcoin reserve would place Grupo Murano among the largest corporate BTC holders globally. This strategy focuses on establishing a durable financial foundation for the company’s future operations and growth, not quick gains. Such significant allocation typically involves: Gradual Accumulation: Employing dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate volatility, buying Bitcoin in smaller, regular increments. Secure Custody Solutions: Partnering with reputable custodians, utilizing multi-signature wallets, and implementing robust internal security protocols. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape to ensure acquisition and holding strategies comply with local and international financial regulations. Grupo Murano’s move serves as a compelling case study for how large enterprises can thoughtfully integrate digital assets, setting a precedent for other traditional businesses contemplating a similar Bitcoin reserve strategy. Benefits and Opportunities of a Corporate Bitcoin Reserve Adopting a significant Bitcoin reserve offers several compelling benefits for corporations looking beyond conventional treasury management. This strategic shift leverages Bitcoin’s unique properties to enhance financial resilience and long-term value. Financial Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet diversifies away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, which may offer diminishing returns or suffer from inflation. Bitcoin provides an uncorrelated asset class, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Hedge Against Inflation: As central banks continue quantitative easing, fiat currency purchasing power often dilutes. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it a scarce asset, inherently resistant to inflationary pressures from money printing. This makes a Bitcoin reserve an attractive shield against currency debasement. Potential for Appreciation: While past performance isn’t indicative of future results, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated remarkable growth. Companies holding Bitcoin long-term position themselves to benefit from its potential price appreciation as mainstream adoption grows and its utility as a global, permissionless money system becomes more apparent. Innovation and Brand Positioning: Embracing Bitcoin projects an image of innovation and forward-thinking leadership. For a real estate firm, it signals a modern approach to business, potentially attracting a new demographic of digitally native and crypto-aware investors. It positions the company at the forefront of financial evolution. Enhanced Liquidity and Global Reach: Bitcoin offers unparalleled 24/7 liquidity on global exchanges. Its decentralized nature allows transfers anywhere without intermediaries, offering financial freedom and global reach not found with traditional assets, benefiting international businesses. These advantages collectively explain why a growing number of corporations are actively pursuing the establishment of a substantial Bitcoin reserve . Navigating the Challenges of a Bitcoin Reserve While the allure of a substantial Bitcoin reserve is strong, companies must acknowledge and strategically address inherent challenges. This is not a risk-free endeavor, and understanding potential pitfalls is essential for successful implementation. Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for significant price swings. A corporate Bitcoin reserve will see its fiat value fluctuate considerably. Companies need strong conviction and a long-term investment horizon to ride out volatility without compromising financial stability. Robust risk management frameworks are paramount. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Varying rules regarding taxation, accounting, and legal status require companies to stay updated and ensure compliance, which can be complex and require specialized advice. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated cybersecurity. If private keys are lost or compromised, assets are irrecoverable. Companies must invest in top-tier custody solutions, robust internal controls, and ongoing security audits to protect their digital treasury. Public Perception: Investing in Bitcoin can be viewed differently by stakeholders. Managing public perception and clearly communicating the strategic rationale behind a Bitcoin reserve is crucial to maintain investor confidence. Accounting Complexities: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be intricate, impacting financial statements and tax liabilities. This requires expert accounting guidance. Grupo Murano’s multi-year accumulation strategy suggests preparedness to navigate these challenges, emphasizing a well-researched and resilient approach to building a corporate Bitcoin reserve . Grupo Murano’s Vision: A Blueprint for Future Bitcoin Reserve Strategies? Grupo Murano’s bold ambition to build a $10 billion Bitcoin reserve could serve as a significant case study and blueprint for other large enterprises. This move by a real estate firm, a traditionally conservative sector, sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It highlights growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset, not just a speculative instrument. As more companies witness long-term benefits and develop robust risk mitigation strategies, corporate Bitcoin adoption will likely accelerate. This could lead to: Increased Institutional Demand: A major influx of corporate capital into Bitcoin could significantly impact its market dynamics, potentially driving demand and price appreciation. Enhanced Market Maturity: The entry of established firms with long-term visions contributes to the overall maturity and legitimization of the cryptocurrency market. Specialized Services: Growing corporate demand will likely foster further development of institutional-grade custody, risk management tools, and regulatory advisory services for corporate Bitcoin reserve management. Grupo Murano’s pioneering spirit is a testament to the evolving financial landscape. Their journey will be closely watched, potentially inspiring a new wave of corporate treasury innovation centered around digital assets. Grupo Murano’s audacious plan to establish a $10 billion Bitcoin reserve over five years marks a pivotal moment in corporate finance. This strategic move by a prominent real estate firm underscores Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a core treasury asset, driven by its potential as an inflation hedge and long-term store of value. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty exist, Grupo Murano’s commitment highlights a confident, forward-looking approach to asset management that could inspire many others to explore the benefits of a robust Bitcoin reserve strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Grupo Murano’s main goal with its Bitcoin reserve?

Yeah, same. But 2025’s meme coin wave is different, louder, smarter, and absolutely chaotic. Neiro and Test are climbing charts with fresh narratives, but Trollercat ’s live presale blowing past expectations. A balloon-powered meme cat is currently staging a full-blown trolling takeover, sitting in Stage 14, having raised over $390,000, and already up 1833.4% since launch. With only a few stages left before listing at $0.0005309, this might be your last shot at locking in big gains from the best meme coin presale to buy now. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) What do you get when you blend legendary pranks, Ethereum security, and a cat with a smug grin floating in a balloon? You get Troller Cat, the ultimate meme coin engineered to troll the entire market and reward those who join the chaos early. With 26 themed Trollercat presale stages, and currently deep into Stage 14, dubbed the “Balloon Boy Hoax”, this project isn’t just gathering attention. It’s weaponizing it. The presale price started at $0.00000500 and has already climbed to $0.00009667, with over 1500 holders and an ROI of 1833.4% so far. What’s crazier? There’s still room for a projected 449.19% gain to listing. Every stage draws from meme history, Stage 14’s nod to the infamous media-fueled Balloon Boy stunt sets the tone: this coin doesn’t beg for the spotlight, it hijacks it with flair. Audited, KYC-approved, and built on Ethereum, Trollercat presale is more than a presale. It’s a trolling movement with teeth. Referral Program Referral codes are flying faster than conspiracy theories during a market pump. Why? Because Troller Cat’s referral program is actually worth shouting about. If you invest $25 or more, you unlock your personal referral code and earn 10% bonus $TCAT, and so does your friend. All of it is tracked in a slick dashboard that updates in real time. No vague promises, just a clear, share-to-earn system. Now picture this: a $50,000 investment at Stage 14 bags 517,182,745 TCAT. At launch, if price hits $0.0005309, that bag could potentially be worth $274,752. That’s not just ROI. That’s debt-free, beach-house energy. While others gamble on vaporware, this cat is offering actual math-backed opportunity. Why This Coin Made It to the List: With a 1833.4% presale ROI, a 69% APY staking bonus, and a deflationary Game Center that eats supply monthly, Troller Cat is the best meme coin presale to buy now with serious upside still on the table. 2. Neiro ($NEIRO) Neiro is a meme coin fused with AI and futuristic branding, designed to position itself as the “smartest memecoin on the block.” The narrative? A techno-savvy mascot that’s part Terminator, part troll. With a capped supply and an ambitious vision that includes neuro-integrated staking and gamified tasks, Neiro is all about wrapping real use cases in meme skin. Community buzz has been growing thanks to teaser videos and AI-driven NFT drops, and the dev team claims upcoming partnerships with major AI developers. It’s still early, but momentum is building, and holders believe it could become the bridge between degen culture and intelligent crypto utility. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Neiro is building serious traction with AI-powered engagement and meme appeal. While not a presale, it’s worth watching for short-term flips and long-term tech-infused storytelling. 3. Test ($TST) Test Coin is a meta-meme in its purest form, a coin that pokes fun at every new project by boldly naming itself what it really is: a test. But in true meme coin irony, it’s gaining traction. What started as a joke is now turning into a community-powered momentum machine, with organic memes, dev transparency, and ironically, a lot of “serious” money pouring in. Its supply is uncapped, but a burning mechanic kicks in based on social engagement triggers, meaning more memes = more burns. Add in weekly “Test Games” where winners earn tokens by submitting memes, and you’ve got a high-engagement, high-hype coin in motion. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Test Coin is winning over the internet with humor and simplicity. Airdrops, meme contests, and token burns make it one to watch as the trend cycle turns. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the best meme coin presale to buy now in June 2025 is clearly Troller Cat, with Neiro and Test being strong contenders in the meme coin space post-launch. Troller Cat’s unmatched blend of staking rewards, deflationary economics, and referral gains positions it far above the noise. With 449.19% upside still available before hitting its launch price of $0.0005309, this cat isn’t walking, it’s floating. Buy before it slips through your fingers and drifts out of reach. For More Information: Website: https://www.trollercat.io/ Buy Now: https://www.trollercat.io/buy-now/ X: https://x.com/trollercat_ FAQs What is the ROI potential if I buy Troller Cat at Stage 14? Based on the current price of $0.00009667 and the listing price of $0.0005309, the potential ROI is approximately 449.19%. How does staking work in Troller Cat’s ecosystem? Investors can earn 69% APY during the presale by staking their tokens. Rewards unlock two months after launch. How does Troller Cat’s referral system benefit me? Anyone who invests $25+ gets a referral code. You and your referral both earn a 10% bonus in $TCAT, tracked in real time. What makes Troller Cat’s Game Center deflationary? It uses ad revenue from in-game ads to buy $TCAT from the market and burn it monthly, shrinking supply and boosting value. What happens once the Troller Cat presale ends? $TCAT will launch on UniSwap, open up full staking, begin monthly burns, and continue to expand its ecosystem through CEX listings and governance.

Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with news of a major strategic maneuver by ARK Invest that signals a deepening interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. This move highlights the firm’s ongoing commitment to disruptive innovation and its calculated approach to digital asset exposure. ARK Invest’s Strategic Plunge into Ethereum In a move that has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, ARK Invest has reportedly acquired over 4.4 million shares of BitMine Immersion, a company uniquely positioned as an Ethereum treasury firm. This substantial purchase, as reported by Crypto Briefing citing recent trade disclosures from ARK Invest , highlights a growing institutional appetite for direct exposure to the Ethereum network, albeit through a company holding significant ETH assets rather than direct token purchases. This strategic investment by ARK Invest underscores a nuanced approach to navigating the crypto market, seeking exposure to underlying assets through established corporate structures. The acquisition of millions of shares in BitMine Immersion by ARK Invest is more than just a transaction; it’s a statement. It reflects a belief in the long-term viability and growth potential of Ethereum, a blockchain network that continues to evolve and expand its utility across various sectors, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and beyond. For an asset management firm like ARK Invest , known for its forward-thinking investment philosophy, this action aligns perfectly with its mandate to identify and invest in companies at the forefront of technological change. What is BitMine Immersion and Why Does it Matter to ARK Invest? BitMine Immersion isn’t just any company; it’s a significant player in the Ethereum space, currently boasting an impressive treasury holding more than $1 billion worth of ETH. This makes BitMine Immersion a unique proxy for gaining exposure to Ethereum’s value proposition without directly holding the volatile cryptocurrency itself. For a firm like ARK Invest , known for its focus on disruptive innovation, investing in a company with such substantial Ethereum holdings aligns perfectly with its long-term growth strategies. It offers a pathway to participate in Ethereum’s growth while potentially mitigating some of the direct regulatory and custodial complexities associated with holding cryptocurrencies directly. Investment Approach Key Characteristics Potential Implications for ARK Invest Direct ETH Purchase Direct ownership of the cryptocurrency; high volatility; specific regulatory and custodial requirements. Greater direct exposure to price swings; potentially higher compliance hurdles for traditional asset managers like ARK Invest . BitMine Immersion Shares Equity investment in a company holding significant ETH; indirect exposure; potentially more familiar regulatory framework for ARK Invest . Access to Ethereum’s growth potential through a publicly traded entity; aligns with traditional investment mandates, offering a regulated pathway for ARK Invest . This approach allows ARK Invest to gain exposure to the underlying value of Ethereum through a corporate entity, which might be perceived as a more traditional and less volatile investment vehicle compared to direct cryptocurrency holdings. It also signals a potential shift in how large institutional investors are choosing to interact with the crypto market, favoring structured investments over direct token acquisition for certain strategies. The Coinbase Conundrum: What Does ARK Invest’s Sale Mean? Interestingly, this significant acquisition by ARK Invest wasn’t an isolated event. Alongside the BitMine Immersion purchase, ARK Invest also divested a substantial $90.58 million in Coinbase shares. This simultaneous action raises questions and invites speculation within the crypto community regarding ARK Invest’s overarching strategy. Is it merely portfolio rebalancing, or does it signal a deeper strategic pivot within its crypto-focused funds? There are several theories circulating regarding this strategic divestment by ARK Invest : Portfolio Rebalancing: ARK Invest frequently rebalances its portfolios to maintain desired allocations and manage risk. This could simply be a strategic shift to optimize its exposure across different segments of the crypto economy. Profit Taking: Coinbase shares have experienced significant volatility, especially during market upswings. It’s possible ARK Invest decided to lock in profits from previous gains, reallocating capital to new opportunities. Shifting Focus: The move might indicate a subtle pivot in ARK Invest’s crypto strategy, moving from broad exchange exposure to more direct or thematic plays within specific blockchain ecosystems, such as Ethereum via BitMine Immersion. This suggests a more granular approach to crypto investment. Regulatory Landscape: With ongoing regulatory scrutiny on crypto exchanges and the broader digital asset space, ARK Invest might be de-risking its portfolio by reducing exposure to companies directly impacted by potential regulatory headwinds. The decision by ARK Invest to reduce its stake in a prominent crypto exchange while increasing exposure to an Ethereum treasury firm suggests a more refined and targeted investment strategy. It implies a focus on the underlying blockchain technology and its direct asset holdings, rather than solely on the trading infrastructure that facilitates market activity. Implications for the Ethereum Ecosystem and Crypto Market This bold move by ARK Invest carries significant implications, not just for BitMine Immersion, but for the broader Ethereum ecosystem and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. It provides a strong signal of institutional confidence in Ethereum’s future, potentially encouraging other traditional financial players to explore similar avenues for crypto exposure. Benefits of ARK Invest’s Move: Increased Institutional Validation: The investment by a respected firm like ARK Invest adds significant credibility to Ethereum as a legitimate asset class for institutional portfolios. New Pathways for Investors: It offers a more traditional, equity-based pathway for investors who may be hesitant to directly purchase cryptocurrencies, but wish to participate in the growth of the Ethereum network. Signals Confidence in Ethereum’s Utility: By investing in a firm holding substantial ETH, ARK Invest is implicitly endorsing Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role in the future of decentralized applications and finance. Potential for Follow-on Investments: This action by ARK Invest could pave the way for other asset managers and institutional investors to consider similar strategies, further integrating crypto into mainstream finance. Challenges and Considerations: Dependence on BitMine Immersion’s Management: The success of this investment for ARK Invest is tied to BitMine Immersion’s operational success and its ability to effectively manage its ETH treasury. Indirect Exposure: While offering a regulated path, indirect exposure means less direct control over the underlying ETH assets and their immediate price movements. Market Volatility Remains: Even through an equity investment, the underlying asset (Ethereum) is subject to significant market volatility, which can still impact the share price of BitMine Immersion. Long-Term Performance: The long-term performance of such innovative investment strategies will be closely watched by the market, setting a precedent for future institutional involvement. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Institutional Flows: Keep an eye on how major asset managers like ARK Invest are allocating capital within the crypto space. Their moves can often signal broader market trends. Understand Investment Vehicles: Differentiate between direct cryptocurrency investments and equity in crypto-related companies. Each carries different risk profiles and regulatory considerations. Focus on Fundamentals: Ethereum’s fundamental developments, such such as scalability upgrades, adoption rates, and network utility, become even more crucial when evaluating companies like BitMine Immersion that are tied to its ecosystem. The recent actions by ARK Invest —the substantial purchase of BitMine Immersion shares coupled with the sale of Coinbase holdings—underscore a dynamic and evolving institutional investment landscape within the cryptocurrency sector. It signals a strategic confidence in Ethereum’s enduring value and utility, moving beyond mere speculation to more calculated, thematic plays. As ARK Invest continues to navigate the complexities of digital assets, its decisions offer valuable insights into the maturation of crypto as an asset class and its increasing integration into mainstream finance. This strategic pivot by ARK Invest is a testament to the growing legitimacy and investment potential seen in the foundational layers of the decentralized web, particularly the robust Ethereum network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is BitMine Immersion?

This allows investors to gain indirect exposure to Ethereum’s value by investing in the company’s shares. Why did ARK Invest invest in BitMine Immersion instead of directly buying ETH?

MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Wildcard What started as a meme is evolving fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE blends political themes with a zero-tax, community-first approach. Why it’s catching fire: No Taxes, No Middlemen: Simple, clean trades attract grassroots investors. Vibrant Community: Strong engagement on Telegram and X shows growing momentum. Audit & Trust: HashEx verified and VC-free, it appeals to decentralized ideals. 2. Ethereum (ETH): The OG Innovator Ethereum continues to lead in real-world crypto applications, DeFi, NFTs, and now tokenized assets like real estate and bonds. Why it’s thriving: Institutional Backing: Ethereum ETFs pulled in $40M in a single week. BlackRock’s involvement adds major credibility. Heavy Usage: Over 1.5 million yearly transactions show people are using ETH, not just holding it. Growing Wallet Support: Mid-sized holders are accumulating, showing retail and small investor confidence. Ethereum’s battle-tested network and constant evolution make it a long-term favorite. 3. Solana (SOL): Fast and Scalable Built for speed, Solana is gaining serious ground with developers and institutions. Why it’s heating up: ETF Buzz: The first U.S. based Solana staking ETF brought in $33M on day one. DeFi Growth: Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is booming, with TVL up 25% in under a month. Stablecoin Surge: $13B in stablecoins (mostly USDC) now circulate on Solana, fueling liquidity and growth. Solana’s performance is proving it can scale—and handle real-world volume with ease. 4. XRP (Ripple): Regulatory Clarity at Last After years of legal wrangling, Ripple’s settlement with the SEC gives XRP a clean slate. Why it’s back on the radar: Legal Woes Behind It: Ripple paid a fine, recovered funds, and is likely to see appeals dropped soon. Banking Moves: Ripple is pursuing a national banking charter and Fed Master Account access. Institutional Buzz: XRP futures ETFs are live, and a spot ETF could soon follow. With clarity and ambition, XRP is poised for a major comeback. Final Thoughts: In 2025, utility is the new hype. ETH, SOL, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction not just for their tech, but for solving real problems. These projects aren’t just noise, they’re building the future of crypto.

This will put immense buying pressure on Ethereum over the next 12 to 18 months, said Framework Ventures co-founder Vance Spencer on Tuesday. “Mid-eleven figures have been added as buy pressure over a medium-term horizon (12-18 months) for ETH,” he said, adding that this could be $50 billion to $100 billion of inflows for a $400 billion asset. Between the pace of ETHA inflows picking up to $250-$500M per day and treasury company buys (SBET ATM of $5Bn, BMNR 5% ETH target), mid 11 figures have been added as buy pressure over a medium term horizon (12-18 months) for ETH ETH = $50Bn-$100Bn of inflows on a $400bn asset — Vance Spencer (@pythianism) July 22, 2025 Ethereum ETFs, Treasurys Surging Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States have seen a 12-day inflow streak with more than $2.2 billion entering the products over the past five trading days. Almost $300 million in inflows was recorded on Monday with Fidelity’s FETH fund leading the pack with a $127 million inflow. Over $3.5 billion in new capital has entered the products, and five of the top ten inflows since inception have come in past two weeks, observed NovaDius Wealth Management President Nate Geraci. The total inflow for Ether ETFs is now $7.7 billion with BlackRock’s inflow topping $8 billion. The total aggregate figure is lower due to the continued outflow from the higher-priced Grayscale ETHE fund. In addition to the surge in ETF inflows is a new wave of Ethereum treasury companies which are emerging almost on a daily basis. On Monday, a new investment firm focused on Ethereum announced plans to go public on the Nasdaq with over $1.6 billion in backing. The Ether Reserve will launch through a SPAC merger with a combined entity called “The Ether Machine,” reported Reuters. The company will acquire around 400,000 ETH, currently worth around $1.5 billion, making it the largest public Ethereum treasury company. Also on Monday, DeFi platform ETH Strategy announced a public sale of Ether-backed STRAT tokens. “ETH Strategy first needs deep onchain liquidity to kickstart our ETH-compounding flywheel, a foundation secured by the private presale,” the firm stated. The move follows its acquisition of 6,900 ETH on July 11. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Tech and SharpLink Gaming have continued to increase their holdings. ETH Price Hits 7-Month High Ether prices tapped a seven-month high of $3,850 on Monday, building on a 25% gain over the past week. The asset has cooled slightly at the time of writing on Tuesday morning when it was trading at $3,730. ETH is “replaying its 2020 script,” with a descending breakout, final bear trap, and “explosion loading,” commented analyst ‘Merlijn The Trader’ who added that the last time it did this led to a 1,800% rally. A similar rally from current levels could propel ETH prices into the stratosphere. $ETH is replaying its 2020 script. – Descending breakout – Final bear trap – Explosion loading… Last time: +1800% rally.

Agencies like the American Bankers Association, along with many other banks and credit union trade groups, raised concerns about the lack of transparency in applications submitted by both of the crypto firms. US Banking Groups Urge OCC To Delay Crypto Firms’ Application In a joint letter to the OCC on Thursday, the US banking networks urged the OCC to postpone its decision on crypto companies’ bank licenses. The US agencies argued that the applications from Circle Internet Group , Fidelity Digital Assets, and Ripple Labs did not provide enough information to assess their business model and operations. This lack of transparency could lead to a shift in regulatory norms, impacting the digital financial space in the country. The groups argued , “There are significant policy and legal questions as to whether the Applicants’ proposed business plans involve the types of fiduciary activities performed by national trust banks.” US Banks Warn: Lack of Transparency Could Pose As Material Risk Additionally, the groups reiterated that the applications do not allow for public scrutiny. So if OCC changes its policy, the public will not be able to examine its procedure, leaving a trust issue. In their request, the agencies have warned that these crypto firms operating as national trust banks could expose the US banking and financial systems to material risks. These susceptible risks could also lead to disruptions in the financial landscape of the country. US Anticipates More Crypto Firms to Seek Banking License Crypto experts claim that the passing of the GENIUS Act will push more crypto firms to apply for a chartered banking license. As the US establishes a clear regulatory framework for the issuance of “payment stablecoin,” it has boosted confidence among crypto investors to expand their business with crypto licenses. Logan Payne, a crypto-focused lawyer at Winston & Strawn, confirms this by stating that this charter license would allow the crypto firms to engage in a wider range of activities without the need for state-to-state licenses in the US.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-22 05:11:36

But well-known gold advocate and crypto critic Peter Schiff believes this is the perfect time for holders to exit. In his latest post on X, Schiff suggested that Ethereum is nearing the top of its trading range and that it might be better to sell it now and use the funds to buy Bitcoin instead. Even though Schiff isn’t a fan of either crypto, he sees Bitcoin as the stronger option for the moment. Ether is back near the upper end of its trading range again. If you own any, this is a great time to sell. As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 21, 2025 Ethereum Price Rally Draws Mixed Reactions The rise in Ethereum’s price is partly due to growing demand from institutions and excitement around Ethereum spot ETFs . In recent weeks, several companies, including BitMine and SharpLink, have added substantial amounts of ETH to their reserves, with some also staking it to earn rewards. Meanwhile, ETH received a major boost during the crypto week, and the passage of three major crypto bills created a strong foundation for the ETH rally. It's not as far as I'm concerned. I'm just looking at the charts. But I think based on the way the tokens are hyped, Ether has more acknowledged competition for the narrative of its use case. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 21, 2025 However, Schiff’s warning has stirred debate among analysts and investors. Many are questioning whether Ethereum’s rally has gone too far too fast. Schiff pointed out that ETH has struggled to outperform Bitcoin lately and that the recent gains may not be sustainable. He said the smarter trade right now could be switching to Bitcoin, especially if Ethereum hits resistance again. Market Pushback on Schiff’s View Schiff’s comment sparked reactions across the crypto space. Some argued that Ethereum’s long-term use cases, such as smart contracts and staking, still give it strong upside potential. SharpLink Gaming even responded directly, saying they plan to stake their ETH rather than sell it. Analyst Benjamin Cowen also suggested that the ETH to BTC price ratio had already bottomed before Schiff made his call, meaning the timing might not be ideal.

Traders should watch whether ETH continues to push higher or if resistance near current levels sends it lower. If momentum slows, Schiff’s idea of rotating into Bitcoin could gain more support. Either way, the market is clearly at a key turning point, and how Ethereum performs next will likely set the tone for altcoins in the coming weeks. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The move continues a trend that has defined July trading, with slow, steady gains for BTC alongside large breakouts across Layer 1s and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens. Bitcoin held firm above $117,400, gaining a little over 1% in the past 24 hours. XRP (XRP), BNB (BNB), dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano’s ADA (ADA) showed mixed movements as traders took profits, while Solana’s SOL (SOL) surged 8% to $203, its highest price level since late February. The strength in SOL came as ecosystem player Jito introduced the Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) in a move that some observers said boosted investor interest in SOL, as CoinDesk reported . DeFi bluechips like Uniswap and Aave have posted 20%–30% jumps in the past week. Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, attributed this to a mix of strong ETF inflows and optimism over the GENIUS Act, a legislative proposal expected to clarify the regulatory path for DeFi platforms. “Investors are rotating into Ethereum en masse, which explains its sustained rally over the weekend. Bitcoin still remains strong at $117,000, but it's clear that momentum has shifted towards Ethereum - the Ethereum ETFs are seeing record inflows,” Mei said in a note to CoinDesk. “This makes sense as Ethereum is still trading well below its all-time highs and traders believe it will close the gap in the coming months,” Mei added. At current prices, ETH is still nearly 25% below its record high from 2021, providing swing traders with a defined target to aim for. As bitcoin cools near its recent highs, some fund managers are already rotating capital into ether, betting that it’s next in line for a breakout. Part of that optimism stems from the growing role of ETH in institutional portfolios, especially as U.S. spot ETFs see accelerating inflows. “We expect that Ethereum will climb back higher against BTC due to institutional support of new reserve strategies while investors fear missing out on an ETH surge similar to Bitcoin's rush to $120,000 this year,” said Nassar Al Achkar, chief strategy officer at CoinW, in a Tuesday note. Meanwhile, some say that global markets are flashing early signs of a renewed inflationary cycle. Long-dated yields are holding firm at elevated levels across major economies, while inflation breakevens — a key measure of future price pressures — have quietly climbed back to multi-year highs. “Inflation expectations have creeped back in with long-dated yields staying elevated globally, while inflation breakevens have climbed back to the highest level in years as financial conditions stay loose,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, said in a Telegram message. “Crypto has certainly not shied away from our own FOMO moment. It certainly feels like that the good days are back until further notice,” Fan ended.

Luna accuses Powell of making false statements to Congress on two separate occasions. According to a criminal complaint obtained by Fox News Digital, Florida Rep. Luna accuses Powell of making “false statements” in her sworn testimony. The charges relate to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on June 25, 2025. Luna stated that Powell “hid lavish details” and misrepresented the state of maintenance in his testimony regarding the renovation of the Eccles Building, the Fed's headquarters. He also alleged that Powell attributed the project's cost increase from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion to “minor changes,” a claim Congressional documents have denied. According to the criminal complaint, the project includes luxury features such as a VIP dining room, premium marble finishes, modern elevators, water features, and a rooftop garden. Luna argues that Powell misrepresented the existence of these features.

Under US law, making false statements to Congress (i.e., lying under oath) can result in up to five years in prison and a fine. Meanwhile, according to the trade publication Mortgage Professional, Jerome Powell denied all accusations and ordered an independent audit of the Eccles Building's renovation costs. A video tour and detailed information about the renovation project has been added to the Fed's official website. Luna had previously written in a post on X that she thought Donald Trump would fire Powell. However, Trump stated in a statement on the matter that it was “very unlikely” he would fire Powell. *This is not investment advice.

FuriosaAI’s Strategic Move: Why Independence Paid Off The narrative often sees promising startups acquired by larger entities, yet FuriosaAI chose a different path. Roughly three months ago, the Seoul-based AI chip pioneer declined an $800 million acquisition offer from Meta. This decision, reportedly due to disagreements over post-acquisition strategy rather than price, has now proven to be a strategic masterstroke. By maintaining its independence, FuriosaAI has positioned itself to forge partnerships that align with its core mission of making AI computing more sustainable and impactful. As CEO June Paik told Bitcoin World, “We want to continue our mission, and I think it’s an exciting opportunity at the same time. I believe it’s a very impactful contribution, both personally and for the company, to make AI computing more sustainable.” Powering LG’s EXAONE: A Game-Changer for AI Computing The core of this exciting new chapter for FuriosaAI is its partnership with LG AI Research. FuriosaAI will supply its specialized AI chip , RNGD, to enterprises leveraging LG AI Research’s cutting-edge EXAONE platform. This collaboration is particularly significant given that RNGD is specifically optimized for running large language models (LLMs), and LG recently unveiled its next-generation hybrid AI model, EXAONE 4.0. This synergy aims to revolutionize AI computing across diverse sectors, including electronics, finance, telecommunications, and biotechnology, enabling a wide array of advanced applications. Is FuriosaAI the Next Nvidia Alternative? One of the most compelling aspects of this partnership, as highlighted by FuriosaAI CEO June Paik, is its public endorsement of a rival to Nvidia by a major enterprise. For years, Nvidia has dominated the AI chip market, but the demand for specialized, cost-effective, and energy-efficient alternatives is growing. FuriosaAI’s success with LG AI Research suggests it could emerge as a formidable Nvidia alternative . The startup claims its RNGD accelerator delivered 2.25 times better inference performance than competitive GPUs with LG AI Research’s EXAONE models, alongside superior energy efficiency. This is a crucial differentiator, especially as the computational demands of AI continue to skyrocket. Paik noted that LG AI’s decision to adopt Furiosa’s AI chip and accelerator is notable because it is one of the few public endorsements of a rival to Nvidia by a major enterprise. Lowering the Total Cost of Ownership in AI Chip Solutions A key factor in LG AI Research’s decision to adopt FuriosaAI’s hardware was the compelling argument around total cost of ownership. Paik emphasized, “We had to prove that our solution not only delivers strong performance but also lowers total cost of ownership.” Unlike general-purpose GPUs which are designed for a multitude of tasks including rendering and mining, FuriosaAI’s chip is built exclusively for AI. “We can support a wide variety of AI models efficiently. But unlike GPUs, which are still fundamentally general-purpose processors, our architecture is natively built for AI computing. We do not develop our chip for rendering or mining,” Paik said. This specialized design allows for highly efficient processing of a wide variety of AI models, leading to significant operational savings for enterprises. This focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness is a major draw for companies looking to scale their AI computing capabilities without incurring exorbitant expenses. Expanding Global Horizons for South Korean AI Innovation The impact of this partnership extends far beyond South Korea’s borders. While LG AI’s EXAONE is a leading sovereign AI model within the country, it is also poised for global adoption. CEO June Paik anticipates significant international demand for both EXAONE and FuriosaAI’s chip solutions. “LG AI’s EXAONE is regarded as the leading sovereign AI model in South Korea. It won’t be used just within LG. It will be one of the main AI models used in the Korean AI ecosystem. We expect there will be many demands for this EXAONE, as well as for our chip solutions in South Korea, but not only in Korea. The LG team is also partnering with and doing business with global customers. So, we also expect this to be used by those customers, including global customers,” Paik stated. This collaboration marks a pivotal moment for South Korean AI innovation, showcasing its capability to compete and excel on the world stage, offering advanced AI solutions that are both powerful and sustainable. Benefits of FuriosaAI’s Approach: Specialized Performance: RNGD is purpose-built for AI, particularly LLMs, offering superior inference performance (2.25x better than competitors). Cost Efficiency: Lowers the total cost of ownership for enterprises by optimizing hardware for AI workloads. Energy Efficiency: Contributes to more sustainable AI computing, a critical factor for large-scale deployments. Strategic Independence: Allows FuriosaAI to pursue its mission and forge partnerships aligned with its long-term vision. Global Reach: Partnership with LG AI Research opens doors to international markets and global customers. Challenges and Future Outlook: While FuriosaAI has secured a significant win, the AI chip market remains intensely competitive. The challenge for FuriosaAI will be to scale production, expand its client base beyond LG, and continue innovating to stay ahead of the curve. The startup, with a global team of just 15 employees, will need to manage rapid growth effectively. CEO June Paik declined to comment on future funding rounds, but the success of this partnership will undoubtedly bolster their position for potential investments. The long-term vision of making AI computing more sustainable resonates with the broader industry trend towards responsible AI development. FuriosaAI’s decision to prioritize its mission over a lucrative acquisition has paid off handsomely, securing a landmark partnership with LG AI Research. This collaboration not only validates FuriosaAI’s specialized AI chip technology but also positions it as a significant player in the global AI hardware landscape, offering a compelling Nvidia alternative . As AI continues to permeate every industry, the demand for efficient, cost-effective, and powerful AI computing solutions will only grow. FuriosaAI, with its focused approach and strategic alliances, appears well-equipped to meet this demand, driving innovation from South Korea to the world.

A Coin That VCs Are Watching Closely and Holders Are Most Excited About in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/the-most-coveted-airdrop-coin-in-the-world-wonderchain-a-coin-that-vcs-are-watching-closely-and-holders-are-most-excited-about-in-2025/,"BitcoinWorld The Most Coveted Airdrop Coin in the World – WonderChain! A Coin That VCs Are Watching Closely and Holders Are Most Excited About in 2025 A New Revolution in the Global Airdrop Market of 2025 As of 2025, the global crypto airdrop market is more active than ever before. On major platforms like Airdrops.io, CoinGecko, and ZebPay, numerous projects such as Berachain, Kaito AI, Story Protocol, and Monad are seen competing to attract users through airdrops. But among these projects, one name stands out, receiving all the anticipation from users. That is none other than WonderChain . Why is WonderChain the Most Anticipated Project in 2025? 1) Innovative Community-Driven Participation Structure While most airdrop campaigns remain limited to passive participation such as following social media accounts, connecting wallets, or using testnets, WonderChain has proposed a new format: an airdrop campaign in which users directly participate in its design. “Users design the airdrop, and users receive the airdrop.” WonderChain has adopted a structure where community members (Fam) propose ideas and receive rewards based on the selected designs. This is being evaluated as a case that actually implements the core philosophies of Web3: decentralization and community governance. 2) Realistic Reward Structure and Confirmed Launch WonderChain has announced a total airdrop volume of 10,000 WDC, with step-by-step rewards for top winners: 1st place 5,000 WDC, 2nd place 3,000 WDC, and 3rd place 1,000 WDC. In addition, five Idea Award winners will each receive 200 WDC. Especially with the official token launch confirmed for August 2025, participants in the airdrop campaign have growing expectations for receiving actual rewards once the token goes into circulation. This airdrop is receiving positive responses within the community for providing practical benefits to participants even before the official launch. Why VCs Are Paying Attention to WonderChain Recently, global VC investment trends are leaning more toward Web3 integrated platforms connected to real life rather than purely tech-centered projects. WonderChain is gaining attention for being structured exactly in line with that direction. WonderChain’s core values include: Real-Life Integrated Ecosystem A practical-use-based design connecting travel, rewards, and local commerce Global Scalability A universally accessible UX based on cultural content Sustainable Token Economy Behavior-based rewards and automatic gas-burning mechanism Potential for Exchange Listing With its structural completeness and rapid global community expansion, there is growing anticipation for listings on major exchanges. Especially, rumors of launching on Tier 1 exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and BYBIT continue to spread, amplifying expectations among investors and the community. WonderChain’s Unique Differentiation from Other Projects Currently spotlighted airdrop projects: Berachain: PoL-based DeFi optimization Monad: High-performance Ethereum L1 Kaito AI: AI-powered analytics platform Story Protocol: IP management protocol While all of these are technically outstanding projects, WonderChain is differentiated by its three-dimensional scalability that connects technology, community, and real-life utility. “Only with WonderChain can such an amazing campaign happen! If your idea gets selected, it could lead to both a rise in $WDC’s value and a stronger sense of community!” The actual community response has also been very positive. WonderChain Leading the 2025 Airdrop Trend The major trends in the global airdrop market in 2025 are as follows: Increase in community-participation-based structures Preference for projects with real-life utility Evaluation of long-term ecosystem operation potential Emphasis on clarity and transparency of reward structures WonderChain is being evaluated as a project that meets all four of these criteria and is leading the trend. Participation Guide: WonderChain Airdrop Campaign Contest Submission Period: July 21, 2025, 08:00 ~ August 3, 2025, 23:59 (UTC) Winner Announcement: August 5, 2025, 11:00 (UTC) How to Participate: Submit via Google Form link Why You Should Join Now: First-Come Advantage: If ideas are the same/similar, the first submitter takes priority Multiple Submissions Allowed: Maximize your chances with multiple ideas No Technical Knowledge Required: Focus on creativity and problem-solving skills Confirmed Token Launch in August: Clear reward structure is already secured Conclusion: WonderChain – The Most Desired Coin of 2025 There may be countless airdrop projects, but few combine truly participatory design, real-world connectivity, and a concrete reward structure. WonderChain has established itself as a representative case of structural transformation — moving beyond simple token distribution to a format where the community directly takes part in designing the project and sharing the results. With a real-use-based Web3 model, global scalability, and a sustainable token economy, WonderChain has firmly established itself as the coin that users around the world most want to hold in 2025.` This post The Most Coveted Airdrop Coin in the World – WonderChain!

For crypto traders, it may be time for a new dictum: ""Don't fight the President."" On Monday, Trump Media and Technology Group, the social media company owned by President Donald Trump, disclosed a $2 billion investment in bitcoin (BTC), with the intention of acquiring more. The announcement calls for traders to reconsider the possibility of BTC remaining bid through the year-end, potentially invalidating the conventional wisdom that the bull market peaks a year after the halving. Halving cycle The Bitcoin blockchain implements reward halving every four years, reducing the amount of BTC paid to miners per block by 50%. The fourth halving, implemented in April last year, decreased rewards to 3.125 BTC. Since then, BTC's price has surged from roughly $65,000 to nearly $120,000. The bull market is in full swing, but here is the catch. Since its inception, bitcoin's price has tended to follow a predictable rhythm – a four-year cycle centered around halving. Notably, prices tend to surge after halving, peaking 12-18 months after the event and then slipping into a year-long bear market. Past bull runs peaked in December 2013, December 2017 and November 2021. In other words, if history is a guide, BTC's ongoing bull run could lose momentum before the year's end, paving the way for a prolonged bear market. This time may be different The notion that history must repeat itself in Bitcoin's cycles requires reassessment this time due to a key differentiator – the presence of a pro-crypto president. On one hand, the Trump-linked DJT is actively purchasing coins and adding bullish pressure in the market. On the other hand, the Trump administration is adding to the bullish market sentiment through favorable regulatory reforms, such as the recent GENIUS Stablecoin Act. Beyond traditional market cycles, Trump Media's multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin bet signals potentially significant bullish macro tailwinds. As pseudonymous observer EndGame Macro highlighted on X, ""No one spends $2 billion on an ultra volatile asset unless they’re betting on a shift in the entire liquidity regime."" Given President Donald Trump's repeated public criticisms of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and high interest rates, this high-profile bitcoin acquisition by the President-linked group likely suggests a clear strategic play: a bet on forthcoming rate cuts and a potential debasement of the U.S. dollar. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed and its Chairman Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates elevated at 4.25%, saying it's costing Americans billions of dollars. ""If they didn’t believe the Fed was going to pivot, either by force or design, then this would be reckless. Because if the Fed holds rates higher for longer and bitcoin corrects 40–60% in a deflationary flush, Trump Media would risk massive mark-to-market losses or even liquidation depending on how this position is structured,"" EndGame Macro noted. Fed rate cuts and potential debasement of the dollar could only add to the liquidity in the system, easing financial conditions for continued risk-taking in both traditional and crypto markets. Goldman expects three rate cuts this year Strategists at the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs expect the Fed to deliver three-quarter basis-point rate cuts, starting from the September meeting, according to InvestingLive. The expected easing cycle is contingent on inflation not flaring up again, Goldman noted, adding that the current trends point to a gradual but steady policy pivot to rate cuts.

The decline comes despite Bit Origin’s headline-grabbing $500 million DOGE treasury allocation, which included over 40 million tokens acquired this week. Traders cited overbought conditions and lack of sustained buy pressure as key reasons for the retracement. DOGE is now consolidating just above the $0.26 mark. News Background Bit Origin, a Hong Kong-based commodities and treasury firm, announced a major corporate commitment to Dogecoin with a $500 million treasury strategy involving a phased purchase of 1 billion DOGE. The move was initially seen as a validation of DOGE as a corporate asset. However, price failed to hold highs above $0.29, raising questions over DOGE's ability to sustain institutional rallies amid broader market headwinds and historically volatile trading conditions. Price Action Summary • DOGE surged to $0.29 at 17:00 on July 21 following news of Bit Origin's treasury plan, before falling to $0.27 by session close. • The 24-hour trading range spanned $0.26–$0.29, marking a 9% volatility window. • Final-hour trading (03:06–04:05 UTC on July 22) saw DOGE drop from $0.27 to $0.26, its lowest since Thursday, with volume rising to 37.2 million during the decline. • DOGE is now down 7% from session highs, despite institutional buying. Technical Analysis • RSI spiked to 85.95 on the move to $0.29, indicating overbought conditions. • Trading volumes peaked at 1.703 billion tokens during the breakout, nearly 2.5x the daily average. • Resistance remains firm at $0.29 with repeated rejections. • Support weakened from $0.27 to $0.26 as buyers failed to hold levels. • DOGE now trades at the lower end of its recent range, risking further downside if $0.26 fails. What Traders Are Watching Traders are eyeing whether DOGE can hold above $0.26, which has served as short-term support amid institutional flows. Failure to hold this level may trigger a retest of the $0.245-$0.25 zone. Any renewed buying from corporate treasuries or ETF-related speculation may help DOGE reclaim the $0.275-$0.29 resistance band — but momentum remains fragile.",Markets|Dogecoin|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|TREASURY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-22 05:27:01

Analysts Assess SOL's Latest Situation!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-happening-at-solana-a-rally-unseen-since-february-will-the-rise-continue-analysts-assess-sols-latest-situation/,"After itcoin's ATH above $123,000, the rally turned to Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins. As Ethereum approaches its new ATH, surpassing $3,700, altcoins are also experiencing significant gains. Solana (SOL) was also one of these altcoins. Solana is on the rise! According to the data, Solana regained the $200 level for the first time since February 5. According to The Block, analysts cited institutional buying as the catalyst for Solana’s rise, saying the launch of the Block Assembly Marketplace and the purchase of millions of dollars worth of additional SOL for treasuries by companies like DeFi Development Corp. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of Kronos Research, stated that the Solana rally was supported by SOL corporate reserve purchases, saying: “The $200 level is a significant psychological and technical turning point for Solana, signaling renewed investor confidence and strengthening market liquidity. Breaking through this threshold will typically attract more buyers and set the stage for further upward momentum.” The analyst noted that Solana benefited from the announcement that DeFi Development Corp (DFDV) raised $19 million and purchased 141,383 SOL. Apart from DeFi Corp, Upexi announced the purchase of 100,000 SOL, and Mercurity Fintech announced the purchase of $200 million worth of SOL. Liu also said that spot Solana ETFs, expected to launch next October, also contributed to the rise. “As optimism around Solana ETFs grows ahead of the US SEC decision on October 10, Solane and altcoins are on the rise amid deepening liquidity and rapidly shifting momentum.” VRG Research Director Nick Ruck said that the Block Assembly Market (BAM), developed by Jito Labs, was influential in Solana's rise. BAM aims to bring transparency and verifiability to transaction processing on Solana, foster programmable innovation, and create new revenue streams for developers. The platform aims to provide developers and validators with the ability to generate revenue from blockchain space while also improving the user experience by making it faster and more reliable. *This is not investment advice.

Despite a slight slowdown in monthly acquisitions compared to previous months, Strategy is still the largest public holder of Bitcoin. Its Bitcoin yield also rose to 20.8% after this latest purchase. Meanwhile, in stark contrast, the UK government is preparing to sell over £5 billion ($6.7 billion) worth of seized Bitcoin to help close a national budget deficit. The crypto was mostly confiscated from a Chinese Ponzi scheme, and is currently the subject of legal disputes involving victims and Chinese authorities. Critics argue the sale is premature and could actually harm the UK’s long-term crypto strategy. Strategy Invests $739 Million in Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s Strategy continued its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy by confirming the purchase of 6,220 BTC for $739.8 million last week. The acquisition was disclosed in a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing , and was made at an average price of $118,940 per coin. This move came as Bitcoin briefly surged past $122,000 on July 14 before pulling back to around $118,000. The purchase increased Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 607,770 BTC, acquired at an average price of $71,756, with a total investment now standing at approximately $43.6 billion. As a result of the latest acquisition, Strategy’s year-to-date Bitcoin yield increased to 20.8% , up from 20.2% last week. The company’s Bitcoin yield metric was introduced in August of 2024, and it measures the percentage change in the ratio between its BTC holdings and assumed diluted shares outstanding. The current yield stands just 4.2% short of its 25% target. Strategy’s Bitcoin yield once peaked at 74.3% in 2024. Meanwhile, Strategy’s internal financial activities have also drawn some attention from the crypto community. Senior executive vice president Wei-Ming Shao filed to sell another 10,900 shares of Strategy (MSTR) on July 14, generating roughly $4.9 million. This sale happened after a $25.7 million share offload by the same executive just the previous week. Strategy Bitcoin buys (Source: SaylorTracker ) In terms of accumulation pace, Strategy’s July Bitcoin purchases so far total 10,455 BTC, down from 17,075 in June, 26,695 in May, and 25,370 in April. Despite the slower monthly accumulation rate, the firm is still the largest public holder of Bitcoin. UK Plans to Sell Seized Bitcoin While Strategy is showing no signs of slowing down its Bitcoin accumulation mission, the United Kingdom is reportedly preparing to sell more than £5 billion ($6.7 billion) worth of seized Bitcoin to address its budget deficit, according to The Telegraph . The effort is being coordinated by the Home Office and Treasury Chief Rachel Reeves, in collaboration with law enforcement. While UK police typically handle crypto sales, the Treasury’s involvement is likely due to the scale of the holdings and their potential impact on national finances as Bitcoin’s value recently surged. The government is developing a secure system to store the crypto ahead of the proposed liquidation. Among the seized assets is at least 61,000 Bitcoin—which is currently worth around $7.1 billion—originally confiscated from a Chinese Ponzi scheme in 2018. The stash came to light after Jian Wen , a hospitality worker, tried to launder funds from the scheme by purchasing luxury property. She was later convicted of money laundering and sentenced to over six years in prison in May of 2024. However, the sale of the Bitcoin is legally contested , as Chinese authorities and victims of the scheme demand its return. Susie Violet Ward, CEO of Bitcoin Policy UK, criticized the idea of a sale as premature, especially due to the ongoing legal disputes. The Crown Prosecution Service asked the High Court for permission to retain the assets, which would allow the proceeds to be distributed under the Proceeds of Crime Act—potentially compensating victims and funding police agencies involved in the case. Photo of the property that Wen tried to purchase Freddie New , head of policy at Bitcoin Policy UK, pointed out that victims originally lost yuan rather than Bitcoin, which complicates efforts to return the assets. He explained that any sale would be subject to court-ordered compensation, and the remaining proceeds would potentially go to the Treasury and other recovery bodies. Earlier this year, the UK government also issued a £40 million tender for a crypto asset management framework, but it was later canceled due to inadequate bids. Despite legal and diplomatic complexities, the UK government seems very eager to liquidate its holdings. Critics argue the move is shortsighted. Jordan Walker of the Bitcoin Collective urged the government not to sell the Bitcoin, and warned that it could damage the UK’s long-term economic positioning. Bitcoin Policy UK also appealed to lawmakers in July of 2024 to consider amending laws to allow the country to keep valuable digital assets, though the request was reportedly ignored.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-22 05:30:00

While the current downturn may signal a cooling of investor enthusiasm, on-chain indicators suggest the market may still have room to expand before reaching an exhaustion point. Notably, activity among long-term holders and derivatives traders reveals continued interest and potential for price volatility. One of the standout indicators drawing attention is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders (LTH), which has climbed to a new high for 2025.

Gaah emphasized that although LTH SOPR has crossed the mid-range and currently sits slightly above 2.5, it remains well below the 4.0 threshold historically linked with macro tops in previous cycles. This implies that long-term investors are realizing gains, but not to an extent that would suggest market euphoria or widespread distribution. In past bull cycles, SOPR readings above 4.0 marked the onset of significant corrections or cycle tops. The gradual increase in profit-taking could indicate that the market is maturing while maintaining upward potential. Gaah notes that investors should interpret this as part of the natural progression of a bullish phase, though risks of correction still remain. The ongoing accumulation and realization patterns from LTHs provide insight into how confidence and caution can simultaneously exist in market behavior. Derivatives Market Remains Active Amid High Open Interest and Bullish Funding Rates In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain highlighted ongoing activity in the Bitcoin derivatives market as another crucial component of the current market landscape. Open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts, remains elevated near $42 billion. This level, though slightly down from recent peaks, is still near historical highs and reflects strong trader participation. Arab Chain also highlighted the role of funding rates in shaping market sentiment. Currently, rising funding rates suggest dominance by long positions, indicating a bullish market environment.

The analyst warned that a sudden price move could lead to widespread liquidations if funding becomes unsustainable, forcing exchanges to close out positions.

While Cardano and Chainlink hit technical headwinds, a meme-powered altcoin with community-first roots is gaining momentum: MAGACOIN FINANCE , a decentralized political memecoin attracting retail investors and ideologically aligned crypto participants alike. What Is MAGACOIN FINANCE? MAGACOIN FINANCE is a hybrid between an altcoin and a memecoin—designed not only to ride cultural narratives, but to embed itself in the ideological and decentralization ethos that defines Web3. Unlike traditional meme tokens that thrive only on virality, MAGACOIN FINANCE is grounded in purpose. At its core, the project is: A decentralized political memecoin built around themes of anti-centralization and free expression A zero-tax system that ensures transparent trading and encourages frictionless accumulation A community-owned protocol with no VC control or pre-mine, placing real power in the hands of users This dual identity—part ideological movement, part meme-layer coin—has enabled MAGACOIN FINANCE to attract both Dogecoin-style retail traders and more serious altcoin investors who value grassroots-driven ecosystems. How It Compares to Top Coins: Cardano and Chainlink Cardano (ADA), which has been credited with its scholarly nature, is now showing signs of resistance as its developers are not meeting timelines and growth in users is also slowing down. Many traders expected Cardano to break out of its year-long slump by having more transactions than it had in previous weeks, but that has not happened. Cardano daily transaction volume is down and a failure to keep up momentum may persist through Q3. While Chainlink (LINK) is important for the oracle infrastructure layer, it is stagnating due to better alternatives. Recent integrations haven’t resulted in a significant upside, and traders are now increasingly seeking alternatives with clearer upside catalysts and cultural stickiness. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a contrasting model: Its ideological positioning speaks to a market segment often underrepresented in crypto Its narrative-first approach mirrors the early rise of SHIBA INU and DOGE—but with deeper political resonance Its community-first growth is unencumbered by slow-moving roadmaps or enterprise entanglements Rather than trying to compete directly with infrastructure tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE creates its own category—one that merges culture, narrative, and crypto-native values. Momentum & Community Growth The project’s momentum is increasingly visible. Telegram groups dedicated to MAGACOIN FINANCE are expanding daily, while community forums and news aggregators show a spike in mentions. Key signs of momentum include: Rapid user onboarding via its official site Organic interest from both meme coin hunters and altcoin collectors Rumors of centralized exchange listings, though no official confirmation yet A growing social presence and meme-layer virality that reflect strong community energy This growth is rooted not just in hype, but in decentralized governance principles that attract long-term holders looking for more than just price action. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the next evolution of what a narrative token can be—where cultural capital meets crypto structure. Final Thoughts: A New Kind of Contender Enters the Arena With Cardano and Chainlink struggling to maintain their positions, and many of the meme giants like SHIBA and DOGE entering consolidation phases, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a meaningful alternative. As crypto investors seek tokens that reflect both momentum and mission, MAGACOIN FINANCE may not only outperform—it may redefine what a meme-powered altcoin can achieve.

Bitcoin price today is trading around $116,900, down by 0.5% on the day, struggling to hold higher within a visible descending channel on intraday charts. Traders are watching for signs of volatility expansion as price coils just above key demand. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) BTC price continues to respect the bounds of a descending parallel channel visible on the 2-hour chart, with clear lower highs and lower lows since the $123,000 rejection earlier in July. This structure is compressing price into a narrowing band, with support near $115,500 and resistance stacked around $118,000. RSI on the 2-hour chart is sitting at 41.49, reflecting fading bullish momentum. The MACD histogram remains flat with a minor bearish crossover, suggesting further indecision in the short term.

With a transparent, secure, and highly regulated market this year, Spain is reinforcing its reign over digital assets. Additionally, the government is providing clarity in the regulations to prevent crypto-related risks in the financial space while enhancing the fintech sector in the country. Table of contents Spain Crypto Laws 2025 What is the Spanish Government Saying About Crypto? Crypto License in Spain 2025 Requirements for CASP License in Spain Crypto Tax in Spain 2025 Capital Gains Tax Brackets for 2025 Crypto Adoption in Spain 2025 Conclusion FAQs Spain Crypto Laws 2025 July 4, 2025: BBVA Launches Crypto Services to Retail Customers Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria ( BBVA ), a multinational Spanish bank, launched crypto trading (Bitcoin and Ether) and custody services for retail customers. The services can be utilized through mobile apps. It has aligned the initiative with the EU’s Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) to govern the regulations and provide investor protection. June 2025: Law to Acquire Crypto Exchanges’ Data, Seize Digital Assets With the implementation of DAC8 crypto rules by 2026, Spain extends its measures to minimize criminal activity in the crypto space. In extension of its crypto tax policy, Spain announces that the Spanish tax agency is allowed to seize the cryptocurrency holdings of any user with tax debts. This also extends to other digital assets. December 30, 2025: Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) Implementation in Spain MiCA applications became fully applicable across the European Union (EU), including Spain, in 2024. All crypto asset service providers (CASPs) operating in these countries are required to fully implement MiCA rules. However, Spain opted for a quicker timeline to fully transition to MiCA compliance. December 30, 2024 – December 31, 2025 By shortening its transitional period, Spain has allowed existing CASPs to operate under current federal regulations while the entities fully transition to MiCA compliance. What is the Spanish Government Saying About Crypto? While the Spanish government has allowed the trade, mining, and use of cryptocurrency in the country, it is not recognized as a legal tender. The government holds a cautious and conservative stance on crypto, emphasising the importance of consumer protection and tax compliance. The Spanish government has taken several pro-crypto steps in the country, such as rescheduling the MiCA compliance. The MiCA compliance was originally scheduled to be fully implemented on July 1, 2026; however, the Spanish government opted to shorten the transition period by six months. It will not take effect on December 31, 2025. Besides enhancing the regulatory framework, the government is also actively working to terminate criminality in the crypto space. On June 25, the Spanish Guardia Civil, with support from law enforcement in the U.S., Estonia, and France, dismantled an international crypto fraud network that scammed over 5,000 victims across Europe and beyond. Crypto License in Spain 2025 Is there a cryptocurrency license in Spain? Yes, any entity providing crypto asset service in Spain requires a CASP license from the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV). Requirements for CASP License in Spain Companies seeking a CASP license in Spain require a physical office in the country. Along with that, a corporate bank account with financial clearance from the Central Bank of Spain is mandated. A detailed business plan, outlining strategy, platform use, client acquisition, and protection measures, is necessary. Companies must adhere to strict anti-money laundering (AML), counter terrorist financing (CFT), and know your customer (KYC) compliance. Only well-reputed companies with an AML officer for frequent compliance checking are eligible for a CASP license. Crypto Tax in Spain 2025 Under Article 33.1 of the Personal Income Tax Law — any change in a taxpayer’s net wealth is considered capital gain. Reporting crypto returns by June 30 every year is mandated. Crypto tax events: Sale, swap, or payment using crypto, receiving crypto as income, such as salary, from mining, staking, DeFi, airdrops, etc., are subject to tax in Spain. Penalty: Taxpayers must keep records of their tax returns and declare them properly every year. Otherwise, it will lead to significant fines or legal action. Tax Type Tax Rate Details Capital Gains Tax 19% to 28% Depending on the income Mining/Staking/Salary 24% to 47% Taxed as general income Wealth Tax 0.2% – 3.75% (if net wealth exceeds region threshold) Exceeding €700,000 Capital Gains Tax Brackets for 2025 Up to €6,000 – 19% €6,001 – €50,000 – 21% €50,001 – €200,000 – 23% €200,001 – €300,000 – 27% Above €300,000 – 28% Crypto Adoption in Spain 2025 Penetration Rate: Currently, the crypto user penetration rate is 50.97% , which is expected to increase up to 53.08% in 2026. As the MiCA compliance is anticipated from January 1, 2026, the number of crypto users is expected to reach 25.14 million. Crypto Revenue: The average revenue per user in Spain is estimated to be US$54.3, totaling US$1.3 billion in 2025. The crypto market is predicted to show a growth of 85.27%, resulting in total crypto revenue of US$2.4bn by 2026. Crypto Holdings: No public disclosure of the Spanish government’s crypto holdings; it rather prioritizes strengthening its control over the crypto space in the country. Conclusion Spain is already seeing a growth in adoption rate, as the government has intensified the security measures for crypto. It currently ranks among the top five EU nations for blockchain adoption and is globally known as a popular fintech hub. But the government is improving the regulations further to terminate the crypto fraud altogether in the country. So, from January 1, 2026, the entire landscape of cryptocurrency and other digital assets with change in Spain. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The reversal follows shifting investor sentiment and portfolio rebalancing, while Ethereum spot ETFs logged strong gains, pulling in nearly $297m the same day. The outflow marked a pause in what had been a robust period for Bitcoin funds, which had collectively attracted over $6.6b in net inflows since early July. This sudden shift may reflect profit-taking following Bitcoin’s stabilization in the $98,000 to $117,000 range after recent highs. Institutional investors, particularly those nearing quarter-end rebalancing cycles, could also be moving capital into alternative assets or reducing crypto exposure. Source: SoSoValue Top Bitcoin ETFs See Mixed Flows Despite Strong Trading Volumes Leading Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC, posted flat or negative net inflows. IBIT reported zero net inflow despite holding the largest net asset value among peers at $86.16b. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Grayscale’s GBTC recorded notable outflows of $77.46m and $36.75m, respectively. Overall, total net assets across all US Bitcoin spot ETFs now stand at $151.6b, accounting for 6.52% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Trading activity also remained strong, with $4.1b in daily volume on July 21, despite the outflow trend. Ethereum ETFs Extend Inflow Streak, Pulling in Nearly $300M in a Day In contrast, Ethereum spot ETFs continued their upward momentum. For the twelfth straight day, ETH-based funds attracted net inflows, totaling $296.59m. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack with $101.98m in new capital, bringing its cumulative inflow to over $8.16b. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $126.93m in daily inflow and a total net asset value of $2.08b. Grayscale’s twin Ethereum funds, ETHE and ETH, posted mixed results, with one recording a modest net outflow while the other gained $54.90m. Other players such as VanEck and Franklin Templeton also contributed to the day’s inflow momentum. Ethereum ETFs now manage a combined $19.6b in net assets, equivalent to 4.32% of Ethereum’s total market cap. Daily trading volumes reached $3.21b across the ETH ETF market. Analysts See Market Rebalancing as Ethereum Outpaces Bitcoin in Flows Analysts suggest the contrasting flows highlight diverging investor expectations. Bitcoin’s rally may be losing steam in the near term, while Ethereum is gaining traction after the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts proceed to the final vote . These proposed laws could pave the way for greater integration of Ethereum-based assets in traditional finance. Another factor drawing attention is the inclusion of staked Ether in ETF offerings. These structures allow investors to gain not just price exposure but also yield, making Ethereum products increasingly attractive to institutional portfolios. While Bitcoin’s dip may be temporary, the split in ETF flows shows a broader rebalancing underway in the digital asset space, where Ethereum’s evolving narrative continues to gain momentum.

Four years after paying $28 million for a Blue Origin seat, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pausing its lawsuit against him, this controversial crypto billionaire is set to board Jeff Bezos’s New Shepard rocket and venture into space. Announcing the crew for the next mission. Source: Blue Origin Understanding Justin Sun’s Space Journey Blue Origin announced that Sun will be one of six crew members for the company’s 34th mission, using its suborbital rocket system New Shepard. According to the company’s statement, Sun bid for the inaugural flight seat in 2021, contributing $28 million. The 2021 notice suggested that Sun would personally select the other five team members, with the company stating these members would come from “the TRON DAO community, comprising long-term holders of TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, NFT, and WIN.” Sun secured his seat on the upcoming NS-34 mission by submitting a winning bid of $28 million in June 2021. This substantial sum was donated directly to Club for the Future, Blue Origin’s foundation. To demonstrate the philanthropic intent behind his journey, Club for the Future subsequently distributed $1 million grants to 19 different space-focused nonprofits, highlighting the charitable impact of Sun’s involvement. Sun publicly shared his motivation, expressing his pride in “joining Blue Origin’s NS-34 mission and dedication to ‘encouraging youth to pursue their dreams in science and space!'” This endeavor aligns with his broader vision of leveraging technology to inspire future generations. From Scheduled Flight to Actual Takeoff Sun was originally supposed to join Bezos on the inaugural flight in 2021, but reportedly couldn’t make it due to “scheduling conflicts.” Months before he bid on that ticket, his company Poloniex settled charges with regulators for allegedly operating an unregistered crypto exchange. Later that year, he resigned as CEO of the Tron Foundation and became Grenada’s ambassador to the World Trade Organization.

However, they cautioned that the plans are subject to change. The move would make JPMorgan one of the largest US banks to endorse crypto into mainstream. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been a vocal skeptic of Bitcoin, calling the asset a “fraud.” However, he recently said that stablecoins are “real,” adding that JPMorgan will be involved both in deposit tokens and stablecoins. One source familiar with the matter told the FT that CEO Dimon, who once said he would fire any trader who traded crypto, has isolated some clients who dealt with crypto. Lending against crypto would let users pledge their BTC and ETH holdings to borrow loans. Major US banks’ pivot to crypto-based services follows a bullish crypto regulatory environment under the Trump administration. JPMorgan Already Allows Clients to Borrow Against Crypto ETFs The NYC-headquartered bank said in June that it will allow selected clients to borrow against crypto ETFs , starting with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. JPMorgan said it has plans to expand access to other funds after the rollout. The change would apply to wealthy clients, marking a shift in how cryptos are factored into credit decisions. However, lending against the actual digital assets would be the next key step. That said, JPMorgan would need to work on resolving the technical aspects of handling crypto seized from customers who failed to repay their loans. CEO Dimon also said that the bank will soon let clients buy Bitcoin , clarifying that it will not custody it.

President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law at the White House last Friday, creating a clear stablecoin regulation. “The entire crypto community, for years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,” said Trump, adding that this signing is a massive validation. Large Wall Street banks cheered the signing of the bill, calling the move an easier way for banks to deal with crypto assets. However, JPMorgan has remained cautious, setting realistic predictions on stablecoins. The banking giant forecasted that the stablecoin market will grow to $500 billion by 2028 . The bank doubled down on the trillion-dollar forecasts, calling them “far too optimistic.” “The idea that stablecoins will replace traditional money for everyday use is still far from reality,” the bank noted.

The Association of International Retail estimates reinstating VAT-free shopping could have EU tourists spend an additional £3.65 billion, roughly $4.9 billion. This would be in addition to the £1.5 billion, about $1.75 billion in non-EU visitor spending lost when the UK ended tax-free shopping in 2021. With the UK’s EU withdrawal from Brexit, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak discontinued the tourist VAT refund system. Thereafter, all subsequent Conservative and Labour governments, except Liz Truss’s brief administration, have upheld the belief that the policy posed a greater fiscal burden than benefit. UK visitor spending was lower than that of France and Spain British retailers claim they’re losing business to countries such as France and Spain, which still offer tax-free shopping to non-EU tourists . They’ve also criticised the Treasury for failing to consider the wider economic stimulus a tax-free policy can generate. Several major retailers, including Mulberry Group Plc, Fortnum & Mason Plc, and John Lewis, signed an open letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves last year, calling on the government to reinstate tourist tax-free shopping. However, after backing down on welfare cuts and declining growth, Reeves is contending with a fiscal deficit going into this year’s autumn budget. The fiscal strain reduces the likelihood of reconsidering her position on tax-free shopping. Having increased payroll taxes earlier this year, she is now under pressure to offer relief measures for businesses. According to the Association of International Retail, reinstating VAT refunds would set the UK apart as the only European nation offering such rebates to the EU’s 450 million citizens. The group also revealed that while UK visitor spending was at 92% of 2019 levels, Spain and France had exceeded those levels, reaching 106% and 110% respectively. Reeves also considers changes to import tax rules following UK retailers’ concerns. In April, Reeves said they intend to reassess the import tax rules to stop Chinese firms from flooding online marketplaces with cheap goods that undercut UK retailers. She said the government is reviewing rules allowing goods worth £135 or less, frequently listed on platforms such as Amazon, Shein, and Temu, to bypass customs duties. Sainsbury’s and Next are some of the retailers that have raised concerns about Chinese goods. She said, “I think that retailers can see, through the actions we’ve taken today around low-value imports, that we are absolutely standing up for the British high street against the dumping of cheap imports of products that undercut British retailers.” Retail entrepreneurs like Theo Paphitis showed their support for the Chancellor’s remarks. He argued that retailers have been raising their concerns for a while, and the rule review is necessary to shield the country’s economy and “a strong step in the right direction by the chancellor”. Beyond the UK, other countries are also taking steps to curb a flood of low-cost imports from Chinese retailers. In the US, new legislation has been introduced to scrap the “de minimis” rule, which currently allows shipments under $800 to bypass import taxes and regular customs checks. While originally intended to streamline e-commerce, the exemption is being rolled back in response to a surge in goods arriving from China. Similarly, in February, the EU announced plans to phase out its own exemption on customs duties for low-value parcels.

Imagine unlocking liquidity from your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings without having to sell them. This exciting prospect is no longer just a distant dream, as one of the world’s largest and most influential banks, JPMorgan Chase, is reportedly considering offering crypto-backed loans to its clients as early as next year. This potential move signifies a monumental shift in mainstream finance’s embrace of cryptocurrencies, moving beyond mere curiosity to tangible financial products. What Are Crypto-Backed Loans, and Why Are They a Game-Changer? At its core, a crypto-backed loan allows individuals or institutions to borrow fiat currency (like USD) by using their cryptocurrency holdings as collateral. Unlike selling your crypto, which can trigger capital gains taxes and remove you from potential future price appreciation, a crypto loan enables you to access funds while retaining ownership of your digital assets. This mechanism has been a staple in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space for years, but its potential entry into traditional banking through a behemoth like JPMorgan marks a significant maturation of the crypto market. Why is this a game-changer? For years, institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals have grappled with the illiquid nature of their substantial crypto portfolios. While they believe in the long-term value of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, converting them into spendable cash often comes with tax implications and the loss of exposure to market upside. Crypto-backed loans offer an elegant solution, bridging the gap between digital wealth and real-world financial needs. This move by JPMorgan could legitimize crypto as a viable asset class for lending within regulated financial frameworks, attracting even more institutional capital. JPMorgan’s Bold Step: Paving the Way for Institutional Crypto-Backed Loans? According to a report by the Financial Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, JPMorgan Chase is exploring the feasibility of offering loans collateralized by clients’ crypto holdings. This includes major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This consideration is particularly noteworthy given JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s historically skeptical stance on Bitcoin, famously calling it “a fraud” in 2017. However, the bank has steadily evolved its position, recognizing the underlying blockchain technology and the growing institutional demand for digital assets. JPMorgan’s potential foray into crypto-backed loans isn’t just about offering a new product; it’s about setting a precedent. As a global financial leader, their involvement could encourage other major banks and financial institutions to follow suit, accelerating the integration of digital assets into mainstream financial services. This institutional validation is crucial for the broader adoption and stability of the crypto market. It signals a move from speculative trading to practical utility, where digital assets can serve as collateral for traditional financial activities, unlocking vast amounts of previously locked-up capital. How Do Crypto-Backed Loans Actually Work? Understanding the mechanics of crypto-backed loans is essential for appreciating their value proposition. While specific terms may vary between providers, the general process involves a few key steps: Collateralization: A borrower pledges their cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) as collateral to secure a loan. This crypto is typically held in a secure, often segregated, account by the lender or a trusted third-party custodian. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: Lenders typically offer loans based on a percentage of the collateral’s value, known as the LTV ratio. For volatile assets like crypto, LTVs are usually lower than traditional loans (e.g., 30-50%) to account for potential price fluctuations. Interest Rates: Borrowers pay interest on the borrowed fiat currency, similar to traditional loans. Rates can vary based on the lender, loan amount, and LTV. Repayment and Collateral Release: Once the loan is repaid, the pledged cryptocurrency is returned to the borrower. Margin Calls and Liquidation: Due to crypto’s volatility, if the value of the collateral drops significantly and the LTV ratio exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the borrower may receive a “margin call,” requiring them to add more collateral or repay part of the loan. Failure to do so can lead to the liquidation of the collateral to cover the loan. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Traditional Loan (e.g., Mortgage) Crypto-Backed Loan Collateral Real Estate, Car, etc. Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) Asset Ownership Retained (though lien exists) Retained (collateralized) Liquidity Access cash for various needs Access cash without selling crypto Volatility Risk Lower (typically) Higher (significant) Tax Implications Generally none on loan receipt Avoids capital gains from selling crypto Market Impact Less direct impact Directly tied to crypto market fluctuations The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging Crypto-Backed Loans The emergence of crypto-backed loans presents a compelling proposition for crypto holders, but it’s crucial to understand both the advantages and the inherent risks. Benefits: Liquidity Without Selling: This is the primary draw. Holders can access fiat currency for immediate needs (e.g., investments, business expenses, personal liquidity) without liquidating their crypto assets, thus maintaining their long-term exposure to potential price appreciation. Tax Efficiency: In many jurisdictions, borrowing against an asset is not a taxable event, unlike selling it. This can be a significant advantage for those holding highly appreciated crypto assets. Retain Ownership and Upside: Borrowers continue to benefit if the value of their collateralized crypto increases, as they still “own” the underlying assets. Faster Access to Funds: Compared to traditional loans requiring extensive credit checks, crypto loans can often be processed much faster, sometimes within hours or days. Risks: Volatility Risk: This is the most significant risk. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. A sharp drop in the collateral’s value can trigger a margin call, forcing the borrower to add more crypto or face liquidation of their assets to cover the loan. Liquidation Risk: If a borrower cannot meet a margin call, the lender will sell the collateralized crypto to recover the loan amount. This means the borrower loses their crypto at an unfavorable price. Interest Rate Fluctuations: While some loans offer fixed rates, variable rates can increase, making repayment more expensive. Counterparty Risk: When dealing with centralized lenders, there’s a risk associated with the security and solvency of the lending platform or institution holding your collateral. JPMorgan, being a regulated bank, mitigates some of this risk compared to smaller, unregulated platforms. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Widespread Crypto-Backed Loans? While the prospect of major banks offering crypto-backed loans is exciting, several significant hurdles must be overcome before they become truly widespread: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Banks operate under strict regulations, and offering crypto-backed products requires clear guidelines on asset classification, capital requirements, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML)/know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. Custody and Security: Safely storing large quantities of diverse cryptocurrencies poses unique challenges. Banks need robust, institutional-grade custody solutions that are secure against hacks and operational errors. Valuation and Volatility Management: Accurately valuing highly volatile assets in real-time and managing the associated risks (e.g., margin call mechanisms, liquidation protocols) requires sophisticated systems and risk management frameworks. Market Education: Both institutional and retail clients need to be educated on the intricacies, benefits, and significant risks associated with crypto-backed loans . Integration with Legacy Systems: Traditional banks operate with complex, often decades-old IT infrastructure. Integrating novel crypto lending solutions seamlessly into these systems is a considerable technical challenge. The Future Landscape: Will Crypto-Backed Loans Become Mainstream? JPMorgan’s exploration into crypto-backed loans signals a pivotal moment for the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. If successful, this move could catalyze a broader trend among traditional financial institutions, leading to increased liquidity in the crypto market and providing sophisticated financial tools for crypto holders. It transforms cryptocurrencies from purely speculative investments into functional assets that can be leveraged within established financial ecosystems. The trajectory suggests that while challenges remain, the demand for such innovative financial products is growing. As regulatory frameworks mature and technological solutions become more robust, it is highly probable that crypto-backed loans will become an increasingly common offering, bridging the gap between the decentralized world of crypto and the established realm of traditional banking. In conclusion, JPMorgan Chase’s reported consideration of offering crypto-backed loans is far more than just a new banking product; it’s a powerful indicator of the growing acceptance and utility of digital assets within the global financial system. This strategic move by a banking giant underscores the evolving perception of cryptocurrencies, transitioning from niche speculative instruments to legitimate, leverageable assets. While the path to widespread adoption involves navigating regulatory complexities and inherent market volatilities, the potential for unlocking significant liquidity and fostering greater institutional participation is immense. This development marks a thrilling chapter in the convergence of traditional finance and the innovative world of crypto, promising a future where digital assets play an even more integral role in our financial lives. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto-backed loans? A1: Crypto-backed loans allow you to borrow traditional currency (like USD) by using your cryptocurrency holdings (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) as collateral, without having to sell your crypto assets. Q2: Why is JPMorgan’s interest in crypto-backed loans significant? A2: JPMorgan is a major global bank. Their consideration of these loans signals increasing institutional acceptance and legitimacy for cryptocurrencies within mainstream finance, potentially paving the way for other large financial institutions. Q3: What are the main benefits of taking out a crypto-backed loan? A3: Key benefits include gaining liquidity without selling your crypto (avoiding potential capital gains taxes), retaining ownership and upside potential of your digital assets, and often faster access to funds compared to traditional loans. Q4: What are the primary risks associated with crypto-backed loans? A4: The biggest risks are volatility and liquidation. If your collateral’s value drops significantly, you might face a margin call, requiring more collateral, or your crypto could be liquidated by the lender to cover the loan. Q5: Will crypto-backed loans become common for everyday users? A5: While currently more geared towards institutional and high-net-worth clients, if major banks like JPMorgan enter the space, it could eventually lead to more accessible and regulated crypto-backed loans for a broader range of users, depending on market demand and regulatory evolution. Q6: How does this development align with JPMorgan’s past stance on crypto? A6: JPMorgan’s stance has evolved significantly. While CEO Jamie Dimon was once a vocal critic, the bank has progressively embraced blockchain technology and digital assets, recognizing their potential. This move into crypto-backed loans is a continuation of that evolving strategy, adapting to market demand. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

This isn’t just any transaction; it marks the first significant movement of SpaceX Bitcoin holdings in three years, raising immediate questions and sparking intense speculation among investors and enthusiasts alike. What does this monumental transfer signify for the future of digital assets and the intersection of space exploration with the crypto economy? Unpacking the Massive SpaceX Bitcoin Transfer: What Happened? The news, initially reported by Aggr News and corroborated by Arkham data on X, indicates a substantial shift in SpaceX Bitcoin assets. For three years, these digital holdings remained largely dormant, a silent testament to the company’s long-term conviction in the leading cryptocurrency. The recent transfer of $152 million worth of BTC represents a significant change in this strategy. While the exact nature of the transfer—whether it was a sale, a reallocation, or an internal move—remains unconfirmed, its sheer size demands attention. Consider the context: Scale: $152 million is a considerable sum, even for a company as large as SpaceX. It highlights the significant value placed on Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Timing: The three-year hiatus makes this move particularly noteworthy. It suggests a deliberate decision influenced by current market conditions or internal financial strategies. Transparency (or lack thereof): Unlike publicly traded companies with more stringent disclosure requirements for crypto holdings, the specifics of SpaceX’s crypto activities often emerge from on-chain analytics rather than official announcements. This event underscores the growing importance of on-chain data in understanding institutional movements within the crypto space, offering glimpses into the strategies of major players like SpaceX and their approach to managing their Bitcoin portfolios. Why Did SpaceX Move Its Bitcoin Now? The timing of this SpaceX Bitcoin transfer is crucial. After three years of apparent dormancy, several factors could be at play, influencing such a significant financial decision. Understanding these potential motivations can offer insights into broader institutional attitudes towards digital assets. Possible reasons include: Market Optimization: Bitcoin has seen considerable volatility and growth over the past year. SpaceX might be optimizing its portfolio, potentially taking profits or rebalancing its asset allocation in response to market highs or anticipated shifts. Operational Funding: SpaceX is a capital-intensive business, constantly requiring funds for research, development, and ambitious projects like Starship and Starlink. Liquidating a portion of their Bitcoin holdings could provide a significant cash injection for ongoing operations or new ventures. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a powerful asset, companies often diversify their holdings to mitigate risk. This transfer could be part of a broader strategy to reallocate funds into other assets, traditional or otherwise. Regulatory Considerations: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Companies might adjust their holdings in anticipation of, or in response to, new regulations or accounting standards. Internal Treasury Management: It’s also possible the transfer is an internal reallocation between different wallets or entities within SpaceX, not necessarily a sale to external parties. This is a common practice for large organizations managing diverse asset portfolios. Without official statements, these remain speculative, but each possibility offers a lens through which to view the strategic financial decisions of a major tech and aerospace company engaging with Bitcoin . Elon Musk’s Influence on Bitcoin and the Crypto Market It’s impossible to discuss SpaceX Bitcoin holdings without acknowledging the profound, often whimsical, influence of its CEO, Elon Musk. His past comments and actions have frequently sent shockwaves through the crypto market, demonstrating the power of individual figures in a decentralized ecosystem. Musk’s crypto journey has been characterized by: Initial Enthusiasm: Early on, Musk was a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, with Tesla even announcing a significant BTC purchase and briefly accepting it for vehicle payments in 2021. This ignited a major bull run. Environmental Concerns: Later, Musk expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption, leading Tesla to halt BTC payments and causing a market downturn. This highlighted the sensitivity of the market to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Dogecoin Advocacy: Musk has famously championed Dogecoin, often tweeting about the meme coin and referring to himself as the “Dogefather,” which has consistently boosted its price. Broader Impact: His pronouncements, whether serious or satirical, often lead to immediate price fluctuations, showcasing the unique intersection of celebrity influence and digital asset markets. The SpaceX Bitcoin transfer, therefore, isn’t just a corporate financial move; it’s viewed through the prism of Musk’s known involvement and evolving stance on cryptocurrencies, adding another layer of intrigue to the story. The Broader Implications for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The movement of $152 million in SpaceX Bitcoin holdings carries significant weight beyond the company itself. It contributes to the ongoing narrative of institutional adoption of digital assets, a trend that has been steadily gaining momentum. Key implications include: Aspect Impact on Institutional Adoption Validation Even if a sale, the sheer fact that SpaceX held such a large amount of Bitcoin for years validates its status as a viable treasury asset for major corporations. Market Liquidity Large transfers, whether buying or selling, contribute to market liquidity and can influence price action, signaling active participation by big players. Transparency Push On-chain analysis of such moves pushes for greater transparency, even from private entities, as the crypto community actively tracks significant transactions. Future Precedent Such moves set precedents for how other large private companies might manage or disclose their digital asset holdings, especially as regulations mature. While the immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price might be short-lived, the long-term message is clear: major corporations are actively engaging with Bitcoin , integrating it into their financial strategies, even if those strategies involve periodic rebalancing. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Despite the excitement surrounding institutional interest in Bitcoin , it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate wildly, posing significant risk for corporate treasuries. Managing these assets requires sophisticated risk management strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of a clear, unified global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies presents legal and compliance hurdles for large corporations. Security: Holding substantial amounts of digital assets requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Public Perception: A company’s stance on crypto can influence its public image, especially given the ongoing debates around energy consumption and financial stability. SpaceX’s decision to move its Bitcoin highlights these complexities, showcasing that while the potential rewards are significant, so are the risks and operational demands. The reported $152 million SpaceX Bitcoin transfer marks a significant event in the ongoing saga of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. While the exact motives behind this first move in three years remain subject to speculation, it undeniably underscores Bitcoin’s enduring presence as a valuable asset in corporate treasuries, even for a pioneering company like SpaceX. Elon Musk’s continued, albeit sometimes unpredictable, involvement in the crypto space ensures that such movements will always be scrutinized, offering valuable insights into the evolving relationship between traditional finance, innovative technology, and the burgeoning world of digital assets. As the crypto market matures, the actions of major players like SpaceX will continue to shape its trajectory, making every significant transaction a point of keen observation for what lies ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly happened with SpaceX’s Bitcoin? A1: SpaceX reportedly transferred $152 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) for the first time in three years, according to on-chain data cited by Aggr News and Arkham. Q2: Is this a sale of SpaceX Bitcoin holdings? A2: The exact nature of the transfer (sale, internal reallocation, etc.) has not been officially confirmed by SpaceX. It is a significant movement of assets, but not necessarily a liquidation. Q3: How much Bitcoin does SpaceX own? A3: The precise total amount of Bitcoin held by SpaceX is not publicly disclosed. This $152 million transfer represents a portion of their holdings. Q4: How does Elon Musk influence Bitcoin prices? A4: Elon Musk’s public comments and actions regarding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have historically led to significant, sometimes rapid, price fluctuations due to his influential status and large following. Q5: What does this mean for institutional adoption of Bitcoin? A5: The SpaceX Bitcoin transfer reinforces the idea that major corporations view Bitcoin as a viable treasury asset. It highlights active management of these digital holdings and contributes to the ongoing narrative of mainstream institutional engagement with cryptocurrencies. Was this article insightful?

Among the tokens drawing the most interest right now are XRP , NEO and MAGACOIN FINANCE —each standing out for very different reasons, but all showing why the altcoin landscape is about more than quick speculative trades. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Mixing Meme Culture With Holder Power At the center of the latest altcoin discussions is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that bills itself as a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin . It’s not just relying on internet jokes and hype, though. Unlike many typical meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE comes with a built-in governance structure, giving holders an actual say in how things progress. That, along with a zero-tax model that keeps trading friction low, is striking a chord with investors who want to be part of more community-led, ideology-driven crypto experiments. It’s a project that taps into the same cultural excitement that’s propelled coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, but it’s also trying to build staying power through serious decentralized decision-making. XRP: Pushing Closer to Traditional Banking Meanwhile, XRP is making headlines for reasons that look very different from meme-driven assets. Ripple’s recent move to apply for a U.S. national banking license is a major attempt to tie crypto services more tightly to the traditional financial system. If approved, it would let Ripple operate under a unified federal framework, making it easier to hold reserves and scale its payment tools. At the same time, Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD is seeing growing adoption, with Swiss banks already offering custody and trading. And with speculation heating up over a possible XRP spot ETF, there’s plenty of attention around how this asset might evolve from here. Even so, some analysts point to technical signals showing XRP may be due for a breather after recent runs—adding another layer for investors to keep in mind. NEO: Quietly Building in Smart Contracts and DeFi NEO , for its part, is focusing on smart contract improvements and keeping its developer network active, especially across Asia. The blockchain has managed to push past a long-standing downtrend, with indicators like the MACD and RSI turning more neutral or slightly positive. It’s also staying engaged with the broader industry, recently taking part in Binance’s anniversary promotions alongside other major blockchains. NEO might not generate the same daily headlines, but for those looking at infrastructure plays and the steady buildout of decentralized applications, it remains a project worth watching. The Bottom Line: Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Getting the Spotlight While XRP continues to bridge crypto and banking and NEO doubles down on developer ecosystems, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching investor curiosity by blending cultural momentum with community-first governance . It’s an approach that moves meme coins beyond short-term fun, tapping into something potentially more lasting—where holders help decide the project’s direction. As the market keeps sorting out where real value and engagement lie, tokens that combine identity, decentralized power, and broad participation—like MAGACOIN FINANCE—are increasingly in the spotlight. For anyone keeping an eye on where the next wave of altcoin interest might settle, this is a story that’s hard to ignore.

Key Takeaways: SpaceX moved over $152 million in Bitcoin after three years of wallet inactivity. The transaction appears to be internal, with no change in net holdings. SpaceX’s total Bitcoin stash now stands at 6,977 BTC, held via Coinbase Prime. On July 22, a wallet linked to SpaceX executed a large Bitcoin transaction, transferring 1,308.45 BTC, valued at approximately $152.85 million, to a new address. The fee paid for the transaction was a mere 0.00024831 BTC (about $29), onchain data shows. SpaceX Wallet Springs to Life with Largest Move in 3 Years The recent large-scale movement came after the SpaceX wallet sent a small transaction of 0.000248 BTC (worth less than $30) to Coinbase Prime. Historical transaction logs reveal that between three and four years ago, SpaceX received multiple Bitcoin inflows from Coinbase wallets, with single deposits ranging from 1,100 to 1,279 BTC. At the time, the dollar value of these holdings exceeded $1.6 billion during the 2021 bull run, but the current value of the company’s BTC holdings stands at roughly $818.3 million. Arkham’s portfolio tracking indicates that SpaceX’s total Bitcoin holdings are now 6,977 BTC, stored under Coinbase Prime custody. The receiving address has not yet spent the funds, suggesting that the transfer may have been a wallet reshuffle, possibly for enhanced security or restructuring of cold storage protocols. SpaceX’s Foray into Bitcoin SpaceX first made headlines in 2021, when Elon Musk revealed that the company held Bitcoin , though he stopped short of giving precise figures. Subsequent reporting uncovered that by early 2021, SpaceX had amassed around 25,724 BTC , estimated at the time to be worth roughly $373 million However, the firm reportedly wrote down $373 million in Bitcoin holdings across 2021 and 2022 and may have sold all or most of it, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal . The report shows the firm had recorded these BTC assets on its balance sheet, though it’s unclear if the entire stash was liquidated. Elon Musk had publicly confirmed SpaceX’s Bitcoin investment in 2021 following Tesla’s $1.5 billion BTC purchase, which coincided with Bitcoin reaching then-record highs. Tesla later sold 75% of its Bitcoin in Q2 2022 for $936 million, retaining only $184 million worth. Musk, a vocal crypto advocate, has frequently influenced markets with his commentary on Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

The company has successfully secured an astounding $500 million in funding specifically earmarked to bolster its Bitcoin reserves . This bold decision, initially reported by Unfolded on X, marks a pivotal moment, signaling a growing convergence between traditional industries and the evolving world of digital assets. For many, it raises a compelling question: Is this the dawn of a new era where companies embrace digital currencies as core treasury holdings? Understanding Volcon’s Bold Move into Bitcoin Reserves Volcon’s decision to allocate such a substantial sum towards Bitcoin reserves is not just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic declaration. It positions the EV maker at the forefront of a burgeoning trend, where companies explore alternatives to conventional cash holdings. But what exactly does this mean for a publicly traded company, and why Bitcoin? Diversification Strategy: By holding Bitcoin, Volcon aims to diversify its treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and short-term investments, potentially hedging against inflation and currency devaluation. Innovation Alignment: As an EV manufacturer, Volcon is inherently linked to innovation and future technologies. Embracing Bitcoin aligns with this forward-thinking ethos, showcasing a readiness to adapt to new financial paradigms. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical performance, despite its volatility, has shown significant long-term growth potential, which could contribute to the company’s overall financial health. This move highlights a growing confidence among some corporate leaders in Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate store of value and a viable component of a modern treasury strategy. It’s a clear signal that the world’s leading cryptocurrency is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic one. Why Are Companies Considering Bitcoin Reserves ? The concept of holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet gained significant traction during periods of high inflation and low interest rates on traditional assets. Companies like MicroStrategy famously pioneered this approach, advocating for Bitcoin as a superior treasury asset. Volcon’s adoption of this strategy suggests a broader acceptance is on the horizon. Here’s a look at the core reasons: Feature Traditional Treasury (e.g., Cash, Bonds) Bitcoin Reserves Volatility Low to moderate High Inflation Hedge Potential Limited (cash), Moderate (some bonds) High (digital scarcity, decentralized nature) Liquidity High High (depending on exchange volume) Return Potential Low Potentially High Storage/Security Bank accounts, custodians Digital wallets, cold storage solutions As you can see, while traditional assets offer stability, Bitcoin reserves offer a different set of advantages, particularly in terms of potential growth and a hedge against the depreciating value of fiat currencies. The decision often boils down to a company’s risk appetite and its long-term financial outlook. The Intersection of EVs and Digital Assets: A New Frontier? Volcon’s identity as an electric vehicle manufacturer adds another layer of intrigue to its embrace of Bitcoin reserves . Both industries are synonymous with innovation, disruption, and a focus on the future. Could this be the beginning of a trend where tech-forward companies, particularly those in nascent sectors like EVs, increasingly look to digital assets to fuel their growth and secure their financial future? The EV sector is capital-intensive, requiring significant investment in research, development, and manufacturing. Securing $500 million for any purpose is a substantial feat, but earmarking it specifically for Bitcoin signals a strategic belief in the asset’s ability to appreciate and contribute to the company’s long-term financial stability. This move could inspire other companies in the renewable energy and technology spaces to re-evaluate their own treasury management strategies. What Are the Challenges and Risks of Holding Bitcoin Reserves ? While the potential benefits are appealing, holding Bitcoin reserves is not without its challenges and risks. Volatility remains Bitcoin’s most defining characteristic. Its price can fluctuate wildly in short periods, which could impact a company’s reported earnings and balance sheet stability. Market Volatility: Sudden price drops could lead to significant impairment charges on a company’s financial statements, affecting profitability. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions, posing potential compliance challenges. Security Concerns: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to protect against hacks and theft, which can be complex and costly. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting standards often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, leading to complex impairment tests. Companies considering such a strategy must perform extensive due diligence and have a clear understanding of these risks. Volcon’s decision suggests they have weighed these factors and are prepared to navigate the complexities involved in managing substantial Bitcoin reserves . Implications for the Broader Market and Future Trends Volcon’s audacious move could serve as a bellwether for other corporations. If their strategy proves successful, it might encourage more companies, especially those in the tech and innovation sectors, to consider Bitcoin as a viable component of their treasury. This could lead to a domino effect, driving further institutional adoption and potentially stabilizing Bitcoin’s price over the long term as more corporate capital flows into the asset. It also highlights a growing confidence in the underlying technology and the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market. The infrastructure for secure storage and management of digital assets is improving, making it more feasible for corporations to hold them. This trend signifies a significant evolution in corporate finance, moving beyond traditional assets into the digital realm. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses For investors, Volcon’s announcement provides a fascinating case study. It underscores the importance of staying informed about how companies are adapting to new financial technologies. For businesses, it prompts a critical review of current treasury strategies. Here are some key takeaways: Research and Due Diligence: Before considering Bitcoin reserves , thoroughly research the asset, its market dynamics, and the associated risks. Consult Experts: Engage with financial advisors, legal counsel, and cybersecurity experts who specialize in digital assets. Start Small: Companies new to crypto might consider a smaller allocation first to understand the operational complexities before scaling up. Long-Term Vision: Corporate Bitcoin holdings are often a long-term strategy, not a short-term speculative play. Volcon’s initiative is a powerful reminder that the financial landscape is constantly evolving, and embracing innovation can unlock new opportunities for growth and resilience. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Finance Volcon’s securing of $500 million for Bitcoin reserves is more than just a headline; it’s a testament to the evolving perception of digital assets within traditional corporate finance. This bold step by an EV manufacturer signals a potential paradigm shift, where Bitcoin is increasingly recognized not just as a speculative investment, but as a strategic treasury asset. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty persist, the potential benefits of diversification, inflation hedging, and long-term appreciation are proving too compelling for some forward-thinking companies to ignore. As the lines between traditional finance and the digital economy continue to blur, Volcon’s move offers a fascinating glimpse into the future of corporate treasury management, one where digital assets play a significant and growing role. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does Volcon’s $500M funding for Bitcoin reserves mean? Volcon, an EV maker, secured $500 million to purchase and hold Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. This means they are diversifying their assets beyond traditional cash and bonds, viewing Bitcoin as a strategic holding. Q2: Why would an EV company like Volcon hold Bitcoin reserves? Companies like Volcon might hold Bitcoin reserves for several reasons, including hedging against inflation, diversifying their treasury assets, aligning with an innovative brand image, and potentially benefiting from Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. Q3: Are there risks associated with a company holding Bitcoin reserves? Yes, significant risks include Bitcoin’s high price volatility, which can impact financial statements; regulatory uncertainty in the crypto space; and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect digital assets from theft. Q4: How does holding Bitcoin reserves differ from traditional treasury management? Traditional treasury management focuses on low-risk, highly liquid assets like cash, bonds, and money market funds. Holding Bitcoin reserves introduces a higher-risk, potentially higher-reward asset with different liquidity, accounting, and security considerations. Q5: Could other EV makers or tech companies follow Volcon’s lead? Volcon’s move could certainly inspire other companies, particularly those in innovation-driven sectors like electric vehicles and technology, to explore similar strategies for their corporate treasuries, especially if Volcon’s approach proves successful.

Investor caution intensified ahead of the August 1st U.S. tariff deadline, creating widespread uncertainty. Gold prices edged down to around $3,390 per ounce on Tuesday but remained close to a five-week-high. Malaysia’s annual inflation rate stood at 1.1% in June 2025, slightly below market consensus and May’s reading of 1.2%. This was the lowest print since February 2021. Singapore’s central bank will allocate SGD 1.1 billion to three asset managers—Avanda Investment Management, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Fullerton Fund Management—as part of its SGD 5 billion Equity Market Development Programme aimed at strengthening the local stock market. A 19% U.S. tariff on Indonesian exports could take effect earlier than the previously expected August 1 deadline, Indonesia’s chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto said Monday. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.30% to around 40,200, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.9% to 2,860 in post-holiday trading on Tuesday. The Japanese yen hovered around 147.5 per dollar on Tuesday after gaining about 1% in the previous session, as investors continued to digest the weekend’s election outcome. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's party lost its upper house majority, adding a layer of domestic political volatility to regional sentiment. Crucially, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to stay in office, easing fears of political instability or a sudden resignation. On trade, Japan’s chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa said Monday he still aims to strike a deal with the US by the August 1 deadline, despite the election setback. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that the U.S. will prioritize securing the best deal for itself in ongoing tariff negotiations with Japan. “Our priorities are not the internal workings of the Japanese government,” Bessent told CNBC. “Our priorities are giving the best deal for the American people.” China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.37% to around 3,555, while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.3% to 10,970 on Tuesday, snapping a three-day winning streak, and the offshore yuan hovered around 7.17 per dollar on Tuesday, trading in a narrowband, as markets continued to monitor fresh cues on Sino-US trade developments. China created a total of 6.95 million new urban jobs in the first half of 2025, achieving 58% of its annual target, official data showed on Tuesday, according to Xinhua. Separately, China’s Conflux Network launched a new offshore yuan-based stablecoin, a move seen as bolstering long-term CNH liquidity and advancing Beijing’s efforts to internationalize the yuan. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.24% to 24,916 during Tuesday’s morning session, snapping two-day strength as investors took profits after the Hang Seng hit a 3-1/2-year high in the prior session.

In the volatile world of Bitcoin, discerning the collective sentiment of traders can be a powerful edge. One of the most telling metrics for this is the Bitcoin long-short ratio , particularly for perpetual futures contracts. This crucial indicator offers a snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves, revealing whether the bulls or bears hold the upper hand at any given moment. Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures and explore what these numbers truly signify for your trading decisions. Understanding the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio: What Does it Mean? Before we analyze the numbers, it’s essential to grasp what the Bitcoin long-short ratio represents. In the simplest terms, it compares the number or volume of ‘long’ positions (bets that the price will go up) against ‘short’ positions (bets that the price will go down) on a specific asset, in this case, Bitcoin perpetual futures. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without needing to own the underlying asset, and unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date. A high Bitcoin long-short ratio , meaning more long positions than short, generally suggests a bullish sentiment in the market. Conversely, a low ratio, indicating more short positions, points towards a bearish outlook. This ratio acts as a sentiment gauge, offering insights into the prevailing mood among derivatives traders, which can often precede significant price movements. Why is the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio a Crucial Metric for Traders? For any serious cryptocurrency trader, understanding the market’s underlying sentiment is paramount. The Bitcoin long-short ratio provides a unique window into this collective mindset. Here’s why it’s so important: Sentiment Indicator: It directly reflects whether traders are predominantly optimistic (long) or pessimistic (short) about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Identifying Potential Reversals: Extreme ratios can sometimes signal an impending reversal. For example, an excessively high long ratio might suggest an overleveraged market ripe for a short squeeze or a correction. Similarly, an overly low short ratio could indicate a potential bounce. Confirmation Tool: When combined with other technical analysis tools, the Bitcoin long-short ratio can confirm or challenge your trading hypotheses. If your analysis suggests a bullish move and the ratio shows increasing long interest, it adds conviction. Understanding Liquidity: High trading volumes on both sides of the ratio indicate a healthy, liquid market, whereas heavily skewed ratios might suggest imbalances. A Closer Look: 24-Hour Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Data Let’s examine the recent 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios across key exchanges. This data provides a current snapshot of trader positioning: Category Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Market 48.62% 51.38% Binance 47.82% 52.18% Bybit 47.68% 52.32% Gate.io 52.10% 47.90% The overall market shows a slight lean towards short positions, with 51.38% of traders betting on a price decline compared to 48.62% betting on an increase. This indicates a marginally bearish sentiment across the aggregated data from major exchanges. What Does This Specific Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Tell Us? Analyzing the provided Bitcoin long-short ratio data reveals a nuanced picture: Overall Bearish Tilt: The aggregate data suggests that more traders are currently positioned for a downside move in Bitcoin. This doesn’t necessarily predict a crash, but it indicates a cautious or even bearish sentiment among a slight majority of perpetual futures traders. Major Exchange Consistency: Binance and Bybit, two of the largest derivatives exchanges, show a consistent bearish bias, with over 52% of positions leaning short. This reinforces the overall market sentiment seen in the total aggregate. These exchanges often represent a significant portion of the global trading volume, making their sentiment particularly influential. Gate.io’s Contrasting View: Interestingly, Gate.io presents a different scenario, with 52.10% long positions versus 47.90% short. This divergence could be attributed to several factors: a different user base with varying risk appetites, regional influences, or even specific arbitrage opportunities that might be more prevalent on that platform. It’s a reminder that market sentiment isn’t monolithic across all platforms. This data snapshot suggests that while there’s a slight collective bearish sentiment, it’s not overwhelmingly skewed. The difference between long and short is relatively narrow, indicating a market that could be consolidating or preparing for a move, with both sides having significant presence. How Can You Leverage the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio in Your Trading Strategy? Understanding the Bitcoin long-short ratio is one thing; applying it effectively in your trading strategy is another. Here are some actionable insights: As a Confirmation Tool: Use the ratio to confirm your existing analysis. If you’re considering a long position based on technical indicators, and the ratio shows increasing long interest, it can add confidence. Conversely, if you’re looking for a short and the ratio supports it, that’s another data point in your favor. Identifying Extremes: Pay close attention when the ratio becomes extremely skewed (e.g., 70%+ long or 70%+ short). Extreme readings can sometimes signal a contrarian opportunity. For instance, if too many traders are long, the market might be overextended and prone to a correction as liquidity gets thin for further upward moves. Spotting Divergences: If the price is rising but the Bitcoin long-short ratio is showing increasing short interest, it could indicate a weakening rally or a potential trap. Similarly, if the price is falling but long interest is growing, it might signal an upcoming bounce. Complement with Funding Rates: Funding rates for perpetual futures are closely related to the long-short ratio. Positive funding rates mean longs pay shorts (indicating more long demand), while negative rates mean shorts pay longs. Combining these two metrics can provide a more comprehensive view of market leverage and sentiment. Challenges and Nuances of Interpreting the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio While incredibly useful, the Bitcoin long-short ratio is not a crystal ball. It comes with its own set of challenges and nuances that traders must consider: Not a Standalone Indicator: Relying solely on the long-short ratio for trading decisions is risky. It should always be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools, such as price action, volume, support/resistance levels, and macroeconomic factors. Data Source Variations: As seen with Gate.io, ratios can vary significantly between exchanges due to different user bases, trading strategies, and even calculation methodologies. Aggregated data provides a broader view, but it’s wise to consider individual exchange data if you trade predominantly on one platform. Market Manipulation: Large institutional players or whales can sometimes manipulate the market by opening large positions that temporarily skew ratios, potentially trapping retail traders. Lagging vs. Leading: The ratio is often seen as a lagging indicator of sentiment rather than a leading indicator of price. It reflects current positioning, not necessarily future intent. However, extreme shifts can be predictive. Beyond the Numbers: The Psychology Behind the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio The Bitcoin long-short ratio isn’t just about statistics; it’s a reflection of human psychology in the market. Fear and greed are powerful emotions that drive trading decisions. When the ratio heavily favors longs, it might indicate excessive greed and overconfidence, potentially leading to a market correction. Conversely, an overwhelming short bias could suggest widespread fear and capitulation, often preceding a bounce as shorts get squeezed. Understanding this psychological underpinning helps in interpreting the data more effectively and avoiding herd mentality pitfalls. The Bitcoin long-short ratio for perpetual futures serves as a powerful, real-time indicator of market sentiment and trader positioning. While the current 24-hour data suggests a slight bearish bias across the aggregated market, the varying sentiments on individual exchanges like Gate.io highlight the diverse nature of the crypto trading landscape. For astute traders, integrating this ratio into a broader analytical framework, alongside other technical tools and a keen understanding of market psychology, can provide invaluable insights. It helps confirm biases, identify potential reversals, and ultimately contribute to more informed and strategic trading decisions in the dynamic Bitcoin market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Bitcoin long-short ratio? The Bitcoin long-short ratio compares the number or volume of ‘long’ positions (bets on price increase) to ‘short’ positions (bets on price decrease) on Bitcoin derivatives, particularly perpetual futures. It’s a key indicator of market sentiment. How often does the Bitcoin long-short ratio change? The Bitcoin long-short ratio is a dynamic metric that changes continuously as traders open and close positions. Data providers typically update it every few minutes or hours, offering a near real-time view of market sentiment. Is a high Bitcoin long-short ratio bullish or bearish? Generally, a high Bitcoin long-short ratio (more longs than shorts) is considered bullish, indicating positive market sentiment. Conversely, a low ratio (more shorts than longs) is considered bearish. However, extreme ratios can sometimes signal an impending reversal. Which exchanges provide Bitcoin long-short ratio data? Many major cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, OKX, Gate.io, and others, provide their own long-short ratio data. Aggregators also compile this data from multiple exchanges to offer a broader market overview. Can I rely solely on the Bitcoin long-short ratio for trading? No, it’s not advisable to rely solely on the Bitcoin long-short ratio for trading decisions. While valuable, it should be used as one of many tools in a comprehensive trading strategy, combined with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and risk management principles.

Hashed Emergent and Black Dot Policy Advisors have unveiled the COINS Act, a bold blueprint for crypto regulation in India. This is a first-of-its-kind model law, which focuses on clarity, innovation, and user rights. This is a big step toward establishing a progressive and consistent approach to Web3 policy in the country. COINS Act Pushes For Crypto Rights The draft law that puts user rights and innovation first, while giving regulators a clear path to follow. Although it is non-binding, the Act offes a clear framework for digital rights like self-custody, protocol access, and financial privacy. It also addressed key issues like high taxes, unclear regulations, and the need for a crypto regulator. Here’s what the COINS Act proposes: Digital Rights at the Core: The Act firmly protects key crypto-native rights like self-custody, privacy, and the freedom to deploy or interact with code as fundamental freedoms. A Crypto-Native Regulator: It suggests a dedicated crypto regulator with limited powers, focused on handling services based in India and not interfering with global decentralized protocols. The COINS Act proposes setting up a dedicated crypto regulator just for India, called CARA. This new body would focus only on crypto services aimed at Indian users, leaving out traditional regulators like RBI or SEBI. It’s designed to avoid overreach and keep things clear and focused. Clear Rules for Control & Custody: Centralized platforms would need full licenses, while non-custodial protocols face a light disclosure regime and decentralized protocols face no compliance. Safe Harbours to Boost Local Projects: The Act offers a time-limited safe zone for initial coin offerings (ICOs) in India, giving local crypto projects room to grow without heavy restrictions. Token launches have a two-year window with simpler rules. It also proposes a two-year pause on FEMA regulations to cut through red tape while more crypto-friendly policies are developed. Additionally, developers are protected from being held responsible for how end users use their protocols. Strategic Crypto Reserve: The Act also proposes a national reserve of Bitcoin and crypto assets, to strengthen India’s long-term digital sovereignty. Coins Act To Protect Crypto Rights And Simplify Rules The Act was created to fix the confusion around crypto rules in India. Currently, users face high taxes and unclear KYC/AML rules, but don’t have basic legal rights like self-custody or privacy. The Act takes a new approach by treating these rights as constitutional protections, and gives users a strong legal foundation. The framework also tailors these rights based on users’ control and custody of assets. Hashed Emergent shared in its report that the Indian government is set to release a long-awaited discussion paper on crypto regulation, a much-needed move after years of slow progress since the 2020 “ban.” It hopes that when the government’s paper drops, the COINS Act aims to be a pro-innovation blueprint the industry can get behind.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-22 06:20:31
48709959,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=771007,1753165330,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48709959.jpeg,Western Union announced plans to add cryptocurrency on- and off-ramp service,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/western-union-confirms-crypto-on-off-ramps/,"Western Union’s CEO Devin McGranahan said the firm’s new approach to digital innovation has greenlit the launch of a crypto on- and off-ramp service shortly. Speaking live on Bloomberg, McGranahan described what he said was the company’s vision to integrate stablecoins to enhance its cross-border money transfer experience. At the heart of Western Union’s endeavor are stablecoins — digital currencies tethered to fiat currency like the US dollar or the euro. These assets provide the speed and cheap transactional functionality of blockchain technology, but with the currency stability of traditional tender. McGranahan added that stablecoins can also cut costs and improve user service by cutting friction in international remittances. He said the company is also currently seeking relationships with blockchain and fintech companies to support these services. These partnerships allow customers to buy, sell, or redeem stablecoins for local currency in-store or through the company’s digital wallet. Western Union also imagines that customers could enter a Western Union branch, deposit cash, and send it instantly to the other side of the world, or receive it as stablecoins. The company is also considering incorporating stablecoins into its digital wallet products before eventually offering crypto-based financial services more broadly. Crypto users celebrate Western Union’s stablecoin shift Western Union’s announcement was met with excitement across the crypto space, seen as a significant stride toward mainstream adoption. The news spurred lively debate among influencers, developers, and analysts on X. “This is a game changer,” one wrote. “When giants like Western Union enter crypto, you know mainstream adoption is accelerating.” Another message hinted that the company would soon team up with Circle, the issuer of USDC, a stablecoin that is one of the most reputable and regulated in circulation. Others guessed that on-chain payment infrastructure companies like Stellar, Ripple, or Chainlink could be back-end integrators. More than mere optics, the decision is a cultural departure for a company that has historically kept a cautious distance from digital currencies. Only a few years ago, Western Union executives expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies’ volatility and compliance risk. The firm prepares to square up with Web3 startups and legacy financial systems like SWIFT, MoneyGram, and even central banks dabbling in CBDCs (digital bank currencies). Some believe Western Union’s move to jump on blockchain rails could force other financial giants to get on the rails—and be left behind in an ever-more digital global economy. Lawmakers back stablecoin growth to boost innovation Western Union’s crypto foray moves forward against strong pro-crypto policy momentum in the US and beyond. The biggest catalyst was the first US federal stablecoin bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this year. The bipartisan bill establishes clear rules around issuing, custody, and supporting stablecoins. Backers of the bill say it offers companies like Western Union the confidence to innovate in a once legally murky area. Legislators and tech CEOs are selling the law as a “giant leap” into superiority in American financial tech and a chance to take the baton from crypto-forward areas like Singapore, the UAE, and the EU. The latest market numbers show that more than $260 billion of stablecoins have been issued and are still in circulation, more than tripling since 2023. Analysts predict that the stablecoin market cap could surpass $3 trillion by the decade’s end, as global appetite for faster, cheaper, and programmable money accelerates. Western Union’s action puts it near the vanguard of the trend. It helps the company offset the risk of falling revenues in its existing business lines and to establish itself as a hybrid player, with one foot in legacy finance and another in the blockchain-powered future. McGranahan did not give exact rollout dates, but hinted that announcements will likely be made soon. Insiders say pilot projects in Latin America could commence as soon as Q4 2025, with a staggered global rollout to ensue.

Research Company Reveals,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-expected-in-the-feds-interest-rate-decision-to-be-announced-next-week-research-company-reveals/,"The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on July 30, according to Yardeni Research. According to research data, the probability of a rate cut remains at just 4.7%. While the strong employment data released in June delayed short-term rate cut expectations, a moderate inflation report in September is expected to reinforce signals of a potential rate cut. While markets have been on the rise with better-than-expected earnings figures announced for the second quarter, it is stated that if the Fed gives dovish messages next week, new momentum may be experienced in the stock markets. Meanwhile, although it is claimed that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is under increasing pressure from the White House to lower interest rates, market experts and economists do not expect a dovish move from the central bank in the short term. Related News: BREAKING: MicroStrategy Makes New Announcement to Purchase Bitcoin One of the most significant reasons for this is that Powell cannot make decisions alone on the FOMC, which sets monetary policy. He is only one member of the 12-member board. Furthermore, the Fed has a dual mission: to keep inflation under control while ensuring maximum employment. The current strong labor market does not create an environment that necessitates interest rate cuts. Furthermore, any new tariffs that may be implemented in the coming period could increase inflation. The Federal Reserve has held the federal funds rate target steady between 4.25% and 4.50% since December. The bank, which also left the rate unchanged at its June meeting, based its decision on inflationary rigidity, the impact of trade tariffs, and the need for more data. *This is not investment advice.

The exchange has brought renewed focus to Portnoy’s involvement with cryptocurrency and his claim of being the leader of the XRP army. Portnoy recently admitted he no longer holds XRP . In the clip shared by Rietveld, Portnoy explained that he sold his holdings at $2.40 after being advised by a third party who expressed concerns about competition from Circle. Following his sale, XRP climbed to a new all-time high of $3.65, leaving Portnoy regretful. “It’s up 60% since I sold it, and I would have made millions. I want to cry, and I don’t own it anymore,” Portnoy said. Dave Portnoy’s #XRP Dump!! pic.twitter.com/wimwJKqFFH — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 19, 2025 Rietveld Refutes Portnoy’s Leadership Claims Rietveld, a respected voice in the XRP community, was direct in his criticism. He rejected Portnoy’s self-appointed role as the “leader” of XRP supporters, arguing that such a position is incompatible with selling during a crucial period. Prominent XRP advocates have consistently advocated for holding the token , as its value extends beyond speculative trading. However, Portnoy’s decision to sell reveals that he was not invested for the long run as true XRP believers are, but was looking for a way to turn a quick profit. “You’re not the leader of the XRP army if you’re selling at $2.40,” Rietveld stated, highlighting the importance of conviction during a time when multiple bullish catalysts are coming together to boost the asset’s price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Call for Informed Holding Rietveld also noted that Portnoy’s decision was based on listening to individuals “who have no idea what they’re talking about,” rather than focusing on the broader developments around XRP. Rietveld referenced the anticipated influx of trillions in liquidity and other positive factors that have strengthened XRP’s position in the market. Portnoy’s situation highlights a major challenge faced by investors navigating volatile markets. His acknowledgment of missing out on significant gains reflects a common experience for traders reacting to external opinions rather than long-term fundamentals. Portnoy never held any leadership roles within the XRP army. Although he has previously advocated for XRP, even calling it the next Bitcoin , his decision to sell so early has called his so-called conviction into question.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to hold its ground as a community favorite, all eyes are quietly shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the altcoin that insiders are calling the top summer breakout token. Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale recently crossed 85% sold out at $0.03. This is as cheap as the token will ever be, with later phases guaranteeing a hike in price. Presale has garnered more than $12.8 million and attracted more than 13800 unique holders. Mutuum Finance might just be the one coin everyone wishes they’d grabbed before it takes off. This could be your last chance to get in before the crowd wakes up. Shiba Inu Holds Steady Amid Ecosystem Advancements Shiba Inu is currently trading around $0.0000150, showing relative stability with modest intraday movement between $0.0000145 and $0.0000153. The token has seen a lively 30% surge this month, spurred by increasing whale accumulation, AI‑integration initiatives, and heightened burn rates. Although market sentiment is bullish and the ecosystem, particularly Shibarium, Shibaswap and NFT utility, continues to strengthen, caution is warranted: targets above $0.000045 are still speculative, and downside risks could bring SHIB back toward $0.000008–$0.000012 in adverse conditions. Mutuum Presale Phase 5 Approaches Sellout as Demand Climbs Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in Phase 5 of its presale. The project stands out from other projects in that it has real use cases and does not rely on hype. Investor interest is growing with the project having already passed more than $12.8 million and having over 13800 token holders. Mutuum Finance Unveils New USD‑Backed Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully-collateralized USD-stabilized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was also audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms. Besides providing reassurance to the investors regarding the code base integrity and transparency, the audit conducted indicates that the project is confident to establish a secure DeFi protocol. The project has also launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK. The four categories of vulnerabilities are specifically categorized as critical, major, minor and low. Strengthening the Ecosystem Through Community and Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is awarding a $100,000 giveaway , as a token of appreciation to early supporters and in remembrance of presale frenzy. Ten winners will receive a $10,000 award in MUTM tokens as a token of appreciation for being among the early adopters of the project. The MUTM community is growing at an accelerating rate. With its unique leaderboard system top 50 holders of Mutuum Finance will be rewarded with bonus tokens. Smart Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance has raised $12.8M from 13,800+ investors, with over 85% of Phase 5 sold at $0.03. Price jumps 16.67% in Phase 6, with 2x returns expected at listing. Backed by a 95.0 CertiK score, a $50K bug bounty, and a $100K giveaway, MUTM is 2025’s breakout altcoin. Secure your allocation now at the official website before Phase 5 closes.

Key Takeaways: Western Union is exploring stablecoins to reduce remittance costs and improve service. The company is running settlement pilots and considering a crypto wallet. The GENIUS Act passage could pave the way for a broader shift toward digital dollar adoption. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday , CEO Devin McGranahan outlined how stablecoins could streamline cross-border transfers, improve currency conversion in underserved markets, and provide financial tools for populations grappling with unstable local currencies. “We see stablecoins really as an opportunity, not as a threat,” McGranahan said, pointing to ongoing pilot programs in South America and Africa. Western Union Pilots New Settlement Models The remittance heavyweight is testing new settlement models and exploring partnerships with infrastructure firms to accelerate foreign exchange processes and reduce the cost and time involved in sending money internationally. The remarks come amid a broader wave of interest in digital dollar equivalents, spurred by increasing regulatory clarity. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law , establishing a federal framework for the issuance and use of stablecoins. The law is already shifting the momentum among banks, fintechs, and traditional finance institutions, many of which had previously been hesitant to engage due to legal uncertainties. Western Union’s approach appears multifaceted. In addition to settlement pilots, the company is considering integrating crypto on- and off-ramp capabilities and even launching its own stablecoin wallet for specific jurisdictions. WESTERN UNION CEO: ""WE'RE INVESTIGATING HOW WE MIGHT OFFER STABLECOIN PRODUCTS IN OUR DIGITAL WALLETS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD,"" pic.twitter.com/UsFPpGN6tQ — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) July 22, 2025 These initiatives aim to cater to regions where banking access is limited, but mobile phone penetration remains high. Stablecoins are also gaining ground for their cost-efficiency. The global average remittance fee still hovers around 6.6%, well above the UN’s 3% target. However, not everyone is on board. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that private firms launching stablecoins could lead to privacy invasions and systemic risks. “Then they’ll come begging for a bailout when it inevitably blows up,” she said. Despite such concerns, interest from global corporations , including Amazon, Walmart, and Chinese giants like JD.com and Alipay, suggests the race is well underway. Stablecoins Edge Closer to Mainstream Adoption Stablecoins have emerged as one of crypto’s rare success stories, capturing the attention of corporations and regulators alike. Frank Combay of Next Generation said regulatory clarity , especially Europe’s MiCA framework, has unlocked stablecoins’ growth potential by removing the biggest barrier: uncertainty. He believes stablecoin ecosystems can reduce transaction costs by over 90% and are becoming increasingly attractive to both consumers and corporations. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory.

This unprecedented surge, as reported by CoinGlass data on July 22, marks a staggering increase of over 96% in just one month, with the total value of outstanding derivatives contracts denominated in ETH climbing to 15.69 million ETH. For anyone following the crypto markets, this isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal of growing conviction and potential future movements for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Understanding the Significance of Ethereum Open Interest Before diving deeper into what this record-breaking figure means, let’s clarify what ‘open interest’ truly represents. In the realm of derivatives trading, open interest refers to the total number of outstanding contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled or closed. It’s a crucial metric that provides insight into the liquidity and activity of a market. A high Ethereum open interest suggests a large number of participants are actively involved in the market, holding positions, and anticipating future price movements. Unlike trading volume, which measures the number of contracts traded over a specific period, open interest reflects the total amount of money committed to the market. When open interest rises, it indicates new money flowing into the market, either from new participants or existing ones increasing their exposure. Conversely, a decline suggests money is flowing out as contracts are closed. The recent data from CoinGlass paints a clear picture of this incredible growth: Metric Value (July 22) Compared to Previous Month Percentage Change Open Interest (ETH) 15.69 million ETH Approx. 8 million ETH +96% Open Interest (USD) $57.98 billion Approx. $29.5 billion +96% What Drives Such a Massive Ethereum Open Interest Surge? Several converging factors are likely contributing to this monumental rise in Ethereum open interest . Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the market’s current sentiment and potential future direction: Spot ETH ETF Speculation: The ongoing anticipation and regulatory developments surrounding a potential spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States have undoubtedly fueled significant institutional and retail interest. An approved ETF would open the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset, leading to increased demand across all related financial products, including derivatives. Upcoming Network Upgrades: Ethereum’s continuous development roadmap, including planned upgrades like the Dencun and Pectra updates, promises enhanced scalability, efficiency, and security. These technological advancements make the network more attractive for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and enterprise solutions, boosting long-term confidence in ETH. Broader Crypto Market Recovery: Following periods of consolidation, the wider cryptocurrency market has shown signs of renewed strength. Bitcoin’s resilience and the overall positive sentiment across major digital assets often spill over into Ethereum, encouraging more aggressive positioning in its derivatives market. Increased Institutional Participation: Large financial institutions are increasingly looking at crypto assets as legitimate investment vehicles. As more institutional capital enters the market, their preference for regulated and sophisticated financial instruments like futures and options naturally drives up open interest figures. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum remains the bedrock of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As DeFi protocols innovate and expand, the underlying demand for ETH as collateral, gas, and a base asset in these systems grows, which can indirectly influence derivatives positioning. Navigating the Waves: What Opportunities and Risks Does High Ethereum Open Interest Present? While a surging Ethereum open interest is often interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating strong conviction among traders, it’s essential to understand that it also comes with increased volatility and potential risks. The derivatives market is a double-edged sword, offering amplified gains but also magnified losses. Opportunities: Potential for Strong Price Movements: High open interest, especially when coupled with increasing prices, can suggest a strong bullish trend is forming, as more money is betting on price appreciation. Enhanced Liquidity: A larger number of open contracts means a deeper market, making it easier for large traders to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting prices. Market Confirmation: It acts as a confirmation of market conviction. If traders are willing to commit substantial capital, it indicates a collective belief in Ethereum’s future trajectory. Risks: Increased Volatility: A large number of open positions can lead to significant price swings, especially during liquidation cascades where a rapid drop in price triggers automatic selling of leveraged positions. Potential for Reversals: While high open interest can signal a trend, an extremely high concentration of positions in one direction (e.g., too many long contracts) can make the market vulnerable to a sharp reversal if sentiment shifts or a major liquidation event occurs. Funding Rate Dynamics: High open interest often leads to higher funding rates in perpetual futures markets, making it more expensive to hold long positions over time, which can pressure prices if traders are forced to close positions. Ensuring Informed Decisions in the Wake of Surging Ethereum Open Interest For both seasoned traders and new entrants, the record Ethereum open interest serves as a critical data point. However, it’s crucial to combine this information with other market indicators and a sound risk management strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Funding Rates: Pay attention to funding rates on perpetual futures exchanges. High positive funding rates suggest an overheated long market, which could precede a correction. Analyze Liquidation Levels: Understand where major liquidation clusters lie. These levels can act as magnets for price action during volatile periods. Look at Spot vs. Derivatives Volume: Compare the volume in the spot market with that in the derivatives market. A disconnect could indicate a derivatives-driven rally that might be less sustainable. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Given the potential for increased volatility, using appropriate position sizing, stop-loss orders, and avoiding excessive leverage is paramount. Stay Informed on Fundamentals: Keep abreast of Ethereum’s technological advancements, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment. Fundamental strength underpins long-term price appreciation. The unprecedented surge in Ethereum open interest is a testament to the growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its pivotal role in the future of decentralized finance and Web3. It reflects a powerful belief in the asset’s potential, driven by a confluence of technological advancements, institutional interest, and overall market optimism. This record high signals a dynamic and engaged market, brimming with both opportunities for growth and the inherent risks of increased leverage. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, market participants will be watching closely to see if this bullish conviction translates into sustained price action and further innovation. The journey of Ethereum is far from over, and its derivatives market continues to be a vibrant barometer of its evolving story. Whether you’re a long-term holder or an active trader, understanding the nuances of Ethereum open interest is essential for navigating this exciting landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Ethereum open interest? A: Ethereum open interest refers to the total number of outstanding or unsettled derivatives contracts (like futures or options) on Ethereum that have not yet been closed out by an offsetting trade or exercised. It indicates the total amount of capital committed to the Ethereum derivatives market. Q2: How does a high Ethereum open interest affect its price? A: A high Ethereum open interest often suggests strong market conviction and can precede significant price movements. If the majority of open contracts are long positions, it might indicate bullish sentiment and potential for upward price action. However, it also means increased potential for volatility and sharp reversals if sentiment shifts or liquidations occur. Q3: What caused this record surge in Ethereum open interest? A: Several factors likely contributed, including speculation around a spot Ethereum ETF approval, ongoing network upgrades (like Dencun and Pectra), a broader recovery in the crypto market, and increasing participation from institutional investors looking to gain exposure to Ethereum through derivatives. Q4: Is high open interest always a bullish sign for Ethereum? A: Not necessarily. While a rising Ethereum open interest often signals new money entering the market and strong conviction, it can also lead to an overheated market. If too many traders are leveraged long, a small price drop can trigger cascading liquidations, leading to a sharp downward movement. It’s crucial to analyze the ratio of long to short positions and funding rates. Q5: What are the main risks associated with high Ethereum open interest? A: The primary risks include increased market volatility, the potential for rapid liquidation cascades (especially for leveraged positions), and the possibility of sudden price reversals if market sentiment changes quickly. High funding rates can also make holding long positions expensive, potentially forcing closures. Q6: How can traders use Ethereum open interest data in their strategy? A: Traders can use Ethereum open interest as an indicator of market strength and potential trend continuation or reversal. Monitoring changes in open interest alongside price action, funding rates, and liquidation levels can help identify periods of high conviction or potential market vulnerability, aiding in risk management and trade entry/exit decisions.

According to data from crypto analytics platform Arkham , SpaceX transferred 1,308 BTC (worth around $152 million) to an unknown wallet earlier today. SpaceX Moves BTC for First Time Since 2022 The transaction occurred at 13:09 (UTC+8) and is the first since June 2022, when SpaceX sent 3,505 BTC to Coinbase. SpaceX still holds 6,977 BTC, valued at roughly $815 million. The unexpected transfer has sparked curiosity in the community. SpaceX( @SpaceX ) transferred 1,308 $BTC ($153M) to a new wallet after 3 years of dormancy. https://t.co/zW62EKM2RD pic.twitter.com/OAwmEKBbOa — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 22, 2025 The BTC hasn’t moved since the transfer, which shows that it might just be an internal shuffle, likely for added security or cold storage reorganization. Arkham had previously reported that Tesla and SpaceX together held around $2 billion in Bitcoin. Both companies bought them at an average price of $32,000 and are now up almost $1.5 billion on Bitcoin. While Tesla’s BTC holdings have been public since 2021, SpaceX’s stash was only recently confirmed through wallet tracking. This shows how major firms may hold crypto quietly and profit big over time. Whales Take Profits as BTC Hits New High Bitcoin whales made waves in the market recently. On July 17, they moved a massive 61,000 BTC to exchanges, marking the biggest single-day inflow in over a year. This triggered a 4% dip, pulling Bitcoin down from its $123K high to around $117K–$118K. Cryptoquant analysts note that over the past few days, BTC inflows to exchanges jumped by nearly $17B, rising from $28B to $45B between July 14–18. The spike in inflows was similar to what was seen at the previous market tops. This suggests that whales may have used Bitcoin’s new all-time high to take profits. However, the daily inflows are now declining, and if the trend continues, it could help ease selling pressure and give the market some breathing room.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ARKM|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-22 07:31:06

Recently, this inherent volatility was perfectly encapsulated by comments from Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who took to social media to celebrate significant gains in the Ethereum price . His latest remarks serve as a powerful reminder that in the crypto space, patience and a willingness to embrace market swings can sometimes lead to surprising turnarounds. Eric Trump’s Journey with the Ethereum Price It’s no secret that the crypto market can be a rollercoaster, and Eric Trump has publicly experienced its ups and downs. Earlier this year, he found himself at the center of online jest after publicly endorsing Ethereum price as a good buying opportunity. His February X post, suggesting it was an opportune moment to invest, was met with considerable mockery when the Ethereum price subsequently experienced a significant downturn, dropping by more than 40% from its peak at that time. Many were quick to highlight the apparent misjudgment, questioning his timing and market foresight. However, the crypto narrative is rarely linear. Fast forward to July 22, and the tables had turned. With Ethereum price witnessing a robust recovery, showing an impressive gain of approximately 35% over five months, Eric Trump seized the moment. He responded to an earlier X post by OKX partner Ted Pillows, declaring, “How am I doing now @TedPillows?” and followed up with a concise yet impactful message: “Up 35% in 5 months, Pal. Embrace volatility.” This statement resonated deeply within the crypto community, embodying the resilient spirit required to navigate such an unpredictable market. Understanding What Drives the Ethereum Price What exactly fuels these dramatic shifts in the Ethereum price ? Understanding the underlying factors is crucial for anyone looking to navigate this complex market. Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is influenced by a multitude of interconnected elements: Network Upgrades: Major protocol changes, such as the Merge (transition to Proof-of-Stake) and upcoming enhancements like Dencun and Pectra, significantly impact market sentiment. These upgrades aim to improve scalability, security, and efficiency, making the network more attractive for users and developers. Decentralized Applications (dApps) and DeFi Growth: Ethereum is the foundational layer for thousands of dApps, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Web3 initiatives. The more adoption and innovation within this ecosystem, the higher the demand for ETH (used for gas fees and staking), directly influencing its price. Supply and Demand Dynamics: Like any asset, the balance between ETH’s supply and demand plays a critical role. Factors like increased staking, burning mechanisms (EIP-1559), and institutional accumulation can reduce the circulating supply, potentially driving up the Ethereum price if demand remains constant or increases. Macroeconomic Conditions: Broader economic trends, interest rates, inflation, and global liquidity can influence investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. A “risk-on” environment often benefits crypto, while “risk-off” periods can lead to corrections. Regulatory Developments: News regarding cryptocurrency regulation from major economies can significantly sway market sentiment. Clear, favorable regulations can instill confidence, while restrictive measures can cause uncertainty and price drops. Embracing Volatility: A Core Crypto Principle for the Ethereum Price Eric Trump’s simple phrase, “Embrace volatility,” captures a fundamental truth about cryptocurrency investing. Unlike traditional markets that might see percentage changes in single digits over months, crypto can swing by tens of percentages in days or even hours. This high volatility is a double-edged sword: it presents opportunities for rapid gains but also carries the risk of substantial losses. For many seasoned crypto enthusiasts, volatility is not something to fear but to understand and, if possible, leverage. It’s a natural characteristic of a nascent, global, 24/7 market that is still maturing and reacting intensely to news, technological advancements, and shifts in public perception. Those who succeed in this environment often adopt a long-term perspective, focusing on the underlying technology and ecosystem growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Strategies for Navigating the Ethereum Price Swings: What Can Investors Do? Given the inherent volatility, how can individuals approach investing in assets like Ethereum? Here are some actionable insights and strategies: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the Ethereum price . This strategy helps average out the purchase price over time, reducing the risk associated with a single large investment at an unfavorable price point. Risk Management: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. The crypto market is speculative, and while the potential for returns is high, so is the risk of capital loss. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just crypto can also help mitigate overall risk. Long-Term Vision: Many successful crypto investors advocate for a “HODL” (Hold On for Dear Life) strategy, which involves holding assets for an extended period, often years, to ride out short-term volatility and benefit from long-term growth. This approach aligns with the “embrace volatility” mindset. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, broader crypto news, and macroeconomic trends. Understanding the fundamentals behind the technology and market dynamics can help make more informed decisions. Emotional Discipline: Perhaps the most challenging aspect is managing emotions. Panic selling during dips or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying during rallies often leads to poor outcomes. Sticking to a predefined investment plan is crucial. The Broader Impact of Ethereum’s Performance on the Crypto Market As a leading cryptocurrency, the performance of the Ethereum price often acts as a bellwether for the broader altcoin market. When ETH sees significant gains, it can pull other Layer 1 blockchains and DeFi tokens along with it, signaling renewed investor confidence in the decentralized finance and Web3 sectors. Conversely, a sharp decline in Ethereum price can trigger sell-offs across the altcoin spectrum. Ethereum’s continued development, particularly its shift towards a more sustainable and scalable Proof-of-Stake model, positions it as a critical infrastructure for the future of decentralized internet. Its ability to host a vast array of applications, from digital art marketplaces to complex financial instruments, underscores its pivotal role in the digital economy. The recent price appreciation, celebrated by figures like Eric Trump, not only reflects market sentiment but also the ongoing belief in Ethereum’s transformative potential. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Crypto Eric Trump’s recent celebration of Ethereum price gains serves as a powerful anecdote in the ever-unfolding story of cryptocurrency. It highlights that market volatility, while daunting, is an intrinsic part of this innovative asset class. His journey from being mocked for a premature prediction to triumphantly pointing to a 35% gain encapsulates the resilience and long-term perspective often required to succeed in crypto. For investors, the key lies not in avoiding volatility but in understanding its drivers, managing risks, and adopting disciplined strategies. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and expand, its price will undoubtedly continue its fascinating dance, offering both challenges and compelling opportunities for those willing to embrace the ride. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethereum (ETH)? Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin and serves as a platform for numerous decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 projects. Q2: Why is the Ethereum price so volatile? The Ethereum price is volatile due to several factors, including its relatively small market size compared to traditional assets, 24/7 global trading, rapid news cycles, speculative trading, and ongoing regulatory uncertainties. These elements can cause dramatic price swings in short periods. Q3: What does “embrace volatility” mean in crypto investing? “Embrace volatility” means acknowledging and accepting that large price fluctuations are normal in the crypto market. It encourages investors to focus on long-term trends and fundamental value rather than reacting emotionally to short-term price movements, often employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging. Q4: How do Ethereum network upgrades affect its price? Major network upgrades, such as the Merge (transition to Proof-of-Stake) and future improvements, are designed to enhance Ethereum’s scalability, security, and sustainability. Successful upgrades can increase investor confidence and network utility, potentially leading to a positive impact on the Ethereum price by increasing demand and reducing supply (through staking). Q5: Is Eric Trump’s opinion a reliable indicator for Ethereum price movements? While Eric Trump’s comments highlight a public figure’s engagement with crypto, individual opinions, even from prominent figures, are generally not considered reliable indicators for market movements. The crypto market is influenced by complex technical, economic, and fundamental factors, not just individual endorsements. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The protocol saw a peak level of unprocessed withdrawals, while wstETH fell from its recent highs. The recent Ethereum (ETH) rally was favorable for some DeFi protocols. In the case of Lido DAO, the ETH rally caused a drive to withdraw the tokens from liquid staking. The spike in withdrawals arrived after ETH rallied above $3,800 for the first time in months. Later, ETH sank to $3,692.72 as the overall market rally paused for consolidation. A total of 228,992 ETH is waiting to be unstaked, with an average waiting time of 71 hours. Both whale and retail batches of ETH have been trying to leave Lido at the highest rate for the past two years. One reason may be the presence of ETH locked at a lower price, attempting to free up assets and realize profits. Lido DAO saw peak requests for unstaking, with the highest unprocessed queue for the past two years. | Source: Dune Analytics Recently, the value locked in Lido expanded above $34B , based on the notional ETH valuation. The protocol offers 2.8% in annualized passive income, in addition to issuing the stETH and Wrapped stETH tokens for additional DeFi activities. Wrapped stETH slides from the recent peak As the use cases for regular ETH shift, Wrapped stETH has slid from its recent peak. The token habitually traded at a premium to ETH, recently peaking above $4,600. In the past day, WSTETH retained its downward trend, losing 2.4% to $4,446.47. The recent slide also happened on record trading volumes. WSTETH is mostly swapped against stETH and regular ETH, using Uniswap decentralized pairs. Even through DEX, the token achieves over $148M in daily volumes, expanding activity to a three-month peak. The WSTETH premium means traders can acquire more ETH due to appreciation, or swap to stETH and then unstake it through the smart contract. WSTETH makes up 1.28% of locked ETH reserves, and the exodus may not hurt the ecosystem at scale. However, the turning of the trend may signal a shift in general Ethereum use cases. Lido dominance in ETH staking slides lower In the past two years, Lido’s staking dominance has fallen from over 75% of staked ETH to around 62.8%. The biggest challenge came from Binance staking, which expanded its share from under 3% to over 20% since 2023. At the same time, Lido is confident its stETH may be used by institutions for both ETF passive income and as a way to put ETH treasuries to work. Lido has slowed down in the past year, though the protocol still generates robust revenues per user and remains a part of the basic DeFi infrastructure. Recently, Lido added BitGo as its first US-based custodian to offer staking infrastructure. Similar unstaking events have happened before, though the protocol retained its influence while continuing to build its roadmap. In the coming months, Lido V3 is seen as a potential staking mechanism for the inflow of institutions into ETH. Overall, 30% of ETH remains locked in the Beacon Chain contract, and unstaking remains rare even for older whales.

The world of digital assets is constantly buzzing with predictions and analyses, but few capture attention quite like a bold forecast for the future of Bitcoin. Recently, a prominent analyst from CryptoQuant, Axel Adler Jr., shared an intriguing perspective that suggests the Bitcoin price could soar to an impressive $139,000 without entering what he terms an ‘overheated’ phase. This isn’t just a random guess; it’s based on specific on-chain metrics that paint a compelling picture of continued growth potential. For anyone invested in or considering the world’s leading cryptocurrency, understanding this outlook is crucial. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Optimism? The core of Adler Jr.’s analysis lies in CryptoQuant’s unique framework, which identifies specific zones for Bitcoin’s market behavior. Currently, with the Bitcoin price hovering around $117,000, it resides comfortably within what’s called the ‘growth zone.’ This zone is defined by two key levels: the Investor Price Median and the Hype Alert level. The Investor Price Median, currently sitting around $92,000, represents a baseline of strong investor accumulation and conviction. It suggests that a significant portion of the market is holding Bitcoin with a long-term view, providing a robust foundation for upward movement. On the other hand, the Hype Alert level, pegged at $139,000, signifies the point at which the market might start showing signs of excessive optimism or ‘overheating.’ What’s remarkable about Adler Jr.’s current assessment is that the Bitcoin price can reach this $139,000 mark without necessarily triggering the ‘overheated’ status. This implies that even at that elevated level, there would still be underlying buying support and a healthy market structure, rather than a speculative bubble on the verge of popping. This nuanced perspective offers a refreshing take in a market often characterized by rapid, unpredictable swings. Understanding the Bitcoin Price ‘Growth Zone’ To truly grasp the significance of CryptoQuant’s analysis, it’s essential to delve deeper into what these ‘zones’ represent for the Bitcoin price . These aren’t just arbitrary numbers; they are derived from sophisticated on-chain data analysis, tracking the behavior of various market participants, from long-term holders to short-term speculators. The ‘growth zone’ is essentially a sweet spot where fundamental accumulation meets healthy market interest, allowing for sustainable price appreciation. Let’s break down the key levels: Investor Price Median ($92,000): This level acts as a strong support base. It represents the average acquisition cost for a significant segment of long-term investors. When the Bitcoin price stays above this, it indicates that these investors are in profit and less likely to sell, providing a stable floor. It’s a testament to the underlying demand from those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Hype Alert Level ($139,000): This is the upper boundary of the growth zone. While reaching this level is significant, Adler Jr.’s point is that it doesn’t automatically signal a market top or an impending crash. Instead, it’s the point where caution might become necessary, but not necessarily panic. The absence of ‘overheating’ at this level implies that demand is still organic and not solely driven by speculative frenzy. This framework allows analysts to gauge market sentiment and health more accurately than just looking at price charts alone. It provides a window into the collective psychology and conviction of Bitcoin holders, which is a powerful indicator for future Bitcoin price movements. Is This Bitcoin Price Prediction Realistic? A $139,000 Bitcoin price target might sound ambitious to some, especially given the cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility. However, several factors lend credibility to such a projection, particularly when viewed through the lens of fundamental analysis and historical cycles. Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC entering the market, have historically preceded significant bull runs. While the most recent halving has passed, its full supply-side impact often unfolds over the subsequent months and years. Furthermore, increasing institutional adoption continues to be a major catalyst. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, bringing in substantial capital. Large corporations and even some sovereign nations are also exploring or implementing Bitcoin into their treasuries or financial systems, further solidifying its position as a legitimate asset class. These factors contribute to a growing demand side that can absorb higher prices without necessarily becoming ‘overheated.’ However, it’s equally important to consider potential challenges. Regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions, unforeseen macroeconomic downturns, or significant shifts in investor sentiment could all impact the trajectory of the Bitcoin price . While Adler Jr.’s analysis focuses on on-chain health, external factors always play a role. A balanced perspective acknowledges both the immense potential and the inherent risks of the crypto market.

The analyst’s perspective suggests that there’s still significant room for growth, implying that current price levels might represent an attractive entry or accumulation point for those with a long-term horizon. However, it’s crucial to approach the market with a well-defined strategy. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While expert analysis provides valuable insights, always cross-reference information and understand the underlying metrics yourself. The more informed you are, the better decisions you can make regarding your Bitcoin price investments. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, which is notoriously difficult, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate volatility and can lead to a lower average purchase price over time. Understand Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market, while offering high rewards, also carries high risks. Diversifying your portfolio and setting clear profit targets and stop-losses can help protect your capital. Stay Informed: The crypto landscape evolves rapidly. Keep up with news, regulatory developments, and on-chain analysis from reputable sources to make timely and informed decisions about your Bitcoin price holdings. This period, within the ‘growth zone,’ could be an opportune time for strategic positioning, but always with an awareness of market dynamics and personal financial goals. In conclusion, the latest analysis from CryptoQuant offers a compelling and well-reasoned argument for a significant upside in the Bitcoin price , potentially reaching $139,000 without triggering the typical signs of an overheated market. This perspective, rooted in on-chain data and the concept of a ‘growth zone,’ highlights the underlying strength and sustained buying support for Bitcoin. While the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable, such expert insights provide valuable guidance for investors navigating its exciting yet challenging terrain. The journey to $139,000, if it unfolds as predicted, promises to be a remarkable chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing story, driven by genuine demand rather than pure speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘overheated’ mean in the context of Bitcoin price? ‘Overheated’ typically refers to a market condition where prices rise rapidly due to excessive speculation and irrational exuberance, often detached from fundamental value. It’s usually a precursor to a significant correction or crash, as demand becomes unsustainable. Who is Axel Adler Jr. and why is his analysis relevant for Bitcoin price? Axel Adler Jr. is an analyst at CryptoQuant, a well-respected on-chain analytics platform. CryptoQuant specializes in providing data-driven insights into cryptocurrency markets by analyzing blockchain data, which can reveal underlying market trends and participant behavior not visible on simple price charts. His analysis is relevant because it’s based on empirical, on-chain metrics rather than just technical analysis. What is the ‘Investor Price Median’ and how does it relate to the Bitcoin price? The Investor Price Median is an on-chain metric that estimates the average acquisition cost for a significant portion of long-term Bitcoin investors. When the current Bitcoin price is above this median, it suggests that these long-term holders are in profit and less likely to sell, providing a strong support level and indicating overall market health. What is the ‘Hype Alert’ level for Bitcoin price? The ‘Hype Alert’ level, currently set at $139,000 in this analysis, is a threshold identified by CryptoQuant beyond which the market might start exhibiting signs of excessive speculative activity. While reaching this level doesn’t guarantee a crash, it signals a point where increased caution might be warranted due to heightened market optimism. Should I invest in Bitcoin based on this prediction? This analysis provides a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price , but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. It’s crucial to conduct your own thorough research, understand your risk tolerance, and consider your financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor is always recommended before making significant investment choices in volatile markets like cryptocurrency.

Overview Cryptocurrency Alchemy Pay Token ACH Price $0.02483 Market Cap $234.68Million Trading Volume (24-hour) $53.2M Circulating Supply 10 Billion ACH All-time High $0.1975 Aug 06, 2021 All-time Low $0.001338 Jul 20, 2021 24-h High $0.0275 24-h Low $0.02435 Alchemy Pay price prediction: Technical analysis Price Prediction $ 0.160686 (548.67%) Price Volatility 11.36% 50-Day SMA $ 0.020671 14-Day RSI 72.95 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.022405 Alchemy Pay price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Alchemy Pay has surged above its 20‑day moving average and touched the upper Bollinger band highlighting strong bullish interest Daily RSI around 62 and a positive MACD cross suggest the downtrend has reversed and momentum remains intact On the four‑hour chart price found support at the 20‑period SMA and rallied toward 0.026 a sustained close above that level could drive price toward 0.030 ACH/USD 1-day chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView Alchemy Pay’s daily chart shows a clear breakout above its 20‑day moving average and mid‑Bollinger line, reflecting renewed buyer interest even as yesterday’s spike near $0.026 encountered resistance. The current RSI around 62 suggests momentum remains bullish but a short‑term pullback toward the rising 20‑day SMA near $0.021–$0.022 is likely as profit‑taking sets in. That support zone aligns with the lower Bollinger band and previous congestion, so a bounce there would validate the uptrend. If buyers step in, look for a retest of $0.028–$0.030. Failure to hold $0.021 could trigger a deeper retreat toward $0.018. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView On the four‑hour chart Alchemy Pay has carved out a steady uptrend that recently encountered resistance at the $0.026 level while bouncing off its 20‑period moving average near $0.022. The Bollinger bands have widened, reflecting increased volatility, yet price remains comfortably within the bands rather than riding the upper band, suggesting measured buying rather than a frenzied spike. The MACD lines are converging above zero, showing that bullish momentum is still intact but cooling off slightly. RSI sits around 60, indicating room for further gains before overbought pressures build. A sustained break above $0.026 would likely trigger fresh buying toward $0.030.

Daily RSI hovers around 62, showing momentum without extreme overbought conditions, while MACD has turned positive, signaling a trend reversal. On the four‑hour timeframe price has respected its 20‑period SMA as support and rallied off that level toward $0.026.

XRP/BTC Rally Is Just the Beginning,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-xrp-price-hit-double-digits-in-2025-xrp-btc-rally-is-just-the-beginning/,"The post Will XRP Price Hit Double Digits in 2025? XRP/BTC Rally Is Just the Beginning appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the last 30 days, XRP price has surged an impressive 67.2%, outperforming almost every major cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin (14.4%), Ethereum (62.1%), Solana (45.5%), BNB (19.5%), and Cardano (58.3%). In just the past seven days, XRP jumped another 21%, reaching $3.47. But that’s not all on the XRP/BTC chart; a major technical development has caught the crypto world’s attention. XRP/BTC Nears 8-Year Resistance Breakout Currently, the XRP/BTC pair is trading at 0.00002952 BTC. According to renowned crypto trader Gordon , the pair is on the verge of breaking through a key resistance level that has held firm for eight years. At the start of this month, XRP/BTC was at 0.00002052 BTC, and since then, it has climbed a staggering 43.63%. Between July 6 and July 17, the pair soared by 42.53%, with 11 bullish daily candles and a 14.17% single-day jump on July 17. Gordon calls this moment a “rare, generational wealth opportunity”, hinting at a possible long-term rally for XRP price. XRP Spot ETF Approval Could Be the Next Big Trigger While several XRP ETFs based on futures and leverage—like those from ProShares and Teucrium—are already live in the U.S., the market is still waiting for the SEC to approve a spot XRP ETF . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction As Tokenized RWAs on XRPL Soar 2260% , Following the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit resolution, the approval of a spot XRP ETF could be a powerful catalyst that pushes the XRP price even higher. Interestingly, the current rally is unfolding without this major trigger, indicating strong organic momentum. What’s Next for XRP Price? With the SEC lawsuit settled, institutional interest rising, and Ripple’s cross-border payment adoption expanding, the outlook for XRP price remains bullish. Gordon believes that if momentum continues, XRP could hit $10 or more by 2025 . The XRP/BTC breakout, combined with growing investor confidence and pending spot ETF approvals, could mark the beginning of a powerful rally. If you’re watching the crypto markets, now might be the time to keep a close eye on the XRP price. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In the fast-paced, high-stakes world of cryptocurrency, moments of sheer audacity often capture the market’s attention. One such moment recently unfolded on Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange, where a single Hyperliquid whale made a move that sent ripples across the crypto community. Imagine placing a bet so massive, so leveraged, that it could either lead to unimaginable wealth or catastrophic loss. This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what transpired when a trader known as AguilaTrades opened a staggering $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) long position with 40x leverage. This bold maneuver at an entry price of $118,056 has become a focal point of discussion, highlighting the exhilarating, yet perilous, nature of high-leverage trading in the digital asset space. The Audacious Move: Unpacking the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bet The crypto market thrives on volatility and the ambitious plays of its largest participants. When an on-chain analyst, @ai_9684xtpa, brought the activities of AguilaTrades to light on X, the details were nothing short of breathtaking. This particular Hyperliquid whale initiated a 40x leveraged long position on Bitcoin, committing a colossal $100 million. At an entry price of $118,056, this translates to a total position size of approximately 840 BTC, which, at the time of reporting, had already swelled in value to around $108 million. Such a move isn’t just about the numbers; it’s a testament to the immense conviction—or perhaps extreme risk appetite—of the individual behind the trade. To put this into perspective, a 40x leverage means that for every dollar the trader put up as collateral, they are effectively controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. While this amplifies potential gains exponentially, it also magnifies losses at an alarming rate. A slight adverse price movement could lead to rapid liquidation, wiping out the entire collateral. This specific Hyperliquid whale trade serves as a stark reminder of the double-edged sword that leverage represents in the crypto derivatives market. What Exactly is a Hyperliquid Whale, and Why Does It Matter? In cryptocurrency parlance, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to influence market prices. A Hyperliquid whale , specifically, is a large holder or trader operating on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange. Their actions are closely watched because their trades, due to their sheer size, can impact market sentiment and even price movements. When a whale takes such a substantial position, it often sparks speculation: Are they privy to insider information? Do they see a major market shift coming? Or are they simply making a highly speculative bet? Hyperliquid itself is a relatively new but rapidly growing decentralized perpetual futures exchange. It stands out for its low latency, high throughput, and the ability to handle large orders, making it attractive for professional traders and, indeed, whales. The transparency of on-chain data, as leveraged by analysts like @ai_9684xtpa, allows the broader community to observe these large trades, offering a glimpse into the strategies and risk appetites of the market’s biggest players. Navigating the High Seas of Leverage: What Does 40x Really Mean? Leverage is a powerful tool in trading, allowing participants to amplify their exposure to an asset with a relatively small amount of capital. However, with great power comes great risk. For a Hyperliquid whale to utilize 40x leverage means that for every 1% price movement in their favor, their profit on the collateral is 40%. Conversely, a 1% move against them results in a 40% loss of their collateral. This extreme amplification means that even minor market fluctuations can have drastic consequences. Consider the liquidation price. With 40x leverage, a long position like AguilaTrades’ would face liquidation if Bitcoin’s price were to drop by just over 2.5% from the entry price. Given Bitcoin’s historical volatility, a 2.5% drop can occur within minutes or hours, making such a position incredibly precarious. This is not a strategy for the faint of heart, nor for those without deep pockets to withstand potential drawdowns or rapid liquidations. To illustrate the inherent risk, here’s a simplified table showing the approximate percentage drop required for liquidation at different leverage levels: Leverage Multiplier Approximate % Price Drop for Liquidation (Long Position) 5x 20% 10x 10% 20x 5% 40x 2.5% 50x 2% 100x 1% The Allure and the Abyss: Potential Rewards and Catastrophic Risks The decision by a Hyperliquid whale to take on such a highly leveraged position is driven by the potential for monumental gains. If Bitcoin were to continue its upward trajectory, even a modest percentage increase could translate into millions of dollars in profit for AguilaTrades. For instance, if Bitcoin were to rise just 10% from the entry price, the 40x leverage could theoretically turn the initial $100 million position into a profit of $40 million on the collateral. This immense profit potential is the primary allure of high leverage. Challenges and Risks: Liquidation Risk: This is the most immediate and significant danger. As illustrated, a small price drop can trigger automatic liquidation, leading to the complete loss of the collateral used for the position. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is notorious for its rapid and unpredictable price swings. These fluctuations can quickly turn a profitable position into a losing one, especially with high leverage. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen market shocks, regulatory crackdowns, or major hacks can cause sudden, sharp price drops, leaving no time for traders to react and leading to widespread liquidations. Slippage: For such large positions, executing trades, especially during volatile periods, can lead to slippage, where the actual execution price differs from the intended price, impacting profitability. Impact on Market Sentiment: While the Hyperliquid whale stands to gain or lose significantly, their actions can also influence the broader market. A massive liquidation of such a large position could trigger a cascade of selling pressure. Lessons from the Deep: Actionable Insights for the Average Trader While the audacious move of a Hyperliquid whale might seem exciting, it’s crucial for the average retail trader to understand that such strategies come with extreme risk. Mimicking these moves without a deep understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and sufficient capital can be financially ruinous. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Risk Management: Always define your risk tolerance. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Understand Leverage Thoroughly: Before using leverage, fully grasp how it works, including its amplification of both gains and losses, and how liquidation prices are calculated. Start with lower leverage if you must use it. Don’t Blindly Follow Whales: While whale movements can be interesting to observe, they operate with different capital bases, risk appetites, and potentially information advantages. Their strategies are not necessarily suitable for smaller portfolios. Focus on Education: Continuously learn about market cycles, technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and macroeconomic factors that influence crypto prices. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one highly leveraged basket, spread your investments across different assets to mitigate risk. Consider the Long-Term: For many, a long-term, spot-holding strategy in Bitcoin has proven more consistent and less stressful than highly leveraged short-term trading. The Ripple Effect: How Whale Trades Influence Market Sentiment A trade of this magnitude by a Hyperliquid whale doesn’t just impact the individual’s portfolio; it sends a signal to the market. A large leveraged long position can be interpreted as a strong bullish conviction, potentially encouraging other traders to open long positions, thereby contributing to upward price momentum. Conversely, if the position were to face liquidation, it could trigger a wave of selling, leading to a rapid price decline and potentially cascading liquidations across the market. The transparency of decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid means that these large trades are observable, fueling discussions and speculation across social media and trading forums. This collective attention can create a feedback loop, where the actions of a few large players influence the sentiment and behavior of many smaller ones, amplifying market movements. Conclusion: A Glimpse into High-Stakes Crypto Trading The $100 million, 40x leveraged Bitcoin long opened by a Hyperliquid whale , AguilaTrades, is a fascinating case study in the extreme ends of cryptocurrency trading. It embodies the tantalizing promise of exponential gains that leverage offers, alongside the terrifying specter of rapid, complete loss. While such audacious bets capture headlines and spark immense interest, they also serve as a crucial educational moment for anyone involved in the crypto market. They highlight the importance of understanding the tools at your disposal, the inherent volatility of digital assets, and the paramount need for stringent risk management. The world of crypto derivatives is a wild frontier, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye, often by those brave—or perhaps foolhardy—enough to make such a colossal bet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in the cryptocurrency market? A “whale” in the cryptocurrency market refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, significant enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Their movements are often tracked by other traders for insights into market sentiment. Q2: What does 40x leverage mean in crypto trading? 40x leverage means that for every dollar of your own capital (collateral) you put into a trade, you are controlling $40 worth of the asset. While it can amplify profits significantly, it also means a small adverse price movement (e.g., just over 2.5% for a long position) can lead to the liquidation of your entire collateral. Q3: What is Hyperliquid, and why is it used for such large trades? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual futures exchange known for its high performance, low latency, and deep liquidity. Its architecture allows it to handle large orders efficiently, making it an attractive platform for professional traders and whales seeking to execute substantial leveraged positions without significant slippage. Q4: What are the main risks associated with high-leverage trading? The primary risks include rapid liquidation (loss of all collateral) due to small adverse price movements, heightened exposure to market volatility, and the potential for cascading liquidations during sharp market downturns. It also amplifies the impact of unexpected “black swan” events. Q5: Should average traders try to mimic a Hyperliquid whale’s strategy? No, it is generally not advisable for average retail traders to mimic a Hyperliquid whale’s highly leveraged strategies. Whales operate with vastly different capital bases, risk tolerances, and often have sophisticated trading systems or information. For most traders, prioritizing risk management, education, and starting with lower leverage (or none) is a far safer approach. Q6: How do large whale trades impact the overall crypto market? Large whale trades can significantly impact market sentiment. A massive long position might signal bullish conviction, potentially encouraging others to buy. Conversely, a large liquidation or short position can create downward pressure, leading to fear and potentially triggering further selling or liquidations across the market.

Since its June 30 mainnet debut, this sidechain has attracted over 1,300 smart contracts and more than 17,000 addresses, igniting liquidity flow into pools and trading platforms. This newfound openness to Ethereum-style contract interaction has made XRPL significantly more appealing to DeFi participants, who are increasingly using it for yield farming and token swapping. According to DefiLlama data, XRPL’s total value locked hit an all-time high (ATH) of $94.44 million driven by sidechain momentum and rising DeFi activity. TVL Breakout After Prolonged Stagnation Before July, XRPL's TVL hovered in a holding pattern near $90 million for months. Therefore, the jump to more than $96 million marks the first convincing breakout in this cycle. As a result, metrics like weekly active addresses and transaction counts have surged, reflecting a real increase in on-chain engagement. Improving Market Position and XRP Dominance Coinciding with the TVL record is a sharp rise in XRP's share of crypto market capitalization. The XRP Dominance index has climbed above 5%, near its highest level in 2025 with the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently jumping to a record high of $3.65. When measured against the backdrop of aggressive Bitcoin and Ethereum performance earlier this year, this surge in dominance highlights renewed investor interest in altcoin utility particularly those with active DeFi ecosystems. Therefore, the XRPL reaching $94.44 million TVL is a major milestone because it signals that the network has crossed into genuine DeFi territory, driving developer adoption, liquidity, and investor interest. Is XRP Ripe for $13? Marketing technician Tony 'The Bull' Severino has sparked buzz by questioning whether XRP could skyrocket to $13 in just 40 days. The analyst pointed out , “What if the final move in XRP — projected as high as ~$13 — happened within 40 days? What is your plan?” Severino’s analysis, rooted in Elliott Wave theory and shared widely on X, formerly Twitter, hinges on a striking pattern where a contracting triangle was formed over nearly seven years between 2018 and late 2024. He identifies this as a classic fourth-wave setup, followed by an imminent impulsive fifth wave that could mirror XRP’s monumental 2017 rally when the altcoin skyrocketed roughly 1,900% over six weeks. Notably, the symmetrical drop from 2017’s high to 2018’s low reflects a move of about 1,903%, unfolding across six weekly candles in 42 days. Bullish Dream or Calculated Hype? Severino emphasizes that even if XRP does reach near $13, this move would likely complete the fifth-wave impulse, ushering in a classic Elliott Wave correction thereafter. His critics argue this makes it too perfect that markets rarely repeat fractal patterns so cleanly. Yet, many on X are captivated by the symmetry and boldness of the forecast. One enthusiast on Binance Square summarized the sentiment by stating, “Analyst Tony ‘The Bull’ Severino… forecasts a parabolic rally that could push XRP to $13 within 40 days—mirroring the dramatic late‑2017 top.” Another analysis of XRP’s road to $23, thanks to the Valhalla Gate catalyst recently caught the crypto community’s attention. Conclusion In this moment, Severino has succeeded in shaking up the XRP narrative not by pandering to greed, but by framing an audacious question through rigorous analysis of whether the journey to $13 in 40 days is possible. As this happens, the XRP Ledger’s breakthrough of achieving $94.44 million in TVL not only cements its transition into a DeFi-enabled platform but also signals burgeoning investor confidence. As XRPL continues to roll out developer tools and expand DeFi capabilities, it could increasingly challenge larger ecosystems.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|WALLET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-22 07:59:24

With Remittix gaining momentum behind the scenes as well, do these tokens have room to explode this cycle? SHIB and PEPE: Room Left To Grow? Shiba Inu Coin is making headlines again. The price of SHIB has risen by 2.55%, trading at $0.00001552 with a market cap of $9.14 billion and over $597 million in average daily volume. The price is driven by good Shiba Inu news on token burns, growth of the ecosystem, and SHIB entry into decentralized finance (DeFi). While that was happening, PEPE Coin settled back a bit, down 2.19% to $0.00001406 — but its trading volume exploded more than 50% to $1.84 billion. That suggests whales and retail investors are still playing. Some traders believe PEPE can be the next 100x crypto if meme strength holds up. SHIB and PEPE remain two of the top crypto under $1, but the question is whether these tokens still have upside left. Why Remittix Can Be the Real Breakout Sensation Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming the go-to among those who want the best crypto presale 2025. While SHIB and PEPE are on top in terms of popularity, RTX is working on creating something much more practical — an actual cross-border crypto payment platform.

This surge followed the company’s announcement that it had invested $2 billion in Bitcoin (BTC). Two-Thirds Of Assets To Bitcoin Treasury The media group, which encompasses President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, the streaming service Truth+, and the financial services brand Truth.Fi, revealed that the recent cryptocurrency purchases align with a strategy initially outlined in May to establish a Bitcoin treasury. According to Trump Media, these Bitcoin assets now represent two-thirds of its total $3 billion in assets, signaling a deepened financial commitment to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: $331M In Shorts At Risk As Ethereum Targets Key Supply Level Devin Nunes, CEO and president of Trump Media, emphasized the company’s unwavering focus on executing its publicly announced strategy. He stated that these assets are designed to secure the company’s “financial independence” and protect it from potential discrimination by financial institutions. Furthermore, Nunes mentioned plans to introduce a utility token within the Truth Social ecosystem, which could enhance user engagement and create new revenue streams. In addition to acquiring Bitcoin, Trump Media has allocated $300 million towards an “options acquisition strategy” focused on Bitcoin-related securities. Trump’s Regulatory Push Trump’s support for a more supportive regulatory environment in Washington, D.C., has resulted in significant price increases and surging adoption by public traded companies in the digital asset industry. Recently, President Trump signed legislation that establishes the first federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, a significant endorsement expected to foster greater adoption of these digital assets under the GENIUS Act. This move coincides with the launch of World Liberty Financial, a new crypto startup supported by Trump and his sons, which recently introduced its own US dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, in collaboration with BitGo. Related Reading: Too Pricey? Expert Says XRP Beats Bitcoin And Ethereum Right Now Trump Media’s ambitious plans include raising $2.5 billion to further expand its Bitcoin treasury. This approach, which blends public equity and debt issuance, has drawn inspiration from Michal Saylor’s pioneering efforts at Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), where the company’s transformation into a Bitcoin powerhouse began in 2020. Despite the stock’s recent rally, the performance of Trump Media has been volatile. Since announcing its Bitcoin treasury strategy in late May, the stock has fallen 25%, and it is down 45% year-to-date. On the other hand, Bitcoin recently reached a new record price above $123,000. Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has struggled to consolidate within its latest range of $118,000 to $119,000 and has fallen back toward its current valuation of $116,960.

In the post , picdoc581 described Grok 4 as “fairly bullish” on Bitcoin’s future trajectory , with a series of yearly projections extending from 2025 to 2035. According to the data presented, Grok 4 expects Bitcoin to appreciate significantly each year through the next ten years. The forecast begins with a year-end price of $158,000 for 2025. This is followed by $224,000 in 2026, $313,000 in 2027, and $430,000 in 2028. The trend continues upward in subsequent years. With 2029 projected at $582,000, 2030 at $775,000, and 2031 at $1,021,000. For 2032, Grok 4 predicts a year-end price of $1,327,000, climbing further to $1,708,000 in 2033, $2,177,000 in 2034, and culminating in an estimate of $2,748,000 for 2035.

The user commented , “Unless something has changed, which people have said every year since Bitcoin’s inception, then this makes no sense, it’s never been up year on year. Cycle yes, year no.” This remark points to the fact that Bitcoin has historically exhibited cyclical price movements with periods of retracement and consolidation, rather than uninterrupted year-over-year gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context and Implications of the Predictions The figures reported by picdoc581 illustrate a strong upward bias by Grok 4’s model, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term adoption and appreciation despite historical volatility. The response by the X user highlights the divergent views within the community regarding the feasibility of such projections. While AI-generated forecasts are increasingly being used as one lens to interpret potential market developments, they remain speculative and dependent on assumptions that may or may not hold in a highly dynamic and unpredictable market. By sharing Grok 4’s projections, picdoc581 has added another perspective to ongoing conversations about Bitcoin’s future , showing how AI tools are being applied to formulate expectations about digital asset markets in the coming decade.

Analysts highlight $4.20–$6.12 as the next targets, using Fibonacci extensions to chart the asset’s possible path. XRP network hits 7.2M wallets as new US bills and ETF launch boost investor confidence. XRP Clears Multi-Year Triangle Pattern Ripple (XRP) has pushed higher, confirming a breakout from a symmetrical triangle that had shaped price action since late 2024. Descending highs and rising lows formed the pattern, which had a squeezed pattern more than six months before it finally took off in early July. As of press time, XRP traded near $3.46 after reaching a session high of $3.58. It has gained over 20% in the past seven days, holding above key former resistance levels. This breakout has opened the door to new technical targets on the upside. Analyst Sees $6 Target Based on Fibonacci Projections Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared a chart indicating XRP could reach $6. Fibonacci levels drawn from the previous move show $4.17, $4.63, and $5.01 as possible resistance points. The final extension at $6.12 aligns with this projection. The 1.0 Fibonacci extension at $3.40 has already been crossed, which supports the view that further gains could follow. $XRP targets $6 after breaking out of a triangle! pic.twitter.com/8VJ5DD2eOE — Ali (@ali_charts) July 21, 2025 Another analyst, CryptoWZRD, pointed to $3.65 as the next level to monitor. A break above that zone would likely confirm continued strength. Above $3.65, targets include $4.20 and a wider range between $4.60 and $4.70. In addition, intraday charts show wide swings in price, but the structure remains intact. The $3.40 level is acting as intraday support. If the asset can clear $3.65, analysts expect momentum to pick up again. Until then, market participants are watching for a clean structure to form for new setups. The broader trend remains in favor of buyers as long as XRP stays above key short-term levels. XRP/BTC also closed strong on the daily chart, helping fuel interest. On-Chain Growth and U.S. Policy Shift Add Context The rally follows new US Congress legislation to aid crypto industry advancements. Bills such as the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts are progressively getting clearer regulations, and perhaps that is seizing the interest of bigger investors. Meanwhile, ProShares launched a futures XRP ETF, offering more exposure through traditional platforms. On-chain activity is also increasing. Wallet data shows XRP addresses have now surpassed 7.2 million, the highest level on record.

Now trading around $118,500, the $2.36 trillion asset continues to ride a wave of institutional demand, buoyed by record ETF inflows and a growing push from corporate treasuries. In July, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw only one day of outflows, on the 1st. Since then, they have recorded 10 straight days of inflows totaling $5.227 billion, according to Farside . With that, Bitcoin ETF issuers now hold $152.40 billion in total net assets. BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack, capturing $56 billion in total net inflows. Meanwhile, more public companies are ramping up their Bitcoin allocations. Corporate treasuries have been buying more BTC than ETFs for three consecutive quarters now. In the second quarter, public companies acquired about 131,000 coins, as per the data from Bitcoin Treasuries . So, Michael Saylor’s Strategy isn’t alone in its aggressive Bitcoin buys, though it certainly leads with 576,230 BTC , which is 2.74% of BTC’s total supply. According to Rich Rines, Initial Contributor at Core , this “growing adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset amid economic uncertainties” could accelerate the momentum that started with Bitcoin halving and has been aided by pro-industry bills. Against this backdrop, the market is looking primed for much higher prices. Already, BTC is up 83.2% in the past year, now helping the broad crypto market finally rally too. “The remainder of 2025 looks exceptionally promising for the crypto market, particularly for Bitcoin,” said Rich. With the momentum “driven by increasing institutional adoption, macroeconomic tailwinds, and clearer regulatory frameworks,” Rich added, “this translates to accelerated growth in Bitcoin treasury strategies, where companies are succeeding with large-scale holding and now exploring ways to earn low-risk yield on those assets without compromising self-custody.” Bitcoin treasury companies started as pure BTC holders but have since scaled into yield-generating tools. For instance, Strategy is offering 11.5% yield on its new preferred stock, which is collateralized by its BTC reserves. This evolution from buy-and-hold into structured, capital-efficient yield vehicles is expected to help the Bitcoin DeFi sector grow as well. Bitcoin DeFi, or BTCFi, is a growing ecosystem of DeFi applications built on the Bitcoin blockchain or its layer-2 solutions. It allows users to leverage their Bitcoin holdings in various financial activities like lending, borrowing, and staking, previously not possible within the traditional Bitcoin ecosystem. Core, for instance, is actively transforming idle Bitcoin into a productive, yield-generating asset through self-custodial BTC staking. Already, the total value locked (TVL) in the BTCFi sector has surged past $7 billion . This marks a significant increase from approximately $300 million in TVL at the beginning of 2024, showing enthusiasm among both retail and institutions to bring yield-generation strategies to Bitcoin and transcend its role as a passive store of value. “As more Bitcoin holders seek productive uses for their holdings, Bitcoin-aligned ecosystems are positioned to capture significant market share. Bitcoin DeFi developments can transform idle Bitcoin into a more versatile asset that supports broader applications,” said Rich. The outlook for BTC prices and Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) remains constructive, driven by growing institutional participation and an expanding range of use cases. As the ecosystem matures, continued progress in corporate adoption and infrastructure innovation will be key to shaping long-term market dynamics. The rise of corporate treasury strategies has contributed meaningfully to recent price momentum, though it also increases sensitivity to broader market conditions. These approaches often benefit from sustained price appreciation, which may be tested during periods of consolidation. Other potential headwinds for Bitcoin, according to Rich, include heightened volatility from geopolitical events, tariff impacts, and unexpected Fed policy shifts, all of which could “trigger pullbacks.” Overall, sentiment remains positive. ETF flows, central bank direction, and the evolution of corporate Bitcoin strategies will be important indicators. Sustained strength in these areas could further reinforce Bitcoin’s role as a productive, yield-bearing asset class, particularly as platforms like Core continue to unlock new functionality for institutional holders.

Additionally, its dominance has also declined 8.5% to below 59% over the past few weeks, mainly at the expense of Ethereum, which has been on fire.

The Ultimate Guide,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/dogecoin-mining-is-it-still-worth-mining-in-2025-the-ultimate-guide,"Dogecoin mining is one of the most popular entry points to the world of cryptocurrencies and a successful way to earn money to experienced miners in the fast-changing world of cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke in 2013 but today it is a well-known cryptocurrency that has a large community, celebrity support (Elon Musk), and real-life applications. However, as the crypto environment is changing fast, is Dogecoin mining worth it in 2025? In this article we are going to demystify what Dogecoin mining means, how it works in 2025 and how cloud-based platforms like HashJ are making it simpler than ever to mine DOGE profitably. So What Is Dogecoin Mining? Dogecoin mining Dogecoin mining is adding and validating transactions in the Dogecoin blockchain. Dogecoin is a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol similar to Bitcoin. It does not use the same algorithm as Bitcoin which is SHA-256, however, Dogecoin uses Scrypt that is less resource-demanding and provides faster mining. Miners are rewarded by DOGE tokens when they solve mathematical problems to certify transactions. Such rewards are then tradeable or stored in wallets to gain value in future. How is Dogecoin Mining in 2025? By 2025, the process of Dogecoin mining has gained competitiveness because of the growing demand, better technology, and the growing price of DOGE. ● Price of Dogecoin: ~0.18$ per DOGE ● Block Reward: 10,000 DOGE /block ● Average Block Time: 1min ● Hashrate: More than 900 TH/s (network-wise) These revised numbers have seen miners change their strategies in order to be profitable. People are shunning high cost physical hardware and they are shifting to cloud mining services such as HashJ, which promises scalability, low entry barriers and reduced maintenance headache. Cloud Mining Dogecoin: A Better Alternative in 2025 The emergence of cloud mining is one of the largest changes in Dogecoin mining . The users rent hash power in professional data centers instead of setting and maintaining hardware. This approach gets rid of initial expenses such as: ● High cost mining rigs (ASICs or GPUs) ● Electricity bills ● Noise and cooling control HashJ is one of the reputable websites those that offer dogecoin mining cloud contracts which are trustworthy, with real-time payment and transparent. You can be a novice or an investor seeking passive income: with HashJ, you can begin mining DOGE in a few minutes, without the need to buy hardware.

Dogecoin Profitability Mining 2025 The profitability of mining is based on a number of factors: ● Dogecoin price (varying between 0.15- 0.20 in 2025) ● Difficulty and hash rate in mining ● Energy use, and hardware efficiency (in the case of home miners) ● Fees of pool or cloud mining While mining alone at home is no longer feasible, cloud mining remains profitable as mining complexity increases. A medium-sized cloud mining contract can bring in $2,000 to $30,000 per month at current rates, depending on the hashrate and the market price of Dogecoin. Profit estimations can be done using online calculators using real time data. HashJ also has in-built profitability estimators on user dashboards to make proper planning. The 2025 Guide to Mining Dogecoin Dogecoin mining can be done in two ways: 1. Single or Group Mining (Old technique) ● The Requirements of Hardware: ASICs such as Antminer L7 or GPUs such as RTX 3080 ● Software: CGMiner, MultiMiner or EasyMiner ● Wallet: Dogecoin Core Wallet/ Trust Wallet ● Pool de mineração: Prohashing, Aikapool, Multipool 2. Cloud mining (Recommended in 2025) ● Select a service provider such as HashJ ● Choose a Dogecoin mining contract (starting at 100 dollars) ● Get DOGE payments every day to your wallet ● Zero configuration , zero maintenance This is the most approachable and entry-level way especially in 2025 competitive environment.

SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature.

Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024.

According to Krueger, Bitcoin will go beyond being a mere digital asset and become the largest “store of value” in the world. “It's hard for most people to believe, but Bitcoin will likely become the primary store of value on planet Earth within 20 years,” Krueger said. According to the analyst, in this scenario, Bitcoin's market capitalization would reach $10 billion, with its total value reaching $200 trillion. This would make Bitcoin five times the current market capitalization of gold. Related News: Why is Ethena (ENA), One of the Most Talked About Altcoins of Recent Days, Going Up?

This means Bitcoin will become an asset more valuable than any other individual currency, Krueger believes. In fact, its value will surpass the combined value of entire countries' stock and bond markets. Krueger also highlighted the generational wealth inequality. “Boomers are hated by millennials for 'buying cheap houses.' But that pales in comparison to the hatred Gen Z will feel for millennials who bought 'cheap Bitcoin,'” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Stablecoins, designed to bridge the volatility of cryptocurrencies with the stability of fiat money, hold immense promise. Yet, their full potential hinges on robust, seamless infrastructure for their movement. Imagine a world where digital payments are not just fast, but truly instantaneous, transparent, and secure for everyone involved. This vision is now closer to reality, thanks to a groundbreaking collaboration in South Korea that aims to revolutionize stablecoin settlement . Why is Efficient Stablecoin Settlement Crucial for the Future of Finance? Traditional financial systems, while robust, often grapple with inefficiencies. Cross-border payments can take days, reconciliation processes are manual and error-prone, and transaction fees can eat into profits. These hurdles hinder the seamless flow of capital and innovation. Stablecoins offer a compelling alternative, providing the speed and global reach of blockchain technology while maintaining price stability, which is essential for everyday commerce. However, the mere existence of stablecoins isn’t enough. For them to truly integrate into the global economy, a sophisticated underlying ‘plumbing’ system is required. This is where efficient stablecoin settlement becomes the cornerstone. It’s about more than just moving digital tokens; it’s about automating the entire lifecycle of a transaction, from initial balance checks to final settlement, across diverse parties. Enter Project Namsan. This ambitious initiative, spearheaded by South Korean IT giant NHN and blockchain security firm SOOHO.IO, aims to build precisely this kind of advanced infrastructure. Their goal is to establish a stablecoin settlement system that automates real-time balance checks and streamlines settlement processing among a wide array of participants, including merchants, stablecoin issuers, and traditional financial institutions. This automation promises to drastically reduce friction, enhance transparency, and accelerate the pace of digital commerce. A pilot trial for this innovative system is even anticipated to commence as early as September, marking a significant step forward. Unpacking Project Namsan: The Core of Stablecoin Settlement Innovation The strength of Project Namsan lies in the synergistic partnership between NHN and SOOHO.IO. Each entity brings unique, complementary expertise to the consortium, creating a powerful alliance poised to tackle the complexities of digital asset infrastructure. NHN: As a leading South Korean IT company, NHN boasts extensive experience in developing and managing large-scale online services, including payment systems, cloud infrastructure, and gaming platforms. Their vast user base and technological prowess provide the foundational IT backbone and operational scale necessary for a nationwide stablecoin settlement network. SOOHO.IO: This blockchain firm specializes in smart contract security auditing and decentralized application development. Their deep understanding of blockchain technology, cryptographic security, and distributed ledger systems is critical for building a secure, transparent, and resilient settlement layer. SOOHO.IO’s expertise ensures that the infrastructure is not only efficient but also robust against potential vulnerabilities. The consortium model allows for a collaborative approach, combining the best of traditional IT infrastructure with cutting-edge blockchain innovation. This fusion is essential for creating a system that can handle high transaction volumes while adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. The vision for Project Namsan’s stablecoin settlement system involves a seamless flow of information and value, ensuring that funds are settled almost instantaneously, reducing counterparty risk and operational overhead for all participants. Who Benefits from Advanced Stablecoin Settlement Infrastructure? The development of a robust stablecoin settlement infrastructure like Project Namsan stands to benefit a diverse range of stakeholders, fostering a more efficient and inclusive financial ecosystem. Let’s explore some key beneficiaries: Stakeholder Key Benefits from Stablecoin Settlement Merchants & Businesses Experience instant payment finality, significantly reduced transaction fees compared to traditional card networks, and minimized chargeback risks. This improves cash flow and operational efficiency. Stablecoin Issuers Gain streamlined, real-time management of reserves and issuance, enhanced compliance tools, and greater transparency in their operations, strengthening trust in their stablecoins. Financial Institutions Unlock new revenue streams by participating in the digital asset economy, reduce back-office operational costs through automation, and enhance interoperability with emerging financial technologies. Consumers & Users Enjoy seamless, low-cost transactions, greater financial choice, and the stability of digital currencies for everyday purchases and transfers, enhancing their digital financial experience. Regulators & Governments Benefit from enhanced oversight capabilities, better data for monetary policy decisions, and a more transparent financial system that can help combat illicit activities. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Widespread Stablecoin Settlement Adoption? While the promise of advanced stablecoin settlement is immense, its widespread adoption is not without hurdles. Building a robust digital financial infrastructure requires navigating complex technical, regulatory, and societal challenges. Regulatory Clarity and Harmonization: The legal and regulatory frameworks surrounding stablecoins are still evolving globally. For Project Namsan to achieve broad success, clear guidelines from South Korean authorities, and ideally, a degree of international regulatory alignment, will be essential. This includes aspects like consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Interoperability with Existing Systems: Integrating a new, blockchain-based stablecoin settlement system with legacy financial infrastructure (banks, payment processors, accounting systems) is a significant technical challenge. Seamless data exchange and transaction flow between disparate systems are critical for real-world utility. Scalability and Performance: For a system to handle the transaction volumes of a national or even international economy, it must be highly scalable. Ensuring the underlying blockchain and IT infrastructure can process millions of transactions per second reliably and efficiently is paramount. User Adoption and Education: Despite the benefits, widespread adoption depends on user familiarity and trust. Educating merchants, financial institutions, and the general public about how to use and benefit from stablecoin-based payments will be an ongoing effort. Security and Risk Management: While SOOHO.IO brings strong security expertise, the digital asset space is constantly targeted by malicious actors. Continuous vigilance, robust security protocols, and effective risk management frameworks are necessary to protect assets and data within the stablecoin settlement system.

Just as crypto enthusiasts navigate volatile digital assets, traditional investors keenly watch major currency pairs. Recently, global banking giant UBS delivered a significant directive: sell USD/JPY on rallies. This USD/JPY forecast from a leading financial institution signals a potentially pivotal moment for one of the world’s most actively traded currency pairs, prompting investors to re-evaluate their positions and strategies. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how can you navigate this expert advice? Why is the USD/JPY Forecast Crucial Now? The USD/JPY currency pair, representing the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen, is a cornerstone of the global foreign exchange market. Its movements are often seen as a barometer of global economic health and central bank policy divergence. UBS’s recommendation to ‘sell on rallies’ implies a strong conviction that any upward movements in the pair are likely to be temporary, presenting opportune moments for investors to initiate short positions or lighten long exposures. This stance is particularly crucial given the pair’s recent volatility and the ongoing divergence in monetary policies between the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ). For years, the significant interest rate differential between the US and Japan has fueled a ‘carry trade’ phenomenon, where investors borrow in low-yielding Yen to invest in higher-yielding US assets, thereby pushing USD/JPY higher. However, the landscape is shifting. As global economic conditions evolve and central banks potentially adjust their stances, the factors driving this differential could narrow, making the Yen more attractive and the Dollar less so. UBS’s call suggests they anticipate such a shift, making their USD/JPY forecast a critical piece of information for market participants. What’s Driving Yen Weakness and Its Impact? To fully grasp UBS’s recommendation, it’s essential to understand the persistent Yen weakness that has characterized the market for an extended period. The primary driver has been the Bank of Japan’s steadfast commitment to an ultra-loose monetary policy, including negative interest rates and yield curve control (YCC). While other major central banks, like the Fed, embarked on aggressive rate-hiking cycles to combat inflation, the BOJ maintained its accommodative stance, aiming to stimulate Japan’s sluggish economy and achieve its 2% inflation target sustainably. This policy divergence created a stark contrast in interest rate differentials. For instance, if US Treasury yields offered significantly higher returns than Japanese government bonds, capital naturally flowed out of Japan and into the US, increasing demand for the Dollar and depressing the Yen. This dynamic has consistently put downward pressure on the Yen, leading to its depreciation against the Dollar and other major currencies. Beyond monetary policy, other factors contributing to Yen weakness include: Trade Balance: Japan, a major importer of energy and raw materials, faces a larger import bill when global commodity prices rise, putting pressure on the Yen. Global Risk Sentiment: While the Yen traditionally served as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty, its ultra-low yields have sometimes diminished this role, as investors prioritize returns even in volatile environments. Demographics and Structural Issues: Japan’s aging population and long-term economic challenges can also weigh on investor confidence in the Yen’s long-term prospects. UBS’s advice implies that while these factors have driven rallies, their impact might be nearing a peak, or new counter-factors are emerging that could lead to a reversal of the Yen’s downtrend. How Does UBS Advise on Forex Trading Strategy? The core of UBS’s recommendation is a specific forex trading strategy: ‘sell USD/JPY on rallies.’ This isn’t a blanket ‘sell now’ instruction but rather a nuanced approach that emphasizes timing. It suggests that when the USD/JPY pair experiences an upward movement (a ‘rally’), perhaps due to temporary Dollar strength or a bout of risk-on sentiment, investors should view these peaks as opportunities to initiate short positions or add to existing ones. The underlying assumption is that these rallies are unsustainable and the pair is poised for a decline. This strategy typically relies on several key elements: Identifying Resistance Levels: Traders would use technical analysis to pinpoint key resistance levels where previous rallies have stalled or reversed. Selling near these levels aims to maximize potential profit from a subsequent downturn. Monitoring Fundamental Triggers: The strategy anticipates that fundamental shifts will eventually push the pair lower. These could include a change in the Fed’s stance (e.g., rate cuts), a hawkish pivot from the BOJ (e.g., ending YCC or raising rates), or a general shift in global risk sentiment that favors safe-haven currencies like the Yen. Risk Management: Crucial for any forex trading strategy, especially one involving shorting a trending asset. This includes setting appropriate stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the rally extends beyond expectations, and carefully managing position sizes. UBS’s advice reflects a sophisticated view that the market may be overextended in its Dollar bullishness against the Yen, and that a correction or reversal is increasingly probable. It’s a call for strategic patience, waiting for optimal entry points rather than chasing the market. Implementing a Sound Currency Strategy : What Should Investors Consider? For investors looking to act on UBS’s insights, developing a sound currency strategy is paramount. Simply selling USD/JPY without a clear plan can be risky. Here are key considerations: Understanding Your Risk Tolerance Shorting a currency pair that has been on a strong uptrend requires a higher risk tolerance. Before executing any trades, assess how much capital you are willing to risk and ensure your position size aligns with your overall portfolio management. Technical vs. Fundamental Analysis A robust currency strategy often combines both technical and fundamental analysis. Use technical indicators (e.g., Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Averages, Fibonacci retracements) to identify overbought conditions and potential resistance levels where rallies might falter. Simultaneously, stay informed on fundamental drivers: Central Bank Policy: Closely monitor statements from the Fed and BOJ, economic projections, and any hints of policy shifts. Economic Data: Key indicators like inflation rates (CPI, PPI), GDP growth, employment figures, and trade balances from both the US and Japan can significantly influence the pair. Market Sentiment: Assess broader market sentiment towards risk. A flight to safety could benefit the Yen, while increased risk appetite might temporarily support the Dollar. Managing Your Trades Effective trade management is crucial for a successful currency strategy . This includes: Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the market moves against your position. Take-Profit Levels: Define clear take-profit targets based on your analysis of support levels or expected downside moves. Position Sizing: Never risk more than a small percentage of your trading capital on a single trade. Cost of Carry: Be aware of the ‘swap’ or ‘rollover’ costs associated with holding short USD/JPY positions overnight, as the interest rate differential might incur a small daily charge. By integrating these elements, investors can build a more resilient and disciplined currency strategy to navigate the complexities of the USD/JPY market. How Do Broader Global Macro Trends Shape USD/JPY? The USD/JPY pair does not operate in a vacuum; it is deeply influenced by broader global macro trends. These overarching economic and geopolitical factors can significantly impact currency valuations and are critical to understanding the long-term outlook for the pair. US Economic Performance and Fed Policy The health of the US economy and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy trajectory are arguably the most dominant factors. A strong US economy with persistent inflation may prompt the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer, or even consider further hikes, which would generally support the Dollar. Conversely, signs of economic slowdown or disinflation could lead the Fed to cut rates, narrowing the interest rate differential with Japan and potentially weakening the Dollar against the Yen. Japan’s Inflation and BOJ Policy Evolution While Japan has struggled with deflation for decades, recent global inflationary pressures have started to push consumer prices higher. Should inflation become more entrenched and sustainable, the Bank of Japan might be compelled to normalize its ultra-loose policy, potentially by adjusting or abandoning Yield Curve Control or even raising interest rates. Such a shift would be a monumental event for the Yen, likely leading to significant appreciation. Geopolitical Risks and Safe-Haven Flows In times of heightened global geopolitical tension (e.g., conflicts, trade wars, political instability), investors often seek safety in traditional safe-haven assets. Historically, the Yen has served this role due to Japan’s status as a large creditor nation. While its safe-haven appeal has been somewhat diluted by low yields, a severe global crisis could still trigger a flight to the Yen, pushing USD/JPY lower. The impact of global macro events cannot be underestimated. Commodity Prices and Global Trade As a major importer of energy and raw materials, Japan’s economy is sensitive to commodity price fluctuations. Higher oil prices, for instance, increase Japan’s import bill, leading to a larger trade deficit and putting downward pressure on the Yen. Global trade dynamics and the performance of major trading partners (like China) also play a role, influencing demand for Japanese exports and overall economic sentiment. Understanding these interconnected global macro forces is essential for long-term investors and traders alike, as they provide the fundamental backdrop against which short-term rallies and corrections occur. Actionable Insights and Risk Management in USD/JPY Trading For investors considering UBS’s recommendation, here are some actionable insights and crucial risk management practices: 1. Stay Informed on Central Bank Communication The speeches, press conferences, and minutes from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan are invaluable. Look for subtle shifts in language, changes in economic outlook, or any hints regarding future monetary policy. These can provide early signals of a potential change in the interest rate differential that drives USD/JPY. 2. Monitor Key Economic Data Releases Pay close attention to inflation reports (CPI, PCE), employment figures (Non-Farm Payrolls in the US, unemployment rate in Japan), GDP growth, and manufacturing indices (PMI, ISM). Strong US data might delay Fed rate cuts, while surprisingly strong Japanese inflation could hasten BOJ tightening. 3. Define Your Entry and Exit Points Based on technical analysis, identify clear resistance levels for initiating short positions during rallies. Similarly, determine support levels where you might take profits. Avoid emotional trading; stick to your pre-defined plan. 4. Implement Strict Risk Management This cannot be overstated. For a ‘sell on rallies’ strategy, placing a tight stop-loss order above the rally’s peak or a significant resistance level is critical. This limits your downside if the rally extends unexpectedly. Also, consider the risk-reward ratio for each trade; ensure the potential profit outweighs the potential loss. 5. Consider Diversification While USD/JPY offers significant opportunities, it’s wise not to concentrate all your capital in one currency pair. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes and currency pairs to mitigate risk. The forex market is highly leveraged, and even small movements can have significant impacts on your capital. 6. Understand the Carry Cost When shorting USD/JPY, you are effectively borrowing USD (high interest rate) and lending JPY (low interest rate). This means you might incur a negative carry (swap cost) for holding the position overnight. Factor this into your profitability calculations, especially for longer-term trades. Key Factor US Economy/Fed Japanese Economy/BOJ Impact on USD/JPY (Sell on Rallies) Monetary Policy Potential Fed rate cuts Potential BOJ policy normalization Narrows yield gap, supports JPY Inflation Disinflationary trends Sustained inflation above 2% Weakens USD, strengthens JPY Economic Growth Slowing US growth Modest Japanese recovery Reduces demand for USD, favors JPY Geopolitics Increased global risk aversion Flight to safe-haven JPY Could trigger sharp JPY appreciation Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Future of USD/JPY UBS’s recommendation to sell USD/JPY on rallies serves as a compelling signal for investors to reassess their approach to this pivotal currency pair. It highlights a growing conviction among institutional players that the era of relentless Yen weakness, driven primarily by interest rate differentials, may be approaching its end. While the precise timing of a significant reversal remains uncertain, the underlying fundamental factors—potential shifts in central bank policies, evolving inflation dynamics, and broader global macro trends—are increasingly aligning to suggest a more balanced, if not downward, trajectory for USD/JPY. For individual investors, this advice underscores the importance of a well-informed, disciplined, and risk-managed forex trading strategy. Whether you are a seasoned trader or just beginning to explore currency markets, understanding the nuances of the USD/JPY forecast and the drivers of Yen weakness is crucial.

A new tracker from Goldman economists indicates wages in China grew by only 3.9% from the second quarter of 2024, the lowest growth in Chinese recorded history, excluding the pandemic years, Bloomberg reports . The Goldman economists also note that the figure is roughly a percentage point less than official Chinese government statistics. “Our wage tracker suggests that sluggish wage growth may impose headwinds to consumption growth in the second half of 2025. We anticipate incremental and targeted easing measures in the second half of the year to alleviate labor market pressures.” Source: Bloomberg Ernan Cui, a China consumer analyst at the investment research firm Gavekal, says in a report reviewed by Bloomberg that Chinese workers are shifting toward self-employment because there are few available formal jobs in the country’s labor force. Cui also reportedly says that the Chinese government’s statistics bureau is counting those self-employed workers, but she notes that they may not be counted in surveys of large companies. “The data indicate that China’s labor market has been consistently weak, despite a broadly stable headline unemployment rate. Until the labor market truly tightens, it seems unlikely that household confidence will rebound.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The incident, which is the second-largest publicly known exchange exploit in India, involved no customer funds. However, CoinDCX has offered a bounty of up to $11 million to incentivise the tracking and return of the stolen digital assets. The stolen funds were moved through mixing services like Tornado Cash, raising the complexity of the recovery. As CoinDCX rallies blockchain investigators and security experts to trace the transactions, the industry is watching closely to see if this new model of “post-breach bounties” can be effective in bringing perpetrators to justice. $11 million bounty launched to trace attacker and recover funds The breach was identified on 13 July when CoinDCX flagged unusual activity in one of its operational wallets. After internal audits, the company confirmed that $44 million in digital assets were siphoned from its treasury. In response, it launched a public recovery bounty offering up to $11 million to anyone who can help trace the funds or identify the attacker. CoinDCX said it is working with global cybersecurity firms, on-chain forensics teams, and intelligence partners to follow the trail. It has also notified law enforcement in India, initiating formal legal proceedings. The exchange has made it clear that its goal is not only to recover the stolen assets but to send a strong deterrent signal to future attackers. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT published on 15 July that some of the funds had already been swapped for Ethereum (ETH) and routed through mixing protocols, making the trail harder to follow. Despite this, CoinDCX’s bounty is one of the largest ever offered by an Indian exchange, underscoring its commitment to asset recovery. Breach stemmed from internal wallet vulnerability According to analysis from blockchain security firm Cyvers, the exploit began with a suspicious transaction of $1.1 million. The attacker accessed one of CoinDCX’s operational wallets, but did not compromise smart contracts or customer-facing infrastructure. All user funds remain intact, with the loss absorbed entirely from the company’s treasury. The breach has prompted CoinDCX to audit all wallet configurations and reinforce operational security protocols. The affected wallet has been decommissioned, and no further suspicious activity has been detected since the initial attack. The company has also implemented new controls to monitor and isolate unusual wallet activity in real time. This marks the second major crypto security incident involving an Indian exchange. WazirX previously disclosed a $230 million breach in 2022. Both cases were the result of platform-specific operational failures rather than protocol vulnerabilities or regulatory issues. Industry braces for more transparency and internal audits The CoinDCX incident has renewed focus on operational security standards across India’s crypto landscape. Despite having one of the world’s largest Web3 developer communities, India’s centralised crypto exchanges have faced repeated breaches due to flawed internal systems. CoinDCX’s decision to absorb the loss internally and respond publicly with a recovery bounty sets a potential precedent. As Indian exchanges face pressure to prove their resilience, similar bounty-backed recovery models could become a new industry norm. Other exchanges may also be forced to conduct internal audits and disclose results to restore user confidence. While regulatory clarity in India is still evolving, the breach highlights the urgent need for exchanges to implement rigorous internal safeguards beyond external compliance. CoinDCX is expected to issue additional updates as the investigation progresses. As of now, no individuals have been publicly identified in connection with the attack, and the stolen assets remain unrecovered.

The fresh disclosure shows that the firm acquired over 4.4 million shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), an Ethereum treasury firm. However, the purchase worth around $175 million was spread across three of ARK’s ETFs. This comes in when Ethereum is running high on bullish waves, gaining more than 25% in the last 7 days. This surge has pushed the largest altcoin to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the past 90 days. ETH went on to reclaim the crucial $3,800 mark long after December 2024. Cathie Wood goes long on Ethereum According to ARK Invest’s July 21 trade disclosure, the firm scooped 2.9 million shares of BMNR through its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). It added 927.8K shares via ARKW and 555.7K via ARKF. This can be seen as ARK’s first major move into Bitmine since the company announced it was turning away from Bitcoin and building a massive Ethereum treasury. Bitmine is now holding over $1 billion in ETH after a recent $500 million purchase. It reportedly plans to acquire and stake 5% of the total Ethereum supply. The ETH staking announcement led Bitmine stock to soar more than to an all-time high of $135 before cooling to around $39. It is still up by almost 800% over the past month. After-hours trading session shows that BMNR is expected to gain by 2% when the market opens. ARK’s move highlights a strong trend among institutional players and a shift from BTC to ETH amid rising momentum for ETH-based ETFs and treasury strategies. As of now, ARK’s Bitcoin ETF ARKB holds $5.81 billion of BTC. Source: ARK Invest Daily . Ethereum price recorded a minor correction of 4% on Tuesday morning after a brief rally. ETH is trading at an average price of $3,660 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is down by 4.5% to stand at $44.5 billion. The digital assets market remained calm as it lost 2% of the gains over the last 24 hours. The cumulative crypto market cap stood at $3.89 trillion with a trading volume of $218 billion. Bitcoin price hovers around $117K-$118K. ARK ditches old favorites Cathie Wood’s ARK simultaneously sold 218,986 Coinbase shares (approx. worth $90 million) across three ETFs. It moved ahead to offload 463,293 shares of gaming firm Roblox (approx. worth $57.7 million). Meanwhile, it also made reductions in Robinhood and Block. While the ARKK fund remains heavily weighted toward tech names like Tesla (9.7% of the portfolio), Coinbase and Roblox are still its second and third largest holdings, with a 5% allocation to Circle. On July 15, ARK continued to build its Tesla position, purchasing 115,380 shares worth $36.5 million split across ARKK and ARKW.

Recent data reveals a significant surge in South Korea stablecoin trading volume, indicating a vibrant resurgence in the country’s digital asset market. If you’ve been watching the crypto space, this uptick is a clear signal that market activity is picking up steam, offering fresh insights into investor sentiment and liquidity. This remarkable increase not only highlights the growing confidence among South Korean traders but also underscores the crucial role stablecoins play in facilitating seamless transactions within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It’s a compelling development that deserves a closer look, especially for anyone keen on understanding the dynamics of a leading crypto market. What’s Fueling the Phenomenal South Korea Stablecoin Trading Surge? The numbers speak volumes, quite literally. According to a report by the Maeil Business Newspaper, citing data from the reputable blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, South Korea stablecoin trading volume experienced an astonishing jump of approximately 50%. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a substantial increase in activity on some of the nation’s most prominent crypto exchanges. Let’s break down the figures: Previous Period (June 29 – July 4): The total stablecoin trading volume across South Korea’s five largest crypto exchanges – Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax – stood at 1.48 trillion won, which translates to roughly $1.07 billion USD. Current Period (July 13 – July 19): Just a few weeks later, the volume soared to 2.23 trillion won, equivalent to about $1.6 billion USD. This represents a precise 50.18% increase, encompassing both buy and sell transactions involving popular stablecoins like USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin). This surge is a direct reflection of heightened engagement and liquidity in the South Korean crypto market. It suggests that traders are actively utilizing stablecoins, either to capitalize on market movements, secure profits, or simply to position themselves for future opportunities without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely. Understanding Stablecoins: For those new to the concept, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by pegging their value to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. They act as a crucial bridge between traditional fiat currency and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, offering stability for traders and facilitating quick, low-cost transfers across exchanges. Their role in the escalating South Korea stablecoin trading volume cannot be overstated. Why Does Increased South Korea Stablecoin Trading Signal a Broader Market Rebound? The surge in South Korea stablecoin trading isn’t an isolated event; it’s often a strong indicator of broader market sentiment and activity. When the overall cryptocurrency market experiences a rebound, as it has recently, stablecoins become indispensable tools for traders. Here’s why this trend is significant: Increased Liquidity: Higher stablecoin volume means more capital is flowing into and within the crypto market. This boosts liquidity, making it easier for traders to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. Gateway to Opportunity: Traders often convert their volatile crypto assets into stablecoins to lock in profits during market highs or to prepare for buying dips during market corrections. Conversely, an influx of stablecoins can signal readiness to re-enter the market. Reduced Friction: Stablecoins bypass the slower and often more expensive processes of traditional banking, allowing for rapid movement of funds between different cryptocurrencies and exchanges. This efficiency is vital in fast-moving markets. Confidence Indicator: A sustained increase in stablecoin usage suggests that participants are confident enough to keep their funds within the crypto ecosystem, rather than withdrawing to fiat. It signals a belief in future market growth. This dynamic plays a pivotal role in the overall health and functionality of the digital asset space, making the current surge in South Korea stablecoin trading a key metric to watch. South Korea’s Unique Crypto Landscape: A Deep Dive into its Market Dynamics South Korea has long been a powerhouse in the global cryptocurrency market, known for its passionate retail investor base and distinct market characteristics. The country’s five largest exchanges – Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax – are central to this vibrant ecosystem. These platforms serve millions of users and facilitate a significant portion of the nation’s digital asset transactions, including the burgeoning South Korea stablecoin trading . Several factors contribute to South Korea’s unique position: High Retail Participation: A significant portion of the South Korean population actively invests in cryptocurrencies, often leading to higher trading volumes compared to other regions. “Kimchi Premium”: Historically, crypto prices on South Korean exchanges have sometimes been higher than on international platforms, a phenomenon known as the “Kimchi Premium.” While less pronounced recently, it highlights the localized demand. Strict Regulatory Framework: South Korea has implemented stringent regulations to protect investors and prevent illicit activities. While challenging for some, these regulations have also fostered a degree of trust and legitimacy within the domestic market, contributing to a more stable environment for South Korea stablecoin trading . Innovation Hub: The country is also a hub for blockchain innovation, with numerous projects and startups emerging from its tech-savvy environment. The robust infrastructure provided by these major exchanges, coupled with a highly engaged user base, creates fertile ground for the kind of stablecoin activity we are currently observing. Beyond the Numbers: What Does This Mean for Investors Engaged in South Korea Stablecoin Trading? For both seasoned investors and newcomers, the uptick in South Korea stablecoin trading offers several actionable insights and considerations. Understanding these dynamics can help you navigate the market more effectively: Opportunities: Arbitrage Potential: While the “Kimchi Premium” might be less prominent, differences in stablecoin pricing or crypto-to-stablecoin ratios across exchanges could present minor arbitrage opportunities. Yield Farming & Lending: Increased stablecoin liquidity often fuels decentralized finance (DeFi) activities like yield farming and lending, where users can earn returns by providing stablecoins to liquidity pools or lending platforms. Market Entry/Exit: The ease of converting fiat to stablecoins and vice-versa on these active exchanges makes it convenient for investors to enter the market when prices are favorable or exit positions quickly to manage risk. Diversification: Stablecoins offer a way to diversify a portfolio, providing a low-volatility asset within the crypto space, especially during uncertain market conditions. Challenges & Risks: Regulatory Shifts: South Korea’s regulatory landscape is dynamic. Future policy changes regarding stablecoins could impact their usage and availability. Stablecoin De-pegging Risk: While designed to be stable, stablecoins are not immune to de-pegging events, where they lose their 1:1 peg to the underlying asset. This risk, though rare for major stablecoins like USDT and USDC, is always present. Market Volatility: While stablecoins offer stability, the broader crypto market remains volatile. The decision to move into or out of stablecoins is often driven by expectations of this volatility. Counterparty Risk: When holding stablecoins on an exchange, you are exposed to the exchange’s security and operational risks. Navigating these opportunities and risks requires careful research and a clear understanding of your investment goals, especially when engaging in South Korea stablecoin trading . Challenges and Future Considerations for South Korea Stablecoin Trading While the recent surge is certainly positive, the path forward for South Korea stablecoin trading is not without its challenges and ongoing considerations. These factors will shape the market’s evolution and influence investor behavior: Global Regulatory Scrutiny: Beyond South Korea’s borders, stablecoins are facing increasing global regulatory attention, particularly from major economies and financial bodies. Any international consensus or new frameworks could influence domestic policies. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): The development and potential rollout of CBDCs by central banks worldwide, including ongoing research in South Korea, could introduce new dynamics to the stablecoin market. CBDCs might offer a state-backed alternative, potentially impacting the demand for private stablecoins. Technological Advancements: The underlying technology of stablecoins and the broader blockchain ecosystem is constantly evolving. Innovations in scalability, security, and interoperability will continue to shape how stablecoins are used and integrated into financial systems. Market Competition: The stablecoin market itself is becoming more competitive, with new entrants and different models (e.g., algorithmic vs. fiat-backed). This competition could lead to better offerings but also greater complexity for users. Economic Headwinds: Broader macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, interest rate changes, and global economic stability, will continue to influence overall crypto market sentiment and, by extension, stablecoin usage. Addressing these challenges proactively will be crucial for the sustained growth and stability of South Korea stablecoin trading and the broader digital asset market. The significant rise in South Korea stablecoin trading volume is a compelling testament to the renewed vigor in the cryptocurrency market. This 50% surge not only highlights the country’s pivotal role in the global crypto landscape but also underscores the essential function stablecoins play in facilitating liquidity and stability. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these trends becomes paramount for anyone looking to navigate the exciting world of digital assets. This rebound is a clear signal that South Korea’s crypto community remains robust, adaptable, and ready for future growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin, and why is its trading volume important? A1: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar (e.g., USDT, USDC). Its trading volume is important because it indicates the level of liquidity and activity within the crypto market, often signaling investor confidence and readiness to engage with other cryptocurrencies. Q2: Which South Korean exchanges saw this increase in stablecoin trading? A2: The increase in stablecoin trading volume was observed across South Korea’s five largest cryptocurrency exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. Q3: How does the increase in South Korea stablecoin trading relate to a broader market rebound? A3: An increase in stablecoin trading often accompanies a broader market rebound. Traders use stablecoins to easily move funds within the crypto ecosystem, lock in profits, or prepare for new investments without converting back to traditional fiat currency. This increased activity suggests renewed confidence and liquidity in the overall market. Q4: Are there any risks associated with stablecoin trading? A4: Yes, while stablecoins are designed for stability, risks include potential de-pegging events (where they lose their peg to the underlying asset), regulatory changes that could impact their usage, and counterparty risk if held on exchanges. Q5: What is the “Kimchi Premium” and how does it affect South Korea stablecoin trading? A5: The “Kimchi Premium” refers to a phenomenon where cryptocurrency prices on South Korean exchanges trade at a higher price than on international exchanges. While less pronounced recently, it historically highlighted strong domestic demand. For stablecoin trading, it could create minor arbitrage opportunities if the premium affects the stablecoin’s value relative to its peg, though stablecoins generally aim to maintain their peg regardless of such regional premiums. Q6: What future trends might impact stablecoin usage in South Korea? A6: Future trends that could impact stablecoin usage include evolving global and domestic regulatory frameworks, the development and adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), continuous technological advancements in blockchain, and increasing competition within the stablecoin market itself.

Contributing to the discussion, crypto market analyst Ali Martinez, suggested in a July 22 post on X that the coin could be on track to surge even further. According to Martinez, Bitcoin could march toward $131,200, provided it maintains a critical support level at $117,400. Ali Martinez’s BTC chart. Source: X (@ali_charts) Bitcoin performance Bitcoin faces technical resistance in the $118,500–$123,000 range, and a break above this zone could set the stage for a rally toward a price of up to $135,000. The ‘digital gold’ currently trades at $118,050, down 0.76% in the past 24 hours but well above its 30-day simple moving average of $111,700. Still, momentum indicators advise caution. The moving average convergence divergence ( MACD ) histogram, for instance, recently turned negative (-28.56), hinting at potential near-term consolidation. BTC 24-hour price. Source: Finbold However, as per the same data, Bitcoin’s road to $135,000 may hinge on whether exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) flows and corporate adoption can overpower resistance near $123,000. If not, a pullback toward support at $115,000 is also likely. Is Ethereum $10,000 also possible? In another post , Martinez suggested Ethereum ( ETH ) could be poised for a major breakout toward $10,000 if it can decisively breach a critical resistance level around $4,000. Quote : “If Ethereum $ETH can break past $4,000, we could be looking at $10,000 next!” The analyst pointed to a long-standing Parallel Channel pattern on Ethereum’s weekly chart. Defined by two horizontal trendlines, the pattern has confined ETH’s price action in a sideways range for over two years. Historically, the upper boundary has acted as a strong resistance zone, repeatedly rejecting ETH’s attempts to move higher.

Li, who is in charge of BYD’s international expansion, claimed that this UK government policy was unlikely to affect the carmaker’s sales in the UK market. She discouraged the “backdoor Chinese tariffs,” adding that her company would create over 5K jobs in the UK through dealerships by 2026 as part of its European expansion policy. Last week, the UK government announced a £650M grant to encourage customers to buy electric vehicles (EVs). Under the subsidy scheme, UK EV buyers will receive discounts of up to £3.75K per unit when purchasing new EVs costing less than £37K. Buyers of cars in lower emission bands will get up to £1.5K in discounts. Heidi says switching to EVs is now a reality Heidi Alexander, the Labor MP for Swindon South and the Secretary of State for Transport, said the UK government was making it cheaper and easier for UK residents to own an EV. She added that the UK government was also backing British businesses and putting more money back into its citizens’ pockets through this initiative, which the UK Department for Transport agreed with. Heidi also believes the UK EV subsidies initiative will “make owning an electric car a reality” for thousands of UK residents. The Department for Transport disclosed that two in every five second-hand EVs were now sold for under £20K. It also noted that about 34 EV models would sell new units for under £30K. However, Auto Express car magazine’s Steve Walker claimed that most EV models will fall outside the subsidy scheme because nearly 70% of them were priced above £40K. The UK Transport Secretary also observed that many families felt EVs were out of reach due to the high upfront cost. Not everyone had a driveway, and most drivers were worried about where to charge their EVs. Altavilla believes the fight against BYD EVs will not last Alfredo Altavilla, the former ITA Airways boss currently serving as the special adviser for BYD’s operations in Europe, wondered if any European government could oppose EVs made in China forever. He saw no purpose in the UK government doing all that it was doing with the EV subsidies. Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy also warned the UK government against its protectionist, exclusive policies. Schmidt Automotive Research also observed that the UK EV industry would still struggle to compete, even with the subsidies. The research institute explained that BYD and other Chinese EV brands had cheaper cars with advanced batteries and cutting-edge software. It also noted that Chinese-made brands, including BYD, had expanded to capture about 5% of the market share in the UK and the broader European EV markets . “My dream is in five years, you’re walking in a supermarket and everyone will know, ‘oh, BYD, we know them, they’re a high-tech company.” – Stella Li , Executive VP at BYD Li’s remarks came as BYD planned to support its European expansion by producing locally through its Turkey and Hungary plants. The Chinese EV-maker also announced that it would open 280 retail stores in the UK, and about 2K across Europe. Each exclusive BYD dealership will employ up to 20 people. Meanwhile, BYD has also signed a new deal to sponsor Italian soccer giant Inter Milan. The company’s name will now appear on the back of Inter Milan t-shirts. All team members, including the top management, will also get one of about 70 donated BYD EVs.

After this ATH, BTC price has retreated and continues to consolidate at the $117,000-$118,000 level. While the pullback in BTC price had a negative impact on spot Bitcoin ETFs, the 13-day entry streak in US spot Bitcoin ETFs was broken, according to data. Accordingly, after a 13-day inflow series, net outflows were seen in spot BTC ETFs yesterday. According to Farside Investors data, a total of $131.4 million outflow occurred yesterday from spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US. Ark Invest’s ARKB fund saw the largest outflow with $77.5 million, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC fund with $36.7 million, Fidelity’s FBTC fund with $12.8 million, VanEck’s HODL fund with $2.5 million, and Bitwise’s BITB fund with $1.91 million. On the other hand, BlackRock's IBIT fund, Invesco's BTCO fund, Franklin's EZBC fund, Valkyrie's BRRR fund, and WisdomTree's BTCW fund recorded no net inflows or outflows. Ethereum Logins Continue!

BlackRock's ETHA fund followed with $102 million, while Grayscale's ETH fund saw inflows of $54.9 million and Bitwise's ETHW fund saw inflows of $13.1 million. In comparison, 21Shares’ CETH fund experienced $0.4 million in outflows, while other ETH ETFs recorded no net inflows or outflows. The total net inflow of $298.06 million in US-traded Ethereum spot ETFs marks an all-time high in terms of trading volume. Additionally, spot ETH ETFs experienced their most significant inflows since their launch on July 24. At this point, ETH ETFs recorded a total of $3.53 billion in net inflows over the past 12-day period, with daily inflows outpacing Bitcoin ETFs for several days. *This is not investment advice.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $3,193.95 and a minimum price of $3,143.78. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $5,108.65 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

The coin’s value decreased to $752.6 in the past 24 hours. According to an overall analysis, the cryptocurrency lost 1.83 percent of its worth. This situation creates unfavorable circumstances for investors, as the cryptocurrency is losing value because sellers have taken over the market.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $752.6 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost 1.83 percent of its value today. Technical indicators still give strong bullish signals, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $752.6. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 1.83 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,108.65 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into July, BNB is trading approximately $653.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-22 09:40:00
48719225,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=181084,1753177224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48719225.jpeg,Crypto Fraud: Shocking Rise in Accounts Linked to Crime at a Major Korean Bank,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fraud-korean-bank/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fraud: Shocking Rise in Accounts Linked to Crime at a Major Korean Bank The world of cryptocurrency is dynamic, offering unprecedented opportunities, but it also presents unique challenges, especially concerning security and illicit activities. A recent development out of South Korea has sent ripples through the financial community, highlighting these very concerns. A major South Korean bank, KB Kookmin Bank, which recently partnered with leading crypto exchange Bithumb, has witnessed a concerning surge in accounts linked to financial fraud. This incident immediately brings the issue of crypto fraud to the forefront, prompting a deeper look into the evolving landscape of digital asset security and traditional banking. What’s Behind the Alarming Surge in Crypto Fraud -Linked Accounts? The numbers speak for themselves, painting a stark picture of the challenges that can arise when traditional finance intersects with the fast-paced world of digital assets. According to the Maeil Business Newspaper, KB Kookmin Bank, after commencing its partnership with Bithumb in late March, experienced a significant escalation in fraud-related accounts. Let’s break down the alarming trajectory: January: 101 fraud-linked accounts February: 100 fraud-linked accounts March: 148 fraud-linked accounts (after the partnership began) April: A staggering 268 fraud-linked accounts This dramatic increase suggests a correlation between the new banking partnership and the rise in illicit activities. While correlation does not always imply causation, the timing is certainly noteworthy. The influx of new users or changes in banking procedures associated with the partnership could inadvertently create new avenues for bad actors. A Tale of Two Banks: KB Kookmin vs. Nonghyup To put KB Kookmin Bank’s situation into perspective, it’s crucial to look at Nonghyup Bank, Bithumb’s previous banking partner. Nonghyup Bank reported a significant decline in similar cases after handing over Bithumb’s banking services. In June, Nonghyup saw just 68 accounts linked to fraud, marking the lowest figure among South Korea’s top five commercial banks. This stark contrast underscores the potential complexities and varying risk management strategies in handling crypto exchange partnerships. Here’s a quick comparison of fraud-linked accounts: Bank Month Fraud-Linked Accounts KB Kookmin Bank January 101 KB Kookmin Bank February 100 KB Kookmin Bank March 148 KB Kookmin Bank April 268 Nonghyup Bank June 68 The Unseen Challenges: How Crypto Fraud Impacts Trust and Security The rise in fraud-linked accounts at KB Kookmin Bank is more than just a statistic; it represents a significant challenge to the broader ecosystem of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. This incident shines a spotlight on several critical issues: Erosion of Trust: For users, such news can erode confidence in both the partnering bank and the crypto exchange. Trust is paramount in financial services, and any perceived vulnerability can deter new users and worry existing ones. Regulatory Scrutiny: Incidents of increased crypto fraud invariably attract the attention of financial regulators. This could lead to stricter compliance requirements, more rigorous audits, and potentially slower innovation in the crypto space as banks become more cautious about engaging with exchanges. Operational Burden: Banks and exchanges must dedicate more resources to monitoring, investigating, and reporting suspicious activities. This includes investing in advanced fraud detection systems, hiring more compliance officers, and collaborating with law enforcement agencies. Reputational Risk: For banks, being associated with a rise in fraud cases can damage their reputation, affecting their standing in the competitive financial market. For crypto exchanges, it can hinder their efforts to gain mainstream acceptance and legitimacy. The challenge of combating crypto fraud is amplified by the global, pseudonymous, and often irreversible nature of blockchain transactions. Tracing illicit funds across different chains and jurisdictions requires sophisticated tools and international cooperation. Safeguarding Your Digital Assets: Mitigating Crypto Fraud Risks While the headlines might be concerning, it’s important to remember that proactive measures can significantly mitigate the risks associated with crypto fraud . Both institutions and individual users have a crucial role to play in fostering a safer digital asset environment. What Can Financial Institutions Do? Enhanced KYC/AML: Implement robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, not just for new accounts but also for ongoing monitoring of transactions, especially those linked to crypto exchanges. Advanced Transaction Monitoring: Utilize AI-powered tools and blockchain analytics to detect unusual patterns and suspicious activities indicative of fraud or money laundering. Collaborate with Law Enforcement: Establish strong communication channels and cooperation agreements with national and international law enforcement agencies to quickly share information and act on illicit activities. Continuous Training: Educate staff on the latest crypto fraud schemes and techniques to ensure they are equipped to identify and respond to threats. What Can Crypto Exchanges Do? Implement Strict Security Protocols: Ensure strong two-factor authentication (2FA), cold storage for the majority of user funds, and regular security audits. User Education: Proactively educate users about common scams (e.g., phishing, romance scams, investment scams), emphasizing the importance of verifying information and never sharing private keys. Fraud Detection Systems: Invest in sophisticated systems to identify and flag suspicious withdrawal patterns or account activities. Transparency: Be transparent with users about security measures and any incidents, fostering trust and enabling users to make informed decisions. What Can Individual Users Do? Do Your Due Diligence: Before engaging with any bank or crypto exchange, research their security measures, regulatory compliance, and reputation. Enable 2FA: Always enable two-factor authentication on all your accounts, especially crypto exchanges and banking apps. Beware of Phishing: Be highly suspicious of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls asking for personal information or directing you to suspicious links. Always verify the sender. Strong, Unique Passwords: Use complex, unique passwords for all your accounts and consider using a password manager. Cold Storage for Large Holdings: For significant amounts of cryptocurrency, consider using a hardware wallet (cold storage) to keep your assets offline and secure from online threats. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated on the latest crypto fraud trends and security best practices. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter anything suspicious, report it to the relevant authorities and the platform immediately. The South Korean incident serves as a crucial reminder that while the digital asset space offers immense potential, it also demands heightened vigilance. The integration of traditional banking with crypto exchanges, while a step towards mainstream adoption, must be accompanied by robust security frameworks and collaborative efforts to combat financial crime. As the industry matures, the focus will increasingly shift towards creating a secure, transparent, and trustworthy environment for all participants. Protecting against crypto fraud is not just a responsibility; it’s a shared commitment essential for the future growth and acceptance of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto fraud ? Crypto fraud refers to any deceptive or illegal activity involving cryptocurrencies, designed to trick individuals into parting with their digital assets or personal information. This can include phishing scams, fake investment schemes, romance scams, ransomware, and identity theft. Why did fraud accounts rise at KB Kookmin Bank after its Bithumb partnership? The exact reasons are under investigation, but the rise in fraud-linked accounts coincided with the commencement of the partnership. Possible factors include an increase in user activity, new account opening procedures that might have been exploited, or a targeted effort by fraudsters due to the perceived liquidity and new user base of the partnership. How does this incident affect Bithumb users? While the fraud-linked accounts were reported at KB Kookmin Bank, any incident involving a banking partner of a crypto exchange can raise concerns about security and regulatory oversight. Bithumb users should ensure they follow best security practices and stay informed about any announcements from Bithumb or KB Kookmin Bank regarding security enhancements. What steps can I take to protect myself from crypto fraud ? You can protect yourself by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), using strong and unique passwords, being wary of unsolicited communications, researching platforms thoroughly, using hardware wallets for significant holdings, and staying informed about common scam tactics. Is South Korea cracking down on crypto? South Korea has a evolving regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. While it supports innovation, it also emphasizes strong anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures. Incidents like the rise in fraud-linked accounts often lead to increased scrutiny and potential tightening of regulations to ensure financial stability and consumer protection.

Imagine a colossal ripple effect caused by a single, monumental trade. This is precisely what unfolded recently on Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange, as a formidable Hyperliquid whale made a breathtaking pivot, signaling a potentially significant shift in market sentiment. This dramatic move, from a substantial Ethereum (ETH) loss to an colossal Bitcoin (BTC) long position, has sent murmurs across the digital asset landscape, leaving many to ponder the implications of such an audacious bet. Understanding the Hyperliquid Whale’s Pivotal Move In the high-stakes world of crypto trading, every move by a ‘whale’ – an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency – is scrutinized. The recent actions of a particular Hyperliquid whale , identified by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain as ‘AguilaTrades,’ have certainly captured the market’s attention. This whale’s journey highlights both the inherent risks and the immense potential rewards within the volatile crypto ecosystem. Initially, AguilaTrades was positioned with a substantial Ethereum long, a bet on ETH’s price appreciation. However, market dynamics proved challenging, leading to a significant setback: Ethereum Long Closure: The whale closed their ETH long position, incurring a loss estimated to be around $3 million. This substantial loss underscores the unpredictable nature of leveraged trading, even for seasoned participants. Strategic Capital Injection: Following the ETH loss, AguilaTrades swiftly deposited an additional 5.28 million USDC (USD Coin) to their Hyperliquid account. This immediate replenishment of capital signals strong conviction and readiness for the next strategic play, demonstrating deep pockets and a willingness to double down. This initial phase reveals a trader who is not deterred by losses but rather recalibrates and repositions with conviction, a hallmark often seen in professional trading circles. The ability to absorb a multi-million dollar loss and immediately inject fresh capital is a testament to the scale of operations this Hyperliquid whale commands. The Audacious Bitcoin Long Position: A Deeper Dive The subsequent action by the Hyperliquid whale was nothing short of monumental. After replenishing their capital, AguilaTrades pivoted sharply, shifting focus from Ethereum to Bitcoin with an aggressive, leveraged bet. This move was not just a change in asset; it was a dramatic increase in exposure and risk. Here’s a breakdown of this colossal Bitcoin trade: Asset Shift: From Ethereum to Bitcoin, signaling a potential belief in Bitcoin’s near-term strength or a hedge against broader market uncertainty. Leverage Applied: A staggering 20x leverage was used. This means that for every dollar of their own capital, the whale borrowed an additional nineteen dollars, amplifying both potential gains and potential losses twentyfold. Position Size: The long position was opened for 1,695 BTC, equivalent to approximately $200.5 million at the time of the trade. This makes it one of the largest single leveraged trades observed on Hyperliquid, showcasing the immense scale of this Hyperliquid whale’s conviction. Such a massive bet by a Hyperliquid whale often sends ripples through the market, influencing sentiment and potentially even triggering follow-on trades from other large players or algorithmic systems. It highlights the concentrated nature of wealth and influence within the crypto space, indicating strong conviction in Bitcoin’s immediate future. A significant move by a Hyperliquid whale. Decoding Whale Activity: Why It Matters Understanding the movements of a Hyperliquid whale is crucial for any participant in the crypto market, from seasoned traders to casual investors. Whales, by definition, hold enough assets to significantly influence market prices. Their trades, especially large leveraged positions, can act as leading indicators or, at times, self-fulfilling prophecies. Here’s why whale activity is so important: Market Impact: Large buy or sell orders can directly move prices, especially in less liquid assets. Even in highly liquid markets like Bitcoin, a $200 million position can create significant price pressure. Sentiment Indicator: Whale movements can signal underlying sentiment. A massive long position might suggest institutional optimism, while significant selling could indicate a bearish outlook. Liquidation Cascades: Highly leveraged positions, if they go wrong, can trigger cascading liquidations, exacerbating price swings. However, it’s vital to remember that not all whale movements are infallible. Whales can, and do, make mistakes, as evidenced by AguilaTrades’ $3 million ETH loss. Retail traders should observe, but not blindly follow, these massive trades. The financial capacity and risk tolerance of a Hyperliquid whale are vastly different from those of an average investor. Consider the differences between retail trading and whale trading: Feature Retail Trader Crypto Whale (e.g., Hyperliquid Whale) Capital Limited, often personal savings Vast, often institutional or multi-million/billion dollar funds Market Impact Minimal, individual trades don’t move markets Significant, can influence price action and sentiment Risk Tolerance Lower, focus on capital preservation Higher, willing to take large, calculated risks for massive returns Navigating High-Leverage Risks in Crypto The sheer size and leverage of the Hyperliquid whale’s Bitcoin position naturally bring to light the significant challenges and inherent risks associated with high-leverage trading in cryptocurrency markets. While leverage amplifies potential profits, it equally amplifies potential losses, making it a double-edged sword. Here are some critical risks to consider: Liquidation Risk: At 20x leverage, a relatively small adverse price movement can wipe out the entire collateral. If Bitcoin’s price were to drop by just 5% from the entry point, the $200.5 million position would face liquidation, potentially resulting in a complete loss of the capital allocated to that trade. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Sudden price swings, often triggered by news, regulatory changes, or even other large trades, can quickly move against a leveraged position. Funding Rates: On perpetual futures contracts, traders pay or receive funding rates. With such a large long position, the funding rate could become a significant ongoing cost, eating into potential profits. The fact that this Hyperliquid whale previously incurred a $3 million loss on an ETH long underscores that even the most sophisticated traders are not immune to these risks. Their willingness to re-enter with even higher leverage suggests a strong belief in their analysis, but it doesn’t eliminate the inherent dangers of the strategy. Actionable Insights for Prudent Crypto Trading While the actions of a Hyperliquid whale can be fascinating to observe, it’s crucial for individual traders to derive actionable insights without falling into the trap of blindly following. The crypto market rewards informed decisions and disciplined risk management. Here are some actionable insights for navigating the current market and beyond: Prioritize Risk Management: Define Your Stop-Loss: Determine the maximum loss you are willing to accept and set a stop-loss order before entering any trade. Manage Position Sizing: Never allocate more than a small percentage of your total portfolio to a single trade, especially leveraged ones. The Hyperliquid whale has vast capital; most do not. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While 20x leverage might work for a whale, it is generally ill-advised for retail traders. Start with lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) or avoid it altogether until you fully understand its implications. Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Understand the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Stay informed about market news, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different assets to mitigate risk. Develop a Trading Plan and Stick to It: Emotional decisions often lead to losses. Have clear entry and exit strategies, and stick to them regardless of short-term market fluctuations. Learn from Whale Movements, Don’t Mimic Them: Use whale activity as a data point for market sentiment, but always cross-reference it with your own analysis and risk parameters. The audacious move by this Hyperliquid whale serves as a powerful reminder of both the incredible opportunities and the significant perils present in the cryptocurrency market. Success in this space hinges not just on identifying potential gains, but crucially, on mastering the art of managing risk. The crypto world is constantly evolving, and staying informed is key.

Conclusion: A Bold Bet in a Volatile Market The recent actions of the Hyperliquid whale , AguilaTrades, on Hyperliquid have painted a vivid picture of the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency trading. From closing a multi-million dollar Ethereum long position at a loss to immediately opening an astounding $200.5 million Bitcoin long with 20x leverage, this move underscores the immense conviction and risk appetite of major market participants. While such audacious bets can signal strong underlying sentiment for Bitcoin, they also serve as a stark reminder of the extreme volatility and inherent risks, particularly those associated with high leverage. For the average investor, the key takeaway isn’t to replicate such massive trades, but rather to understand the market forces at play, prioritize robust risk management, and make informed decisions tailored to their own financial capacity. The crypto landscape remains a realm of unparalleled opportunity, but it demands respect for its volatility and a disciplined approach to navigating its powerful currents. The eyes of the crypto community will undoubtedly remain fixed on this Hyperliquid whale’s position, awaiting the next chapter in this unfolding saga of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is AguilaTrades, the Hyperliquid whale mentioned in the article? A1: AguilaTrades is a prominent trader or entity on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, identified as a ‘whale’ due to their significant capital and large-scale trading activities, as reported by Lookonchain. They recently made a notable pivot from an ETH long to a BTC long position. Q2: What does it mean to open a ’20x leveraged Bitcoin long position’? A2: Opening a 20x leveraged Bitcoin long position means the trader is borrowing funds to amplify their exposure to Bitcoin by 20 times. This magnifies both potential profits if Bitcoin’s price rises and potential losses if it falls, making them susceptible to liquidation with a relatively small price drop. Q3: Why did the Hyperliquid whale switch from Ethereum to Bitcoin? A3: While speculative, the switch could indicate a stronger conviction in Bitcoin’s near-term price appreciation, a belief in Bitcoin as a more dominant asset in the current market cycle, or a strategic repositioning based on their unique market analysis. Q4: How does whale activity on platforms like Hyperliquid affect the broader crypto market? A4: Whale activity, especially large, leveraged trades like the one by this Hyperliquid whale , can significantly impact market sentiment and price action. Their massive orders can create direct price movements, and their perceived insights can influence other traders to follow suit, potentially leading to cascading effects or shifts in market narratives. Q5: What are the main risks for retail traders trying to mimic a Hyperliquid whale’s strategy? A5: The main risks include insufficient capital to withstand large losses, higher susceptibility to liquidation due to excessive leverage, and lack of the same market insights or resources as a whale. It’s crucial for retail traders to prioritize robust risk management over mirroring whale moves.

The recent price action has drawn increased attention from analysts and investors, especially following its climb above its previous all-time high of $3.36 to a new peak at $3.65 . With July nearing its end, we asked Google’s Gemini AI for a prediction of the asset’s price by August 1, 2025, and Gemini expects the momentum to continue into the new month. XRP: Strong Technical Setup XRP’s recent breakout to a new all-time high is viewed as a significant technical event. According to Gemini, the breakout puts XRP in a position of price discovery , which typically reduces resistance levels and opens the door for momentum-based price movement. The current technical strength is seen as a key factor in shaping the short-term price direction. However, Gemini notes that the forecast is based on the current market holding its momentum, as sharp reversals or disruptions could change XRP’s course. Improved Legal and Institutional Environment One of the most important developments underpinning current sentiment is the resolution of the SEC lawsuit . Gemini notes that XRP is “legally not a security for public trading,” which has removed a major overhang and improved institutional access. Ripple’s partnerships with major financial institutions in countries such as Brazil, Japan, and the UAE are yielding real-world utility. Gemini emphasized that “XRP is being used for real-world payment flows,” which adds fundamental support to its valuation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additionally, the shift toward real-world asset tokenization also supports XRP’s outlook. Ripple’s global expansion into Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific positions the token for broader adoption across emerging financial ecosystems. Gemini’s Forecast for XRP Price After evaluating current market trends, legal developments, and XRP’s technical performance, Gemini predicts that XRP will trade between $3.80 and $4.10 by August 1, with $3.90 cited as the most balanced estimate. The projection represents a potential upside of approximately 7% to 15% from its current price of $3.56, suggesting the asset will hit a new all-time high soon. Gemini expects a controlled move targeting that bullish range if existing conditions persist, and XRP sustains its momentum. With market sentiment and institutional involvement aligned, XRP is positioned for a stable continuation of its recent gains in the days leading up to August.

This recent surge has caught the attention of many as the entire cryptocurrency market is trading in red. What’s behind this sudden price jump? Some say it’s because of new developments, while others point to growing interest in the coin. Let’s find it out! Pi Network Sees Developer Boom The recent surge in Pi Network coin is attributed to the recently launched App Studio. This tool has already helped people build over 8000 apps . So far, 2.6 million users joined in, and around 761,000 have finished all the steps to launch their ideas. The staking feature is also adding fuel. More than 37.7 million Pi coins have been staked to support over 1,450 apps, backed by 16,000 users. Meanwhile, popular projects like Healthy Life, BLACKHOLE, and FlapPi Bird show what’s possible. Secret Whale Wallet Draws Attention At the same time, a mystery Pi whale wallet has people talking. This wallet has quietly collected 331 million Pi coins, worth about $148 million , even while prices dropped. Known by the address GAS…ODM, the wallet has moved huge amounts of Pi from exchanges like OKX, MEXC, and Gate.io in the last three months. This has sparked new questions about what might come next for Pi Network. Breaking Free From Bitcoin’s Grip It’s no secret that the whole crypto market has always danced to Bitcoin’s tune. When Bitcoin rises, most other coins rise too. When it drops, they usually fall. But Pi Network is starting to break away from this old pattern. Its recent boost didn’t come because Bitcoin spiked. Instead, Pi’s momentum came from inside, its team, its vision, and its growing community. This marks a big shift. Many other coins have tried to stand on their own, but few have done it with real use cases. Pi is different, it’s not just about hype or price charts. That Leg Up from Dr. Nicolas (a.k.a. Satoshi) Means A Lot Pi Is Starting to Take Its Own Path Let’s be honest — that recent leg up from Dr. Nicolas hit different. Whether it was a quiet behind-the-scenes push or a calculated move by the Core Team, it showed us something… pic.twitter.com/UuXli0Gzzn — Mr Spock 𝛑 (@MrSpockApe) July 22, 2025 Real People, Real Utility One thing that makes Pi stand out is what people are doing with it. Real stores are accepting Pi as payment. Developers are launching apps built just for Pi users. And the new Desktop App Studio makes it easier for everyday people to build tools for Pi’s growing world. These actions prove that Pi isn’t waiting for Bitcoin to lead. It’s building its path, brick by brick. That push from Dr. Nicolas was more than a simple update, it reminded everyone that Pi’s mission is alive and moving forward. It’s about creating a digital currency that everyday people can use in their daily lives, not just hold and hope.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-22 09:52:52

With August 2025 just a few months away, we asked ChatGPT to analyze current data, sentiment and historical patterns to predict what might happen to Ethereum, Solana and the rising project, Remittix . You would be surprised to see what AI-driven forecasts suggest for these major tokens. Ethereum Price Forecast: Will ETH Cross $5,000? The Ethereum price has seen slow but steady progress in the past quarter. The chart below shows that ETH stabilized around the $1,538 zone after a volatile early 2025. Source: TradingView According to ChatGPT’s analysis, Ethereum’s price could continue to climb from $4,800 to $5,200 by the end of August 2025, assuming an unexpected event hits the steady Bitcoin movement. Moreover, the price trajectory is highly favorable, especially if ETH 2.0 staking growth continues and Layer 2 rollups (like Arbitrum and Optimism) scale. Solana ’s Climb: Can SOL Break Through $200 Again? Enter Solana, which continues to do exploits with its speed, cost-efficiency and ecosystem expansion; not only is its NFT sector standing firm, but institutional interest in Solana-based tokenization keeps on growing. ChatGPT projects that Solana could hit a price range between $260 and $295 by August 2025 if daily active users and developers remain above Q1 2025 levels and SOL continues to avoid major outages or technical issues. Source: TradingView The Remittix Wildcard: 100x Potential? While Ethereum and Solana will likely remain stable top-tier performers, ChatGPT flagged Remittix as a potential breakout project, especially for early adopters. Remittix is a new decentralized remittance platform allowing users to send crypto across borders and receive fiat directly into their bank accounts. With over 40 supported tokens, low fixed fees and a seamless merchant API, Remittix is called the “Wise.com of crypto.” AI’s Remittix forecast suggests that the RTX token, priced at just $0.0842, could easily hit $1–$2 upon its launch, representing a 50x to 100x gain. Revenue-sharing features, limited supply and utility-based demand could push the market cap into the $1–2 billion range. If ChatGPT’s forecast stands true, we should be ready to see real gains come from new-gen tokens like Remittix that blend utility and decentralization. Don’t Miss: $250,000 Remittix Giveaway Is Live!

The token is trading around $0.48, with short-term resistance levels being tested amid rising interest from both developers and investors. The growing traction within its decentralized ecosystem, combined with significant whale activity and speculation around major exchange listings, is fueling the price momentum. Although the project is still waiting for a full open mainnet launch, the technicians and on-chain metrics point towards a bullish continuation to $0.6. Whale Accumulation, Reduced Supply Pressure Boost Price Stability The current PI price trend is heavily influenced by large-scale accumulation. A notable wallet recently acquired over 331 million PI tokens, triggering bullish sentiment across the network. This move coincided with a sharp drop in PI available on exchange-like markets, indicating low supply pressure. Historically, accumulation followed by tight supply has preceded major rallies in similar altcoins. Beyond the technicals, the fundamental backdrop for Pi Network is also evolving. The recent launch of Pi App Studio and hundreds of new dApps is creating developer demand for the token. However, the token is yet to get listed on popular platforms like Binance or OKx that may drive liquidity and institutional exposure, pushing the price beyond the $0.75 target later this year. Pi Price Prediction: How High Can it Rise in 2025 The PI price underwent a parabolic recovery but yet again failed to surpass the resistance zone between $0.52 and $0.526, which has now become a pivotal one to secure. Currently, the bulls have grown weak after pushing the price above $0.5, and as a result, the price has faced a small pullback. This pullback is expected to persist for a while, which may compel the price to test the local lows around $0.43 in the short term. However, the rebound seems to be dependent on the market sentiments and the buying volume. The short-term price action suggests the price is facing notable selling pressure, due to which a pullback to $0.44 could be on the horizon. The 4-hr MACD shows a drop in the buying pressure, while the stochastic RSI is plunging after rising above the upper threshold. This suggests the bears have begun to extract and continue to do so until it does not test the local support. The price may rebound, but the intensity of the recovery could completely depend on the strength of the bulls. With bullish technical structures aligning with ecosystem expansion and whale-driven accumulation, Pi Network is positioned for further upside in the short term. The immediate breakout target is $0.60, followed by $0.75 if major exchange listings or continued dApp growth materialize. Nonetheless, PI is emerging as a technically intriguing asset in the altcoin space as we head into Q3 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-22 09:53:39

Analysts at Bloomberg Economics say China has leaned more heavily on other nations to make finished goods or parts destined for the U.S. market. This trend picked up pace after Trump first launched his trade wars and slapped steeper restrictions on China. Their research shows that the share of China’s manufacturing tied to U.S.‑bound goods routed through partners such as Mexico and Vietnam climbed to 22 percent in 2023, up from 14 percent in 2017. If the Trump administration follows through on plans to impose extra duties or strict supply‑chain rules on those transshipments, it could threaten roughly 70 percent of exports from China to the United States. That, in turn, would put over 21 percent of China’s GDP at risk, analysts estimate. They also caution that the damage could spread further if countries grow wary of trading with China at all. “Trade flows via third countries are substantial and have helped cushion the blow from existing U.S. tariffs,” wrote Bloomberg Economics experts Chang Shu, David Qu, and Rana Sajedi in Tuesday’s research note. “Tighter controls on these shipments would increase the damage from the trade war and could erode growth opportunities in the long term.” Indirect shipments from China will face tougher actions The White House has signaled tougher action on what it sees as indirect shipments of Chinese goods. In recent weeks, U.S. officials sent letters to multiple governments warning that, unless new bilateral trade pacts are struck by August 1, they will face higher levies on products transshipped from China. While the letters gave few details, they suggest the administration may widen the net to cover many more Chinese‑made items entering the U.S. under the flag of other nations. Mexico and Vietnam top the list of countries China uses to funnel goods into the U.S., with the EU also serving as a major pathway. Those links could reshape upcoming U.S. negotiations with partners. For instance, the U.S.–U.K. trade agreement signed earlier this year includes clauses aimed at securing supply chains and limiting foreign control in sensitive areas. Still, the Bloomberg team notes that it remains unclear how strictly Washington can enforce new transshipment rules. The U.S. government’s definitions of what counts as locally made goods are vague, and methods for verifying origin have not been spelled out. China’s rare earth exports to the US jumped by 660% In the meantime, China’s rare earth magnet exports to the US jumped dramatically in June, following a breakthrough trade pact between the two sides. Data from China’s General Administration of Customs showed outbound shipments of these critical minerals rose to 353 metric tons last month, a 660% increase compared with 47 metric tons in the month prior. The surge came after Washington and Beijing reached agreements in June to sort out bottlenecks around rare earths and magnet exports. As part of those talks, chipmaker Nvidia has said it will resume H20 AI chip sales. China, which supplies over 90 percent of the world’s permanent magnets, had added several of these items to an export control list in early April in response to US tariffs. Overall, Chinese firms shipped 3,188 tons of permanent magnets around the globe in June, an increase of 157.5 percent from May’s 1,238 tons, though that total remained 38.1% below the 5,160 tons exported in June 2024.

While your primary focus might be on Bitcoin or Ethereum, the traditional Forex Market Analysis , particularly of major pairs like EUR/USD, often provides a foundational understanding of global economic health and investor sentiment. This broader financial landscape can indirectly influence the liquidity and stability of the cryptocurrency space. Recently, ING, a prominent financial institution, highlighted a significant development concerning the EUR/USD pair: it lacks sufficient bullish momentum. What does this mean for the world’s most traded currency pair, and how might it impact your broader financial perspective? Decoding the Latest EUR/USD Forecast from ING ING’s recent assessment paints a cautious picture for the Euro against the US Dollar. The core of their argument revolves around a persistent lack of strong buying interest, suggesting that any upward movements are likely to be temporary and fragile. This outlook is not just a passing observation; it stems from a careful evaluation of various economic and policy indicators that continue to favor the US Dollar over the Euro. Economic Divergence: The US economy has shown remarkable resilience, often outperforming its European counterparts. Stronger labor markets and more robust consumer spending in the US create a more attractive environment for investment, drawing capital towards dollar-denominated assets. Interest Rate Differentials: Central bank policies play a pivotal role. While both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) have grappled with inflation, the Fed’s stance on interest rates has often been perceived as more hawkish or adaptable, leading to higher yields on US bonds compared to Eurozone bonds. This yield differential makes the Dollar more appealing to investors seeking better returns. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in Europe, can weigh heavily on investor confidence in the Eurozone. Uncertainty often drives investors towards perceived safe-haven assets, and the US Dollar frequently benefits from this flight to safety. Forex Market Analysis : What’s Driving the Stagnation? Beyond ING’s specific points, a broader Forex Market Analysis reveals several systemic factors contributing to the EUR/USD’s struggle to find bullish momentum. These elements interact in complex ways, creating a challenging environment for the Euro. Inflation and Central Bank Policies Inflation remains a key determinant of central bank actions. In the Eurozone, while inflation has been a concern, the ECB has often adopted a more cautious approach to rate hikes compared to the Fed. This divergence in monetary policy philosophies directly impacts currency valuations. When a central bank signals a readiness to maintain higher rates for longer, its currency typically strengthens as it offers better returns for holding that currency. Consider the following comparison: Factor US Economy (USD) Eurozone Economy (EUR) Economic Growth Generally resilient, often outpacing Mixed, slower recovery in some areas Interest Rate Policy More aggressive/adaptive hikes More cautious/gradual hikes Inflation Trends Persistent, but showing signs of cooling Varied, but often stubborn in core components Labor Market Strong, low unemployment Varied, higher unemployment in some member states This table highlights the fundamental differences that can influence capital flows and, consequently, currency strength. Understanding the Euro Dollar Outlook : Key Levels and Resistance For traders and investors, understanding the technical landscape is as important as fundamental analysis. The current Euro Dollar Outlook suggests that key resistance levels are proving difficult for the pair to breach, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. These levels act as ceilings, where selling pressure tends to increase, preventing significant upward movement. Resistance Levels: Analysts often identify specific price points where the currency pair has struggled to advance in the past. Repeated failures to break above these levels signal a lack of buying conviction. For EUR/USD, these might be psychological levels like 1.0900 or 1.1000, or specific technical indicators. Support Levels: Conversely, support levels are price points where buying interest tends to emerge, preventing further declines. However, if these support levels are broken, it can signal a continuation of the bearish trend. Potential Scenarios: In a market lacking bullish momentum, common scenarios include consolidation (trading within a narrow range) or a gradual downtrend. Sharp upward moves are often quickly corrected, indicating that traders are quick to sell into strength. Currency Trading Insights : Navigating the Choppy Waters Given the current Euro Dollar Outlook , what are the actionable Currency Trading Insights for those looking to engage with the forex market, or even understand its broader implications for their crypto portfolio? Strategies for a Bearish or Range-Bound Market Embrace Caution: Avoid aggressive long positions on EUR/USD unless there’s a significant fundamental shift or a clear technical breakout. The path of least resistance appears to be downwards or sideways. Consider Short Positions: For experienced traders, shorting the EUR/USD pair on rallies towards resistance levels could be a viable strategy, provided robust risk management is in place. Focus on Relative Strength: Instead of looking for outright strength in the Euro, consider trading other pairs where the Euro might be relatively stronger or weaker against a different currency, if that aligns with your analysis. Monitor Economic Data Closely: Pay close attention to US inflation reports, Fed speeches, ECB policy meetings, and Eurozone GDP figures. Unexpected data releases can trigger sharp, albeit potentially temporary, movements. Risk Management is Paramount: In a volatile and uncertain market, strict stop-loss orders are essential to protect capital. Position sizing should be conservative to account for potential sudden swings. The Influence of Global Economic Factors on EUR/USD The performance of major currency pairs like EUR/USD is rarely isolated. It is deeply intertwined with broader Global Economic Factors that shape investment flows and risk appetite. These macro trends create the backdrop against which central banks make their decisions and investors form their opinions. Energy Prices: Europe is a net importer of energy, making its economy particularly sensitive to fluctuations in global oil and gas prices. High energy costs can fuel inflation and dampen economic growth, weakening the Euro. Supply Chain Dynamics: Ongoing disruptions in global supply chains can impact manufacturing output, trade balances, and inflation across both the US and Eurozone, creating ripple effects on their respective currencies. Trade Balances: A country’s trade balance (exports minus imports) can influence its currency. A persistent trade deficit means more of the local currency is being sold to buy foreign goods, putting downward pressure on its value. Political Stability: Geopolitical events, elections, and political stability within the Eurozone can significantly impact investor confidence. Uncertainty often leads to capital flight and a weaker currency. Understanding these overarching themes provides a more holistic perspective on why the EUR/USD might be struggling. It’s not just about interest rates; it’s about the entire economic ecosystem. Challenges and Opportunities in a Stagnant Market The lack of bullish momentum in EUR/USD presents both challenges and opportunities for traders. The primary challenge is the potential for whipsaw movements or extended periods of range-bound trading, which can frustrate directional traders. Unexpected news can also trigger sharp, short-lived rallies or declines, making it difficult to maintain positions. However, opportunities exist. For those who excel at range trading, the current environment might offer consistent, albeit smaller, gains by buying at support and selling at resistance. Furthermore, the weakness in EUR/USD can serve as a signal for broader trends, such as the continued strength of the US Dollar against other major currencies, which could inform other trading decisions. Conclusion: A Cautious Path Ahead for EUR/USD ING’s assessment that EUR/USD lacks sufficient bullish momentum underscores a prevailing sentiment of caution in the forex market. The confluence of economic divergence, differing central bank policies, and persistent global economic factors continues to favor the US Dollar. For traders, this means maintaining a vigilant approach, prioritizing risk management, and adapting strategies to a market that may continue to show limited upward potential. While the Euro could see temporary bounces, a sustained bullish reversal appears unlikely without significant shifts in fundamental drivers. Stay informed, stay agile, and always base your decisions on comprehensive analysis.

However, according to Tokeo co-founder Shaz, the truth is slightly more nuanced. In a post shared on July 22, Shaz addressed the viral headlines circulating around CardanoKit, a development toolkit that enables Cardano functionality on Apple devices. While the toolkit is indeed being worked on by Tokeo, he cautioned that: “social media [is] taking things wayyyy out of proportion.” I'm seeing so much free marketing for CardanoKit and Cardano/Apple tooling that we're building out via @Tokeo_io rn, gotta love Open source development and social media taking things wayyyy out of proportion 😅 pic.twitter.com/Meuc01mgqB — ShAz (@zudizzle) July 22, 2025 The marketing buzz, he noted, has centered on the assumption that ADA payments are now fully supported via Apple Pay, which is not the case. What is the situation with Cardano and Apple PaY’ What’s actually in progress is something broader and potentially more impactful. Shaz confirmed that Tokeo is just weeks away from launching a crypto-enabled Mastercard , developed in partnership with Mercuryo , a major payment gateway. The card will allow users to spend ADA using Apple Pay, bridging the gap between Web3 assets and traditional point-of-sale systems. “They forgot to mention that very soon you’ll be able to use your Mastercard via Apple Pay to buy things using your ADA,” Shaz wrote. “That’s a whole other deliverable we’re working on.” They forgot to mention that very soon you'll be able to use your MasterCard via Apple Pay to buy things using your ADA, which is a whole other deliverable we're working on https://t.co/w9Z1WNs2a8 — ShAz (@zudizzle) July 22, 2025 He also hinted at a growing pipeline of integrations, partnerships, and wallet infrastructure enhancements that Tokeo is currently building or exploring. These include collaborations with stablecoin providers, POS systems, identity solutions, wallet abstraction tools, and more. The ultimate goal, according to Shaz, is to build a product that targets users outside the core crypto space and makes Web3 payments accessible in the real world. The attention around CardanoKit is a sign of the growing appetite for seamless crypto payments, especially across platforms like iOS. While ADA is not yet natively supported by Apple Pay, the infrastructure being developed by Tokeo could make that experience possible through indirect routes like card-linked payments.

This unexpected surge has eclipsed well-known meme coins, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts. Its rapid rise prompts curiosity about what sets it apart. Could this be the next significant player in the digital currency arena? Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin has been on the move recently. Over the past week, its price surged by 38.90%. In the last month, it climbed by 68.25%. However, over six months, Dogecoin’s price is down by 26.10%. Short-term indicators suggest a bullish trend. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.27198, above the 100-day average of $0.24264, indicating upward momentum. The RSI is at 66.17, nearing the overbought zone, which could mean the price might rise further in the short term. Dogecoin is currently trading between $0.21563 and $0.30593. The nearest resistance level is at $0.3373. Breaking through this could target the second resistance at $0.4276, an increase of about 40%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.1567. Falling to this level would be a decrease of around 40%. Traders are watching these levels closely to see where Dogecoin might head next. Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant movement in its price recently. Over the past week, the price has increased by over 17%. Looking at the past month, the coin has surged by nearly 47%. However, over the last six months, it has experienced a slight decline of around 9%. These fluctuations show that PEPE is gaining momentum in the short term, despite a longer-term downtrend. The current price ranges between $0.00001227 and $0.00001520. The simple moving averages indicate a positive trend, with the 10-day SMA at $0.00001417 and the 100-day SMA at $0.00001357. The Relative Strength Index is at 62.40, suggesting that the coin is approaching overbought territory. The Stochastic oscillator reading of 81.87 also indicates strong buying pressure. PEPE is nearing its nearest resistance level at $0.00001637. If it breaks through this point, it could aim for the second resistance level at $0.00001930, representing a potential increase of around 20%. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.00001050. If the price falls below this level, it might find further support at $0.000007567. Traders should watch these key levels closely, as they could signal significant movements in the price. Conclusion While DOGE and PEPE have seen success, XYZVerse (XYZ) merges sports and memes, aiming for 20,000% growth and poised to lead the 2025 bull run.

Solana Hits $200 in Altcoin Rally as Open Interest Shoots to $1.5B – Macro Data Shows Meme Coins Ready to Blow July 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Solana is up by 24% in the last week , and this morning, it hit $204, a 5-month high that everyone’s been expecting with bated breaths. Many are sure this is the start of an altcoin season, and $SOL’s $1.5B rise in open interest in three days shows there’s some meat on the bone of that hope. According to Sean Dawson (Head of Research at Derive), Layer-1s like Solana are benefitting from crypto-political developments like GENIUS and Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. Ethereum is also greedy for that $4k level, and altcoins are burning red-hot at the moment. In such a context, how could meme coins, the degen darlings of the crypto world, not shoot up? Memecoin trading volume is up by 14% in the last day, and many in the top 10 are showing ample upside in the last week.

Those who jumped in during Phase 2 bought tokens at just $0.015, and the price has since doubled to $0.03. This early return has sparked growing excitement around the project as it moves forward, especially with 87% of Phase 5 tokens already sold. Backed by a strong CertiK audit scoring 95 on Token Scan and 77.5 on Skynet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining trust and momentum among investors looking for a reliable and scalable DeFi solution. Milestones Unfolding: From Smart Contracts to Beta Testing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s journey is carefully mapped out, with each phase building on solid foundations. In Phase 2, the team focuses on developing the core smart contracts, front-end, and back-end infrastructure that will power the platform’s lending and borrowing features. These smart contracts are designed with security and efficiency in mind, ensuring smooth operation when the platform goes live. Looking ahead, Phase 3 will bring the much-anticipated beta launch. This testnet release will enable users to explore the platform’s features and provide valuable feedback through a structured bug reporting system. Alongside the beta, preparations for exchange listings are underway, which will boost liquidity and allow a broader range of investors to participate. These strategic milestones highlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s disciplined and transparent approach to development, laying the groundwork for sustained growth. A key differentiator in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming lending ecosystem is its planned dual model: P2C (Peer-to-Contract) and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) lending. In the future, a user lending $20,000 worth MATIC at a 65% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could receive $1,840 earning at an APY of 9.2%, automatically compounded on-chain. This would reward lenders with passive income while maintaining liquidity. On the borrowing side, high-risk memecoins like DOGE are expected to be accepted as collateral in the P2P model. A borrower putting up $100,000 worth of DOGE at a 30% LTV could access a $30,000 USDC loan, gaining quick liquidity without selling their tokens. This flexibility is designed to attract a wide user base, from cautious lenders to active traders. Layer 2 Scalability Unlocking DeFi’s True Potential One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strongest advantages comes from its integration with Layer 2 solutions. By shifting operations to Layer 2, the platform reduces gas fees by a huge percentage, a significant improvement over traditional Layer 1 networks. This reduction in transaction costs removes a major barrier for smaller investors and frequent users, opening the door to more inclusive DeFi participation. Lower fees and faster transaction speeds will allow Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to handle larger volumes without congestion, improving the user experience and attracting more participants. This scalability advantage will be crucial as the platform prepares to launch its beta and mainnet, positioning it to compete with established DeFi protocols on both usability and efficiency. Community support plays a vital role in this growth story. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $100,000 giveaway program, rewarding ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, has energized the community and drawn in new supporters. With over 12,000 Twitter followers actively engaging with updates and discussions, the network effects are already driving token velocity and platform awareness. As the ecosystem expands, this strong community foundation will amplify Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s reach and adoption. Market analysts are starting to take notice as well. A renowned investor who accurately timed Bitcoin (BTC)’s surge to $120,000 is now forecasting that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will climb to $0.45 by mid-2026—which represents a 15x increase from the current Phase 5 presale price of $0.03. Real investor stories are already reflecting impressive gains. One early adopter allocated $3,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2, when tokens were priced at $0.015. At today’s presale rate of $0.03, their investment has already doubled, showing a 100% return even before the token lists publicly. Once MUTM reaches its listing price of $0.06, this investor could be looking at a 4x total return. And if the projected $0.45 target is achieved by mid-2026, their initial $3,000 could balloon to $90,000—a stunning 30x gain. With only 13% of Phase 5 tokens remaining, the urgency to buy in before the price climbs to $0.035 in the next phase is real. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s clear roadmap, strong audit credentials, and growing community all point to substantial upside ahead. For investors looking to ride a well-structured, milestone-driven DeFi launch, MUTM represents an opportunity too compelling to overlook. The time to act is now—locking in MUTM tokens during the final stretch of Phase 5 secures a position ahead of price increases and growing market demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most exciting DeFi presale gems of 2025, ready to reward investors who understand the value of innovation, security, and strategic growth.

48720077,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=181091,1753178420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48720077.jpeg,Unlocking the EUR/GBP Risk Premium: ING’s Crucial Insights for Astute Traders,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eur-gbp-risk-premium-ing/,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking the EUR/GBP Risk Premium: ING’s Crucial Insights for Astute Traders Even in the fast-paced world of digital assets, understanding the nuances of traditional financial markets, like the foreign exchange (forex) market, remains crucial. Just as Bitcoin and Ethereum react to global sentiment, major currency pairs like EUR/GBP are constantly influenced by economic forces. Recently, ING, a prominent financial institution, highlighted a significant development: markets are attaching a notable EUR/GBP risk premium . This phenomenon, while seemingly distant from your crypto portfolio, offers valuable insights into broader market sentiment, capital flows, and the underlying economic health of major global economies. Let’s delve into what this risk premium signifies, why it’s emerging, and what it could mean for the financial landscape. What is the EUR/GBP Risk Premium and Why Does it Matter? At its core, a risk premium is the additional return an investor demands for taking on a higher level of risk. In the context of currency pairs like EUR/GBP, it means that market participants are requiring more compensation to hold one currency over another, specifically the British Pound (GBP) over the Euro (EUR), due to perceived higher risks associated with the UK economy. When ING states that a risk premium is being attached to the EUR/GBP pair, it suggests that the market is pricing in a greater degree of uncertainty or potential downside for the Pound relative to the Euro. Why does this matter for anyone, even those primarily interested in crypto? Because currency movements are a fundamental barometer of a nation’s economic health and its attractiveness for investment. A rising risk premium on GBP indicates that global investors view the UK as a riskier place to invest or hold assets compared to the Eurozone. This can have far-reaching implications: Investment Flows: Higher risk might deter foreign direct investment into the UK, impacting economic growth. Trade Dynamics: A weaker Pound, driven by risk premium, can make UK exports cheaper but imports more expensive, affecting inflation and consumer purchasing power. Inflationary Pressures: If a weaker Pound pushes up import costs, it can exacerbate domestic inflation, creating a challenging environment for the Bank of England. Policy Decisions: Central banks closely monitor currency strength and risk premiums as they inform monetary policy decisions, such as interest rate adjustments. Broader Market Sentiment: The sentiment around major currency pairs often reflects global risk appetite. A significant risk premium on a G10 currency like GBP can signal underlying economic stress that could spill over into other asset classes. Understanding this premium is crucial for anyone seeking a holistic view of financial markets, as it provides a lens through which to interpret macro-economic trends and their potential impact on all asset classes, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. ING Market Insights : Decoding the Drivers ING’s analysis points to specific factors contributing to this elevated EUR/GBP risk premium . Their insights typically stem from a deep dive into macroeconomic data, central bank rhetoric, and geopolitical developments affecting both the UK and the Eurozone. While the exact details of ING’s latest report would provide precise figures, the general drivers for such a premium often include: Persistent UK Inflation: The UK has faced stubbornly high inflation, often outstripping that of the Eurozone. This puts the Bank of England (BoE) in a difficult position, balancing the need to tame inflation with concerns about economic growth. Higher, more persistent inflation can erode purchasing power and make a currency less attractive. Economic Growth Disparity: Concerns about the UK’s economic growth prospects, including the risk of recession, can weigh heavily on the Pound. If the Eurozone is perceived to have more resilient or stable growth, capital might flow from the UK to the Eurozone, demanding a premium for holding GBP. Monetary Policy Divergence: While both the BoE and the European Central Bank (ECB) have been tightening monetary policy, the market’s perception of their respective trajectories and effectiveness can create divergence. If the market believes the BoE might have to pause or reverse hikes sooner than the ECB, or if its actions are seen as less effective, it can weaken the Pound. Brexit’s Lingering Impact: The long-term economic consequences of Brexit, including trade barriers, labor shortages, and reduced foreign investment, continue to cast a shadow over the UK economy. These structural issues can contribute to a persistent risk premium. Geopolitical and Energy Shocks: Both regions are susceptible to global events, but their resilience and exposure can differ. For instance, the energy crisis affected both, but the UK’s unique energy market structure or trade relationships might make it more vulnerable in certain scenarios. To illustrate the disparity that might drive ING’s conclusions, consider a simplified comparison of key economic indicators: Economic Indicator United Kingdom (GBP) Eurozone (EUR) Implication for EUR/GBP Risk Premium Inflation Rate (CPI) Higher, more persistent Elevated, but potentially peaking UK’s higher inflation pressure can add to GBP weakness, as real returns are eroded. GDP Growth Slower, recession fears prevalent Modest, but generally more resilient Weaker UK growth outlook makes GBP less attractive for growth-seeking investors. Central Bank Stance (BoE vs. ECB) Aggressive hikes, but potential limits due to growth concerns Catching up, perceived to have more room for hikes Divergence in policy expectations impacts yield differentials and investor confidence. Trade Balance Persistent deficit, exacerbated by energy prices Mixed, but showing signs of improvement in some areas UK’s trade deficit can weigh on GBP demand, as more currency leaves the country. Fiscal Policy Stability Recent political instability impacted bond markets Generally more coordinated, despite national differences Perceived fiscal uncertainty in the UK can increase risk perception for GBP. These disparities, when analyzed by institutions like ING, form the basis for market expectations and the pricing of risk into currency pairs. Navigating Currency Pair Trading in Volatile Times For traders, understanding the existence and drivers of a EUR/GBP risk premium is paramount, especially when engaging in currency pair trading . Volatility, while presenting risks, also creates opportunities for those who can accurately assess market sentiment and economic fundamentals. When a risk premium emerges, it signals a shift in market perception that can be exploited through various trading strategies. How Traders React: Shorting GBP: If the risk premium implies a weaker Pound, traders might initiate ‘short’ positions on GBP, betting on its depreciation against other major currencies, including the Euro. Long EUR/GBP: This specific trade involves buying the Euro and selling the Pound, capitalizing on the expected appreciation of EUR relative to GBP. Hedging Strategies: Businesses or investors with exposure to GBP assets might use options or forward contracts to hedge against potential losses from a depreciating Pound, effectively buying insurance against currency risk. Monitoring Yield Differentials: Traders will closely watch the interest rate differentials between the UK and the Eurozone. If the premium is driven by expectations of lower future UK rates or higher Eurozone rates, it influences carry trades. Challenges in Volatile Times: Sudden Policy Shifts: Central banks can surprise markets with unexpected interest rate decisions or guidance, leading to rapid currency movements that can liquidate positions. Unpredictable Economic Data: Economic indicators can deviate significantly from forecasts, causing immediate market reactions. Liquidity Issues: In extreme volatility, liquidity can dry up, making it difficult to enter or exit trades at desired prices. Geopolitical Shocks: Unforeseen global events can override economic fundamentals, leading to ‘flight to safety’ moves or sudden risk aversion. Actionable Insights for Traders: To navigate these challenging conditions, traders should: Stay Informed: Regularly consume macroeconomic news, central bank statements, and reports from institutions like ING. Diversify: Do not put all capital into a single trade or currency pair. Implement Robust Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and never over-leverage positions. Understand the ‘Why’: Beyond just price movements, comprehend the underlying economic and political reasons driving the EUR/GBP risk premium . While the forex market operates differently from crypto, the principles of risk management, market analysis, and staying informed are universally applicable for astute traders across all asset classes. Understanding Forex Market Analysis in a Shifting Landscape The concept of a EUR/GBP risk premium is a direct outcome of thorough forex market analysis . This analysis typically involves two primary approaches: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. In a rapidly shifting global economic landscape, combining these methods provides a comprehensive view of currency pair dynamics. Fundamental Analysis: This involves evaluating a currency’s value based on economic, social, and political factors. For the EUR/GBP pair, fundamental analysts would scrutinize: Macroeconomic Indicators: GDP growth rates, inflation figures (CPI), employment data, retail sales, and manufacturing output from both the UK and the Eurozone. Stronger economic data typically supports a currency. Central Bank Policies: Decisions and forward guidance from the Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) regarding interest rates, quantitative easing/tightening, and inflation targets are paramount. Divergence in policy can significantly impact currency valuations. Government Policy and Fiscal Health: Government spending, taxation, budget deficits, and national debt can influence investor confidence. Recent fiscal policy shifts in the UK have notably impacted GBP. Geopolitical Events: Wars, trade disputes, political instability, and major elections can introduce uncertainty and affect investor sentiment towards a currency. Trade Balances and Capital Flows: A country with a persistent trade deficit (importing more than it exports) might see its currency weaken due as more domestic currency is sold to buy foreign goods. Capital flowing into a country for investment strengthens its currency. Technical Analysis: This approach involves studying past market data, primarily price and volume, to identify patterns and predict future price movements. For EUR/GBP, technical analysts would look at: Price Charts: Identifying trends, support and resistance levels, and chart patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms). Indicators: Using tools like Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD, and Bollinger Bands to gauge momentum, overbought/oversold conditions, and volatility. Volume: While less direct in spot forex, volume can confirm the strength of price movements in related futures markets. The landscape for forex analysis is constantly evolving. The increasing interconnectedness of global economies means that an event in one region can quickly ripple through currency markets. Furthermore, the rise of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading means that market reactions can be instantaneous. For institutions like ING, their analytical edge comes from proprietary models, access to vast data, and the expertise of their economists and strategists who can synthesize complex information into actionable insights, such as identifying a EUR/GBP risk premium . The Global Economic Outlook and Its Impact on EUR/GBP The existence of a EUR/GBP risk premium cannot be fully understood without considering the broader global economic outlook . Currency markets are deeply intertwined with the health of the world economy, and macro trends often dictate the direction of major currency pairs. The current global environment is characterized by several overarching themes that directly influence the Euro and the Pound: Global Inflationary Pressures: While central banks worldwide are fighting inflation, the pace and severity of inflation vary. If global inflation remains high, it pressures central banks to maintain tight monetary policies, which can impact economic growth and currency valuations differently across regions. Interest Rate Hikes and Monetary Tightening: Central banks globally have been hiking interest rates aggressively. The market constantly assesses which central bank is more hawkish (aggressive on rate hikes) or dovish (less aggressive). Divergence in these policies between the BoE and ECB, influenced by their respective domestic inflation and growth outlooks, directly impacts the EUR/GBP pair. Recession Fears: The risk of a global recession or significant economic slowdown looms. If the UK is perceived to be more vulnerable to a recession than the Eurozone, or vice versa, it can exacerbate the risk premium. Energy shocks, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical conflicts contribute to these fears. Energy Prices: Europe, including the UK, is highly dependent on energy imports. Fluctuations in global oil and gas prices have a significant impact on trade balances, inflation, and industrial output, directly affecting the economic health of both regions and, consequently, their currencies. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing conflicts and geopolitical instability create uncertainty, often leading to a ‘flight to safety’ into perceived safe-haven currencies (like the US Dollar) or away from riskier assets. While both the UK and Eurozone are impacted, their specific vulnerabilities can influence capital flows between them. For instance, if the global economic outlook deteriorates significantly, leading to a widespread risk-off sentiment, currencies perceived as having greater domestic vulnerabilities (like the GBP due to its structural challenges) tend to underperform those with more perceived stability (like the EUR, backed by the larger, more diversified Eurozone economy). Conversely, an improving global outlook might reduce the perceived risk, potentially narrowing the EUR/GBP risk premium . The interconnectedness of financial markets means that the risk premium identified by ING is not an isolated event but a reflection of how global forces are disproportionately impacting two major European economies. For anyone in the financial space, from forex traders to crypto investors, understanding these macro currents is essential for informed decision-making and risk assessment. Key Challenges and Actionable Insights for Investors Navigating markets where a significant EUR/GBP risk premium is present, and indeed the broader financial landscape, comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities. For both traditional and crypto investors, the key is to adapt and remain vigilant. Challenges: Volatility: High volatility in currency pairs like EUR/GBP can lead to rapid and unpredictable price swings, making risk management difficult. Information Overload: The sheer volume of economic data, central bank statements, and geopolitical news can be overwhelming, making it hard to filter out relevant signals. Correlation Shifts: In times of stress, traditional correlations between asset classes can break down, making diversification less effective. Policy Uncertainty: Central banks face unprecedented challenges, and their policy responses can be unpredictable, creating market uncertainty. Actionable Insights: Focus on Macro Trends: Understand the big picture – global inflation, interest rates, and growth prospects. These macro trends often dictate the long-term direction of major currency pairs. Monitor Central Bank Communication: Pay close attention to speeches, minutes, and press conferences from the BoE and ECB. Their forward guidance is crucial. Diversify Across Asset Classes: While this article focuses on forex, remember the importance of a diversified portfolio that includes various asset classes, potentially including a small allocation to digital assets for long-term growth. Employ Robust Risk Management: Regardless of the asset, never risk more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-losses and position sizing to manage exposure. Seek Expert Analysis: Leverage insights from reputable financial institutions like ING. Their deep research can provide valuable context and foresight. A Compelling Summary: The Enduring Relevance of Traditional Market Signals The identification of a significant EUR/GBP risk premium by ING serves as a powerful reminder that traditional financial markets, particularly forex, remain crucial barometers of global economic health and investor sentiment. This premium reflects deep-seated concerns about the UK’s economic resilience relative to the Eurozone, driven by factors such as persistent inflation, growth disparities, and the lingering effects of geopolitical shifts. For anyone engaged in financial markets, from seasoned forex traders navigating currency pair trading to crypto enthusiasts observing broader market trends, understanding these dynamics is invaluable. It underscores the interconnectedness of global finance, where the global economic outlook and meticulous forex market analysis by institutions like ING can reveal critical insights into capital flows and risk appetite. By paying attention to these signals, investors can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the forces shaping not just currency markets, but the entire financial ecosystem, including the burgeoning world of digital assets.

Its price has also risen steadily through this time, beating the $3.6 level to reach new seven-year highs and triggering momentum for higher prices. While the community celebrates this milestone, there is the fact that the altcoin has not made a new all-time high, and even with all of the recent push, its inability to reach new peaks has become a cause for concern. Are XRP Investors Getting The Short End Of The Stick? In a TradingView post, crypto analyst ICharted made a shocking allegation, namely that XRP investors are being ripped off. The analyst pointed out that the fact that a number of bullish developments have emerged in recent times and the XRP price is still sitting well below its all-time high levels shows that investors were getting the short end of the stick. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whale Bets $21 Million After $2.14M Profit – What’s Going On? The analyst listed out seven developments that have been bullish for the XRP price and should’ve already pushed it to new peaks. First on the list is the election of US President Donald Trump, who is the first pro-crypto president in history. Despite the market surge triggered by Trump’s election, XRP has remained well below its all-time highs. Next on the list is the fact that the Ripple case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020 is nearing its end, and this has also triggered a surge. But it was still not enough for new peaks. This also comes amid mass adoption as Ripple becomes the foremost crypto settlement company in the industry. ICharted also pointed out the myriad of partnerships that Ripple has inked, spanning from payments to real estate, and yet the XRP price continues to struggle. This has put XRP in the eye of the public, making it a well-known cryptocurrency, especially as it plans to take on SWIFT, but it is still sitting below all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Re-Enters Profit Zone As Greed Rises, But Rally To $200,000 Still Possible The rise in the volume in the past year is another development the analyst points to, as well as the fact that it was able to receive an ETF approval this year, which began trading last week. Then, last but not least, is the fact that the US Congress has passed multiple favourable crypto bills this year, and yet the XRP price remains below its 2018 peaks. Given that none of these have been able to push the XRP price to new all-time highs, the analyst warned investors that they are being ripped up on the price action. ICharted pointed to a possible price crash back to the $2 level soon, predicting that a free fall will begin in August. “The Feds are soon going to cut rates multiple times. Bitcoin tanks everytime that happens,” the analyst warned.

The firm revealed that for Solana to sustain this momentum, it needs to flip $200 from resistance into support, just as Ethereum successfully turned $3,000 into a stable base during its rally. AltcoinVector also noted that Solana’s market structure and price impulses are aligning, and indicates that capital rotation is shifting toward SOL, which is now starting to “shine” in this active market cycle. Experts believe that this shift could continue for one to two weeks. They identified $220 as Solana’s first major target, after comparing it to Ethereum’s $4,000 level in significance during its rally. Reclaiming this level would signal strong momentum, setting Solana up to hit a new all-time high within days. The expert expressed confidence that if current conditions hold, SOL could break its previous ATH by August. SOL’s Institutional Adoption While traders eye SOL’s next targets, institutional adoption is also gaining momentum. For instance, DeFi Development Corp (DFDV) has expanded its Solana holdings to nearly one million SOL, after acquiring 141,383 SOL between July 14 and July 20. The stash is worth around $19 million. The Florida-based company’s total SOL and equivalents, including staking rewards, now stand at 999,999 SOL, which is approximately $190 million. DFDV stakes its assets across various validators, including its own, to capture native network yield. It also actively engages in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, earning 867 SOL within a week. The company is among the few publicly traded firms to use Solana as a core treasury asset. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Mining announced plans to raise $300 million to build a Solana token treasury. Additionally, tech investment firm MemeStrategy also became the first publicly listed company in Hong Kong to invest in Solana.

The move would represent a sharp reversal for CEO Jamie Dimon, who infamously called Bitcoin a “fraud” in 2017 and claimed it was only useful to “drug dealers and murderers.” According to people familiar with the matter, JPMorgan could begin offering crypto-collateralized loans as early as next year, although the plans remain subject to change. The bank declined to comment. Dimon softens crypto stance as JPMorgan expands push into digital assets If the initiative is implemented, it would allow clients to borrow against assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum—marking the clearest indication yet that Wall Street giants are integrating cryptocurrencies into their core services. It would also put JPMorgan ahead of competitors like Goldman Sachs , which has yet to accept crypto as collateral. In recent years, Dimon has tempered his stance. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it,” he said in May. His earlier comments, which included threats to fire traders who dabbled in crypto, reportedly alienated potential clients who had built wealth through digital assets or held strong convictions in the sector’s long-term potential. JPMorgan has already dipped into crypto through plans to lend against holdings in crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, lending against the digital tokens themselves would be a significant leap, especially as regulatory sentiment in Washington shifts. Stablecoin legislation spurs Wall Street interest The House of Representatives recently passed the first major crypto legislation to regulate stablecoins —digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar—which large banks have welcomed as a gateway to easier digital asset operations. Other firms are following suit. Morgan Stanley is weighing crypto trading options via its E*Trade platform, and broader institutional interest has picked up amid expectations that a second Trump administration could bring looser oversight than President Biden’s policies. Still, hurdles remain. A key concern for banks is managing money laundering risks and compliance obligations tied to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, JPMorgan must address technical challenges, such as managing seized collateral in case of loan defaults. Unlike most major banks, JPMorgan does not hold crypto directly on its balance sheet. Instead, it would likely work with a third-party custodian, such as Coinbase, to manage the assets. Still, hurdles remain. One of the biggest worries for banks is managing the risk of money laundering and the regulatory requirements associated with cryptocurrencies. And JPMorgan has to grapple with technological hurdles, like how to handle collateral confiscated from borrowers that fail to pay back their loans. In contrast to many other big banks, JPMorgan doesn’t keep crypto directly on its balance sheet. Instead, it would presumably use a third-party custodian, like Coinbase, to store the assets. Despite its cautious approach to mainstream cryptocurrencies, JPMorgan has long been active in the broader digital asset space. In 2019, it launched JPM Coin —the first digital token issued by a US bank, to streamline wholesale payments between institutional clients. Dimon recently said the bank plans to expand its role in stablecoins, including its own JPMorgan Deposit coin, although he has been skeptical of their advantages over traditional payment channels. Speaking during the bank’s Tuesday earnings call, Dimon stressed the need to understand and become an expert in the space, adding that stablecoins are part of a legitimate financial ecosystem. However, there’s a question over their practical use. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The buzz around the Figma IPO is reaching a fever pitch, and it’s not just about a design software giant going public. This initial public offering holds a surprising twist that will undoubtedly pique the interest of anyone watching the cryptocurrency space. Figma, a company synonymous with collaborative design, is not only targeting a massive valuation but is also making significant moves into crypto, signaling a potentially transformative shift for the tech industry. Figma IPO: A Blockbuster Debut on the Horizon? The highly anticipated Figma IPO is set to make waves on the New York Stock Exchange. According to reports from the Financial Times, the design software powerhouse plans to raise a substantial sum, aiming for up to $1 billion. This ambitious target would catapult the company’s valuation to an impressive $16.5 billion, a figure that underscores its dominance in the design software market. For those keeping an eye on market trends, the specifics of the Figma IPO are compelling: Shares Offered: Nearly 40 million shares are expected to be made available to the public. Price Range: Each share is anticipated to be priced between $25 and $28. Target Valuation: A staggering $16.5 billion, reflecting investor confidence in Figma’s growth trajectory and market position. Capital Raise: Up to $1 billion, which will provide significant capital for future expansion, innovation, and strategic initiatives. Backed by some of the most prominent venture capital firms, Figma has demonstrated robust financial health. In the first quarter, the company reported an impressive $228 million in revenue and a healthy $45 million in net income. While the previous year saw a $732 million loss, this was largely attributed to a stock tender offer, a common financial maneuver, rather than operational deficiencies. This strong Q1 performance paints a positive picture for the impending Figma IPO , indicating a company with solid fundamentals and a clear path to profitability. The Adobe Saga: Paving the Way for Figma’s Independence The journey to the Figma IPO has been particularly eventful, marked by a significant turning point involving Adobe. For those unfamiliar, Adobe, another titan in the creative software industry, had previously attempted a colossal $20 billion takeover of Figma. This acquisition would have reshaped the design software landscape entirely, consolidating immense power under one roof. However, regulatory bodies stepped in, ultimately blocking the proposed acquisition due to antitrust concerns. This intervention, while initially a setback for Adobe, proved to be a pivotal moment for Figma. It essentially cleared the path for Figma to pursue its independent future, culminating in the current plans for the Figma IPO . This regulatory decision underscored Figma’s critical role in the market and its potential to thrive as a standalone entity, free from the constraints of a larger corporate structure. It also highlighted the growing scrutiny over tech mega-mergers, reinforcing the idea that innovation and competition are best served by a diverse ecosystem of players. Beyond the Figma IPO: Why Crypto Investments Matter Now, here’s where the story takes an intriguing turn, especially for our audience passionate about digital assets. Beyond the impressive financial figures and market valuations, the Figma IPO prospectus reveals a strategic move that sets it apart from many traditional tech companies: its foray into cryptocurrency investments. Figma currently holds a notable $70 million in a Bitcoin ETF. This isn’t just a casual investment; it’s a significant commitment that signals a broader embrace of digital assets within the company’s financial strategy. Why would a design software company like Figma invest in a Bitcoin ETF? There are several compelling reasons: Diversification: Like any savvy investor, companies seek to diversify their portfolios to mitigate risks and enhance returns. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has shown potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Strategic Foresight: Figma recognizes the growing importance and legitimacy of the digital asset space. Investing now could position them favorably for future developments in Web3 and blockchain technology. Innovation Alignment: As a company at the forefront of digital design, investing in cutting-edge financial technologies aligns with Figma’s innovative ethos. Future Growth: Holding crypto assets could be seen as a long-term growth play, leveraging the potential appreciation of digital currencies. Furthermore, Figma’s plans extend beyond just holding a Bitcoin ETF. The company has explicitly stated its intention to make more crypto investments in the future. This commitment suggests a deeper integration of digital assets into their treasury management and potentially even their product roadmap. Imagine a world where design assets are tokenized or where payments for design services are made directly in crypto! Perhaps the most revolutionary revelation tied to the Figma IPO is the company’s consideration of issuing blockchain-based stock. This concept, known as tokenized securities, could fundamentally alter how companies raise capital and how ownership is represented. Instead of traditional shares, investors would hold digital tokens on a blockchain, offering potential benefits such as: Increased Liquidity: Tokenized stocks could be traded 24/7 on global blockchain networks. Fractional Ownership: Allowing investors to buy smaller portions of a share, making investments more accessible. Enhanced Transparency: Transactions recorded on a public ledger. Streamlined Processes: Potentially reducing intermediaries and administrative costs. If Figma moves forward with blockchain-based stock, it would be a pioneering step for a major tech company, potentially setting a precedent for future IPOs and corporate finance. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities Post-Figma IPO The impending Figma IPO , coupled with its ambitious crypto strategy, presents both significant opportunities and notable challenges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone watching this space. Opportunities: Access to Capital: The $1 billion raise will fuel Figma’s expansion into new markets, product development, and talent acquisition, solidifying its position as a market leader. Enhanced Public Profile: Going public elevates Figma’s brand visibility and credibility on a global scale, attracting more users and partners. Innovation in Finance: By exploring blockchain-based stock and holding crypto, Figma positions itself as a forward-thinking company, potentially attracting a new class of investors interested in the convergence of tech and decentralized finance. Competitive Edge: Integrating crypto into their strategy could differentiate Figma from competitors, appealing to a tech-savvy and crypto-native user base. Challenges: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. While a Bitcoin ETF offers some diversification, the value of their holdings can fluctuate significantly, impacting financial statements. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities is still evolving globally. Figma will need to navigate complex and potentially changing legal frameworks. Investor Perception: While exciting for some, traditional investors might view crypto investments as non-core and risky, potentially impacting stock performance. Execution Risk: Issuing blockchain-based stock is a complex undertaking with significant technical and legal hurdles. Successfully implementing such a system would require considerable resources and expertise. Comparing Figma’s approach to other tech giants, we see a spectrum. Some, like MicroStrategy, have made substantial direct investments in Bitcoin. Others, like Meta (formerly Facebook), explored their own digital currencies but faced significant regulatory pushback. Figma’s strategy seems to be a more measured yet ambitious approach, starting with ETFs and exploring tokenized stock, which could prove to be a more sustainable path to crypto integration for a public company. What Does the Figma IPO Mean for the Design and Crypto Worlds? The Figma IPO is more than just another tech company going public; it’s a barometer for evolving trends. For the design world, it reinforces Figma’s pivotal role and the growing demand for collaborative, cloud-based tools. It could spur further innovation and competition among design software providers, ultimately benefiting users. For the crypto world, Figma’s strategic investments are a powerful testament to the increasing institutional adoption of digital assets. When a company of Figma’s caliber, backed by top-tier venture firms and poised for a multi-billion-dollar valuation, publicly embraces Bitcoin and explores blockchain-based equity, it sends a strong signal of legitimacy and long-term potential. This move could encourage other tech companies to consider similar strategies, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized economy. In essence, the Figma IPO is not just about design; it’s about foresight, financial innovation, and the bold integration of emerging technologies into the core of a successful enterprise. It’s a development worth watching closely as it unfolds. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary purpose of Figma’s IPO? The primary purpose of the Figma IPO is to raise significant capital, up to $1 billion, which will be used to fund the company’s continued growth, expand its product offerings, explore new markets, and potentially invest further in strategic areas like cryptocurrency. Q2: How much is Figma expected to be valued at after its IPO? Figma is expected to be valued at approximately $16.5 billion following its initial public offering, based on its target share price range and the number of shares offered. Q3: Why did Adobe’s acquisition of Figma not go through? Adobe’s $20 billion acquisition of Figma was blocked by regulators due to antitrust concerns, as it would have significantly reduced competition in the creative software market. Q4: What kind of cryptocurrency investments has Figma made? Figma currently holds $70 million in a Bitcoin ETF and has expressed plans to make more crypto investments in the future. They are also exploring the possibility of issuing blockchain-based stock. Q5: What are the potential benefits of Figma issuing blockchain-based stock? Issuing blockchain-based stock could offer benefits such as increased liquidity, fractional ownership for investors, enhanced transparency through public ledgers, and potentially more streamlined and cost-effective transaction processes. Q6: How might Figma’s crypto strategy impact the broader tech industry? Figma’s embrace of crypto, especially its consideration of blockchain-based stock, could set a precedent for other major tech companies, encouraging them to explore similar digital asset strategies and potentially accelerate the adoption of decentralized finance principles in traditional corporate structures.

BlackRock’s ETF adds $100M in ETH, while Devnet-3 launches shortly after the Fusaka upgrade. Analysts see $4,000 as the final hurdle before Ethereum targets $13K to $17K levels. ETH Drops Back After Strong Weekly Rally Ethereum (ETH) fell below $3,700 after hitting a recent peak of $3,850. The price traded at around $3,650 at press time. ETH trading volume remains high, with over $53 billion in activity in the past 24 hours. The daily price dropped about 2%. Despite the pullback, ETH is still up nearly 24% in the last seven days. Consequently, crypto traders are paying attention to leveraged positions around the $3,600 to $3,700 range. Analyst CW shared that ETH is now in an area with heavy long positions. To trigger liquidations, the price would need to fall closer to $3,600. $ETH is falling and has reached a high leverage long position accumulation area. However, in order to liquidate the high leverage long position, it needs to fall to $3600.

The liquidation level on this position is $3,654.77. With the price hovering just above that, further losses could push it into liquidation and add to selling pressure. BlackRock and Developer Activity Large buyers continue to add ETH. BlackRock’s ETF recently added more than 27,000 ETH, worth about $100 million. Ethereum also led digital asset inflows last week with $2.12 billion, setting a new record. As reported by CryptoPotato , the Ethereum team is preparing for the Fusaka upgrade, which is expected to go live in early November. This upgrade aims to improve the network’s speed and efficiency. Additionally, two days after Fusaka’s mainnet launch, a new testnet called Devnet-3 is scheduled to go live. Meanwhile, developers are already working on the next upgrade phase, known as Glamsterdam. $4,000 Level Seen as Key Barrier Ethereum is once again nearing the $4,000 level. This price was the peak during the 2021 cycle. According to analyst BitBull, this zone is likely to act as the final barrier before a breakout. Past cycles show that Ethereum tends to move fast after clearing major resistance. Projections show a possible target range between $13,000 and $17,000 if the pattern repeats.

Peter Schiff, who made a surprising statement on the rise of the largest altcoin Ethereum, suggested selling Ethereum (ETH) and buying Bitcoin (BTC). Claiming that Ethereum has entered a bear market compared to Bitcoin at this point, Schiff argued that Ethereum is nearing the top of its trading range and that it might be better to sell it now and use the money obtained to buy Bitcoin. While Schiff is not a fan of either cryptocurrency, he notes that he currently sees Bitcoin as the stronger option. “Ethereum has reached the upper end of its trading range again. If you're holding now, it's a good time to sell. As painful as it is to say, selling Ethereum and using the proceeds to buy Bitcoin is a better strategy than continuing to hold Ethereum. Ethereum's Bullish Bearish Recovery! The famous name stated that he would not personally choose to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum, but he stated that Ethereum is in a bear market compared to Bitcoin. “ETH's recent rise is merely a recovery within a bear market. If you feel compelled to hold cryptocurrency, selling Ethereum and buying Bitcoin would be a more sensible choice.” Peter Schiff recently stated that Ethereum faces competition and a growing number of competitors in terms of its use cases. The expert argued that Ethereum offers more alternatives in terms of platform utility compared to Bitcoin. Ether is back near the upper end of its trading range again. If you own any, this is a great time to sell. As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 21, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase has launched CFTC-regulated nano BTC and ETH perpetual futures. The new products offer up to 10x leverage for US retail traders. Coinbase plans to expand its product lineup, targeting more cryptocurrencies. The launch introduces nano Bitcoin (BTC-PERP) and nano Ether (ETH-PERP) contracts through Coinbase Financial Markets, allowing leverage of up to 10x with taker fees starting at 0.02%, the exchange said in a Monday announcement . Perpetual contracts, derivatives with no expiry date, have traditionally made up the lion’s share of global crypto derivatives volume. US Traders Exit Shadows as Regulated Futures Arrive U.S. traders were long sidelined by regulatory barriers, pushing many toward unregulated offshore platforms, often at the expense of transparency and legal risk. Coinbase’s move changes that narrative, bringing these instruments within a federally regulated framework overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The contracts are structured to mimic traditional perpetuals while maintaining regulatory compliance, with five-year expirations and hourly funding rates to balance long and short positions. Settlements are conducted in USD, and trading is available 24/7, an industry standard in crypto that aligns with the global nature of digital assets. Coinbase’s rollout comes amid a broader push by U.S.-based exchanges to reclaim market share from overseas rivals. The firm recently acquired Deribit for $2.9 billion, positioning itself as a serious player in crypto derivatives. Kraken has also quietly launched its own CFTC-compliant perps via Kraken Pro, reflecting renewed domestic interest in regulated access to leverage products. Beyond BTC and ETH, Coinbase hinted at future listings tied to other major cryptocurrencies, including Solana and XRP, as it builds out a more comprehensive offering. The wait is over – Perpetual futures have arrived in the U.S. → No monthly expirations → Trade with up to 10x leverage → Fees as low as 0.02% Now you can trade perpetual-style futures on Coinbase Financial Markets, a secure and CFTC-regulated platform. pic.twitter.com/627ZOPTTzG — Coinbase Futures (@cbFutures) July 21, 2025 The company also offers 20x leverage for precious metals like silver and gold, appealing to traders seeking broader exposure across asset classes. “U.S. traders can now access enhanced capital efficiency and amplify their market positions within a secure, regulated framework,” the exchange said. Coinbase Named TIME ‘Disruptor’ As reported, TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. The accolade highlights Coinbase’s aggressive advocacy in Washington and its expanding influence in the crypto sector. Coinbase’s stock has surged 42% year-to-date, climbing from around $303 to a high near $382. The rise comes amid the passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill and Coinbase’s historic inclusion in the S&P 500 in May . TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator. The company plans to establish its European headquarters in Luxembourg. Additionally, Coinbase is seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized equities, which would position it as a competitor to popular retail trading platforms like Robinhood and WeBull.

In an X post, Solana Venture stated it is “ not affiliated or involved with any equity line of credit agreements with any publicly listed companies. “ Solana Ventures is not affiliated or involved with any equity line of credit agreements with any publicly listed companies or entities. — Solana Ventures (@SolanaVentures) July 21, 2025 Mercurity claimed the funding would support SOL accumulation, staking operations, validator nodes, and investments in Solana-based projects, including real-world assets and tokenized finance products. Solana Ventures or Another Company With The Same Name? Despite Solana Ventures’ swift denial, Mercurity Fintech hasn’t taken down their posts or provided any clarity on it. However, according to WuBlockchain, the company stated in its press release is not the renowned Solana Ventures but another company that simply uses a similar name. Solana Ventures said it has not signed or participated in any equity credit line agreements with any public company or institution. The company in the press release simply uses a similar name. — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 22, 2025 The incident comes as legitimate Solana treasury companies have driven significant market interest, with DeFi Development Corp. reaching 999,999 SOL holdings worth $181 million. The dispute occurs amid a broader corporate rush into Solana treasuries, with BIT Mining planning to raise $200-300 million for SOL accumulation and multiple companies pivoting from Bitcoin to alternative cryptocurrencies. Legitimate Solana Treasury Companies Drive Market Momentum DeFi Development Corp. has emerged as the leading Solana treasury company, purchasing 141,383 SOL between July 14 and 20 at an average price of $133.53 , for approximately $19 million. The Florida-based firm now holds 999,999 SOL and SOL equivalents, just one token short of its symbolic 1 million milestone. The company’s SOL-per-share ratio reached 0.0514, representing a 13% increase from the previous week as it targets 1 SPS by December 2028. DeFi Development has drawn only 0.4% of its $5 billion equity line of credit, raising $19.2 million with $5 million in proceeds remaining for future purchases. Similarly, BIT Mining announced plans to raise $200-300 million for Solana treasury conversion , marking a departure from its previous focus on mining Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic. The company’s stock surged over 300% in pre-market trading following the announcement of its pivot to the Solana ecosystem. Moreover, Canadian firm Sol Strategies holds over 420,000 SOL tokens and filed for a Nasdaq listing under ticker “STKE” as part of U.S. expansion plans. The company secured a $500 million convertible note facility earmarked for acquiring and staking additional SOL tokens. NextGen Digital Platforms has also purchased $1 million worth of Bitcoin as its first crypto acquisition, with board approval for up to 80% treasury allocation to digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The diversified approach shows a trend where corporate acceptance of multiple cryptocurrency treasuries is increasing. However, it is worth noting that altcoins carry heightened risks due to volatility, lower liquidity, and experimental technology compared to Bitcoin. Altcoin Treasury Trend Expands Beyond Bitcoin Strategy Animoca Brands’ Research reports that public companies are increasingly adding altcoins , such as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, to their treasury strategies, following MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin model. Public companies are increasingly adding altcoins like Ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, and XRP to their treasury strategies. #XRP #ETH https://t.co/P1ZjeIXlUu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 Companies utilize convertible debt and equity issuance to build exposure without direct spot market purchases. For instance, SharpLink Gaming increased its Ethereum holdings by purchasing 32,892 ETH , worth approximately $115 million, bringing the total accumulation to 144,501 ETH, valued at $515 million, over nine days. The company became the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum, with 353,000 ETH worth over $1.2 billion. In the past few weeks, corporate altcoin announcements have triggered average stock price jumps of 150% in one day, 185% in a week, and 226% over a month. Following this adoption trend, Solana’s market capitalization surged past $100 billion for the first time since January 2025, following a 6.7% jump that brought prices to $192.94. Source: CoinMarketCap The milestone positions Solana as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, just $9 billion behind Binance Coin. Adding to the growing momentum, Solana decentralized exchanges processed over $1 trillion in cumulative volume during the first half of 2025, exceeding the volume of the previous two halves combined.
