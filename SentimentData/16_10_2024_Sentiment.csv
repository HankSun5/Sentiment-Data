Bitcoin, for example, broke above $66,000 before cooling off earlier today. Like the world’s most valuable coin, Solana and its meme coins are trending higher. According to Coingecko, SOL trades above $150, adding nearly 7% in the previous trading week. Meme Coins Soaring But PELF Deployer Dumping The lift-off in Solana has seen some of its ecosystem tokens massively benefit. Among the many, Solana-based meme coins continue to rip higher. According to Coingecko, three Solana meme coins, including Popcat and DogWifHat, now command a market cap above $1 billion. Related Reading: SUI Records Substantial 120% Price Surge, But Insider Selling Claims Raise Red Flags While investors are closely tracking the performance of Popcat, the first cat-themed meme coin to break above the $1 billion level, some whales are fading the current bull run. One analyst, citing Nansen data, observes that the deployer of the PELF, a meme coin on Solana, is offloading. Initially, the deployer received 247 million PELF for 82 SOL worth $12,516. Later, the addresses received another 39.13 million PELF. According to on-chain data, the address has sold 3.2 million PELF for 662 SOL. Although analysts believe the deployer might have offloaded more tokens through other unknown addresses, the whale currently owns over $7.8 million worth of PELF at spot rates. Usually, any liquidation by a whale is considered bearish and might significantly influence price action. Retail traders, some interested in meme coins, often closely monitor the accounts of known whales, including deployers. If they choose to sell, moving tokens to a DEX, speculators will also look to sell before prices tank. Will Improving Crypto Sentiment Drive Demand? PELF remains in an uptrend, judging by the formation in the daily chart. The token is up nearly 300% from September lows. However, PELF is inside a broader range and down from its March 2024 highs. If buyers are to take charge, there must be a confirmation of October 14 gains. In that case, PELF could break above $0.0008101, bottoming out from Q3 2024 lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Road To $70,000? Analysts Set Next Targets As BTC Retests Key Levels Improving crypto sentiment could lift meme coins, driving them to new valuations. As of October 15, the total market cap of Solana meme coins exceeds $10.9 billion. Interestingly, they continue to grow in strength, looking at the number of Solana meme coins breaking into the top 10. According to Coingecko, Dogecoin is still the most valuable. However, DogWifHat, Bonk, and Popcat are now among the top 10, flipping Floki, Neiro on Ethereum and Brett.

Based on a crypto analyst’s prediction, Solana could be creating up for a major bull flag that could send its price to new all-time highs above $1,000. It’s important to note that Solana is currently trading at less than one-ninth of this projected price target of $1,400. SOL Bull Flag Points To $1,400 Price Increase A crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) identified as ‘Titan of Crypto,’ has shared a bullish forecast for Solana, predicting its rise to astronomical highs. The analyst predicted that Solana could see its price jump to $1,400 soon. Related Reading: Over $182 Million Wiped Out As Bitcoin Price Breaks $64,000 And Sends Bears To The Gallows In a comprehensive chart analysis of Solana’s price movements from 2023 till date, the analyst identified a well-defined bull flag pattern, which he described as “massive.” According to Titan of Crypto, the formation of this bull flag signals the potential for a major rally in the coming weeks and months. In the Solana price chart, the analyst traced the unique flag pattern, which began forming before October 2024. He extended the pattern into 2025, emphasizing that the flag would likely emerge around the end of 2024 or the beginning of the next year, before continuing its development through to October 2025. If SOL can successfully complete this pattern without experiencing significant price declines, the crypto analyst expects the top altcoin to reach new all-time highs at $1,429 by 2026. However, a more conservative price projection was given by another crypto analyst, who suggested that a $1,000 price surge based on the Heads and Shoulders technical indicator was a more realistic price target for Solana. Echoing this sentiment, Titan of Crypto disclosed that Solana’s Fibonacci extensions currency suggests a potential move towards the $1,400 price mark. While maintaining his bullish outlook for SOL, the analyst acknowledged that a $1,000 price target is also possible. He adjusted his previous forecast, stating that he expects Solana to see a price increase around the $1,000 range. Titan of Crypto has also confirmed that if Solana can pull off this projected price surge, its current market capitalization of $72.7 billion could potentially double, surpassing Ethereum’s market cap, which currently stands at $315 billion.

Market sentiment is improving alongside price action, fueling hopes for a sustained rally. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? Key data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin demand is rising, supporting the idea that Bitcoin could continue to climb. This growing demand and the improving market sentiment create a favorable environment for bullish momentum. Continuing the recent price surge could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach new highs, while any hesitation might lead to further consolidation. Either way, market participants are eagerly awaiting the next major move. Bitcoin Open Interest Reaching New Highs After surging to test local highs, Bitcoin is at a critical turning point, setting the stage for a potential rally that has analysts and investors optimistic. The price has surged over 12% in less than a week, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment in the market. This upward momentum has sparked hopes of continued gains, with many speculating that Bitcoin is on the verge of a significant breakout. Top crypto analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently shared a compelling CryptoQuant chart, revealing that Bitcoin’s open interest across all exchanges has just hit a new all-time high of $19.75 billion. This spike in open interest often precedes large price moves, signaling heightened activity and more capital at stake in the market. A surge in open interest suggests that traders are positioning themselves for significant price action, potentially adding more fuel to the current rally. The data from CryptoQuant supports the growing bullish outlook for Bitcoin, as it suggests that investors and traders are increasingly confident in the asset’s near-term performance.

Bitcoin could be on track to test new highs if this momentum continues, paving the way for a broader market rally. As the market eyes this critical juncture, the next few days will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s trajectory. BTC Pushing Local Highs Bitcoin is trading at $65,600 after consolidating following yesterday’s surge to local highs. The price is eyeing the crucial $66,500 resistance level, which, if broken, could send BTC to new all-time highs. This resistance has been a key barrier for Bitcoin, and a successful push above it would confirm the bullish momentum and likely lead to further gains. BTC is now trading well above its 200-day moving average (MA) at $63,336, further solidifying the positive outlook for Bitcoin in the coming weeks. Holding above this MA is a strong indicator that the bulls are in control. The market is poised for a potential rally. However, for Bitcoin to continue its upward trajectory, it must break the $66,500 level and set a new high. On the downside, if BTC fails to surpass this resistance, a retrace to lower demand levels around $62,000 could occur, which would still be a healthy correction within the broader uptrend.

The memecoin’s extraordinary 48x return in a single month was a result of its precipitous rise from $0.000039 to $0.002. Neiro explodes in price in the last month. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Dogecoin Revival: Active Addresses Skyrocket To Highest Level In 8 Months Despite this dramatic rally, the coin has slowed down its momentum, losing 15% from its peak of $0.0022. Price forecast from CoinCodex still calls for further increases in the future for the cryptocurrency, foreseen to reach 219%, getting up to a price of $0.019284 by November 2024, as traders start wondering if this is only the beginning of a much more massive drop. In the short term, traders are concerned with whether Neiro’s retracement is temporary or if the memecoin has reached its maximum potential. However, this long-term forecast indicates the possibility of substantial upside. Retracement Strikes Critical Support Neiro’s recent drop in price coincided with a daily bullish order block, causing the price to fall to a critical support level—the 23% Fibonacci retracement area—at the time of publication. These levels are essential because they have the potential to provide the necessary support to prevent further declines. The bulls would proceed to the 37% Fib level as their subsequent line of defense if the retracement persists. Neiro’s stochastic RSI indicates an oversold condition, which suggests a potential rebound. Furthermore, the RSI continues to exceed the neutral 50 level, which serves to bolster the likelihood of a price reversal. If momentum returns, some analysts predict that Neiro could increase to $0.0027, which would be a 20% increase from its current value. Longs Predominate, But Sentiment Is Neutral Market sentiment remains neutral, despite the presence of positive technical signals. The Weighed Sentiment is at the median level, which indicates that there is uncertainty regarding whether Neiro will continue to rise or encounter additional selling pressure. The coin’s substantial rally has resulted in a decrease in supply outside of exchanges, which suggests that some investors have taken profits. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? But for the successful traders, there is still a glimmer of hope. Using the Binance Top Trader Long/Short ratio, 58% of traders are still net long on Neiro and thus expect an extended ascent. Traders will be watching above resistance at $0.0027 and support at $0.0017 over the next days to see how the memecoin goes forward. Over the past month, Neiro has recorded 18 out of 30 green days, or 60%, with a notable price volatility of 26.66%. These factors suggest that now may be an opportune time for potential buyers. Looking Ahead: Is A Bigger Rally Possible? As Neiro’s volatility plays out, traders should track important support and resistance levels for now. The next significant movement for this high-flying memecoin might go either way since both technical indicators and market mood give conflicting signals.
