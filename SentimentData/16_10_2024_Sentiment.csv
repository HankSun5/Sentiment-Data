Bitcoin, for example, broke above $66,000 before cooling off earlier today. Like the world’s most valuable coin, Solana and its meme coins are trending higher. According to Coingecko, SOL trades above $150, adding nearly 7% in the previous trading week. Meme Coins Soaring But PELF Deployer Dumping The lift-off in Solana has seen some of its ecosystem tokens massively benefit. Among the many, Solana-based meme coins continue to rip higher. According to Coingecko, three Solana meme coins, including Popcat and DogWifHat, now command a market cap above $1 billion. Related Reading: SUI Records Substantial 120% Price Surge, But Insider Selling Claims Raise Red Flags While investors are closely tracking the performance of Popcat, the first cat-themed meme coin to break above the $1 billion level, some whales are fading the current bull run. One analyst, citing Nansen data, observes that the deployer of the PELF, a meme coin on Solana, is offloading. Initially, the deployer received 247 million PELF for 82 SOL worth $12,516. Later, the addresses received another 39.13 million PELF. According to on-chain data, the address has sold 3.2 million PELF for 662 SOL. Although analysts believe the deployer might have offloaded more tokens through other unknown addresses, the whale currently owns over $7.8 million worth of PELF at spot rates. Usually, any liquidation by a whale is considered bearish and might significantly influence price action. Retail traders, some interested in meme coins, often closely monitor the accounts of known whales, including deployers. If they choose to sell, moving tokens to a DEX, speculators will also look to sell before prices tank. Will Improving Crypto Sentiment Drive Demand? PELF remains in an uptrend, judging by the formation in the daily chart. The token is up nearly 300% from September lows. However, PELF is inside a broader range and down from its March 2024 highs. If buyers are to take charge, there must be a confirmation of October 14 gains. In that case, PELF could break above $0.0008101, bottoming out from Q3 2024 lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Road To $70,000? Analysts Set Next Targets As BTC Retests Key Levels Improving crypto sentiment could lift meme coins, driving them to new valuations. As of October 15, the total market cap of Solana meme coins exceeds $10.9 billion. Interestingly, they continue to grow in strength, looking at the number of Solana meme coins breaking into the top 10. According to Coingecko, Dogecoin is still the most valuable. However, DogWifHat, Bonk, and Popcat are now among the top 10, flipping Floki, Neiro on Ethereum and Brett.

Based on a crypto analyst’s prediction, Solana could be creating up for a major bull flag that could send its price to new all-time highs above $1,000. It’s important to note that Solana is currently trading at less than one-ninth of this projected price target of $1,400. SOL Bull Flag Points To $1,400 Price Increase A crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) identified as ‘Titan of Crypto,’ has shared a bullish forecast for Solana, predicting its rise to astronomical highs. The analyst predicted that Solana could see its price jump to $1,400 soon. Related Reading: Over $182 Million Wiped Out As Bitcoin Price Breaks $64,000 And Sends Bears To The Gallows In a comprehensive chart analysis of Solana’s price movements from 2023 till date, the analyst identified a well-defined bull flag pattern, which he described as “massive.” According to Titan of Crypto, the formation of this bull flag signals the potential for a major rally in the coming weeks and months. In the Solana price chart, the analyst traced the unique flag pattern, which began forming before October 2024. He extended the pattern into 2025, emphasizing that the flag would likely emerge around the end of 2024 or the beginning of the next year, before continuing its development through to October 2025. If SOL can successfully complete this pattern without experiencing significant price declines, the crypto analyst expects the top altcoin to reach new all-time highs at $1,429 by 2026. However, a more conservative price projection was given by another crypto analyst, who suggested that a $1,000 price surge based on the Heads and Shoulders technical indicator was a more realistic price target for Solana. Echoing this sentiment, Titan of Crypto disclosed that Solana’s Fibonacci extensions currency suggests a potential move towards the $1,400 price mark. While maintaining his bullish outlook for SOL, the analyst acknowledged that a $1,000 price target is also possible. He adjusted his previous forecast, stating that he expects Solana to see a price increase around the $1,000 range. Titan of Crypto has also confirmed that if Solana can pull off this projected price surge, its current market capitalization of $72.7 billion could potentially double, surpassing Ethereum’s market cap, which currently stands at $315 billion.
