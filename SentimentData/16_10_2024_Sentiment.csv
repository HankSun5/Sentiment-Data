Bitcoin, for example, broke above $66,000 before cooling off earlier today. Like the world’s most valuable coin, Solana and its meme coins are trending higher. According to Coingecko, SOL trades above $150, adding nearly 7% in the previous trading week. Meme Coins Soaring But PELF Deployer Dumping The lift-off in Solana has seen some of its ecosystem tokens massively benefit. Among the many, Solana-based meme coins continue to rip higher. According to Coingecko, three Solana meme coins, including Popcat and DogWifHat, now command a market cap above $1 billion. Related Reading: SUI Records Substantial 120% Price Surge, But Insider Selling Claims Raise Red Flags While investors are closely tracking the performance of Popcat, the first cat-themed meme coin to break above the $1 billion level, some whales are fading the current bull run. One analyst, citing Nansen data, observes that the deployer of the PELF, a meme coin on Solana, is offloading. Initially, the deployer received 247 million PELF for 82 SOL worth $12,516. Later, the addresses received another 39.13 million PELF. According to on-chain data, the address has sold 3.2 million PELF for 662 SOL. Although analysts believe the deployer might have offloaded more tokens through other unknown addresses, the whale currently owns over $7.8 million worth of PELF at spot rates. Usually, any liquidation by a whale is considered bearish and might significantly influence price action. Retail traders, some interested in meme coins, often closely monitor the accounts of known whales, including deployers. If they choose to sell, moving tokens to a DEX, speculators will also look to sell before prices tank. Will Improving Crypto Sentiment Drive Demand? PELF remains in an uptrend, judging by the formation in the daily chart. The token is up nearly 300% from September lows. However, PELF is inside a broader range and down from its March 2024 highs. If buyers are to take charge, there must be a confirmation of October 14 gains. In that case, PELF could break above $0.0008101, bottoming out from Q3 2024 lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Road To $70,000? Analysts Set Next Targets As BTC Retests Key Levels Improving crypto sentiment could lift meme coins, driving them to new valuations. As of October 15, the total market cap of Solana meme coins exceeds $10.9 billion. Interestingly, they continue to grow in strength, looking at the number of Solana meme coins breaking into the top 10. According to Coingecko, Dogecoin is still the most valuable. However, DogWifHat, Bonk, and Popcat are now among the top 10, flipping Floki, Neiro on Ethereum and Brett.

Based on a crypto analyst’s prediction, Solana could be creating up for a major bull flag that could send its price to new all-time highs above $1,000. It’s important to note that Solana is currently trading at less than one-ninth of this projected price target of $1,400. SOL Bull Flag Points To $1,400 Price Increase A crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) identified as ‘Titan of Crypto,’ has shared a bullish forecast for Solana, predicting its rise to astronomical highs. The analyst predicted that Solana could see its price jump to $1,400 soon. Related Reading: Over $182 Million Wiped Out As Bitcoin Price Breaks $64,000 And Sends Bears To The Gallows In a comprehensive chart analysis of Solana’s price movements from 2023 till date, the analyst identified a well-defined bull flag pattern, which he described as “massive.” According to Titan of Crypto, the formation of this bull flag signals the potential for a major rally in the coming weeks and months. In the Solana price chart, the analyst traced the unique flag pattern, which began forming before October 2024. He extended the pattern into 2025, emphasizing that the flag would likely emerge around the end of 2024 or the beginning of the next year, before continuing its development through to October 2025. If SOL can successfully complete this pattern without experiencing significant price declines, the crypto analyst expects the top altcoin to reach new all-time highs at $1,429 by 2026. However, a more conservative price projection was given by another crypto analyst, who suggested that a $1,000 price surge based on the Heads and Shoulders technical indicator was a more realistic price target for Solana. Echoing this sentiment, Titan of Crypto disclosed that Solana’s Fibonacci extensions currency suggests a potential move towards the $1,400 price mark. While maintaining his bullish outlook for SOL, the analyst acknowledged that a $1,000 price target is also possible. He adjusted his previous forecast, stating that he expects Solana to see a price increase around the $1,000 range. Titan of Crypto has also confirmed that if Solana can pull off this projected price surge, its current market capitalization of $72.7 billion could potentially double, surpassing Ethereum’s market cap, which currently stands at $315 billion.

Market sentiment is improving alongside price action, fueling hopes for a sustained rally. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? Key data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin demand is rising, supporting the idea that Bitcoin could continue to climb. This growing demand and the improving market sentiment create a favorable environment for bullish momentum. Continuing the recent price surge could set the stage for Bitcoin to reach new highs, while any hesitation might lead to further consolidation. Either way, market participants are eagerly awaiting the next major move. Bitcoin Open Interest Reaching New Highs After surging to test local highs, Bitcoin is at a critical turning point, setting the stage for a potential rally that has analysts and investors optimistic. The price has surged over 12% in less than a week, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment in the market. This upward momentum has sparked hopes of continued gains, with many speculating that Bitcoin is on the verge of a significant breakout. Top crypto analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently shared a compelling CryptoQuant chart, revealing that Bitcoin’s open interest across all exchanges has just hit a new all-time high of $19.75 billion. This spike in open interest often precedes large price moves, signaling heightened activity and more capital at stake in the market. A surge in open interest suggests that traders are positioning themselves for significant price action, potentially adding more fuel to the current rally. The data from CryptoQuant supports the growing bullish outlook for Bitcoin, as it suggests that investors and traders are increasingly confident in the asset’s near-term performance.

Bitcoin could be on track to test new highs if this momentum continues, paving the way for a broader market rally. As the market eyes this critical juncture, the next few days will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s trajectory. BTC Pushing Local Highs Bitcoin is trading at $65,600 after consolidating following yesterday’s surge to local highs. The price is eyeing the crucial $66,500 resistance level, which, if broken, could send BTC to new all-time highs. This resistance has been a key barrier for Bitcoin, and a successful push above it would confirm the bullish momentum and likely lead to further gains. BTC is now trading well above its 200-day moving average (MA) at $63,336, further solidifying the positive outlook for Bitcoin in the coming weeks. Holding above this MA is a strong indicator that the bulls are in control. The market is poised for a potential rally. However, for Bitcoin to continue its upward trajectory, it must break the $66,500 level and set a new high. On the downside, if BTC fails to surpass this resistance, a retrace to lower demand levels around $62,000 could occur, which would still be a healthy correction within the broader uptrend.

The memecoin’s extraordinary 48x return in a single month was a result of its precipitous rise from $0.000039 to $0.002. Neiro explodes in price in the last month. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Dogecoin Revival: Active Addresses Skyrocket To Highest Level In 8 Months Despite this dramatic rally, the coin has slowed down its momentum, losing 15% from its peak of $0.0022. Price forecast from CoinCodex still calls for further increases in the future for the cryptocurrency, foreseen to reach 219%, getting up to a price of $0.019284 by November 2024, as traders start wondering if this is only the beginning of a much more massive drop. In the short term, traders are concerned with whether Neiro’s retracement is temporary or if the memecoin has reached its maximum potential. However, this long-term forecast indicates the possibility of substantial upside. Retracement Strikes Critical Support Neiro’s recent drop in price coincided with a daily bullish order block, causing the price to fall to a critical support level—the 23% Fibonacci retracement area—at the time of publication. These levels are essential because they have the potential to provide the necessary support to prevent further declines. The bulls would proceed to the 37% Fib level as their subsequent line of defense if the retracement persists. Neiro’s stochastic RSI indicates an oversold condition, which suggests a potential rebound. Furthermore, the RSI continues to exceed the neutral 50 level, which serves to bolster the likelihood of a price reversal. If momentum returns, some analysts predict that Neiro could increase to $0.0027, which would be a 20% increase from its current value. Longs Predominate, But Sentiment Is Neutral Market sentiment remains neutral, despite the presence of positive technical signals. The Weighed Sentiment is at the median level, which indicates that there is uncertainty regarding whether Neiro will continue to rise or encounter additional selling pressure. The coin’s substantial rally has resulted in a decrease in supply outside of exchanges, which suggests that some investors have taken profits. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? But for the successful traders, there is still a glimmer of hope. Using the Binance Top Trader Long/Short ratio, 58% of traders are still net long on Neiro and thus expect an extended ascent. Traders will be watching above resistance at $0.0027 and support at $0.0017 over the next days to see how the memecoin goes forward. Over the past month, Neiro has recorded 18 out of 30 green days, or 60%, with a notable price volatility of 26.66%. These factors suggest that now may be an opportune time for potential buyers. Looking Ahead: Is A Bigger Rally Possible? As Neiro’s volatility plays out, traders should track important support and resistance levels for now. The next significant movement for this high-flying memecoin might go either way since both technical indicators and market mood give conflicting signals.

This, as the alpha coin breaches the $66,000 level at the time of writing. Active address count monitors the number of unique Bitcoin addresses that have been involved in a transaction during a given period. This metric is viewed as an essential indicator of the digital asset’s health and adoption. Related Reading: Dogecoin Revival: Active Addresses Skyrocket To Highest Level In 8 Months According to Santiment, the seven-day average of about 3.5 million active addresses indicates that the digital coin’s key yardstick remained strong, unmoved by the neutral sentiment recorded for the Bitcoin fear and greed barometer. This despite the price of Bitcoin undergoing all that volatility associated with crypto markets, the count of active addresses stood firm, showing that core users and participants continue actively using the cryptocurrency for their transactions and holdings. Still, Active Addresses Are Somewhat Below Yearly Average Active addresses have been relatively static over the last few days, and its 2024 monthly average hasn’t yet overcome the yearly average, so engagements are down. It was found by Glassnode to be in parallel with the slide seen mid-2018 during the Bitcoin price correction after its bull run of 2017. Although prices have rallied briefly, network activity has not returned in a manner consistent with past cycles. The decline in active addresses and the post-halving period of this year point to a declining need for blockspace by the network, which could be a sign of a wider slowdown in the number of Bitcoin users. A Positive Long-Term Outlook? Analysts pointed out that the consistent network activity would suggest that the long-term prognosis for the asset related to cryptocurrencies stays favorable. It also demonstrated how the basic usage and interaction with the Bitcoin network have not been impacted by the swings in the digital currency environment of speculative investments. Independent of the enthusiasm or fear that could drive temporary price changes, the persistence of the active address count indicates a fundamental robustness of Bitcoin’s infrastructure and the actual real-world benefit it offers.

At the time of writing, the fear and greed index was at 48, a sign of a market in equilibrium. It also signaled the shift to neutral courtesy of the increased anxiety and greed brought on by changing prices. Based on various criteria including volatility, volume, and social media trends, the Bitcoin fear and greed index suggests that following the recent strong market swings investors are adopting a wait-and-see strategy before jumping in and investing.

LTC could continue to rise if it clears the $72.80 resistance zone. Litecoin is showing positive signs from the $65 support zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $70 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $68.00 on the hourly chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The price is up over 10% and might continue to rise if it clears the $72.80 resistance zone. Litecoin Price Gains Bullish Momentum After forming a base above $65, Litecoin started a fresh increase. LTC price broke the $68 and $70 resistance levels to move into a positive zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price gained over 10% and even cleared the $72 level. A high was formed at $72.74 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $65.29 swing low to the $72.74 high. Litecoin is now trading above $70 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $68.00 on the hourly chart of the LTC/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $65.29 swing low to the $72.74 high. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $72.00 zone. The next major resistance is near the $72.80 level. If there is a clear break above the $72.80 resistance, the price could start another strong increase. In the stated case, the price is likely to continue higher toward the $75.50 and $78.00 levels. Any more gains might send LTC’s price toward the $80.00 resistance zone. Are Dips Supported in LTC? If Litecoin price fails to clear the $72 resistance level, there could be a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $71.00 level. The next major support is forming near the $69.00 level, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $67.50 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $65.00 support. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LTC/USD is above the 60 level. Major Support Levels – $71.00 followed by $67.50.

According to a report by CNBC, the project aims to establish a crypto bank and was expected to attract considerable investor interest. However, the token sale, which began on Tuesday, was marred by website outages and technical issues, severely limiting participation. Trump Crypto Venture Faces Setbacks Zachary Folkman, co-founder of WLF, had previously indicated that over 100,000 individuals were on the whitelist for the investment opportunity. Despite this promising start, the reality was starkly different. Related Reading: XRP Price Growth: Analyst Breaks Down The Movements And Why It’s So As of Tuesday afternoon, blockchain data from Etherscan revealed that only about 4,300 unique wallet addresses held the WLF token, amounting to roughly 4% of the registered investors. The platform reported selling more than 532 million tokens at a price of 15 cents each, which represents less than 3% of the total 20 billion tokens available for public sale. Throughout the day, users faced consistent disruptions, with the website often displaying a message stating, “We are under maintenance.” WLF has yet to provide an official comment regarding these technical difficulties. These setbacks come at a crucial time for Trump, who is the Republican presidential nominee and has heavily promoted the project since August under the branding “The DeFiant Ones,” a nod to decentralized finance (DeFi). The project’s roadmap indicates an ambitious goal of raising up to $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation during the initial sale. Investors To Receive Voting Rights On WLF Platform Folkman, who has a varied entrepreneurial background, including a previously owned company, Date Hotter Girls, has stated that 20% of WLF’s tokens are allocated to the founding team, which includes members of the Trump family. The WLF token, WLFI, is structured as a Regulation D offering, allowing it to raise capital without registering as a security with the SEC, provided it meets certain conditions, such as limiting the sale size and restricting participation to accredited investors. So far, details about the project’s functionalities remain sparse. Related Reading: Worldcoin Gains Upside Momentum: Is A Major Breakout Ahead? Individuals associated with the Trump family project have suggested that the platform will facilitate borrowing, lending, and investing in cryptocurrencies. However, a formal white paper or comprehensive business plan has not been made public, and the primary disclosure has been that investors will receive voting rights on the forthcoming WLF platform. In a step toward legitimacy, WLF has also initiated the process of obtaining approval from Aave, a DeFi ecosystem and lending platform known for its open-source framework and reputation in the crypto community.

CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, attributed the rise in crypto investment products last week to political factors, particularly the upcoming U.S. elections, rather than monetary policy shifts. “This trend is evident in the fact",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-10-16 09:22:00

Ethereum Open Interest Has Now Risen To $9.7 Billion As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Ethereum Open Interest has seen a strong rise recently. The “Open Interest” is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of ETH-related positions currently open on all derivatives platforms. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up new positions on the market right now. As new positions generally come with leverage attached to them, the overall leverage in the market rises when the Open Interest does. So, the asset’s price can become more likely to show volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Push To $6,000 If This Pattern Holds, Analyst Says On the other hand, the indicator registering a decline implies the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platforms. Either way, the reduced leverage can lead to more stability for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Open Interest over the past month: As the above graph shows, the Ethereum Open Interest has seen a spike recently as the cryptocurrency’s price has shown its recovery run. This isn’t particularly unusual, as rallies tend to attract a lot of attention and, with such interest, naturally follow a ton of speculation. However, the scale of the increase could be something to watch out for. From the chart, it’s apparent that this latest Open Interest increase has outweighed the September spike. A zoomed-out version of the chart shows that the last time the metric saw a larger 24-hour rise was back in May. As mentioned earlier, an Open Interest increase can lead to more volatility in the price. This is because a mass liquidation event, popularly known as a squeeze, can become more likely to occur if the market is more leveraged. In theory, this volatility can take Ethereum in either direction. However, the quant has pointed out that the funding rates are currently high, which suggests the sector is leaning towards being long-heavy. Thus, most of the new positions that have popped up on exchanges are likely long. Related Reading: Solana Extends Rally By 4%, But This Factor Could Lead To A Top Historically, conditions like these have created a ripe environment for a long squeeze. It remains to be seen how the coin develops in the coming future and whether a sharp correction in its price will occur alongside large long liquidations. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,600, up more than 8% over the past week.

Some market watchers suggested the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a breakout, setting new targets for the short and mid-term timeframes. Related Reading: Crypto Prices Go Up: A ‘Cautious Bullish’ Outlook Amid Fed Worries And Market Volatility Polkadot Breaks Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern Polkadot has registered a 10.9% increase in the last week following the market’s performance. DOT jumped from the $4.32 support zone to the $4.53 mark before retracing, registering a 4.8% daily surge in the early hours of Tuesday. The cryptocurrency also saw a 56% rise in market activity, recording a $259.3 million daily trading volume. This increase has made DOT retest the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern. Market analyst CryptoBull360 stated that Polkadot is “getting ready for a massive breakout” from the bullish pattern after a long consolidation period. DOT has been moving within the falling wedge for the past seven months, consolidating between $4-$4.8 since August’s Black Monday. The analyst noted that the token had a strong bounce from the Point of Control (PoC) value zone, surging 11% in the last three days. Today’s jump saw the token break above the pattern’s upper trendline, momentarily sitting above it. CryptoBull360 expects a retest of March highs if the token successfully breaks out of the falling wedge. To him, a 160% surge for the midterm is imminent, which would target the $11.46 yearly high. Is DOT Preparing To Reclaim $20? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Polkadot could “be following Fantom’s footsteps.” Per the post, DOT’s chart looks similar to Fantom’s before its March performance. Ahead of the Q1 rally, FTM rose two times to the upper range of its accumulation zone and retraced before its 263% bullish run toward its yearly high. If Polkadot were to follow, and its current pattern holds, DOT’s price could rise to $9.7 in Q4. Following the surge, the cryptocurrency would face a pullback to the $6.5-$6.7 support zone before skyrocketing to $20 by Q1 2025, a level not seen since April 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Road To $70,000? Analysts Set Next Targets As BTC Retests Key Levels Despite the bullish forecasts, some investors remain cautious about Polkadot. A crypto trader noted that DOT followed Bitcoin’s lead like most of the market. The cryptocurrency surged to its daily high of $4.53 as BTC retested the $67,000 resistance level. However, DOT quickly fell to Monday’s levels as BTC was rejected from its resistance zone. The trader questioned DOT’s 24-hour trend, stating, “BTC stops pumping, DOT rises a few percent, while most things don’t rise, as soon as it gets going, the entire market falls and DOT immediately loses everything it had previously gained.” As of this writing, DOT is trading at $4.42, a 2.2% increase in the daily timeframe.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Price Has Proven To Be Reliable Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Community Manager Maartunn has discussed about an indicator that’s suited for doing day-to-day BTC trading. The metric in question is the Realized Price of the short-term holders. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor or address on the Bitcoin network. When the spot price of the coin is greater than this metric, the holders as a whole are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, it being under the indicator suggests the dominance of loss in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Push To $6,000 If This Pattern Holds, Analyst Says In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs are made up of the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. This cohort corresponds to one of the two main divisions of the Bitcoin market done on the basis of holding time, with the other group being known as the long-term holders (LTHs). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH Realized Price over the past month: In the above graph, Maartunn has highlighted all the instances where the Bitcoin price made a retest of the STH Realized Price during this window. It would appear that the line has acted as both support and resistance for the asset. The cryptocurrency finding a break above the line has turned it into support, while it falling under has led to the level changing into resistance. This is actually a pattern that the STH Realized Price has displayed throughout history, not just the past month. As for why the indicator shows such interactions with the coin’s price, the answer may lie in investor psychology. The STHs tend to include the most fickle-minded investors in the market and they are particularly sensitive to retests of their cost basis. When Bitcoin retests their Realized Price from above, they may decide to buy more of the asset, as they could believe that the same level would prove to be profitable again in the future. This accumulation provides support to the BTC price. Related Reading: Solana Extends Rally By 4%, But This Factor Could Lead To A Top Similarly, the STHs can sell as a reaction to a retest from below, as they may fear that they would go into losses once more in the near term, so exiting at the break-even would at least give them their money back. While the Bitcoin STH Realized Price does tend to carry some reliability, it can also show some deviations. As the analyst has marked in the chart, one such outlier instance occurred just earlier in the month. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $65,700, up more than 5% over the last seven days.

This prospective increase is supported by recent price movements and significant technical indicators. Related Reading: Neiro Coin Blows Up 4,608%—Can It Sustain The Momentum? Shiba Inu has experienced a consistent increase, presently trading at $0.00001805 following a brief decline to the $0.000016 area last week. Although its gains have been less substantial than those of other meme tokens, observers believe SHIB is poised for a significant rebound imminently. TradingView expert Without Worries has recommended that this is an opportune moment to initiate a long position in Shiba Inu. Despite a 70% decline in the token since March, numerous positive indicators have surfaced, such as RSI breakouts and trend reversals. Shiba Inu Price: How Big Is The Projected Increase? Shiba Inu might rise 400% to $0.000074, according to the researcher. SHIB made a fourfold increase to $0.000045 early this year, which matches this estimate. Notwithstanding the optimism, the analyst saw the potential for additional corrections regarding Shiba Inu. Investors must remain cognizant of possible obstacles ahead. Resistance Levels Shiba Inu is currently facing resistance at $0.00001865. It has already broken through this level to reach an intraday high of $0.00001893. The next levels of resistance are $0.00001969 and $0.00002094. The present technical analysis for SHIB forecasts a price escalation of 0.74%, aiming for $0.00001802 by November 14, 2024. Strong market mood supports this forecast, as shown by the Fear & Greed Index, which sits at 65 and denotes investor greed. Related Reading: Dogecoin Revival: Active Addresses Skyrocket To Highest Level In 8 Months Time To Buy The Meme Coin? In the preceding month, Shiba Inu experienced 15 green days out of 30, resulting in a 50% positive performance rate, and shown a price volatility of 12.02%. These facts indicate that the present may be a favorable opportunity for investors to contemplate acquiring SHIB. The optimistic sentiment and substantial anticipated expansion underscore robust market interest in the meme coin from a technical standpoint. The Fear & Greed Index residing in the greed zone may suggest possibilities for price appreciation, although it also warrants caution for probable corrections. It is crucial for traders to monitor important support levels at $0.000018 and resistance levels at $0.000019 while navigating this volatile market environment. Shiba Inu is a promising investment due to its performance and expectations.

MicroStrategy, the original proxy for Bitcoin, has shown an outperformance to physical Bitcoin. The stock maybe serving as a leading indicator for the crypto's next big move. A Trump victory could be the push Bitcoin needs for the longed-for run to above $100,000. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been trapped in a slightly bearish sideways trend for a long time now. Here is the long-term chart. ADVFN This sideways action has been frustrating for Bitcoin believers because the move to around the $60,000 level, which was meant to be the stepping stone to $100,000+, has stalled. Instead, we are at an equilibrium point and the price is thrashing around in a range. Here is a chart of that. ADVFN It looks good and it seems possible that Bitcoin can break out now and head on its longed-for run to above $100,000. It just needs one more heave and that might come from a Trump victory. Trump has made lots of super positive crypto noises – and has even launched his own cryptocurrency project and token, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Meanwhile, the Democrats have u-turned and started purring about digital currency, but it’s probably too little too late. As such, a Republican win for the presidency can do nothing but good for Bitcoin. The strange thing is, what Bitcoin holders are looking for is a chart that looks like this. ADVFN This is MicroStrategy (MSTR), the stock that’s a huge bag of crypto and has been a proxy for Bitcoin and took the role of Bitcoin ETF until there were actual Bitcoin ETFs. So, what is going on here? The official explanation is that MicroStrategy will be the Bitcoin Bank. OK, that sounds cool. However, it’s not exactly comforting when you look at what happened to Silvergate and others at the hands of the regulators, and that tendency is almost certain to continue under another Democrat presidency. Maybe the narrative of being a Bitcoin Bank is enough to decouple the company from the Bitcoin price trend, but what if that isn’t what is going on here? US investors do love a story of trillions and zillions, so maybe MicroStrategy’s ‘Bitcoin Bank’ story is sufficient, but to me, that explanation is not enough. What I am left wondering is this: If I was almost sure I knew Bitcoin was going up, what would I buy, especially if I didn’t want to push the price of Bitcoin just yet? The answer is, I would buy MicroStrategy. You can come up with plenty of scenarios, but the key takeaway is, will Bitcoin follow MicroStrategy, rather than the other way around? Is MicroStrategy driving Bitcoin now rather than vice versa? Here is the chart of BTC and MicroStrategy. ADVFN Clearly, MicroStrategy has more ‘pop’ than Bitcoin, so perhaps MicroStrategy’s stock feels the rally coming before the Bitcoin market does. It is an intriguing thought. Like any potential signal, it can be used in many ways. For me, it will simply be another reference point if Bitcoin breaks into new ATHs and will help me time a top, which will likely be wild if it goes on such a run. It also gives me pause to wonder, is the current run-up to the trend ceiling going to turn into the defining breakout? Is this move predicting a Trump win? One thing is for sure, this is a moment that traders should be watching Bitcoin closely because if MicroStrategy is a leading indicator then Bitcoin is about to breakout and breakout big.",BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-16 17:45:15

This comes amid BTC’s impressive price rebound, which has brought renewed optimism that the next leg of the bull run is almost here. Bitcoin Price Could Rise To $86,600 If It Breaks This Level Martinez mentioned in an X post that the Bitcoin price could rise to around $86,600 if it can break past $67,400. He indicated that this price target could mark the next potential local top for the flagship crypto. Bitcoin rose past $67,400 and climbed to almost $68,000 on October 15, its highest level since July. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Flashes Historical Bull Flag, Here’s What Happened Last Time Although the Bitcoin price has retraced, there is the belief that it could again retest the $67,400 price target and successfully break above. This could ultimately pave the way for BTC to reach a new ATH and climb to $86,600, as Ali Martinez predicts. Bitcoin currently boasts a bullish outlook from a technical and fundamentals analysis standpoint. The Bitcoin price’s recent rally led to a break above its 200-day moving average (MA), which was around $65,844. Martinez noted earlier that a break above this moving average has always led to parabolic bull runs. Therefore, a break above this 200-day MA indicates that the flagship crypto is well primed for a massive move to the upside. The crypto analyst also recently revealed that Bitcoin’s open interest across all exchanges just hit a new ATH of $19.75 billion. He mentioned that a spike in this metric often signals big price moves ahead, with more capital on the line. Indeed, Bitcoin investors look to be allocating more capital to the flagship crypto as Martinez revealed that over 400,000 BTC ($24 billion) had been withdrawn from exchanges in the past eight months. Cryptoquant’s CEO Ki Young Ju also suggested that there has been an increased demand for the flagship crypto while stating that Bitcoin’s apparent demand is back. This metric guages the difference BTC mined and the supply that has been inactive for a while. When The Rise To $86,000 Could Happen Martinez didn’t provide a timeline for when the rise to $86,000 could happen. However, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has provided insights into when the Bitcoin price could enjoy this parabolic rally. The analyst stated in an X post that the wave 5 expansion is set to begin anytime soon. Related Reading: XRP Price Growth: Analyst Breaks Down The Movements And Why It’s So He added that the 22nd of this month of this month is probably when the “real fun” will start. His accompanying chart showed that wave 5 expansion could send the Bitcoin price to around $90,000, even higher than Martinez predicts. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,000, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
