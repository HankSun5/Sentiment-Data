This is a new benchmark in the market and is getting the attention of investors including those from Dogecoin’s (DOGE) highly active community. With innovative technology and exponential growth potential Ruvi AI is a token to watch in 2025. Dogecoin’s Unique Charm and Flaws Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke but has since become a serious player in the crypto world. Backed by a passionate community and fueled by internet meme culture Dogecoin has become a symbol of community driven investment. Its appeal is in its simplicity and the camaraderie it brings to its supporters. Dogecoin has strengths like strong community backing and wide recognition but its limitations as a speculative and meme based asset are evident. Critically Dogecoin lacks the robust utility and industry disruption potential that newer tokens like Ruvi AI bring to the table. This gap has led some DOGE investors to look for advanced utility driven tokens to add to their portfolio. Ruvi AI’s Innovation Ruvi AI is revolutionizing blockchain by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) into its ecosystem. Designed for real world applications Ruvi AI powers tools that generate text, images, videos and audio making it a standout in industries like marketing, content creation and video production. Unlike Dogecoin’s entertainment driven appeal Ruvi AI is focused on creating real value through its technology. The $RUVI token is the backbone of the ecosystem providing holders with staking rewards, governance rights and access to premium features. By addressing real world pain points Ruvi AI is moving beyond the meme narrative and carving its own path as a high impact player in the blockchain space. Presale Success Ruvi AI’s presale is going great, the first phase priced at $0.010 per token sold out in 2 weeks and delivered 50% returns to early investors when phase 2 launched at $0.015.Ruvi AI has sold over 135 million tokens with over 1,400 holders in the community. The project just reached a major milestone by getting listed on an exchange before the presale even ends – a testament to its strong leadership and execution. More partnerships and listings are coming soon and the investors are getting excited and Ruvi AI is solidifying its position as a game changing crypto project. Dogecoin vs Ruvi AI The comparison between Dogecoin and Ruvi AI is two different investment propositions. Dogecoin is speculative growth and community, thriving on its meme driven popularity and endorsement culture. But without a clear utility framework its long term growth potential is limited to cyclical market trends. Ruvi AI is innovation at the intersection of blockchain and AI technology. Its real world applications and expanding ecosystem is a big opportunity for investors looking to back projects with disruption potential. With the presale gaining momentum Ruvi AI is positioning itself for exponential growth far beyond what Dogecoin has achieved. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI’s tiered presale structure is very attractive for early adopters. Here’s a breakdown of the returns based on the listing price of $0.07 and a predicted post listing price of $1 per token: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 $RUVI ($750 investment) Bonus : 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 investment) Bonus : 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 investment) Bonus : 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $1,000,000 These scenarios show the great opportunities in Ruvi AI’s presale tiers, affordability and growth.

At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $104,851, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours and roughly 6.3% below its recent peak. This period of relative price stability comes amid cautious sentiment across the broader crypto market, as analysts examine whether the current bull cycle is beginning to shift gears or simply experiencing a temporary pause. CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan has released a comparative analysis of current and past market cycles, noting several distinct behaviors in Bitcoin’s recent price action. Drawing parallels to the bull runs of 2017 and 2021, Dan suggests that while similarities exist, the current cycle has developed unique characteristics. These changes could signal a different structure in how the market plays out, particularly in terms of timing and investor participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Comparing Bitcoin Cycles: 2024–2025 Diverges from Historical Patterns According to Dan, previous cycles saw more predictable corrections and rallies. In 2017, Bitcoin experienced relatively short corrections before entering a prolonged rally that concluded in late December of that year. The 2021 cycle, affected early on by the COVID-19 pandemic, featured a longer initial correction before a strong upward surge. In both cases, once Bitcoin gained momentum, corrections became less frequent and shorter in duration. The current cycle, spanning 2024–2025, has so far been marked by alternating strong rallies and sudden declines, often occurring over short timeframes. These patterns have dampened broader market sentiment, particularly during periods when altcoins significantly underperformed Bitcoin. Dan posits that these repeated pullbacks may not be purely organic. Instead, they could indicate intentional suppression by large players aiming to extend the cycle’s duration and prevent overheating. If this interpretation holds, the bull cycle could end not with a gradual fade, but a sharp spike driven by euphoric buying behavior. Retail Activity Declines as Institutions Drive Market Structure A separate analysis by CryptoQuant’s Burak Kesmeci focuses on the behavior of retail investors since Bitcoin hit its $111,000 high in late May. Data shows that retail transfer volumes, transactions valued between $0 and $10,000, have decreased from $423 million to $408 million. Additionally, the 30-day change in retail demand has slipped into negative territory, shifting from +5 points to -0.11 points. This reduction in retail activity suggests that smaller investors remain sensitive to short-term volatility, stepping back in response to recent price corrections. Related Reading: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History’s Turning Kesmeci argues that for the bull cycle to sustain momentum, consistent participation from retail segments is crucial. At present, institutional interest appears to be the primary source of demand. The divergence between these two investor classes may shape how the next leg of Bitcoin’s market cycle develops.

In a significant move signaling this trend, Zebec Network (ZBCN) has announced its acquisition of Gatenox, a specialized compliance and identity platform. This strategic integration is set to profoundly impact Zebec’s ability to navigate the complex landscape of global financial regulations and expand its reach into highly regulated markets. Why Zebec Needs Enhanced Crypto Compliance At its core, Zebec Network aims to revolutionize how value is transferred in real-time, particularly through its innovative programmable money and payment streams. However, as these financial technologies become more mainstream and interact with traditional finance systems, the necessity for stringent Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Business (KYB), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures becomes paramount. Without these measures, platforms face significant risks: Regulatory penalties and fines Reputational damage Exclusion from partnerships with traditional financial institutions Difficulty in attracting institutional users The acquisition of Gatenox directly addresses these challenges by bringing proven compliance technology in-house. This isn’t just about meeting minimum requirements; it’s about building a foundation of trust and security that is essential for scaling Web3 payment solutions globally. Integrating Gatenox : A Deep Dive into the Benefits The integration of Gatenox’s platform into Zebec’s existing infrastructure is expected to yield multiple benefits, significantly strengthening Zebec’s position in the market: Seamless Compliance Integration: Gatenox specializes in streamlined KYC/KYB processes, making it easier for users and businesses to onboard while adhering to regulatory standards. Integrating this technology directly into the Zebec payment stack means compliance checks can become a more seamless part of the user experience, rather than a cumbersome hurdle. Enhanced Risk Management: With advanced AML tools from Gatenox, Zebec can bolster its ability to detect and prevent illicit activities on its network. This includes transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, and risk scoring, all crucial for maintaining a clean and trustworthy ecosystem. Preparation for Regulatory Registration: A primary driver for this acquisition is Zebec’s ambition to pursue regulatory registration under key frameworks like the EU’s MiCA Regulation and the UK’s FCA Regulation . Having robust, integrated compliance systems is a fundamental prerequisite for obtaining such licenses. The Gatenox acquisition provides Zebec with the necessary technological backbone to demonstrate compliance capabilities to regulators. Expansion into Regulated Markets: Successfully navigating regulations like MiCA and those enforced by the FCA opens the door to operate legally and confidently within major economic blocs like the European Union and the United Kingdom. These markets represent significant opportunities for growth but demand strict adherence to financial regulations. The Gatenox acquisition is a direct investment in accessing these opportunities. What is MiCA Regulation and Why Does it Matter? The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is a landmark legislative package in the European Union designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets and related activities. It aims to provide legal certainty, support innovation, and protect consumers and investors. For a platform like Zebec, compliance with MiCA is crucial for operating within EU member states. Key aspects of MiCA include: Rules for the issuance and admission to trading of crypto-assets. Requirements for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) regarding authorization, governance, and consumer protection. Provisions on market abuse. Meeting MiCA’s requirements demands sophisticated compliance systems, exactly what the Gatenox acquisition is intended to provide for Zebec . Navigating the UK Landscape with FCA Regulation Similarly, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the regulatory body overseeing financial services in the United Kingdom. While the UK is no longer part of the EU, it is developing its own comprehensive framework for crypto-assets, often aligning with international standards and principles similar to MiCA. Obtaining registration or authorization from the FCA is essential for crypto businesses wishing to serve the UK market legally. The FCA focuses heavily on: Preventing financial crime (AML/CTF). Protecting consumers. Ensuring market integrity. Zebec’s pursuit of FCA registration underscores its commitment to operating within established financial regulations, a goal significantly bolstered by the integration of Gatenox’s compliance expertise. Challenges and Considerations While the acquisition presents clear strategic advantages, integrating two distinct technology platforms and organizational cultures can present challenges. Ensuring a smooth technical merger of systems, maintaining data integrity, and aligning operational procedures will be key to realizing the full potential of the Gatenox acquisition. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, requiring continuous adaptation and updates to compliance protocols. Actionable Insights for the Industry Zebec’s move highlights a growing trend in the Web3 and crypto space: the increasing importance of proactive compliance. For other projects and companies in the sector, this acquisition serves as a strong signal: Compliance is not optional: As Web3 technologies mature, integrating robust KYC, KYB, and AML is becoming a necessity, not a luxury. Strategic acquisitions can accelerate compliance: For projects lacking in-house compliance expertise, acquiring specialized firms like Gatenox can be a faster path to regulatory readiness than building from scratch. Focus on regulated markets requires investment: Entering jurisdictions with clear regulatory frameworks (like the EU and UK) demands significant investment in compliance infrastructure and processes. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Regulatory Clarity The acquisition of Gatenox by Zebec Network is a decisive step towards strengthening its crypto compliance capabilities and positioning itself for expansion into regulated markets under frameworks like MiCA Regulation and FCA Regulation . By integrating advanced KYC, KYB, and AML tools, Zebec is not only mitigating risks but also building a foundation of trust essential for the future of Web3 payments. This move underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto industry and its commitment to operating within global financial standards, promising a more secure and accessible future for programmable money.

Botanix Labs , a project focused on bringing more functionality to the Bitcoin network, has just announced a significant strategic move ahead of its anticipated mainnet launch. This development is set to impact how the protocol operates and its path toward greater decentralization, a key goal for any blockchain project. What is Botanix Labs and Why Does a Federated Model Matter? At its core, Botanix Labs is building a Bitcoin layer-2 network. Think of it as an overlay on top of Bitcoin that aims to overcome some of Bitcoin’s inherent limitations, particularly when it comes to running complex applications. Their unique approach utilizes a technology called Spiderchain , which is designed to enable compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means developers could potentially deploy applications and smart contracts similar to those found on Ethereum, but secured by the underlying power of Bitcoin. The shift to a Federated model is a crucial step in this journey. Previously, Botanix Labs might have held more centralized control over the network’s operations. A federated model, in this context, means handing over operational control and validation responsibilities to a group of independent, trusted entities. This moves the network away from being solely controlled by the founding team and distributes power among multiple participants. Leading Operators Join the Federated Model A major highlight of this transition is the caliber of the initial participants in the Federated model . Botanix Labs has brought on board 16 independent node operators. These aren’t just random individuals; they include established names in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. According to reports, prominent entities like AntPool, Fireblocks, and Galaxy are among this initial group. The involvement of such recognized players lends credibility and operational expertise to the network. Adding these independent operators removes Botanix Labs itself from direct operational control over the network’s consensus or validation processes. This is a vital step towards decentralization, making the network less susceptible to single points of failure or control by one entity. As they prepare for the upcoming mainnet launch , having a diverse group of operators already participating in the Federated model is a strong signal of their commitment to building a robust and distributed network from the outset. Spiderchain and Enabling EVM Smart Contracts on Bitcoin The underlying technology making all of this possible is the Spiderchain . This innovative architecture is what allows Botanix Labs to bridge the gap between Bitcoin’s security and the flexibility of EVM smart contracts . By enabling EVM smart contracts on Bitcoin, Botanix Labs aims to unlock a vast array of potential use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to NFTs and more, all while inheriting Bitcoin’s unparalleled security guarantees. The Federated model plays a direct role here too. These independent node operators are crucial for the operation and security of the Spiderchain . They will be responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the state of the layer-2 network, ensuring that the EVM smart contracts function correctly and securely, anchored by the Bitcoin base layer. Why This Matters for the Mainnet Launch The transition to a Federated model is more than just a technical tweak; it’s a foundational step necessary before the mainnet launch later this quarter. Launching a decentralized network requires distributed control from day one. By establishing this group of 16 independent operators now, Botanix Labs is setting the stage for a more resilient and decentralized network when it goes live for public use. The goal is not to stop at 16 operators. Botanix Labs has stated plans to expand to hundreds of globally distributed validators over time. This gradual expansion of the Federated model is key to ensuring long-term decentralization and network resilience against various threats. Benefits of the Federated Model Shift: Enhanced Decentralization: Reduces reliance on the core Botanix Labs team for network operations. Increased Resilience: Distributes control across multiple independent entities, making the network more robust. Preparation for Scale: Establishes a framework for onboarding a larger number of validators for the mainnet. Credibility: Involvement of recognized industry players adds trust and confidence in the network’s operational integrity. Alignment with Bitcoin Ethos: Moves towards a more distributed control structure, aligning with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin itself. What’s Next for Botanix Labs? With the Federated model now in place and initial operators onboarded, the focus is clearly on the impending mainnet launch . This shift is a critical milestone, demonstrating progress towards a decentralized operational structure required for a public network. The success of the Bitcoin layer-2 , its ability to support EVM smart contracts via the Spiderchain , and its overall adoption will heavily depend on the robustness and decentralization achieved through this Federated model and the subsequent expansion of its validator set. Summary Botanix Labs has taken a significant step by transitioning to a Federated model and onboarding 16 independent node operators, including industry heavyweights. This move removes the core team from operational control, bolstering decentralization and network resilience. Utilizing the Spiderchain to enable EVM smart contracts on Bitcoin, this strategic shift is crucial preparation for their highly anticipated mainnet launch later this quarter. It signals a strong commitment to building a decentralized and robust Bitcoin layer-2 solution.

While the report attributes much of this to an 11% drop in BTC’s price, it also reflects active selling pressure by professional money managers. Bitcoin exposure in Q1 2025. Source: CoinShares Notably, financial advisors were one of the few groups that slightly increased their exposure, signaling some resilience within certain investor classes. However, the larger institutional trend suggests a pivot away from short-term speculation and toward long-term treasury-style holdings, particularly among corporates. Adding to the downside pressure, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded a staggering $430 million in outflows on May 30, the largest single-day exit since inception. This ended a 31-day streak of inflows, stoking fears of continued selling. Musk vs Trump Fallout Sparks Panic Selling Sentiment soured further as a very public feud between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk roiled risk assets. The disagreement, which centered around a disputed Congressional spending bill, escalated after Musk called for Trump’s resignation and threatened to push for impeachment. Trump, in turn, defended the bill as a historic tax-cutting measure. The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year https://t.co/rbBC11iynE — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 This clash rattled investor confidence, especially given prior rumors about Musk potentially joining Trump’s 2025 tech policy team.

Can Bitcoin Recover Amid Macro Headwinds? Despite the panic, some analysts believe this dip may open up long-term buying opportunities, especially if Bitcoin follows gold’s historical pattern of rallying during recessions. With Musk warning that Trump’s tariffs could spark a U.S. recession in H2 2025, safe-haven assets may come back into favor.

However, growing corporate use of BTC as a treasury asset may provide a long-term support base even amid institutional ETF outflows. BTC Bull Token Presale Nears $7.91M Cap as 61% APY Staking Draws Yield Hunters With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $6,858,262 out of its $7,911,528 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00255 is expected to rise once the cap is met. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

Aptos (APT) just recorded a 5% price jump after its CEO, Avery Ching, was officially invited to testify before the U.S. Congress. This rare move places Aptos at the center of discussions shaping the legal future of blockchain innovation. Meanwhile, Maker (MKR) pushed through resistance levels that technical analysts believed would hold it back, rising above $1,800 and signaling a potential move to $2,400. These aren’t just random movements—they reflect a broader trend of market confidence in projects with clear value propositions and solid leadership. As this activity continues to build market momentum, one name is steadily gaining recognition among informed participants: Qubetics ($TICS), a presale-stage contender that’s solving a completely different piece of the puzzle—real-world internet security and blockchain interoperability. Qubetics presents itself not merely as another digital token but as a complete infrastructure solution with a core emphasis on application-layer innovations. At its heart is a decentralized VPN that tackles what centralized service providers failed to resolve—digital privacy and censorship resistance. As Aptos enters legislative conversations and Maker breaks bearish flags with confidence, Qubetics emerges with something just as compelling: an active crypto presale backed by quantifiable application value. From a utility standpoint, each of these coins represents a different slice of where blockchain is headed. Aptos is building influence on Capitol Hill. Maker is rewriting market expectations. Qubetics is delivering a tool many internet users have needed for years. In this competitive and trend-driven climate, only one may ultimately be remembered as the next big crypto. Qubetics’ dVPN: Internet Privacy That Finally Works At a time when online surveillance and censorship are no longer theoretical concerns but daily realities for millions, Qubetics has introduced a decentralized VPN (dVPN) as part of its ecosystem. This feature operates on a fully peer-to-peer model, eliminating centralized oversight and control. Unlike traditional VPN services that can be subpoenaed, censored, or shut down, the Qubetics dVPN runs across blockchain infrastructure to ensure no single authority can track, throttle, or log users’ data. This isn’t just relevant for crypto-native users; it holds weight for journalists, NGOs, researchers, and privacy-conscious citizens across the globe—particularly in countries where digital restrictions continue to tighten. The implementation of blockchain-enabled routing and encryption doesn’t just benefit individuals. Businesses with cross-border communication needs stand to benefit significantly from Qubetics’ offering. Consider a financial advisory firm handling sensitive client data, or a pharmaceutical research team working with proprietary information. The decentralized architecture Qubetics has built makes their data both more secure and more agile. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator uniting leading blockchains, Qubetics is uniquely positioned to support scalable applications without compromising the foundational principles of decentralization and freedom. This emphasis on real utility and cross-platform compatibility is what places Qubetics in the ongoing discussion around the next big crypto. Qubetics Presale in Final Phase: Why Analysts Are Watching It as the Next Big Crypto Ahead of Listing Qubetics has officially entered the last phase of its public presale, Stage 37, with a fixed token price of $0.3370. So far, over $17.7 million has been raised, more than 515 million tokens have been distributed, and the project now counts over 27,500 holders. With only 10 million tokens remaining before it moves to exchange listing at $0.40, this stage marks a clear transition point for the project. These strong presale metrics, along with confirmed pricing and growing demand, have led many to identify Qubetics as the next big crypto to watch heading into the second half of 2025. Supporting this momentum is a recent tokenomics revision aimed at long-term sustainability. The total token supply has been reduced significantly—from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion—tightening future supply and improving value support. In parallel, the protocol has increased its public allocation to 38.55%, shifting a larger share of the supply into community hands. This structural change is designed to strengthen decentralization while allowing for more active governance participation by token holders. From a capital planning perspective, a $2,000 allocation at the current presale rate secures approximately 5,937 $TICS tokens. At the confirmed listing price of $0.40, this investment adjusts in value to $2,400. Longer-term projections remain speculative but indicate that if $TICS reaches $5, the same stake could be valued at $29,685. If it rises to $10, that grows to $59,370. With fixed pricing, limited token availability, and a refined roadmap, Qubetics continues to stand out as a serious contender for the next big crypto status among new-generation blockchain projects. Aptos Rallies as Congressional Testimony Sparks 5% Price Boost Aptos made headlines this week with a notable 5% rise in its token price after its co-founder and CEO Avery Ching received an invitation to testify in front of the United States Congress. This opportunity places Aptos in a strategic position to influence key regulatory frameworks for digital assets. The hearing, titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets,” centers around crafting legislation that accommodates Web3 technologies while protecting public interest. Aptos’ involvement not only validates its technical foundation but also strengthens its role in institutional dialogues that could shape the market’s future. This engagement has sparked strong market interest, pushing Aptos to $4.96. The invitation also suggests growing recognition from U.S. lawmakers who are increasingly looking toward tech-native platforms to guide future digital frameworks. While most tokens respond to short-term market sentiment, Aptos is actively engaging in long-term shaping of policy—making its latest price movement more than just a reaction. It reflects credibility, influence, and growing maturity in the sector. Maker Defies Technical Patterns to Eye a $2,400 Target Maker (MKR) has defied bearish expectations by breaking out of a downward pattern and rallying beyond the $1,800 mark. Previously stuck near a bear flag formation with a ceiling at $1,603, the token has not only broken through this ceiling but has also exceeded its realized price of $1,609 for the first time since May 7. Analysts now project MKR could surge as high as $2,400 in the near term. These moves are backed by a favorable Money Flow Index and Bull-Bear Power indicators, both of which suggest continued buying pressure. What stands out most in Maker’s recent activity is its resilience. Despite broader market caution, MKR’s upward movement reflects sustained participant confidence in its long-term value. As it transitions branding efforts toward becoming Sky, Maker is not only changing perception but also fortifying its infrastructure. This combination of technical performance and forward-facing developments is drawing considerable attention from crypto market watchers seeking signals of breakout momentum. The Final Word: Which One Has the Strongest Path Ahead? As June 2025 unfolds, the crypto market continues to shift based on developments that matter. Aptos is moving up the chain of influence by stepping directly into regulatory debates. Maker has proved its ability to surprise analysts by climbing past key resistance levels and keeping momentum alive. Qubetics, meanwhile, is steadily building out its foundational products while drawing participation in its carefully structured presale. Each of these platforms addresses a different pain point in the crypto space—from scalability and regulation to resilience and privacy. But for those watching closely, Qubetics stands out as a project worth watching as it edges toward its launch window. This might be the time to join this best crypto presale before Qubetics transitions into its full-scale mainnet deployment, offering one of the clearest routes to becoming the next big crypto.

Qubetics addresses internet privacy and blockchain interoperability through a decentralized VPN, offering practical use cases for both individuals and businesses. Why is Qubetics being ranked as one of the best crypto presale opportunities this cycle? Because of its limited supply, robust utility applications in real-world digital payments, and a community-driven allocation model, analysts continue to flag it as one of the best crypto presale projects currently active. Why are Aptos and Maker trending in the market right now? Aptos is gaining institutional attention through congressional testimony, while Maker is rising sharply due to strong technical indicators and bullish sentiment.

45572530,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=166656,1749165633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45572530.jpeg,"Crucial US China Trade Talks Resume, Boosting Global Hopes",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-china-trade-talks/,"BitcoinWorld Crucial US China Trade Talks Resume, Boosting Global Hopes In a development that has captured the attention of global financial markets, including the often-volatile world of Cryptocurrency , US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have reportedly agreed to resume Trade Talks . This news, initially reported by Chinese state media CCTV and shared by prominent market commentators like @DeItaone on X, signals a potential de-escalation in tensions that have weighed heavily on the Global Economy . Why Do US China Trade Developments Matter for Cryptocurrency? While seemingly unrelated to digital assets, the relationship between the United States and China is arguably the single most significant bilateral economic dynamic on the planet. The state of US China Trade directly influences: Global Market Sentiment: When the two largest economies are in conflict, uncertainty rises. This often leads to a ‘risk-off’ environment where investors pull capital from perceived riskier assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies, seeking safety in assets like gold or government bonds. Conversely, positive developments can foster a ‘risk-on’ mood, encouraging investment in growth assets. Economic Growth Projections: Trade disputes impact supply chains, manufacturing, and consumer confidence worldwide. A healthier global economy generally provides a more favorable backdrop for asset classes like cryptocurrency, which benefit from increased liquidity and investor confidence. Capital Flows: Major shifts in economic policy or trade relations can influence how and where large pools of capital are deployed globally. Therefore, monitoring the progress of Trade Talks is crucial for anyone looking to understand the broader macroeconomic forces that can significantly influence Market Impact across all asset classes, including digital currencies. The Details of the Agreement: What We Know So Far The agreement to resume negotiations followed a reportedly lengthy and positive call between President Trump and President Xi. Here are the key takeaways: Source of Information: The news was first disseminated via Chinese state media CCTV, picked up by financial news feeds like @DeItaone, and later confirmed by President Trump himself on Truth Social. Call Duration: President Trump described the call as lasting approximately 90 minutes. This duration suggests a substantive conversation rather than a brief check-in. Reported Outcome: According to President Trump, the call ended positively for both nations. Chinese state media reported an agreement to begin a new round of talks “as soon as possible.” Implicit Context: The need to “resume” talks implies that previous negotiations had stalled or broken down, highlighting the significance of this new agreement to restart the process. This development marks a potential turning point after periods of intense tariff exchanges and rhetoric that created significant uncertainty for businesses and investors globally. Navigating the Potential Market Impact The resumption of Trade Talks is generally perceived as a positive catalyst for the Global Economy . Reduced trade tensions could lead to: Increased Business Confidence: Companies might be more willing to invest and expand if the threat of escalating tariffs diminishes. More Stable Supply Chains: Reduced uncertainty allows businesses to plan more effectively and avoid costly disruptions. Improved Consumer Sentiment: Stable economic conditions and potentially lower costs (due to reduced tariffs) can boost consumer spending. For the cryptocurrency market, this could translate into: Potential Benefits: A stronger ‘risk-on’ environment could encourage investors to allocate capital back into cryptocurrencies. Increased stability in traditional markets might reduce knee-jerk sell-offs in crypto during global economic jitters. A generally healthier global economy supports innovation and investment across all sectors, including blockchain and digital assets. Potential Challenges/Risks: Talks could still break down, leading to renewed uncertainty and negative Market Impact . The actual terms of any potential trade deal matter significantly; not all agreements are equally positive for all sectors. Other macroeconomic factors (inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events) still play a major role and can outweigh the positive impact of trade progress. What Actionable Insights Can Crypto Investors Gain? Given the interconnectedness of the Global Economy and financial markets, here’s how crypto enthusiasts can use this information: Monitor Progress: Keep a close eye on news regarding the actual commencement and progress of the US China Trade negotiations. Headlines about breakthroughs or impasses can cause swift market reactions. Observe Market Reaction: Watch how traditional markets (like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and global indices) react to trade news. Positive reactions in these markets often correlate with positive sentiment spilling over into crypto. Diversify Perspective: Understand that while trade is a major factor, it’s not the only one. Consider monetary policy, regulatory news, and technological developments within the crypto space itself. Be Prepared for Volatility: While positive news is good, the path to a trade resolution is often bumpy. Be prepared for potential volatility in the crypto market driven by headlines, both positive and negative. Treating this US China Trade development as a key piece of the global macroeconomic puzzle is essential for making informed decisions in the crypto market. Concluding Thoughts: A Step Towards Stability? The agreement between President Trump and President Xi to resume Trade Talks is a significant development that offers a glimmer of hope for increased stability in the Global Economy . While the outcome of these negotiations remains uncertain, the willingness to return to the table is a positive sign. For the cryptocurrency market, which is increasingly influenced by global macroeconomic trends and overall Market Impact , this represents a crucial factor to watch. The potential for reduced trade tensions could contribute to a more favorable investment climate, but investors should remain vigilant and informed about the progress of these vital discussions.

The crash unfolded alongside a brutal political brawl between Elon and the sitting US president, and it dragged the once-beloved meme coin deep into the red. The drama kicked off earlier this week when Elon took shots at Trump’s latest spending bill. Trump didn’t stay quiet. He hit back by pulling the NASA nomination of Jared Isaacman, Elon’s longtime business ally and the man he wanted leading US space exploration efforts. That withdrawal shattered any illusion of peace between them. Trump threatens to cancel contracts, Musk responds with Dragon shutdown By Thursday, the fight turned into a full-on public war. Trump told the press he was “very disappointed” in Elon. Within hours, Elon fired back on X, writing, “Trump would have lost the election without me.” The next reply from Trump? “CRAZY.” He followed that with a threat to cancel federal contracts held by Elon’s companies. The impact on the market was immediate. Tesla shares fell 14% before closing for the day. Elon didn’t hesitate. He wrote on X, “Go ahead, make my day,” and then announced that SpaceX would begin shutting down its Dragon spacecraft program. Dragon is the only American spacecraft that transports astronauts to and from the International Space Station. There was no direct mention of Dogecoin, but it didn’t matter. The coin has never been tied to any real-world value or asset. Instead, it runs on vibes, hype, memes—and above all—Elon’s influence. That’s why this political chaos hit so hard. Elon leaving Washington means his sway is fading, and Dogecoin holders are taking the hit. In 2022, Dogecoin jumped 15% in a day after Tesla accepted it for merch. In 2023, Elon replaced the Twitter logo with a shiba inu, the Dogecoin mascot, and the price surged over 30%. Now that Elon is out of Trump’s circle, and contracts are under threat, that same price is collapsing. Back in November, after Trump’s win, Dogecoin had rallied with other coins like bitcoin, as crypto traders expected a regulation-free environment. That optimism is dead now. With Elon out and government pressure mounting, buyers are paying the price for betting on their bromance.

According to the South Korean news agency Yonhap , two bills that propose institutionalizing tokenized securities are pending before the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee. Tokenized Securities: High on Political Agenda? The bills were drafted by lawmakers Min Byeong-deok and Kim Jae-seop. The National Assembly has been effectively deadlocked since December last year, when former President Yuoon Seok-yeol unsuccessfully attempted to impose martial law. President Lee Jae-myung on Wednesday unveiled key nominations on his first day of presidency, including the prime minister nominee and his presidential aides, in his first briefing to reporters after entering the presidential office in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. https://t.co/lNUF4jvVvw — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) June 4, 2025 But following yesterday’s inauguration of President Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party (DP) , an end to the impasse is now in sight. The DP has a large majority in parliament. Senior party officials have repeatedly called for Seoul to legalize security token offerings (STOs). This would overturn a much-maligned blanket ban on all forms of public blockchain-based token issuances. The ban dates back to the end of the 2010s. Yonhap wrote that expectations are now high that lawmakers will “quickly” turn their attention to STO regulations. The news agency wrote that expectations about approval grew high in previous sessions. Many felt the committee was on the cusp of approving the bills. The South Korean National Assembly Building in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: SC Jang) Both bills failed to pass the past session “due to external factors such as the National Assembly’s deadlock,” Yonhap wrote. The agency added, “However, the industry thinks that much has since changed.” Firms Ready to Act Scores of South Korean companies have been sitting on tokenized securities-related offerings for years, in anticipation of favorable legislation. This number includes large financial providers, telecom giants, and leading tech companies. Former President Yoon repeatedly pledged to authorize STO approval, but was ultimately unable to deliver on his promises. Domestic firms have told media outlets they are hopeful the same will not be true of President Lee’s government. Lawmakers have reached a de facto consensus about the need to legalize STOs, and the nation’s biggest securities companies want Seoul to fast-track the necessary legislation. Many providers say that this will help them diversify their financial investment product offerings. Yonhap explained: “Both the ruling and opposition parties are, unusually, showing a strong desire to activate the STO market. A bipartisan consensus is emerging.” Lee Jae-myung clinches presidency with record vote count https://t.co/jKFe3xPOyT — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 4, 2025 Financial Inclusion Boost Lawmakers believe STOs will help boost financial inclusion. They think STO will let the public make micro-investments, spending as little as 10,000 won ($7.39) to invest in real estate assets or expensive works of art. However, while the media outlet suggested that politicians will likely push ahead with a vote on Min’s or Kim’s bills once business as usual resumes in the National Assembly, controversy surrounding the fate of Yoon continues to disrupt the chamber’s activities. The DP wants to process several special prosecution laws as it looks to launch an inquiry into Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon-hee. The latter has been accused of crimes including fraud, stock market manipulation, tax evasion, and corruption. The opposition People Power Party has protested the DP’s moves. The former says a plenary session schedule has not yet been agreed upon. President Lee also vowed to launch a KRW-pegged stablecoin in the run-up to June 3’s election . Both he and Min claimed that a won stablecoin could help South Korea “secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony.” The post South Korean Parliament ‘Poised to Approve Tokenized Securities Bill’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|South Korea|Tokenization,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-05 23:30:00

At the forefront of this movement is the concept of Real World Assets (RWA) being brought onto the blockchain. Today, a significant milestone has been reached in this burgeoning sector: Plume Network has officially launched its public mainnet, dubbed Plume Genesis. This launch marks a pivotal moment for RWA Finance (RWAfi), providing a dedicated infrastructure for managing and trading tokenized real-world assets. What is Plume Network and Why Focus on RWA Blockchain? Plume Network positions itself as the first modular L2 blockchain specifically designed for tokenizing Real World Assets . But what exactly does that mean, and why is a dedicated RWA Blockchain necessary? Traditionally, assets like real estate, art, private equity, or even collectibles are illiquid and difficult to trade. Tokenization changes this by creating digital representations (tokens) of these assets on a blockchain. This allows for fractional ownership, increased liquidity, faster settlement, and greater transparency. However, bringing RWAs on-chain isn’t without its complexities. It requires addressing legal and regulatory compliance, ensuring data privacy, and providing robust infrastructure that can handle the unique characteristics of these assets. Plume Network aims to solve these challenges by offering a comprehensive, full-stack solution tailored specifically for RWAfi projects. Their ‘full-stack’ approach means they provide not just the base blockchain layer, but also integrated solutions for asset tokenization, compliance tools, and distribution mechanisms. This makes it easier for businesses and individuals to onboard and manage RWAs in a compliant and efficient manner. Plume Genesis Mainnet: Powering the Future of RWA Finance The launch of Plume Genesis, the public mainnet, signifies that Plume Network is now fully operational and open for users and projects to deploy and interact with RWA-focused applications. This isn’t just another blockchain launch; it’s the debut of infrastructure built from the ground up with RWA Finance as its core mission. Key aspects of the Plume Genesis mainnet include: Dedicated RWA Focus: Optimized for the specific needs of tokenizing and managing real-world assets. Full-Stack Architecture: Provides integrated tools for tokenization, compliance, and distribution. Scalability and Efficiency: As an L2 network, it aims to offer lower transaction costs and higher throughput compared to mainnet layers. EVM Compatibility: Likely built with EVM compatibility in mind, making it easier for developers to migrate or build dApps. This launch is critical because it moves Plume Network from a test environment to a live, production-ready platform where real value can be transferred and managed in the form of tokenized assets. Strong Backing and a Growing Ecosystem A significant indicator of Plume Network’s potential is the caliber of its partnerships and the rapid growth of its ecosystem. The project is backed by notable names in both traditional finance and the crypto space, including: Superstate: A firm founded by Compound founder Robert Leshner, focused on bringing U.S. Treasury bills onto the blockchain. Blackstone: One of the world’s largest alternative investment firms. Invesco: A major global investment management company. These partnerships lend considerable credibility and signal strong interest from institutional players in the potential of the RWA Blockchain space. Their involvement suggests that Plume Network is building infrastructure that meets the standards and needs of large-scale financial institutions. Beyond the backing, Plume Network has already attracted substantial capital and projects to its platform: Over $150 million in RWA capital is reportedly already on-chain. More than 200 projects are building or planning to deploy on the network. This rapid adoption indicates strong demand for a dedicated RWA platform and positions Plume Network as a central hub for future RWA developments. Opportunities on Plume: Staking, Rewards, and Crypto RWA The mainnet launch also opens up several avenues for users to participate and benefit from the Plume Network ecosystem, particularly within the Crypto RWA landscape. One key opportunity is the ability to stake PLUME tokens . Staking is a common mechanism in blockchain networks that allows token holders to support network security and operations while earning rewards. For PLUME token holders, staking provides a way to earn yield directly from the network’s activity. Furthermore, Plume is offering ecosystem rewards . These rewards are designed to incentivize participation and activity on the network, encouraging users to explore the various RWA applications and services being built. An ongoing Plume airdrop is also available, providing early users and participants with an opportunity to receive PLUME tokens. Airdrops are a popular way for new networks to distribute tokens and build community engagement. Adding another layer of opportunity, staking is also available through Nest , which is described as Plume’s RWA yield engine. This suggests that users might be able to stake their PLUME tokens or potentially other RWA-backed tokens within Nest to earn yield derived from the underlying real-world assets or network activity. These features are crucial for bootstrapping the network effect and attracting both users looking for yield opportunities and projects seeking active participants. The Future Landscape of RWA Finance The launch of a dedicated RWA Finance blockchain like Plume Network is a strong signal for the future direction of the crypto industry. It highlights the increasing maturity of blockchain technology and its potential to interact with and transform traditional financial markets. While challenges remain – particularly around regulatory clarity and bridging the gap between physical and digital realms – platforms like Plume are building the necessary infrastructure to overcome them. The significant capital and project interest already seen on Plume suggest that the market is ready for dedicated RWA solutions. The success of Plume Network and similar initiatives could pave the way for a future where a wide range of assets, from real estate fractions to private company equity, are easily traded and managed on-chain, unlocking trillions of dollars in value and creating a more accessible and efficient global financial system. Summary: Plume Network’s Bold Step for Real World Assets In conclusion, the launch of the Plume Genesis public mainnet is a major development for the Real World Assets sector and the broader blockchain industry. By providing a purpose-built, full-stack RWA Blockchain , Plume Network is addressing the specific needs of tokenizing and managing RWAs. With strong backing from traditional finance giants and a rapidly growing ecosystem of projects and capital, Plume is well-positioned to become a key player in the evolution of RWA Finance . Opportunities like PLUME token staking, ecosystem rewards, and the ongoing airdrop offer compelling reasons for users and developers to explore this new platform and participate in the exciting future of Crypto RWA .

A recent development that has captured significant attention involves a major player in the market making a notable addition to its platform. DWF Labs , a prominent global digital asset market maker, has officially announced the listing of the USD1 stablecoin . This particular stablecoin is drawing extra scrutiny due to its association with the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) project, which has been linked to the Trump family. The listing is live on DWF Liquid Markets, the firm’s institutional trading platform, which boasts connectivity to over 1,000 counterparties. This move signifies a potential step towards broader institutional access for USD1, bringing together established financial infrastructure with a project carrying a high-profile political connection. Understanding the Players: DWF Labs and WLFI Project To fully grasp the significance of this development, it’s essential to look at the entities involved. DWF Labs is recognized as a leading force in the digital asset space, specializing in market making, quantitative trading, and Web3 investments. Their platform, DWF Liquid Markets, is designed specifically for institutional clients, offering deep liquidity and access to a wide network of trading partners. On the other side is the WLFI project , or World Liberty Financial. This initiative has gained prominence due to its connection to the Trump family, though the precise nature of the relationship is a subject of discussion. It’s often described as a DeFi project aiming to leverage blockchain technology. The USD1 stablecoin is presented as a core component of this project, intended to provide a stable digital currency pegging its value to the US dollar. What Does a Stablecoin Listing Mean? A stablecoin listing on an institutional platform like DWF Liquid Markets is more than just adding another token. It implies several things: Increased Liquidity: DWF Labs’ role as a market maker means they will actively trade USD1, providing buy and sell orders to ensure smoother price action and easier large-volume trades for institutional clients. Institutional Access: Listing on a platform connected to 1,000+ counterparties opens USD1 up to a vast network of hedge funds, trading firms, and other institutional players who might not typically trade on retail exchanges. Enhanced Visibility: The listing itself generates buzz and brings the USD1 stablecoin and the WLFI project into the spotlight within the professional trading community. Potential for Integration: Inclusion on such a platform can pave the way for USD1’s integration into other institutional crypto products and services. For the USD1 stablecoin and the WLFI project , this listing is a significant milestone in their effort to gain traction in the competitive stablecoin market. The Political Connection: Trump Crypto and Its Implications The term “ Trump crypto ” has become a shorthand for digital asset projects or tokens associated with Donald Trump or his family. While it’s crucial to clarify the exact nature of the connection (often through family members or close associates rather than directly by Donald Trump himself), this association brings both unique opportunities and potential challenges. Potential Opportunities: High Profile: The association generates significant media attention and public awareness, which can be invaluable for a new project. Potential User Base: Could potentially tap into a base of supporters interested in politically aligned digital assets. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Projects linked to prominent political figures may attract increased attention from regulators. Political Polarization: The association can alienate potential users or partners who do not share the same political views. Dependency on Association: The project’s success might become overly reliant on the political connection rather than its underlying technology or utility. Reputational Risk: Any controversy surrounding the political figure could negatively impact the stablecoin and the project. The listing of USD1 by DWF Labs places it squarely at the intersection of finance, technology, and politics, making it a subject of keen interest and careful observation. Navigating the Institutional Crypto Landscape The move by DWF Labs highlights the growing appetite for diverse digital assets within the institutional crypto market. Institutions are increasingly looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to stablecoins, DeFi protocols, and other emerging tokens. Platforms like DWF Liquid Markets cater to the specific needs of these large players, including: Robust security measures High-speed execution Regulatory compliance considerations Access to deep liquidity pools Over-the-counter (OTC) trading options For the WLFI project , having their USD1 stablecoin available on such a platform provides validation and a direct pathway to institutional capital, which is crucial for growth and stability in the long term. What Should Traders and Investors Consider? For those operating in the institutional crypto space or even sophisticated individual traders looking at USD1, several factors warrant consideration: Due Diligence on USD1: Like any stablecoin, understanding its reserve backing, audit frequency, and redemption mechanisms is paramount. Transparency is key. Understanding the WLFI Project: Research the team, the technology, and the broader goals of World Liberty Financial beyond the stablecoin itself. Assessing the Political Risk: Be aware that the association with the Trump family could introduce volatility or regulatory hurdles unrelated to typical market dynamics. Evaluating DWF Liquid Markets: Understand the platform’s fee structure, trading pairs available, and specific terms for trading USD1. Market Competition: USD1 enters a market dominated by giants like USDT, USDC, and others. Its success will depend on adoption, trust, and potential unique features or advantages. While the stablecoin listing by DWF Labs is a positive step for USD1 in terms of accessibility, the unique political context adds layers of complexity that require careful analysis. Conclusion: A Watchful Eye on USD1 and the WLFI Project The listing of the USD1 stablecoin on DWF Liquid Markets marks a significant moment for the WLFI project . It provides institutional access and enhanced liquidity through a major market maker, DWF Labs . However, the project’s association with the “ Trump crypto ” narrative means it will likely face unique challenges and opportunities compared to politically unaligned stablecoins. As the institutional crypto market continues to mature, the inclusion of assets like USD1 demonstrates the expanding scope of digital asset trading. The performance and adoption of USD1, particularly how it navigates the intersection of finance and politics, will be closely watched by market participants and regulators alike. This development underscores the increasingly diverse and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency landscape.

HFSC Holds Critical Crypto Hearing Amid Policy Talks Titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: From Blueprint to a Functional Framework,” the June 4 hearing widely focused on concerns regarding the development of a digital asset regulatory framework . Happening Now: Full Committee hearing examining the Committee’s digital asset market structure framework. WATCH or LISTEN: https://t.co/3qbnUPa7SD — House Committee on Financial Services – Democrats (@USHouseFSC) June 4, 2025 Largely covering the CLARITY Act of 2025, the hearing brought together several crypto-oriented witnesses, including former SEC commissioner Elad Roisman, Etheralize founder Vivek Raman, Uniswap Labs Chief Legal Officer Katherine Minarik, and former CFTC chairman Rostin Benham and Timothy Massad. “I’ve been proudly involved in this issue for over a decade having been former chair of the capital markets subcommittee and having been involved in oversight and investigations,” Huizenga said.“This is the future and we better get our act together.” A Pro-Crypto Senate Showdown Huizenga’s comments come just one week after reports emerged that the House Financial Services Oversight subcommittee chair intends to run for Michigan’s open Senate seat in 2026. Huizenga is known for his crypto-friendly stance toward issues impacting the blockchain sector , having co-sponsored digital asset legislation including FIT21 and the CLARITY Act. The move is likely to upset mainstay Trump-supporters, with Republicans largely backing former Michigan congressman Mike Rogers to campaign for Senate in 2026. Crypto donors have already begun to throw backing in the race, with new crypto super PAC First Principles Digital slated to endorse Rogers in the lead-up to election day. Rogers also has a pro-crypto track record and holds an A rating on digital asset advocacy organization Stand With Crypto’s politician ranking database. “Ensuring that crypto, the next generation of internet information and value flow, is imbued with American values — and payments denominated in American dollars — is paramount,” Rogers said in a recent op-ed published in The Washington Examiner. “Our national security is directly tied to the strength of our economy, and the dollar maintaining its primacy as the global reserve currency.” The post Crypto Is ‘The Future,’ House Financial Services Oversight Subcommittee Chair Says appeared first on Cryptonews .",News|Election|Regulation|U.S. Congress,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|UNI,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-05 23:47:01

Tether, the issuer behind the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, has announced a significant strategic Tether investment in Shiga Digital. This partnership is poised to make waves in the burgeoning Africa blockchain landscape. Who is Shiga Digital and What Does This Tether Investment Mean? Shiga Digital is a financial solutions platform based in Africa, specifically leveraging blockchain technology. While the exact amount of the Tether investment remains undisclosed, the announcement signals a strong commitment from Tether towards supporting digital innovation on the continent. Shiga Digital offers a suite of services designed to empower businesses in Africa, including: Customized virtual accounts Over-the-counter (OTC) trading services Foreign exchange (FX) trading services The company has a clear vision: to place blockchain technology at the core of its future operations. This strategic direction aligns perfectly with the capabilities of stablecoins like USDT stablecoin , which Shiga Digital intends to actively utilize. Why is Africa Becoming a Hotspot for Crypto Investment? The Crypto Africa narrative is one of rapid growth and increasing adoption. Several factors contribute to this trend: High Mobile Penetration: A large portion of the population has access to mobile phones, which serve as gateways to digital financial services. Need for Financial Inclusion: Many Africans remain unbanked or underbanked, and blockchain technology offers potential solutions for broader financial access. Remittances: Africa receives significant remittances, and stablecoins like USDT stablecoin offer a potentially cheaper and faster way to send and receive money across borders. Economic Growth Potential: The continent represents a vast, relatively untapped market with significant economic potential. Tether’s move is not isolated but part of a broader trend of global crypto players recognizing the strategic importance of the Africa blockchain market. Investing in platforms like Shiga Digital provides a localized entry point into this dynamic ecosystem. The Role of USDT Stablecoin in Africa’s Digital Economy The integration of USDT stablecoin into Shiga Digital’s platform is a key aspect of this partnership. Stablecoins offer several advantages that are particularly relevant in African markets: Stability: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, offering a reliable store of value. Cross-Border Transactions: Facilitating cheaper and faster international payments compared to traditional banking channels. Access to Global Markets: Providing a bridge for African businesses and individuals to participate in the global digital economy. Inflation Hedge: In economies experiencing currency fluctuations, holding stablecoins can offer a degree of protection against local currency devaluation. By actively utilizing USDT stablecoin , Shiga Digital can offer its clients more efficient and cost-effective financial services, from trading to cross-border settlements. This directly supports the growth of Crypto Africa . What Services Does Shiga Digital Offer and How Do They Use Blockchain? Shiga Digital is building a platform tailored to the specific needs of the African market. Let’s look closer at their core offerings: Service Description Blockchain Relevance / Benefit Customized Virtual Accounts Providing businesses with digital accounts for managing funds. Potentially leveraging blockchain for transparent record-keeping, faster settlements, and enhanced security. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading Facilitating direct peer-to-peer or business-to-business trading of digital assets and currencies. Blockchain can enable faster, more secure, and potentially lower-cost settlements for large trades. Use of USDT stablecoin simplifies transactions. Foreign Exchange (FX) Trading Allowing businesses to exchange currencies. Blockchain and stablecoins can offer more competitive exchange rates and faster settlement times compared to traditional FX markets. Shiga Digital’s commitment to making blockchain its core business suggests they will continue to innovate, finding new ways to apply distributed ledger technology to solve real-world financial challenges in Africa. The Tether investment will likely accelerate these development efforts. Challenges and Opportunities for Africa Blockchain Adoption While the potential is vast, the path to widespread Africa blockchain adoption is not without hurdles. Challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain varies significantly across African nations. Infrastructure Limitations: Internet connectivity and power supply can be inconsistent in some regions. Education and Awareness: Many potential users are still unfamiliar with blockchain technology and stablecoins like USDT stablecoin . Security Concerns: Protecting users from scams and fraud in a rapidly evolving space is crucial. However, the opportunities often outweigh the challenges. The young, tech-savvy population, the need for better financial infrastructure, and the potential for leapfrogging legacy systems present a fertile ground for growth. The Tether investment in Shiga Digital is a vote of confidence in Africa’s ability to harness these opportunities. Actionable Insights from the Tether-Shiga Digital Partnership What can we learn from this strategic move? Focus on Real-World Use Cases: Projects like Shiga Digital, which address tangible financial needs (payments, trading, accounts), are key to driving adoption in Crypto Africa . Stablecoins as a Catalyst: The emphasis on utilizing USDT stablecoin highlights the role stablecoins play in providing stability and utility in volatile or underserved markets. Strategic Partnerships are Crucial: Global players like Tether partnering with local experts like Shiga Digital can accelerate growth and navigate regional nuances. The Tether investment is a prime example. Africa is a Growth Frontier: This investment reinforces the narrative that Africa is not just a market for adoption but a hub for innovation in the blockchain space. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Africa The strategic Tether investment in Shiga Digital is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a signal of increasing confidence in the potential of Africa blockchain technology. As Shiga Digital expands its services and actively utilizes USDT stablecoin , it has the potential to lower transaction costs, improve financial access, and connect African businesses to the global digital economy more seamlessly. This partnership could serve as a blueprint for future collaborations, further accelerating the growth and adoption of digital finance across the continent. The journey of Crypto Africa is just beginning, and investments like this are paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient financial future.

This is a considerable rise from just 312,200 BTC a year earlier. The reason for the major increase in Bitcoin accumulation is due to various factors. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s value has prompted many more companies to include it in their portfolios. The ongoing support for cryptocurrency by President Donald Trump has created more interest in the sector. After Trump was elected, the U.S. government began to support policies that are beneficial for the crypto industry.

The facility’s administrators say that the bank statements from December 2023 to present show that Dewey, who had access to the account, transferred funds using the peer-to-peer money transfer service Cash App. They also say that the mother has over $16,000 in patient liability, with no payments made since January. Medicaid likewise denied medical assistance due to the old woman’s reported income. The police say that the suspect admitted using Cash App to move money from the PNC bank account and used the funds to purchase groceries and gas, pay personal credit card bills and send money to relatives.

Dogecoin, Solana, and Sui are dealing with tough market conditions like slow momentum, regulatory issues, and technical pressure. In contrast, BlockDAG is making huge moves, separating itself from the pack. It has collected over $287 million and sold 22 billion BDAG coins, with exchange listings set for 20 platforms. Dogecoin is feeling the weight of weak signals, Solana is navigating through legal pressure, and Sui is holding on despite some volatility. These factors are why many are turning toward BlockDAG’s low entry price and big growth potential. Let’s break down the current status of DOGE, SOL, and SUI and explain why BlockDAG is considered one of the top cryptos to buy now for those aiming for major gains before the next bull rally. 1. BlockDAG: Leading the Charge in 2025’s Presale Cryptos Among the top cryptos to buy now, BlockDAG (BDAG) has become a market favorite, supported by solid progress and consistent delivery. Its presale has raised $287 million with 22 billion coins sold. The locked price of $0.0018 until June 13 gives early buyers a shot at 2,678% returns based on its confirmed $0.05 launch rate. There’s also strong chatter about BDAG possibly reaching $1, which could mean over 500x return from today’s rate. Ethereum builders are already moving to BlockDAG thanks to its EVM compatibility, lower costs, and better scalability. Its roadmap includes smart contract kits, builder tools, and real-world use features. Visibility is growing fast, with 20 exchange listings in the pipeline and five already confirmed. With the GO LIVE reveal approaching, interest is climbing. At its current price of $0.0018, BlockDAG isn’t just another coin, it’s fast becoming one of the top cryptos to buy now. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE): Weak Signals Still Dominate DOGE trades near $0.1899, rising just 1.2% daily, but technical signs are not encouraging. It faces pressure at $0.188 and $0.150, and June has often brought declines for the coin. While the range between $0.179 and $0.238 is possible, indicators suggest continued downward pressure. Volume is shrinking, and the trendline is pointing lower, showing low excitement from large-scale buyers. Even though DOGE has an active fan base, there’s no major news or utility-driven spark ahead. This makes it less appealing for those scanning the market for the top cryptos to buy now. Watch key support areas closely if the market dips again. 3. Solana (SOL): Progress Checked by Legal Concerns SOL currently stands at $153.76, rising 1.4% on the day, but last week saw a 10% fall due to legal questions tied to the SEC and Solana-linked ETFs. This has dimmed its recent positive movement. If confidence builds again, it might try to revisit its $177 level or push toward $200. But if it slips under $150, it may drop to $127, especially with rising sell-offs. Solana still shines in speed and app usage, but the legal cloud makes it less attractive as one of the top cryptos to buy now. Other coins offer more near-term promise without regulatory stress. 4. Sui (SUI): Solid Base But Tight Range SUI is hovering at $3.27, gaining 1.9% in 24 hours. It’s holding strong above the key $2.95 support, though concerns remain about a slip to $2.70 if selling grows. Sui’s network is expanding with more dev activity and users, yet its trading zone is narrow. For 2025, prices are forecasted between $2.26 and $3.30, making it more of a stable bet than a high-gain choice. The coin has solid foundations, but those searching for the top cryptos to buy now may look elsewhere. It’s steady, but not leading the charge in growth. Final Remarks! Amid all the noise, a few coins show real strength. DOGE continues to mirror its past June patterns, SOL is weighed down by legal issues, and SUI remains range-bound. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is pushing ahead with a $287 million presale, developer tools, and planned listings. That 2,678% return estimate and a possible $1 price make BlockDAG stand out clearly. Its focus on usability, builder support, and exchange visibility adds to its momentum. For those still wondering about the top cryptos to buy now , BlockDAG may be more than just a good pick, it could be leading the next major crypto run. The current window won’t last long.

A significant piece of clarity has emerged from a key European financial authority regarding the application of the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. This clarification specifically addresses the status of two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin and Ethereum. For those navigating the complexities of crypto regulation Europe , this insight from the Central Bank of Ireland is particularly relevant. Understanding the Core of MiCA Regulation Before diving into the specifics of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s status, it’s essential to grasp what MiCA regulation is and why it’s so important. MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the European Union. Its primary goals are to: Provide legal certainty for crypto assets not covered by existing EU financial services legislation. Support innovation while ensuring financial stability and protecting investors and consumers. Establish harmonized rules for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) across the EU. Address risks related to market integrity and financial stability that could arise from crypto assets. MiCA covers a broad range of crypto assets and activities, but its scope is defined by specific categories of crypto assets and the services provided in relation to them. This is where the detail matters, particularly concerning the requirement of an ‘identifiable issuer’. Central Bank Ireland Crypto Stance: No Issuer, No MiCA? The recent statement causing discussion comes from Mary-Elizabeth McMunn, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland. According to reports, she indicated that both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are currently not subject to the MiCA regulation because they lack an identifiable issuer. This point is crucial. MiCA’s framework largely applies to crypto assets that are issued by a specific entity or group, making that entity accountable for compliance, disclosure, and other requirements. Think of it this way: For many traditional financial instruments, there’s a clear issuer – a company issuing shares, a government issuing bonds, a bank issuing stablecoins (which MiCA does cover under specific categories). This issuer is responsible for meeting regulatory obligations. Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, were launched in a decentralized manner, with no single company, foundation (in the traditional sense), or individual entity acting as a central issuer responsible for their ongoing existence or issuance in the way MiCA defines it. Why the ‘MiCA Issuer’ Point is Key for Bitcoin and Ethereum The distinction regarding the MiCA issuer is fundamental to how the regulation classifies crypto assets. MiCA broadly categorizes crypto assets into: Crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens: This is a broad category, but the issuer requirements still apply for many sub-types. Asset-referenced tokens (ARTs): Crypto assets that purport to maintain a stable value by referencing another value or right, or a combination thereof, including one or more official currencies. E-money tokens (EMTs): Crypto assets that purport to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of one official currency. The requirements for issuing and offering ARTs and EMTs are particularly stringent under MiCA, placing significant obligations on the issuer. For crypto assets that don’t fit neatly into ART or EMT categories, the application of MiCA often still hinges on there being an identifiable entity responsible for the public offering or admission to trading. Because Bitcoin and the original Ether issuance model predate much of this regulatory thinking and operate on decentralized networks without a central issuing authority, they arguably fall outside the direct scope of MiCA’s issuer-centric provisions. This is the basis for the Central Bank of Ireland’s Deputy Governor’s statement on Bitcoin Ethereum MiCA status. Contrasting with Tokens Having an Identifiable Issuer: The XRP Example The original report mentioned a comment from crypto influencer “SMQKE” highlighting XRP as an example of a token that *does* have an identifiable issuer (Ripple Labs). This comparison helps underscore the point made by the Central Bank of Ireland. If a crypto asset has a clear entity responsible for its creation, distribution, and potentially ongoing development or management in a centralized manner, it is far more likely to be considered within MiCA’s scope, potentially as a utility token (depending on its function) or another regulated category if it references assets or fiat. This contrast illustrates the regulatory challenge posed by the diverse nature of crypto assets. Regulators are attempting to fit novel digital assets into frameworks often designed for traditional finance, where identifiable issuers and responsible entities are standard. The decentralized nature of networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum presents a unique case that requires careful interpretation of regulations like MiCA. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation in Europe? The stance from the Central Bank Ireland crypto position offers valuable insight into how national regulators within the EU are interpreting MiCA. While MiCA is an EU-wide regulation, its application and enforcement will involve national competent authorities. This statement suggests that, at least from the perspective of the Irish central bank, the decentralized nature of BTC and ETH places them outside the primary issuance and offering rules of MiCA. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin and Ethereum are entirely unregulated in Europe. Activities involving these assets, such as trading services provided by crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), *are* covered by MiCA. CASPs dealing with BTC, ETH, or any other crypto asset must comply with MiCA’s requirements regarding authorization, governance, consumer protection, market abuse prevention, and more. So, while the assets themselves might not be regulated at the ‘issuer’ level, the businesses that interact with them on behalf of users within the EU *are* subject to comprehensive rules under MiCA. This is a critical distinction. Potential Implications and Benefits of this Clarity For the crypto industry and users in Europe, this clarification, particularly regarding the Bitcoin Ethereum MiCA relationship, offers several potential benefits: Increased Certainty: Reduces ambiguity around the regulatory status of the two largest cryptocurrencies, which are foundational to the broader crypto market. Focus on Services: Reinforces that MiCA’s focus for decentralized assets is on regulating the *services* provided around them (exchanges, wallets, etc.), rather than attempting to regulate the decentralized protocols themselves. Potential for Innovation: By acknowledging the unique structure of truly decentralized networks, this interpretation might provide more space for innovation at the protocol layer, while ensuring consumer protection occurs at the service provider layer. However, this interpretation isn’t without its nuances and potential future considerations. For instance, the status of Ethereum post-merge and its move to Proof-of-Stake, including staking services, is an area that continues to be discussed within regulatory circles. While the core ETH asset may not have a central issuer, services built around staking could potentially have different regulatory considerations. Challenges and Remaining Questions for Crypto Regulation Europe While the Central Bank Ireland crypto statement provides clarity on one aspect, the broader landscape of crypto regulation Europe still presents challenges: Defining ‘Decentralized’: Where is the line drawn between a truly decentralized network and one with enough central control to constitute an ‘issuer’? This will likely be a point of ongoing regulatory scrutiny for newer or less decentralized projects. Scope of Services: As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, determining which activities constitute regulated ‘services’ under MiCA and who is responsible for compliance becomes complex. Harmonization in Practice: While MiCA aims for harmonization, interpretations by national authorities, though guided by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Banking Authority (EBA), might still vary in practice. Future Developments: The crypto space is dynamic. New types of assets and services may require future regulatory adjustments or interpretations. Understanding these complexities is vital for anyone operating or investing in the European crypto market. The focus is clearly shifting towards regulating the gateways and service providers that connect users to the decentralized world, rather than attempting to police the decentralized protocols themselves, especially those lacking a clear MiCA issuer . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Based on this significant clarification and the broader scope of MiCA, here are some actionable insights: For Users: Be aware that while BTC and ETH might not be directly regulated at the protocol level under MiCA, the platforms and wallets you use to buy, sell, or store them within the EU are likely regulated. Choose CASPs that are transparent about their compliance status. For Businesses (CASPs): MiCA compliance is non-negotiable if you operate in the EU. Focus on meeting the stringent requirements for authorization, governance, risk management, and consumer protection, regardless of whether the underlying assets you handle (like BTC or ETH) have an issuer or not. For Project Teams (Developing New Assets): If your project involves issuing a new token, carefully consider whether it falls under MiCA’s definitions, particularly ARTs or EMTs, or if it could be considered to have an identifiable issuer. Seek legal and regulatory advice early in your development process if you intend to target the EU market. Stay Informed: Regulatory interpretations can evolve. Follow updates from EU authorities (ESMA, EBA) and national regulators like the Central Bank of Ireland to stay abreast of developments impacting MiCA regulation and crypto regulation Europe . Summary: A Step Towards Clarity in European Crypto Regulation The statement from the Central Bank of Ireland’s Deputy Governor, Mary-Elizabeth McMunn, provides welcome clarity on a specific but crucial aspect of the MiCA regulation: that Bitcoin and Ethereum, due to their lack of an identifiable issuer, are not subject to the issuance and offering requirements of the framework. This aligns with the decentralized nature of these pioneering networks and reinforces the idea that MiCA’s focus, for such assets, is primarily on regulating the service providers that facilitate access for users. While challenges and questions remain in the complex world of crypto regulation Europe , this interpretation from the Central Bank Ireland crypto stance marks a significant step in understanding the practical application of MiCA and the importance of the MiCA issuer concept in determining regulatory scope, particularly concerning the status of Bitcoin Ethereum MiCA interactions.

Solana is struggling, as it slipped under important support zones. In contrast, Dogecoin shows signs of strength and may be heading toward a bullish breakout. The real surprise is Web3 ai ($WAI) . While its price is still just $0.000422 in Stage 8, it’s drawing serious attention. The listing price is set at $0.005242, which means a possible 1747% return for early buyers. With more than $7.1 million raised already, this project might outpace both DOGE and SOL in terms of real impact. Solana Struggles Despite ETF Talk Around the Corner Solana’s price continues to fall, even as talks around ETF approval pick up. It is now trading under a key support area, and technical charts show rising pressure and weaker momentum. Analysts point out that the declining volume and lack of strong buying signals could mean short-term struggles for SOL. Still, some long-term supporters remain hopeful. With ETFs on the radar, the coin may get a second wind if broader market interest returns to layer-one platforms. Past upgrades and SOL’s efficient ecosystem suggest it could bounce back. If market sentiment changes, this dip may still turn into an opportunity for those watching closely. Dogecoin’s Chart Suggests Big Move Ahead Dogecoin (DOGE) is forming a bullish ascending triangle on its daily chart. That pattern usually hints at a breakout. DOGE is now hovering around $0.17, and analysts believe that closing above $0.175 could rally toward $0.19 or even $0.20. On-chain signals look good. Wallet activity is picking up, and the trading volume is also growing. DOGE has faced plenty of swings, but its strong community and listing across major exchanges keep it relevant. Indicators like RSI and MACD are now moving in the right direction. For traders chasing short-term gains, this setup might be worth watching. Web3 ai Hits $7.1M With $WAI Powering DeFi Focused Features Web3 ai is making quiet but powerful moves during its early stages. The project aims to solve practical problems in crypto using artificial intelligence. At the heart of its ecosystem is $WAI, the utility coin that powers all platform features. Currently in Stage 8, $WAI is priced at $0.000422. The listing price is confirmed at $0.005242, offering a potential return of 1747%. More than $7.1 million has been raised so far, showing strong demand. What makes it even more notable is that this momentum is not driven by celebrity hype or memes, it’s backed by utility. Web3 ai has a total of 50 presale stages. The final stage price is $0.003276, still below the listing price. This gap is drawing attention from early participants. Once live, all AI tools, designed for DeFi users and crypto communities, will become active. These tools include features for tracking market trends, detecting risks, and enhancing research. While many rush into meme coins for fast gains, Web3 ai is focused on building a reliable foundation for AI in crypto. It’s still under one cent, yet already proving its demand. With a clear roadmap, smart utility, and rising traction, Web3 ai could become one of the standout platforms of this cycle. Summing Up! Solana’s technical patterns hint at weakness despite ETF buzz. Dogecoin’s momentum looks better, but its gains depend on market support. Web3 ai stands apart by not relying on hype or short-term spikes. Its AI tools will go live after listing, adding real value. The $WAI token fuels the entire platform. With over $7.1 million raised and a low presale price of $0.000422, the project is building for long-term utility, not just market chatter. If SOL and DOGE feel like stories from past cycles, Web3 ai could be what’s next. In a noisy space, $WAI offers a clear and grounded signal.

Here’s Why This is Good for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/swift-quietly-approves-ripples-interledger-protocol-heres-why-this-is-good-for-xrp/,"An official change request listed on the ISO 20022 website has been approved, and it may significantly alter the future of digital value transfer. Submitted by The Mojaloop Foundation for Payments and Clearing Settlement. This request was approved in late 2024 and proposes an implementation that references Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP), a technology designed to enable seamless, cross-network payments. This approval could significantly benefit XRP in the coming months. This development surfaced through a post on X by crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), who published a short video highlighting the approved ISO change request. In a follow-up, he shared several images pointing to Ripple’s ILP as a key component for value transfer across otherwise incompatible networks. Notably, the documentation proves that the Interledger Protocol is not a theoretical framework, but is already functioning and integrated with Ripple’s existing infrastructure. A Confirmed Connection Between ILP, XRP, and SWIFT The documentation attached to SMQKE’s post reinforces a crucial technical point: Ripple’s Interledger Protocol utilizes XRP in the process of value movement. This integration offers significant potential to modernize global remittance and settlement systems while embedding XRP into the architecture. This functionality becomes especially relevant in the universal mode of ILP, where transactions can occur between untrusted connectors, bypassing the need for notaries by using XRP as a bridging asset . Another excerpt specifies that the ILP system relies on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for final settlement. The diagram outlines the payment flow, showing how connectors facilitate interim exchanges. All claims are ultimately recorded and redeemed on the XRPL. SMQKE also attached a document from SBI Group, a long-time Ripple partner , which acknowledges Ripple’s hybrid technology that combines ILP and XRP Ledger. The slide explains that XRP can be used as a bridge currency in international transfers, eliminating the need for multiple local currencies while enhancing interoperability. YES — RIPPLE’S INTERLEDGER PROTOCOL USES XRP TO MOVE VALUE ACROSS NETWORKS Documented 4x. https://t.co/shLyD5rR2L pic.twitter.com/RJx3di7v63 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 4, 2025 SWIFT Network Compatibility Marks a Turning Point The significance of ISO 20022’s approval lies in the standard’s role as a global foundation for financial messaging, particularly within systems like SWIFT. With Ripple’s ILP now officially linked to a change request involving the ISO 20022 standard, it positions Ripple’s infrastructure as interoperable with the widely used messaging standard. This approval is even more notable because SWIFT has confirmed full migration to the ISO 20022 standard by November. Ripple’s payment system is ISO 20022 compliant, and this integration of ILP into the system gives way for potential XRP adoption in SWIFT’s ecosystem.

A chart analysis posted by a crypto analyst on the social media platform X has given an interesting projection about XRP’s next move. By overlaying XRP’s current weekly chart with its explosive 2017 fractal, the analyst hints that the altcoin might be on the verge of a repeat performance that sends it far beyond its current price range. 2017 XRP Fractal Overlaid Technical analysis of XRP price action on the weekly timeframe reveals an interesting pattern that has been unfolding over multiple weeks. This interesting pattern began with the intense XRP price rally in Q4 2024, which eventually ended in a consolidation around $2, as seen in the current price action. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a flag pattern that is still playing out. Related Reading: Analyst Shows 3-Cycle Ride For XRP Price To Reach $46 The core of the analyst’s technical analysis lies in the uncanny resemblance between XRP’s present market structure and the bullish pattern that preceded the historic 2017 rally. As such, the analyst overlaid the 2017 fractal onto the current price action, revealing a formation that mirrors a giant bull flag, which is often interpreted as a technical continuation pattern. The analysis also places into focus XRP’s ongoing interaction with the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) on the weekly candlestick timeframe. Back in 2017, this level acted as a support base for XRP’s vertical breakout. Now, the current pattern shows the cryptocurrency is once again consolidating directly above this moving average, which the analyst describes as the foundation of a giga bull flag. The resemblance doesn’t stop at price structure. The analyst also draws attention to the RSI behavior. Back in 2017, the RSI entered a flat compressed zone between two spikes on the weekly timeframe, a pattern that appears to be repeating today. The first RSI peak has already formed, and the current flattening phase suggests a possible second spike may soon follow, which could correlate with a breakout in price if the fractal stays valid. What To Expect If 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? The implications are exciting if XRP follows the same trajectory as it did in 2017. The overlay suggests a price rally beyond $20, which would represent the biggest rally so far in XRP’s price history. The projected move would take XRP far beyond its 2018 all-time high of $3.40 and establish a new price floor above double digits for the cryptocurrency. This projection aligns with other projections in similar technical analyses from other cryptocurrency analysts. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Now Targeting $4 After Reversal From ‘Buy Zone’ At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.2, down by 2,3% in the past 24 hours. Whether or not XRP follows the 2017 pattern exactly remains to be seen, but the similarities in price behavior, RSI compression, and EMA support are difficult to dismiss.

This is a great development on the path to regulated digital assets in the US. The bill aims to lay down a comprehensive set of rules for the growing world of cryptocurrencies. With bipartisan support and industry backers, it is now well on its way to one of the most disruptive periods of its journey — the committee review and amendment process. The CLARITY Act is pitched to clarify how digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, are regulated. For years, the crypto industry has complained about murky regulations and conflicting guidance from federal agencies. The bill is trying to define what digital assets are. It also seeks to split the regulatory authority between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). That will allow innovation in crypto to continue — while ensuring that consumers and markets are protected from fraud and abuse, lawmakers who introduced the bill last week on May 29 said. The Financial Services Committee will review the bill at the June 10 markup at the Rayburn House Office Building. They will offer amendments, argue over its wording, and mold it into a final version that could be sent to the full House for a vote. Lawmakers push CLARITY Act forward amid GENIUS Act uncertainty Support for the CLARITY Act is building. That’s celebrated as a boon by crypto businesses, developers, and investors. But there’s a catch: the bill’s future could rely on the fate of another piece of legislation making its way through the Senate — the GENIUS Act . The GENIUS Act aims for stablecoins, several types of crypto that track things in the real world — like the US dollar. The crypto economies rely heavily on stablecoins, the gas on which many digital assets famously ride. The Senate made major progress on June 4 when it took a key procedural vote on the GENIUS Act. The vote was strong and bipartisan — 66 in favor to 32 against. This provides evidence that legislators of both stripes understand the need for new financial rules in an era increasingly dominated by blockchain. The GENIUS Act would impose tight regulations on stablecoin issuers, such as full asset backing and periodic disclosures of reserves. Lawmakers argue that this will foster trust from the public and ultimately allow innovation to persist. Because stablecoins are so integral to the digital asset economy, many believe the GENIUS Act must pass before the CLARITY Act can effectively go to work. If the GENIUS Act flounders in the Senate, it would sap momentum for the CLARITY Act in the House. Crypto advocates push to influence CLARITY Act language With the markup date approaching, crypto advocates are fighting to shape the language that will be included in the final iteration of the CLARITY Act. Eight industry groups have banded together to advocate for language in the bill featuring the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, another proposal that would shield DeFi developers — those who code up decentralized financial platforms but don’t hold user funds. They argue they should not be treated like banks or financial institutions because they do not hold assets. Without these protections, developers fear being saddled with regulations designed for completely different businesses. They also fear conflicts of interest in the legislative process. Yet some warned that clear ethical guidelines needed to be established, or there would be public distrust. There have been suggestions to prohibit federal officials from owning or advocating for cryptocurrencies in office. These are thought necessary to ensure a level playing field for regulating virtual assets and to prevent corruption.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin BTC is trading above $101.5K as Asia begins its trading day, shrugging off fresh tariff uncertainties from the Trump administration. However, the real story, according to Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation at Pythagoras Investments, is that traders continue to be laser-focused on a bull market throughout the remainder of the year, with a high degree of confidence that BTC will reach $120,000, buoyed by persistent corporate buying and declining volatility. ""The uncertainty from unexpected tariff increases by the Trump administration is causing some volatility,"" Gabeljic said in an email to CoinDesk. ""However, bitcoin remains relatively strong, with lower volatility compared to other digital assets."" Institutional bullishness remains resilient, Gabeljic highlighted, noting that traders on Polymarket are ""pricing in a 69% probability that Bitcoin will hit at least $120,000 by year-end."" FlowDesk, a Paris-based market maker, echoed this optimistic outlook despite recent subdued market conditions in a recent note on Telegram. ""The market is clearly coiling, waiting to break out of a narrow band just below all-time highs,"" FlowDesk wrote in their market update note. ""Significant repositioning and rotation from Bitcoin towards altcoins has occurred, though BTC's underlying strength remains evident."" FlowDesk also noted cautious market behavior, as indicated by a modest decline in BTC funding rates on major exchanges like Binance, which suggests a reduction in leverage. However, on-chain borrowing activity has seen renewed vigor, potentially signaling anticipation of an imminent market breakout. Further bolstering the bullish BTC narrative is the continued accumulation by corporate treasuries. Listed companies now hold approximately 809,100 BTC, worth nearly $85 billion, nearly doubling the amount held a year ago, driven by favorable regulatory shifts and accounting changes that allow for the recognition of bitcoin gains. ""The expectation of a continued strong bitcoin remains,"" said Gabeljic. News Roundup $TRUMP Token Drops 9% as Musk-Trump Feud, Family Crypto Clash Spook Investors The presidential-themed $TRUMP memecoin fell 9.3% on Thursday, significantly underperforming the broader crypto market as tracked by the CoinDesk 20, an index covering the largest digital assets, which declined 5%. The token’s sharp downturn followed a heated public exchange between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, sparked by disagreements over Trump’s proposed “Big, Beautiful Bill” and its impact on national debt, CoinDesk previously reported . The argument escalated quickly, with Musk threatening to ground SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft and Trump countering by suggesting the government might sever contracts with Musk-led enterprises. Further pressure on the memecoin came after its newly launched crypto wallet, created in partnership with NFT marketplace Magic Eden, went offline following a cease-and-desist from another Trump-affiliated crypto venture. Trump’s sons publicly distanced themselves from the memecoin project, highlighting their involvement in a separate Ethereum-based DeFi initiative, World Liberty Financial. The internal branding clash added another layer of uncertainty, amplifying investor concerns and weighing heavily on the token’s price. CRCL Soars on First Day of Trading Circle (CRCL) shares soared 167% on their first day of trading, closing at $83 after pricing its IPO at $31, briefly hitting an intraday peak of $104. The surge recalls Coinbase's volatile 2021 IPO, which similarly started strong but rapidly lost momentum, raising caution among investors about long-term stability. The jump in Circle's stock price came amid a modest uptick in stablecoin market activity. Trading volume for Circle's USDC rose 22% over the past 24 hours, while market leader Tether's USDT saw volume increase by 13%. Despite the bullish debut, the coming weeks will test Circle’s staying power as investors assess whether enthusiasm around stablecoin infrastructure translates into sustained stock performance. U.S. Treasury Sanctions Philippines Firm Linked to $200M 'Pig Butchering' Crypto Scams The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Philippines-based tech firm Funnull Technology Inc. and its administrator, Liu Lizhi, for facilitating ""pig butchering"" crypto scams responsible for over $200 million in losses from U.S. victims, CoinDesk previously reported. OFAC accused Funnull Technology of providing digital infrastructure, such as IP addresses and domains, used by cybercriminals to host hundreds of thousands of scam websites designed to deceive victims into fraudulent crypto investments. ""Pig butchering"" refers to elaborate crypto scams that groom victims over time, often beginning through unsolicited messages and fake romantic overtures, before convincing them to invest significant sums. With these sanctions, OFAC prohibits any U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with Funnull or Liu, aiming to disrupt the networks enabling these extensive cyber scams and to safeguard investors in the digital asset ecosystem. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin dropped nearly 4% to test the $100K support level before rebounding above $101.5K, as high-volume selling and major exchange outflows signaled growing market stress amid weakening retail activity. ETH: Ethereum dropped 4% after repeatedly failing to surpass the critical $2,640 resistance level, despite increased institutional buying and notable whale accumulation of over $285 million in ETH. Gold: Gold edged higher to $3,363.58 in early Asian trading amid weak U.S. economic data and signs of easing U.S.-China tensions, as the Gold-Silver Ratio surged past 100—a rare signal historically linked to outsized silver returns. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened higher, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.14%, after a positive 90-minute call between U.S. President Trump and China's Xi Jinping set the stage for resumed trade negotiations. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures flatlined as a public feud between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk added uncertainty to market sentiment.

45575524,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=741641,1749170883,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45575524.jpeg,Citadel Securities president warns US debt is a ticking time bomb,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/citadel-warns-us-debt-is-a-ticking-time-bomb/,"President of Citadel Securities, Jim Esposito, has warned that America’s growing debt is a serious risk. Speaking at Thursday’s Piper Sandler Global Exchange & FinTech Conference, Esposito described the rising budget deficit and national debt as a “ticking time bomb.” “No one is smart enough to predict when exactly it will rear its ugly head,” he said . Esposito’s caution follows a sharp increase in pessimism among top finance executives on the prospects for the US economy. His comments echo those from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who late last month warned that there would be a crack in the bond market after the US government and Federal Reserve “massively overdid” spending and quantitative easing. Goldman’s president, John Waldron, recently said that US debt levels are more concern for bond traders than Trump’s tariff policies. Dimon warned in May that there would be a break in the bond market, emphasizing that it was not a question of if but when. Goldman Sachs President John Waldron also chimed in. He said bond traders are more concerned about the US debt than Trump’s trade tariffs. For him, the biggest risks to market stability are higher borrowing costs and the deficit. Citadel’s billionaire founder and CEO, Ken Griffin, also weighed in, criticizing the Trump-supported tax bill moving through Congress. He called the legislation reckless and warned in a June 5 interview that it would only worsen the nation’s debt crisis. Congress pushes trillion-dollar tax cuts The alert is coming as lawmakers debate huge tax cuts. The US House of Representatives passed it with the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in late May. The measure renews tax cuts in the 2017 Trump-era tax law. But it comes at a high price. The bill would increase the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over a decade, the Congressional Budget Office said. That’s on top of a vast national debt exceeding $36 trillion. Most economists say that the level of borrowing is not sustainable. The US spends over a trillion dollars annually on interest on debt alone. That is more than it spends on the military or public health. Esposito stated that the issue was not about politics but about math, adding that the current debt level is definitely at the upper limit of what is sustainable. Citadel ramps up efforts amid market turbulence Citadel Securities, which is based in Miami, is one of the biggest market makers in the world. The company does well when the market action intensifies and stock trading picks up. The first quarter of 2025 brought record profits and trading revenue for the firm — driven by gyrations in the bond and stock markets. Despite benefiting from turbulence, the broader economic risks are all too real, Mr. Esposito said. He likened the situation to the UK crisis when then-Prime Minister Liz Truss’s unfunded tax cuts touched off a selloff in long-term bonds and forced her to resign. Esposito said he was not suggesting that the US was heading toward a “UK bond moment” but emphasized the need to remain laser-focused on managing the nation’s debt stock. He also spoke about the firm’s growing interest in digital assets, noting that Citadel Securities is expanding into cryptocurrency trading and has seen strong enthusiasm from institutional clients. Esposito said that crypto had reached the point of no return, and once clear regulations are in place, it is expected to become a major asset class.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap new cryptocurrency priced under $0.05, is gaining traction as a serious contender among the best cryptos to buy now. The project is selling at $0.03 and is gaining interest rapidly. Already, more than $9.9 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 11,700 people participating so far, who will witness the tokens appreciate to $0.035 as phase six begins. While ADA remains a staple in long-term portfolios due to its smart contract infrastructure and consistent development, some analysts argue that MUTM’s early positioning and projected tokenomics give it a realistic shot at hitting $2 before ADA reclaims that level. For those wondering what crypto to invest in, this new altcoin may be the breakout pick of the year. Cardano currently hovers around the $0.70 region. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Steam as a Rising DeFi Player Mutuum Finance is attracting even greater investor interest with its growing decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. Leveraging cutting-edge DeFi technology and crypto lending features, the platform has already raised over $9.9 million and built a community of 11,700 holders. Currently, MUTM tokens trade at $0.03, with the following presale round having the price rise to $0.035. The early investors will achieve returns of up to 100%, with the token debuting at a price of $0.06. Increasing Credibility with Certik Audit Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) groundbreaking lending infrastructure is reshaping decentralized markets while cementing its reputation in the DeFi space. A huge milestone was achieved with the successful conduct of a smart contract audit by Certik, a move that drastically boosts investor trust. With this seal of approval, Mutuum Finance is now among the top crypto projects to watch. Leaderboard Feature Boosts Community Engagement To further tap into its users, Mutuum Finance has introduced a leaderboard-based gamification featuring the top 50 token owners in real time. The leaders will receive bonus tokens, creating a fun, competitive way to drive more users up the board and remain there, combining social activity with DeFi strategy. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow As the platform gains traction Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 prize each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Many find the Buy-and-Distribute feature in the Mutuum Finance model one of its most outstanding traits. It works by purchasing tokens on the open market and giving them to people who take part in staking. Because the tokens support an active community, this strategy calls for investors who are in it for the long term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a standout in the DeFi space, backed by over $9.9 million raised and a growing community of 11,700 investors. Priced attractively under $0.05 during its presale, MUTM offers early participants the potential to see their investment double as prices move to $0.06 at launch. Supported by a Certik audit and innovative tokenomics like the Buy-and-Distribute feature Mutuum Finance combines security community incentives and cutting-edge technology to position itself for substantial growth. Investors looking for promising altcoins to buy now should explore MUTM before the next phase ignites its price surge.

According to market insiders, these new contracts track the price of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which has gathered over $72 billion in assets.

This setup lets local traders tap into Bitcoin’s price swings without touching foreign crypto platforms. Quarterly Contracts Linked To IBIT These Bitcoin futures will come out every three months, with the first batch due to expire in September 2025. Based on reports, only qualified investors will be allowed to trade on the MOEX. That means big banks, funds, and other approved financial groups can take part. Ordinary investors won’t get in on these deals. The Bank of Russia gave the green light in May 2025 for such products, but it still warns most firms to steer clear of direct crypto deals. The idea seems to be to let big players handle the risk in a controlled way. Local Settlements Keep Risk In Rubles Moscow Exchange decided to price the contracts in US dollars. However, when it’s time to settle, everything happens in rubles. This approach protects Russia from sudden swings in foreign markets. A trader can lock in a deal based on Bitcoin’s value in dollars, yet get paid in their home currency. It’s a setup that keeps money inside Russia even as it ties to a global crypto product. Some analysts see this as a smart middle ground. It lets Russia join the international cryptocurrency scene but without depending on overseas platforms. 🚀 Moscow Stock Exchange Launches #Bitcoin Futures Contracts will only be available to qualified investors, with the futures tied to the value of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, quoted in US dollars, and settled in Russian rubles.

It approved crypto-linked derivatives for qualified investors, but it hasn’t opened the door for everyone. Most banks and investment firms are told not to put their clients into direct Bitcoin trades. Instead, they can offer tools like these futures if they qualify. This reflects a watchful stance on digital assets. Authorities acknowledge the lure of big profits, but they also want to avoid big losses. By keeping access limited, they hope to keep any trouble contained.

The price of XRP is once again following the lead of Bitcoin, a pattern that has been seen time and again in the crypto market. As Bitcoin experiences a pullback, most altcoins, including XRP, tend to react in a similar way. And right now, things aren’t looking too bright for XRP on the daily chart. According to a recent technical analysis, XRP appears to be forming a bearish head and shoulders pattern — a classic price chart formation that often signals a possible drop ahead. The pattern consists of a left shoulder, a head, and a right shoulder, with a key support level known as the “neckline.” In XRP’s case, this neckline lies between $2.10 and $2.15. The price has started breaking below this zone, although a final confirmation is still needed. What’s Next For XRP Price? An analyst suggests that XRP is in the fifth and final stage of its upward movement. So far, the price has made four upward moves, with a few small dips along the way. Now, it seems to be climbing higher, believed to be in the fifth wave. According to this pattern, once the fifth wave wraps up, the market typically sees a significant price drop or correction. If the trend holds, XRP might soon reach new all-time highs. However, traders should tread carefully, as a major correction often follows when prices hit these new peaks. On a shorter time frame, XRP recently completed a small five-wave upward move, starting from its low in April. Since then, the market has been pulling back, creating what analysts refer to as a three-wave correction. This pullback isn’t finished yet. The expert predicts that XRP might dip a bit more before it resumes its upward trend. The correction zone is currently between $1.27 and $1.79. Ideally, the price could drop one last time to around $1.26 to $1.23 before kicking off a fresh rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 01:37:23

The company failed to persuade the court to discontinue key parts of a federal judge’s order requiring the iPhone maker to immediately open its lucrative App Store to more competition. This court decision stems from the ongoing antitrust litigation initiated by Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, challenging the phone company’s control over in-app payment systems. A three-judge appeals panel denied the phone maker’s appeal to stop an April 30 order prohibiting the company from levying a fee on in-app iPhone transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system. This decision was issued in a two-page decision issued late Thursday. The setback risks diverting billions of dollars in revenue from the tech firm while it overturns the order to rein in its commissions from e-commerce within apps on the iPhone. Apple vows to continue to battle Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers’ ruling Apple had sought to pause the app store order after it was handed down by the US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers. In a stinging rebuke, the judge found the Cupertino, California, company in civil contempt of court and recommended an independent investigation to determine whether a high-ranking executive lied while testifying at the tech giant’s trial in her Oakland, California, courtroom. This represented another turn of the screw in a legal fight that video game developer Epic Games started nearly five years ago when it began accusing Apple of turning the iPhone’s app store into a price-gouging monopoly. The antitrust case focused largely on the 15% to 30% commissions the tech firm charges on some transactions within iPhone apps. The system also prevents app makers from informing users about alternative payment options outside Apple’s own in-app payment system. The phone company vowed to continue to battle that decision in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, in the meantime, Gonzalez-Rogers’s order restraining Apple’s commissions on some in-app commerce will stand while possibly affecting its profits. Tim Sweeney refers to Apple’s fee on in-app iPhone transactions as “the long national nightmare” Following the appeals court rejection of Apple’s request, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney shared an X post claiming that the long national nightmare of the tech firm’s tax is over. He hoped next week’s WWDC would be the Apple-led celebration of freedom developers and users have long deserved. In response, the tech firm expressed disappointment with the court’s denying its request to stay. The company then promised to continue its appeal despite failing this time. The firm claimed it intends to ensure the app store stays an amazing opportunity for developers and a safe and trusted place for our users. It is worth noting that while Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with the tech firm, in her initial 2021 ruling in the same case, she ordered the company to allow apps to link to alternative payment systems. Various parties appealed the decision, including to the Supreme Court in 2024. But they ultimately did not overturn it. In response, the phone maker imposed a 12% to 27% commission, prompting Epic to beg Gonzalez-Rogers to hold Apple in contempt of her order. After a fresh round of hearings that unfolded over nine months from last year until this year, Gonzalez-Rogers dropped a legal hammer on Apple.

The company said that Kling brought in more than 100 million yuan ($14 million) in revenue every month in April and May. Kling is now one of the world’s highest-grossing AI video generation tools, demonstrating Kuaishou’s deep competitive advantages in generative AI . Kling AI operates by selling digital tokens, which it calls “inspiration credits.” Users buy credits and use them to make videos. This is in part due to the nature of the platform, which allows users to spend more credits to create higher-fidelity detailed videos or to produce more videos at lower fidelity with fewer credits. Today, Kuaishou sells 66 inspiration credits for one dollar. Top-quality videos cost around 100 credits apiece, while simpler videos are just 20 credits. This credit system makes service accessible and scalable to individual creators and businesses. Since its introduction a little more than a year ago, Kling has slowly attracted a devoted following of users, using a simple method of creating fast, fun video content. Solid profits catch investors off guard Kuaishou benefited from the strong showing of its social e-commerce and live commerce service Kling AI in surpassing market expectations when it reported its March-quarter financial results last week. The company’s fast-growing revenue from AI proved to be the standout performer, helping to send the stock up. Kuaishou’s shares surged after the announcement, indicating investor confidence in the company’s AI strategy. Kuaishou is one of several major Chinese internet companies turning to artificial intelligence as a new growth driver. Many companies are betting big on AI, believing that building new amenities driven by the technology will amass users in ways that generate revenue beyond their traditional platforms. Competition grows stronger in the AI video generation market The field of AI video generation is an increasingly crowded space. Meanwhile, large Chinese players like Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings have introduced or revamped their own AI video and creative tools this year. New startups are also entering the niche: AI startup Manus, for example, fairly recently demoed a product that appears to create videos on its own just from a written script. Internationally, companies like OpenAI have built tools for creating films, such as Sora, which helps automate video production. Runway AI, focusing on video production and editing, reached a $3 billion valuation in April. This proves a fast-rising, high-investing interest in AI on the video side worldwide. Kling is known for its token-based business model and steadily growing revenue. Its success also hints that there may be significant demand for AI-based tools that generate videos rapidly and inexpensively. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Besides, there was a break below a key rising channel with support at $2,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even dipped below the $2,500 support level. A low was formed at $2,394 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The next key resistance is near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,540 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,680 swing high to the $2,394 low. A clear move above the $2,540 resistance might send the price toward the $2,600 resistance. An upside break above the $2,600 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions.

Here’s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency. Solana Coin Days Destroyed Has Witnessed A Huge Spike In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD) indicator for Solana. A ‘coin day’ is a quantity that one token of the asset accumulates after having stayed dormant (that is, not being involved in any transaction activity) for one day. When a token carrying some number of coin days is moved, its coin days counter resets back to zero, and the coin days that it was carrying are said to be ‘destroyed.’ The CDD measures the total number of coin days being reset in this manner across the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Key Investors Double Down, Buy Another 79,000 BTC When the value of this indicator registers a spike, it means dormant coins are potentially on the move. Generally, this kind of trend is a sign of transaction activity from the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTHs are resolute entities who tend to hold for long periods, so they naturally hold a large number of coin days. As such, transfers from them usually result in the destruction of a significant number of coin days. Now, here is the chart for the Solana CDD shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value during the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana CDD has observed a large spike recently, suggesting the LTHs have made some transactions. In total, this spike involved the destruction of a massive 3.55 billion coin days. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator has seen only two spikes of a greater scale in 2025 so far. February 26th recorded a CDD value of 5.53 billion, while March 3rd saw a value of 4.64 billion. The LTHs usually only break their silence when they want to participate in selling, so movements from them can sometimes spell trouble for the cryptocurrency’s price. Large spikes like these can especially be worth taking note of, as they can point toward a possible shift in holder conviction . The aforementioned two larger spikes occurred one after the other, with a third, slightly smaller-scale spike following later in March. Therefore, it’s possible that more than a couple of diamond hands lost their belief during that period. Related Reading: Bitcoin ATH Fails To Hype Retail—Demand Is Actually Down It now remains to be seen whether the latest Solana CDD spike would also be followed up by another, or if this was just a one-off event. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $153.9, down more than 10% in the last week.

The influx of capital will be used to continue Momentum’s astronomical growth within the Sui DeFi ecosystem. This funding round follows a previous round of $10 million led by Varys Capital in March 2025. OKX Ventures recognizes Momentum’s position as a leading DEX on the Sui blockchain, with its innovative approach to liquidity management and ecosystem development. The investment aligns with OKX Ventures’ strategy of supporting promising infrastructure projects that contribute to blockchain ecosystem growth. Momentum has demonstrated strong technical execution and adoption metrics since its launch, positioning it as an important contributor to the expanding Sui Network ecosystem. “We are delighted to partner with and invest in Momentum, whose model will effectively enhance trading efficiency, boost liquidity depth and increase user rewards. This innovative approach has the potential to make a significant impact in the DeFi space, especially for the Sui ecosystem,” said Cass Cai, Head of KuCoin Ventures. Momentum has established itself as one of the fastest-growing liquidity engines on Sui, powered by its innovative ve(3,3) DEX model. It has achieved $3 billion in swap volume, $69 million in TVL, and has surpassed 420,000 users within just two months. In addition to the respected backers joining Momentum’s latest funding round, additional funding came from prominent industry leaders, including Coin Bureau, Monke Ventures, MultiChain Advisors (MCA), Crypto Lark (@TheCryptoLark) @theonlynom (Core Contributor at Bonk), and others. The latest funding builds on early strategic support from Circle Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and Sui Foundation, and positions Momentum as a leading force in the Sui ecosystem and one of the most highly anticipated projects in DeFi. Led by co-founder ChefWEN (@ChefMMT_X), the architect of MSafe and senior engineer of Meta’s Libra project, Momentum has established its security track record since its launch in May 2022. This is achieved through audited smart contracts, a robust review process, real-time monitoring and 24/7 support, ensuring minimal fund risk while earning and building trust with both retail and institutional investors. “Sui’s architecture sets a new standard for DeFi infrastructure – enabling near-instant transaction finality, scalable performance under heavy load. It takes a strong chain to make a DEX that delivers, and because of this, I’m confident in Momentum’s ability to build a DEX that delivers a seamless, CEX-like experience entirely on-chain,” said ChefWEN. Momentum’s groundbreaking ve(3,3) DEX incentivizes liquidity through vote-escrowed tokenomics, redistributing 100% of protocol revenue to stakers. This flywheel, token locking, voting and deeper liquidity pools set Momentum apart from the competition. About Momentum Momentum is a Move-native DEX built on Sui, offering trading, vesting, and treasury management for both retail and institutional participants. Backed by Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, OKX Ventures, Vary’s Capital, Selini Capital, Amber Group, Protagonist and Sui Foundation, it’s co-founded by ChefWEN, an early architect of Meta’s Libra project. Mirroring the success of Aerodrome which boasts 73% market share of Base on-chain volume, the groundbreaking ve(3,3) model is set to provide deeper liquidity with better rates for traders and higher earnings for liquidity providers.

One unexpected factor contributing to today’s decline is a public feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. The two high-profile figures exchanged some pretty sharp remarks online, creating a surprising amount of tension. Musk took aim at Trump’s past controversies and even called for his impeachment, while Trump responded with strong comments about the economy. While this drama might seem like just another day in the headlines, it has definitely made investors nervous and sent ripples through both traditional and crypto markets. Stock markets opened carefully today, which made traders bet that cryptocurrency prices will keep falling. More traders are opening short positions, which is putting extra pressure on the market and causing prices to drop further. Bitcoin Drops, Altcoins Follow Currently, the global cryptocurrency market cap is sitting at $3.18 trillion, reflecting a 3.42% drop in the last 24 hours. The Fear & Greed Index is at 46, showing a neutral sentiment in the market, while the Altcoin Season Index is low at 23 out of 100. Bitcoin is trading at $101,895 after a 2.77% decrease in the last 24 hours. Ethereum has fallen to $2,424, down nearly 7%, while Solana is priced at $145.39 after a drop of over 5%. XRP has slipped to $2.10, and Dogecoin has taken one of the hardest hits, plummeting nearly 9% to $0.1720. Despite this downturn, analysts believe that this sharp reaction might be short-lived. The tensions between Musk and Trump could ease up soon, which might help stabilize prices. Bitcoin’s crucial support zone is between $100,700 and $98,000. If the market can hold above this range, it may enter a phase of sideways trading before trying to bounce back.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 02:07:48

He also noted that his general bias on AI is that it’s dangerous, and there will be positive and negative consequences regardless of which country comes out on top. Karp has always championed U.S. AI dominance, suggesting in January that the country needs to put more effort into developing more advanced AI models. He argued that the rise of competing artificial intelligence models, such as China’s DeepSeek, is a sign that the U.S. needs to work quickly to develop advanced AI. The entrepreneur also revealed Palantir’s commitment to equipping and enhancing U.S. defense interests in a recent letter to shareholders. Palantir aims to improve AI in the U.S. Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar says the US is in a winner-take-all AI arms race and war with China and DeepSeek has made it clear that ""the time to mobilize has come"" pic.twitter.com/tHLFVFLXpI — Tsarathustra (@tsarnick) February 3, 2025 The tech CEO also mentioned Thursday that the U.S. currently has a leg up in the AI race, and Palantir is leading the way in making companies more secure and efficient with its tools. He said that the company’s growth in recent years has stemmed from ballooning demand for AI solutions, where he agreed Palantir is leading the charge and is poised to transform the way American companies run. “There is no economy in the world with this kind of corporate leadership which is willing to pivot, which understands technologies, which is willing to look at new things, but also has deep domain expertise. Our allies in the West, in Europe, are going to have to learn from us.” -Alex Karp, Palantir CEO. The company’s shares outperformed in 2024 and have continued climbing in 20225 as investors bet on their software and work with key government contractors and agencies. Shares of the Denver-based data analytics and AI software firm are up 74% this year, but investors have to shell out on a higher earning multiple than its tech peers. The tech billionaire said Thursday in response that those who like the firm’s price can exit. He also maintained that Palantir is not surveilling Americans in response to recent allegations that the company is helping the Trump administration gather data on Americans. The President signed an order in March that directed federal agencies to remove unnecessary barriers to data consolidation. The New York Times also reported last week that the tech company expanded the reach of its artificial intelligence product within the U.S. government, which could track Americans’ information, from medical to financial. Warren Davidson, Senator for Ohio, said she hopes to turn Palantir’s power off fundamentally. She argued that the power of combining all information on an individual into one database creates a digital ID and that tech can be abused.

Three events last month also confirmed that the rivalry between the U.S. and China over artificial intelligence has entered a new and more dangerous phase. The U.S. began with a May 8 Senate hearing where lawmakers aired concerns that the country’s lead over China was eroding fast. A sweeping U.S. ban on Huawei’s Ascend AI chips followed. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) warned that using the Chinese firm’s AI chips could trigger criminal penalties under U.S. export control laws. The agency also clarified that Huawei’s Ascend processors, specifically the 910B, 910C, and 910D, are subject to strict export controls because they are believed to be designed or manufactured using U.S.-origin technology. Last month’s last event happened when Trump visited the Middle East to sign expansive AI chip deals with key regional allies. The agreement included building the largest AI campus in Abu Dhabi, giving the UAE access to U.S. advanced AI chips.

This decision not only puts California on the same path as crypto-forward states like Colorado and Utah but also positions it as a national leader in digital asset adoption. The bill outlines a multi-year pilot starting in 2026, overseen by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. This government-led shift could open the door for massive blockchain integrations in public infrastructure.Among these projects, Qubetics ($TICS) is commanding growing attention as a project built not only to meet current blockchain challenges but also to outperform legacy solutions. While competitors still battle limitations in cost, complexity, and cross-border accessibility, Qubetics is advancing with real-world applications and decentralized architecture. Its utility is particularly impactful in the domain of borderless transactions, offering a seamless experience for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. For those researching the best cryptos to buy today, Qubetics is quickly becoming a standout entry point backed by confirmed metrics and active adoption. This legislative momentum coincides with a rising wave of optimism across crypto markets. Key tokens such as XRP and NEAR Protocol have already started reacting to broader trends, with XRP climbing for five straight sessions and NEAR signaling a short-term recovery. As regulatory barriers loosen and institutional sentiment improves, these developments have created fertile ground for renewed interest in scalable and utility-driven crypto projects. Qubetics: Redefining Global Utility Through Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics introduces a transformative infrastructure built to eliminate friction in global payments. Its native platform supports frictionless cross-border transactions, bypassing slow intermediaries and excessive fees. For international consultants, merchants, freelancers, and global teams, this functionality brings unprecedented speed and reliability to everyday financial interactions. Built with interoperability and compliance in mind, the protocol ensures transparent settlement while protecting data integrity and wallet security. Qubetics streamlines the complexity often associated with multi-jurisdictional crypto payments. Users can complete international transfers in seconds, access multiple currencies, and settle in native or fiat tokens—without relying on centralized banking rails. This solution stands in stark contrast to many legacy platforms still tied to outdated infrastructure and compliance bottlenecks. Qubetics Crypto Presale Accelerates Toward Finality Qubetics has officially entered Stage 37—the final chapter of its public token sale. With the crypto presale price set at $0.3370 and the listing price locked at $0.40, current participants are aligned for an instant 20% value increase upon market launch. Over $17.7 million has been secured so far, and more than 515 million $TICS tokens have been distributed. The token holder base has now surpassed 27,500—a sign of widespread adoption and credibility even before centralized exchange listing. The strategic tokenomics revamp earlier this quarter cut the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion. Public allocation was increased to 38.55%, enhancing decentralization and giving the community meaningful control in governance. Unlike speculative ventures that inflate supply for short-term gain, Qubetics has introduced structural scarcity from the outset. For those evaluating short-term strategies, the numbers speak for themselves. A $5,000 contribution at the current presale rate yields 14,810 $TICS tokens. At listing, this stack is immediately valued at $5,925. These metrics are based on confirmed sale terms—not hypothetical forecasts—making Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy today for those seeking defined entry points with transparent upside potential. As supply diminishes and demand intensifies, the chance to lock in this final-stage presale position is closing fast. Qubetics is currently categorized among the best cryptos to buy today by analysts tracking presale momentum, decentralized architecture, and infrastructure utility. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and ETF Momentum Drive Market Attention XRP is undergoing a strategic resurgence. Following its recent 10% rebound from May’s lows, XRP has now posted five consecutive bullish sessions, trading at approximately $2.26. The token is consolidating within a key wedge formation between $2.19 and $2.26, with immediate resistance identified at $2.50. Analysts suggest that a break above this threshold could unlock higher levels of bullish continuation. What’s fueling this renewed interest? Primarily, it’s regulatory clarity. The conclusion of Ripple’s legal conflict with the SEC reaffirmed XRP’s non-security status in the U.S., providing a long-awaited green light for institutional and retail engagement. Added to this is growing speculation around the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF, with a ruling expected by June 17. If greenlit, the ETF could open billions in inflows, reinforcing XRP’s position among the best cryptos to buy today. Market sentiment has also turned increasingly positive. On-chain data shows significant whale accumulation between $2.20 and $2.40, and funding rates in perpetual futures remain positive. Combined with strategic partnerships and upcoming tokenization initiatives, XRP continues to build a foundation of support beneath its price action. XRP has successfully overcome major regulatory hurdles and is positioned for broader institutional adoption. These developments, supported by consistent chart structure and upcoming catalysts, confirm its status as one of the best cryptos to buy today. NEAR Protocol: Momentum Builds as Key Indicators Flip Bullish NEAR Protocol is slowly climbing back after finding a local bottom at $2.25. It currently trades near $2.53, above the 9-period EMA ($2.48), which is often an early signal of short-term recovery. Resistance remains at the 50-day SMA around $2.63, while stronger ceilings sit at $2.73. Although the broader trend faces pressure, technical indicators such as a rising RSI (now at 53) and a bullish MACD crossover suggest growing buying strength. The protocol’s momentum follows a clear setup. A successful break above $2.63 could usher in new bullish sentiment, potentially positioning NEAR for another run toward previous highs. Support levels are currently anchored at $2.44 and $2.25, forming a tight trading band that allows for tactical accumulation. NEAR continues to appeal due to its sharded architecture and developer-centric platform. It enables scalable dApps with low latency and has cultivated a robust ecosystem for smart contract deployment. These strengths, combined with current price structure, make NEAR Protocol one of the best cryptos to buy today, especially for those seeking undervalued Layer 1 opportunities. NEAR Protocol displays a strong technical setup, underpinned by resilient architecture and a loyal builder base. These elements make it a compelling choice for community members seeking the best cryptos to buy today before larger momentum returns. Final Thoughts Legislative action from California has sent a strong signal: digital assets are not just being tolerated—they’re being integrated. This policy tailwind is driving renewed enthusiasm toward technically sound, utility-focused crypto projects with real-world application. Qubetics exemplifies this new standard. From its high-utility cross-border infrastructure to its nearly complete presale phase, the $TICS token offers a compelling mix of short-term upside and long-term sustainability. Meanwhile, XRP’s regulatory clarity and potential ETF catalyst place it on a decisive path, and NEAR Protocol’s resilient indicators suggest a building recovery. For serious participants, the best cryptos to buy today are those that offer transparent metrics, scalable architecture, and time-sensitive access. Qubetics, XRP, and NEAR meet that criteria—and the window to engage at current levels is narrowing quickly.

Qubetics, XRP, and NEAR Protocol are among the most promising due to their momentum, structural strengths, and alignment with broader market catalysts. Why is Qubetics gaining traction in today’s crypto market? Qubetics is advancing in real-world utility with cross-border transaction support and has reached the final stage of its crypto presale with strong participation. Is XRP a good crypto to buy today based on recent trends? Yes. XRP benefits from legal clarity, ETF speculation, and strong accumulation trends, making it one of the top cryptos to monitor right now. What makes NEAR Protocol one of the best cryptos to buy today? NEAR Protocol has shown a bullish crossover in MACD, improved RSI, and technical setups that support near-term recovery potential. How much time is left in the Qubetics presale? Qubetics is currently in Stage 37—the final phase—with limited supply remaining. Early buyers still have a short window to participate before listing.

The price is now consolidating and might aim for a recovery wave above the $2.120 resistance. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.20 zone. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.192 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.120 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips To Support XRP price failed to gain pace for a move above the $2.220 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.2150 and $0.2120 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.192 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Finally, the price tested the $2.050 zone. It is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.281 swing high to the $2.056 low. The price is now trading below $2.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level. The next resistance is $2.1750. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.281 swing high to the $2.056 low. A clear move above the $2.1750 resistance might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance or even $2.2420 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.250. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.15 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.050 level. The next major support is near the $2.020 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.020 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.00 support. The next major support sits near the $1.920 zone.

Now D.C. is moving to take ownership of the funds via the suit. Fake IT workers allegedly sending crypto to North Korea “For years, North Korea has exploited global remote IT contracting and cryptocurrency ecosystems to evade U.S. sanctions and bankroll its weapons programs,” Sue J. Bai, head of the DOJ’s National Security Division, is quoted as saying in the government press release.According to the DOJ, an FBI investigation is said to have revealed a “massive campaign” involving remote IT workers infiltrating U.S. businesses with fraudulent identities, or identities stolen from American citizens. “These tactics hid the North Koreans’ true location and identities, causing unwitting employers to hire them and pay them a salary, often in stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT,” the release notes.To obfuscate the money and send funds back to North Korea, workers allegedly used the following tactics: Fake accounts Micro-transactions Chain-hopping/Token-swapping Hiding value in NFTs (non-fungible tokens) Using U.S.-based accounts to “legitimize” activity Crypto mixing US government use of crypto, fiat also criticized U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro said of the forfeiture action: “Crime may pay in other countries but that’s not how it works here,” noting that “We will halt your progress, strike back, and take hold of any proceeds you obtained illegally.”Some might take issue with Pirro about that. And with Sue J. Bai about the bankrolling of weapons programs. In recent years, hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency have been funneled to “socially acceptable” U.S.-backed military initiatives in Ukraine, including for “lethal equipment.” Elliptic data on Ukraine government’s cryptocurrency expenditures from 2022. Source: Elliptic . Billions in fiat currency have been sent to the Israeli military, as Gazans are killed and ousted from their homes, while the U.S. president backing this bankroll has a controversial, influence-cashgrab memecoin released while in office. Anyway one slices it, it is a messy situation, where “licit” uses of crypto seem to depend more on the power and geopolitical standing of the user, than they do ethics. None of this justifying any ostensible North Korean terror.Regardless, the DOJ release summarizes: “Today’s forfeiture action follows the Department’s announcement of two federal indictments charging Sim for allegedly conspiring (1) with North Korean IT workers to generate revenue through illegal employment at companies in the United States and abroad; and (2) with over-the-counter cryptocurrency traders to use stolen funds to buy goods for North Korea.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|North Korea|USA|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|SPONSORED|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-06 02:30:23

While we often see Bitcoin ATMs popping up in private businesses or dedicated crypto hubs, a national postal service entering the game is certainly big news. This is exactly what’s happening in Romania, marking a significant step for digital finance availability across the country. The launch of a Romania Bitcoin ATM within the traditional postal network signals a fascinating convergence of old and new. The Revolutionary Arrival of the Romania Bitcoin ATM Romania’s national postal service, known as Poșta Română, has officially installed its very first Bitcoin ATM. This isn’t just a one-off experiment; it’s part of a broader strategy to modernize their services and improve digital access for citizens across Romania. The inaugural machine has been placed in the city of Tulcea, a move that brings cryptocurrency convenience to a specific regional hub before potential expansion. This initiative highlights Poșta Română’s commitment to evolving with the times. For decades, postal services have been integral parts of communities, handling everything from mail delivery to financial services like money orders and bill payments. By integrating a Bitcoin ATM, they are positioning themselves as relevant players in the burgeoning digital economy, making it easier for Romanians to buy and sell Bitcoin using cash. Poșta Română Bitcoin: A Strategic Modernization Move Why would a national postal service get involved with Bitcoin? The decision by Poșta Română to launch a Poșta Română Bitcoin service through ATMs is primarily driven by the need for modernization and expanding digital inclusion. In many countries, postal networks have extensive reach, often serving remote areas or populations less familiar with online banking or digital wallets. Leveraging this existing infrastructure provides a unique pathway to introduce cryptocurrency access to a wider demographic. This move can be seen as a strategic response to changing consumer habits and technological advancements. By offering cryptocurrency services, Poșta Română aims to: Enhance Service Portfolio: Add a modern, in-demand financial service. Increase Foot Traffic: Attract new customers interested in crypto. Promote Digital Literacy: Help citizens become more comfortable with digital assets. Support Financial Inclusion: Provide access points for those who may not have easy access to online crypto exchanges. The integration of Bitcoin ATMs into postal branches leverages trust and familiarity associated with a long-standing public institution, potentially lowering the barrier to entry for individuals curious about cryptocurrency but hesitant to use online platforms. The Crucial Partnership with Bitcoin Romania This significant step for Poșta Română is made possible through a partnership with Bitcoin Romania (BTR). Bitcoin Romania is a well-established cryptocurrency exchange and ATM operator within the country. They bring the necessary technical expertise, infrastructure, and regulatory understanding required to operate Bitcoin ATMs effectively and compliantly. Partnerships like this are essential for traditional institutions venturing into the crypto space. Bitcoin Romania’s role likely includes: Providing and maintaining the ATM hardware. Handling the technical backend for transactions. Ensuring compliance with Romanian financial regulations regarding cryptocurrency. Managing the liquidity for the ATM (ensuring there’s enough cash and crypto available). This collaboration allows Poșta Română to quickly deploy crypto services without building the entire technical stack from scratch, while Bitcoin Romania expands its network and reaches new customer segments through the postal service’s extensive presence. Focus on the Tulcea Bitcoin ATM and Future Expansion The initial focus is on the Tulcea Bitcoin ATM . Tulcea, located in southeastern Romania, serves as an important administrative and economic center, particularly for the Danube Delta region. Launching the first ATM here could be a strategic choice to test the service’s viability and public reception in a specific regional market before scaling up. While the exact timeline and specific locations for future expansion haven’t been detailed publicly, the stated intention is to roll out more Bitcoin ATMs in other cities across Romania. This phased approach allows Poșta Română and Bitcoin Romania to learn from the Tulcea launch, optimize operations, and address any challenges that arise before a wider deployment. The potential for a nationwide network of Bitcoin ATMs within postal branches could dramatically change the landscape for cryptocurrency access in Romania. What This Means for Crypto Adoption Romania The launch of a national postal service-backed Bitcoin ATM is a strong indicator of growing Crypto Adoption Romania . It signals that cryptocurrency is moving from being a niche interest to gaining recognition and integration within mainstream public services. This development can have several positive impacts: Increased Awareness: The presence of ATMs in familiar locations like post offices raises public awareness about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Improved Accessibility: Provides a straightforward, often cash-based, method for buying/selling Bitcoin, complementing online options. Potential for Trust Building: Association with a national institution may lend an air of legitimacy and security for newcomers. Setting a Precedent: Could encourage other traditional Romanian institutions to explore crypto-related services. While Romania already has a developing crypto ecosystem, this move by a state-owned entity represents a significant endorsement and infrastructure boost that could accelerate wider adoption. Navigating Access: Benefits and Potential Challenges The introduction of Bitcoin ATMs through Poșta Română offers clear benefits but also presents potential challenges. Benefits: Convenience: Easy access points for buying/selling Bitcoin, often available during standard business hours. Simplicity: ATMs typically offer a user-friendly interface compared to complex online exchanges. Cash Transactions: Facilitates entry into crypto for individuals who prefer using cash or have limited access to traditional banking/online payment methods. Physical Presence: Offers a tangible point of contact and potentially in-person assistance, which can be reassuring for first-time users. Potential Challenges: Fees: Bitcoin ATM transactions often come with higher fees compared to online exchanges due to operational costs. Transaction Limits: ATMs may have daily or per-transaction limits. Privacy Concerns: Depending on local regulations, using an ATM might require identity verification (KYC/AML procedures). Technical Issues: ATMs can experience technical malfunctions or require maintenance. Public Education: Ensuring the general public understands how to use the ATMs and the basics of cryptocurrency is crucial. Despite potential hurdles, the overall impact is likely positive for expanding access and awareness. How Can Romanians Use the New Bitcoin ATM? For residents near the Tulcea location, using the new Tulcea Bitcoin ATM is designed to be relatively straightforward. While specific steps can vary slightly by machine operator (in this case, Bitcoin Romania), the general process typically involves: Verification: Depending on the transaction amount and local regulations, you may need to verify your identity using a phone number, ID card, or passport. Selecting Action: Choose whether you want to buy or sell Bitcoin. Providing Wallet Address (for buying): If buying, you’ll need a Bitcoin wallet. You can often scan your wallet’s QR code using the ATM’s scanner. Inserting Cash (for buying): Insert the desired amount of Romanian Lei (RON) into the machine. Confirming Transaction: Review the transaction details (amount, price, fee) and confirm. The Bitcoin will be sent to your wallet. Receiving Cash (for selling): If selling, you’ll typically send Bitcoin from your wallet to the ATM’s address, wait for confirmation, and then the machine will dispense cash. It’s always advisable to check the specific instructions displayed on the ATM screen and be aware of the current exchange rate and fees before completing a transaction. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Digital Inclusion The launch of the first Romania Bitcoin ATM by the national postal service, Poșta Română, in partnership with Bitcoin Romania, is a significant and revolutionary development. Placing a Poșta Română Bitcoin service in a physical, accessible location like a post office in Tulcea makes cryptocurrency less abstract and more attainable for the average citizen. This move is a clear signal of increasing Crypto Adoption Romania and a forward-thinking approach by a traditional institution seeking modernization. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of increased access, awareness, and financial inclusion are substantial. As Poșta Română plans to expand this network, we could see a notable shift in how Romanians interact with and utilize digital currencies, solidifying the country’s position in the evolving global crypto landscape.

This development highlights the growing complexities surrounding branding and intellectual property within the decentralized finance space. What is the TRUMP Wallet Controversy All About? The controversy centers on the alleged development of a crypto wallet application branded as the “$TRUMP Wallet”. While details about the wallet’s specific features or intended purpose remain somewhat scarce in public reports, its name clearly leverages the widely recognized “TRUMP” brand. The developer behind this project is identified as Fight Fight Fight LLC. The situation gained further attention when it was reported that Magic Eden, a prominent NFT marketplace, was planning to collaborate on the launch of this wallet. The core issue appears to be whether this project had the authorization or endorsement of the Trump family or their associated business entities, including World Liberty Financial. World Liberty Financial Steps In: The Cease and Desist According to reports, World Liberty Financial has issued a cease-and-desist letter directly to Fight Fight Fight LLC. This legal instrument is a formal demand to stop a specific action – in this case, the development and presumably the planned launch and marketing of the “$TRUMP Wallet”. Key aspects of the reported cease-and-desist letter likely include: A demand to immediately halt all development, marketing, and promotional activities related to the “$TRUMP Wallet”. An assertion that the use of the “TRUMP” name or related likenesses is unauthorized and infringes upon intellectual property rights held by the Trump family or their entities. A warning of potential legal consequences if the demands are not met. The letter was also reportedly sent to Magic Eden, presumably to inform them of the dispute and warn them against proceeding with any collaboration or launch related to the unauthorized wallet. The Trump Family’s Stance on Trump Crypto Products This isn’t the first time the Trump family has addressed products leveraging their name in the crypto or digital asset space. Both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have previously issued public statements clarifying which products are officially associated with them and which are not. Specifically regarding the “$TRUMP Wallet”, Donald Trump Jr. reportedly stated that it was not an official Trump product. Eric Trump went further, warning of possible legal action against unauthorized uses of the family’s brand. This consistent stance reinforces the message that any product or service using the Trump name in the crypto realm without explicit, official endorsement is likely doing so without permission and potentially facing legal challenges. This makes discerning official Trump crypto initiatives from unofficial ones crucial for users and investors. Implications for DeFi Project Developers and Users The dispute between World Liberty Financial and the developers of the “$TRUMP Wallet” serves as a significant case study for the broader DeFi project landscape. It highlights several critical implications: Intellectual Property Risks: Developers must be extremely cautious when using or referencing prominent names, brands, or likenesses. Assuming that a name is fair game because it’s associated with a public figure, especially one actively involved in related ventures (like WLFI), is a risky proposition. Due Diligence for Platforms: Platforms like Magic Eden also face risks. Collaborating on or listing products without verifying the necessary rights and permissions can expose them to legal challenges from the legitimate brand owners. User Confusion and Risk: Unauthorized projects create confusion for users. They may mistakenly believe an unofficial product is endorsed, potentially leading to financial loss or exposure to scams. Users interested in official ventures should always seek verification from the official sources. This incident underscores the need for clear legal frameworks and robust due diligence processes within the fast-evolving DeFi space. Navigating Crypto Legal Action: Challenges and Lessons Legal disputes in the crypto world, often involving intellectual property or unauthorized use of branding, present unique challenges. The decentralized nature of some projects, the global reach of the internet, and the pseudonymous nature of participants can complicate enforcement. However, this case demonstrates that traditional legal tools like cease-and-desist letters are still being employed to protect established brands. For developers, the lesson is clear: obtain proper licenses or permissions before using copyrighted or trademarked material. For users, the actionable insight is to verify the legitimacy and official endorsement of any product, especially those leveraging well-known names or brands, before investing time or money. Examples of similar challenges exist across various industries where new technologies intersect with established branding and IP law. The outcome of this specific Crypto legal action will likely provide further clarity on how such disputes are handled within the digital asset ecosystem. In summary, World Liberty Financial’s reported cease-and-desist against the $TRUMP Wallet developer underscores the critical importance of intellectual property rights in the crypto space. As the Trump family’s official DeFi project asserts its position, this legal challenge serves as a stark reminder for developers and users alike to prioritize legitimacy and verification in the complex world of branded digital assets.

He contends that Ripple has found “the only route left by the Judge” by using an institutional structure that moves XRP through regulated intermediaries instead of selling it directly to investors. “It’s not just clever,” he wrote. “It’s compliant by design.” The setup in question was revealed in a recent Form 6-K filing by Webus, which outlined the creation of an XRP Treasury to be managed by Samara Alpha, an SEC-registered investment adviser. The program delegates full control of up to $300 million in XRP to Samara under a phased, regulated structure. While the filing stops short of stating where the XRP will come from, Darkhorse argues the intent is clear: Ripple can legally sell XRP to an SEC-facing intermediary like Samara, which then allocates it to a corporate client like Webus — all without violating the standing injunction. Related Reading: The Worst Case For XRP This Cycle? Just A Giga Rally To $19, Says Analyst “Ripple is enjoined from direct institutional sales without SEC clearance,” Darkhorse explained. “The workaround? Sell to regulated intermediaries (like Samara on behalf of Webus) with treasury agreements that are SEC-transparent and non-retail facing. It’s structured — not casual.” Is Ripple Bypassing The XRP Injunction? Veteran XRP commentator Jay Nisbett pushed back. “I just don’t see any of this as clever or bypassing anything — it’s just adoption,” he replied. Nisbett asserted that Ripple and Webus are not partners, that Webus is simply acquiring XRP like any other participant on the secondary market, and that the asset itself “has been ruled to be not a security in this context.” He added that holding XRP on a balance sheet isn’t the same as triggering a securities transaction. Darkhorse issued a sharp rebuttal. “You’re missing the mechanism,” he told Nisbett, laying out his argument in four parts. First, he emphasized that Webus did not just announce an intent to buy on the open market. “Webus filed via Form 6-K to publicly document a $300M XRP Treasury but not to simply buy on open markets. They delegated management to ‘Samara Alpha,’ an SEC-registered investment adviser, under a phased, regulated structure.” Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $21 This Bull Cycle With 1.618 Fib Level As Next Target Second, he argued that the core issue is Ripple’s inability to sell directly to institutions, which is where the intermediary comes in. “This structure is about creating compliant distance,” he wrote. “It’s not Ripple handing XRP to an investor — it’s routing via an SEC-registered manager who takes custody and executes under regulatory supervision.” Third, Darkhorse disputed Nisbett’s assertion that there’s no relationship between Ripple and Webus. “Check RippleNet corridors and prior Asia-Pacific mobility pilot cases,” he wrote. “Their ties to Ripple’s network and XRPL liquidity routes go back years. Just because it wasn’t front-page news doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.” Finally, he challenged the notion that Webus’s XRP holdings are merely passive. “ ‘Just holding on balance sheet’ is not automatic exemption,” he argued. “This is treasury deployment, not idle custody. The fact that Webus structured this through a delegated SEC-facing manager says they do consider XRP institutional risk a legal factor.” He concluded bluntly: “This isn’t Ripple dumping tokens on exchanges. It’s creating institutional conduits that comply while navigating around the injunction bottleneck.” Despite the detailed structure and SEC-facing components, Nisbett remained unmoved. “No I get what you’re saying… I just disagree in that mechanism being an unexpected event,” he wrote. “It’s just a natural maturation of the market and the market reacting to legislation hurdles as the market always has and will.” With Ripple still bound by Judge Torres’s 2024 permanent injunction — which prohibits direct institutional XRP sales unless registered — the debate hinges on whether the Webus structure constitutes indirect circumvention or lawful evolution. The SEC has yet to comment, and the court recently denied the parties’ request to vacate the injunction, calling it “procedurally improper.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.1989.

Led by prominent figures like Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy, this trend signaled a new era of institutional interest and confidence in digital assets. However, as these companies acquired Bitcoin, often using leverage or issuing debt, a wave of concern emerged: were these corporate Bitcoin buyers taking on excessive Corporate Debt that could lead to instability or forced selling? According to Alex Thorne, head of research at Galaxy Digital, these concerns about debt levels among companies holding Corporate Bitcoin might be largely overblown. His perspective offers a crucial counterpoint to the prevailing anxiety, suggesting that a deeper look at the financials reveals a more stable picture than many assume. Are Corporate Bitcoin Buyers Drowning in Debt? Analyzing the Concerns When companies like MicroStrategy or others began significant Bitcoin Treasury strategies, the market reaction was mixed. While many celebrated the institutional validation, others pointed to the methods used for financing these purchases, particularly the issuance of debt. The primary fears revolved around: Liquidity Risk: If Bitcoin prices dropped significantly, could these companies meet their debt obligations or margin calls? Forced Selling: A severe market downturn might force companies to sell their Bitcoin holdings at a loss to service debt, creating downward pressure on the market. Balance Sheet Health: High debt levels could weaken the company’s overall financial position, impacting its core business and stock value. Interest Rate Risk: Rising interest rates could make servicing existing variable-rate debt more expensive and future refinancing more difficult. These are valid concerns in isolation, but Thorne’s analysis suggests they may not tell the whole story when applied to the specific companies involved in Corporate Bitcoin adoption. Understanding the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Debt Maturity Thorne highlights a key factor often overlooked in the debt panic: the maturity profile of the debt. He stated that if you look at the debt levels of companies buying Bitcoin, it’s not as excessive as one might think, with most of this debt not falling due within the next two years. This is a critical point. Debt that matures far in the future provides a company with significant breathing room. This allows companies with a Bitcoin Treasury to: Ride out short-term market volatility in Bitcoin. Generate operational cash flow from their core business to service interest payments. Strategically plan for refinancing or repayment well in advance of the due date. Benefit from potential future appreciation in Bitcoin’s value before debt needs to be addressed. It implies that the immediate risk of a debt-induced forced sale of Corporate Bitcoin is relatively low for many major holders, at least in the near term. MicroStrategy and Beyond: Examples of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption While several companies have adopted Bitcoin Adoption strategies, MicroStrategy is arguably the most prominent example. Their aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin, financed significantly through convertible notes and secured debt, often puts them at the center of this debt discussion. Let’s consider MicroStrategy ‘s approach: They have issued various forms of debt specifically to acquire Bitcoin. A significant portion of this debt is long-term, such as convertible senior notes maturing in 2025, 2027, and beyond. They also utilized Bitcoin-backed secured debt, which has specific loan-to-value thresholds but provides flexibility. Their core business (business intelligence software) continues to generate revenue, providing a source of funds independent of their Bitcoin holdings. While MicroStrategy ‘s strategy is unique in its scale and financing methods, other companies engaged in Bitcoin Adoption may have different debt structures or hold Bitcoin as a smaller percentage of their overall assets. Evaluating each company individually is crucial. Analyzing Corporate Debt Structures: Not All Debt is Equal The type of debt matters. Companies acquiring Corporate Bitcoin have used various instruments: Convertible Notes: These are unsecured debt that can be converted into equity under certain conditions. They often carry lower interest rates but can dilute shareholders if converted. Secured Term Loans: Debt backed by specific assets, in some cases, the Bitcoin itself. These loans have covenants (like loan-to-value ratios) that, if breached, could trigger margin calls or require additional collateral. Senior Unsecured Notes: Standard corporate bonds not backed by specific assets, relying on the company’s overall creditworthiness. Thorne’s point about maturity applies across these types. Long-dated debt, regardless of structure, pushes the refinancing or repayment risk further into the future, providing a buffer against immediate market downturns impacting the Bitcoin Treasury . What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Adoption? The narrative around Corporate Debt and Bitcoin is important for the future of Bitcoin Adoption . If fears of debt-fueled collapses were realized, it could significantly deter other companies from adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. However, if, as Thorne suggests, the current debt structures are manageable and the risks are being effectively navigated, it could pave the way for more mainstream corporate interest. Successful management of these strategies by pioneers like MicroStrategy provides a potential blueprint and builds confidence. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers What should you take away from this analysis? Look Beyond Headlines: Don’t rely solely on sensational headlines about corporate debt. Investigate the specific companies. Analyze Debt Maturity: Understand when their significant debt tranches are due. Near-term maturities pose higher immediate risk than long-term ones. Evaluate Core Business: Assess the health and cash flow generation of the company’s primary operations, as this is the first line of defense for servicing debt. Understand Debt Structure: Different debt types have different risks and covenants. Consider the Strategic Long Game: Companies adopting Bitcoin Treasury strategies often view Bitcoin as a long-term hedge or growth asset, not just a short-term trade. While risks always exist in finance and volatile assets like Bitcoin, the idea that major corporate holders are on the verge of a debt-induced crisis appears, based on expert analysis, to be significantly exaggerated for now. Summary: Debt Concerns Overblown, But Due Diligence Remains Key In conclusion, the concerns surrounding Corporate Debt taken on by companies pursuing a Bitcoin Treasury strategy seem largely overblown, particularly regarding immediate risks. Expert analysis points to manageable debt levels and, crucially, debt maturity schedules that extend well into the future, providing a buffer against short-term Bitcoin price volatility. While prominent examples like MicroStrategy have used leverage, their specific financial structures and the long-term view on Bitcoin Adoption suggest that a debt-fueled collapse is not an imminent threat for most major players. However, this does not negate the need for investors and observers to conduct their own due diligence and understand the specific financial health and debt obligations of individual companies holding Corporate Bitcoin .

Speaking Thursday at the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco , Khosrowshahi said the company is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins for operational use. “I think stablecoins are one of the more interesting instantiations of crypto that have a practical benefit beyond being a store of value,” Khosrowshahi said. Uber was an early member of the Diem Association (formerly Libra), joining in 2019 to support Meta’s now-defunct stablecoin initiative aimed at reshaping global payments. “You can have your opinions on Bitcoin, it’s a proven commodity, and people differ on where it’s going. But stablecoins seems quite promising, especially for global companies moving money around internationally,” Khosrowshahi continued on Thursday. “That’s super interesting to us, and we’re definitely going to take a look.” The remarks echo what Khosrowshahi told CNBC in September 2021 , when he said Uber would “look into” accepting BTC and other cryptocurrencies as payment. At the time, he dismissed any plans to put crypto on the company’s balance sheet, saying, “We are going to keep our cash safe.” Later, in February 2022, Khosrowshahi told Bloomberg that the company would “absolutely” accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment at “some point” in the future, but emphasized that the time wasn’t right yet. “We’re having conversations all the time,” Khosrowshahi said at the time. “As the exchange mechanism becomes less expensive and becomes more environmentally friendly, I think you will see us leaning into crypto a little bit more.” When he made crypto-related comments in 2021, BTC traded flat for the next three months. However, his February 2022 comments came weeks before the beginning of an industry-shaking major market correction, which kicked off later that spring.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-06 03:01:19

This decision, confirmed by Anthropic Co-founder and Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan, stems largely from recent rumors suggesting that OpenAI , Anthropic’s primary competitor, is on the verge of acquiring Windsurf . Why Anthropic Cut Windsurf Access Speaking at TC Sessions: AI 2025, Jared Kaplan clarified Anthropic’s position. He stated that the company is focused on enabling customers with whom they foresee sustainable, long-term relationships. The prospect of selling access to their valuable Claude AI models to a competitor like OpenAI through a third party like Windsurf was, in Kaplan’s words, ‘odd’. This comment follows reports, including one from Bloomberg, about OpenAI’s potential $3 billion acquisition of Windsurf. Just days before Kaplan’s remarks, Windsurf announced that Anthropic had indeed cut its direct access to popular models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. This has reportedly forced Windsurf to scramble for third-party computing resources on short notice, potentially causing instability for users accessing Claude via Windsurf. Windsurf expressed disappointment regarding Anthropic’s decision, while neither Windsurf nor OpenAI have officially confirmed the acquisition rumors. Resource Constraints and Lasting Partnerships Kaplan also highlighted that part of the reason for the decision is Anthropic’s current computing constraints. The company aims to reserve its valuable compute resources for what Kaplan termed ‘lasting partnerships’. This suggests a strategic prioritization of resources towards collaborations expected to yield long-term benefits and alignment. Despite current limitations, Kaplan expressed optimism about increasing the availability of Claude AI models in the coming months. He mentioned that Anthropic has begun unlocking capacity on a new, substantial computing cluster provided by their partner, Amazon, which is expected to scale significantly. Shifting Focus in AI Coding As Anthropic re-evaluates its partnerships, Kaplan noted the company is actively collaborating with other customers building AI coding tools. He specifically mentioned Cursor, a company Anthropic anticipates working with for a considerable time. Kaplan dismissed the notion that Anthropic is in direct competition with companies like Cursor, even those developing their own AI models. Simultaneously, Anthropic is increasing its focus on developing its own agentic coding products, such as Claude Code. Kaplan suggested that the traditional AI chatbot paradigm, while popular with companies like OpenAI , Google, and Meta, is limiting due to its static nature. He believes that more dynamic AI agents will ultimately prove far more helpful for users tackling complex coding tasks. What This Means for Users and the Market Anthropic’s move to cut Windsurf access underscores the intense competition and strategic maneuvering within the AI industry. For users relying on Windsurf for Claude AI access, this could mean short-term disruptions. For the broader market, it highlights the importance of direct partnerships and resource allocation as companies like Anthropic and OpenAI vie for dominance in specific AI applications, particularly in specialized fields like AI Coding . The situation remains fluid as acquisition rumors persist and Anthropic continues to build out its infrastructure and define its partnership strategy in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

In a sudden move that caught many off guard, the crypto futures market experienced a wave of liquidations, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in leveraged positions within a very short timeframe. What Exactly Happened in the Crypto Futures Market? Recent data from major exchanges paints a stark picture. In just the past hour, a staggering $251 million worth of futures contracts were liquidated. Extending the view, the past 24 hours saw total liquidations surge to over $804 million . These aren’t just numbers; they represent positions closed forcefully due to insufficient margin, primarily impacting traders using high leverage trading strategies. Understanding Liquidations: What are Futures? These are agreements to buy or sell an asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) at a specific price on a future date. In crypto, they are often used for speculation and hedging. What is Leverage Trading? This allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital (margin). For example, 10x leverage means you can control $10,000 worth of crypto with just $1,000 of your own money. What is a Liquidation? When the market price moves against a leveraged position to the point where the trader’s margin is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses, the exchange automatically closes the position. The trader loses their margin and potentially more, depending on the market’s speed. Why Did We See Such Significant Crypto Liquidations? Liquidations of this magnitude don’t happen in a vacuum. They are typically triggered by sharp price movements in the underlying assets. While the exact catalyst can vary, significant market volatility is the primary culprit. When prices swing rapidly, especially downwards for long positions or upwards for short positions, leveraged traders can quickly hit their liquidation price. Factors contributing to recent volatility might include: Macroeconomic news impacting global markets. Specific news related to major cryptocurrencies or the broader crypto industry. Sudden shifts in market sentiment or large whale movements. Technical factors like breaking key support or resistance levels. The speed at which the $251 million was liquidated suggests a particularly sharp and rapid price change occurred within that single hour, cascading into forced closures across various exchanges. Breaking Down the Impact: Which Assets and Exchanges Were Hit Hardest? While the data often aggregates liquidations, these events typically impact positions across various cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures usually account for the largest portions due to their market dominance and trading volume in the futures market . However, altcoins with significant futures trading activity can also see substantial liquidations, often experiencing even higher percentage price swings. Major exchanges offering perpetual futures contracts are where these liquidations occur. Platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, and others regularly report such data. The concentration of the $251 million in a single hour indicates a broad market move affecting positions across multiple leading platforms simultaneously. Challenges of Leverage Trading: While leverage trading can amplify profits, it dramatically increases risk. A small price move against your position can lead to total loss of your margin. The recent crypto liquidations serve as a harsh reminder of this inherent danger, especially in a market known for its extreme market volatility . Actionable Insights: How Can Traders Navigate Volatility and Avoid Liquidations? For anyone participating in or considering the crypto futures market, understanding and managing risk is paramount. The recent $251 million liquidation event underscores the need for caution. Here are some key strategies: Understand Leverage: Don’t use excessive leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading or during periods of high market volatility . Lower leverage gives your position more room to withstand price swings. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level. This limits your potential loss and prevents a full liquidation. Manage Your Margin: Keep a close eye on your margin level. Be prepared to add more collateral if necessary to avoid a margin call or liquidation. Trade with a Plan: Have clear entry and exit points. Don’t make impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Know the Market: Stay informed about factors that could cause sudden price changes. Avoiding forced crypto liquidations requires discipline and a robust risk management strategy, particularly when engaging in leverage trading in the unpredictable futures market . Summary: A Harsh Lesson in Leverage and Volatility The liquidation of $251 million in crypto futures within a single hour, contributing to over $804 million in 24 hours, is a significant event in the futures market . It highlights the inherent risks associated with leverage trading in a market characterized by extreme market volatility . While futures offer opportunities for profit and hedging, the potential for rapid and substantial losses through crypto liquidations is a reality every trader must confront. Understanding these risks and implementing strict risk management practices are essential for survival in this fast-paced environment.

This development, revealed via BitGo’s X account, marks a crucial step in expanding access to yield-generating opportunities within the cryptocurrency market for large-scale investors and financial institutions. The service is being rolled out in partnership with Yuma, a recognized validator in the Bittensor ecosystem, aiming to provide a secure and compliant pathway for institutions looking to participate in network consensus and earn rewards through TAO staking . What is Institutional Staking and Why is it Important? Institutional staking refers to the participation of large financial entities – such as hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations – in the process of staking cryptocurrencies. Unlike retail staking, which can be done individually or through smaller platforms, institutional staking requires robust infrastructure, stringent security measures, regulatory compliance, and sophisticated reporting capabilities. BitGo specializes in providing these high-level services, making them a key player in enabling institutions to enter the staking arena. The importance of institutional involvement in crypto staking cannot be overstated. It brings significant capital into proof-of-stake networks, enhancing their security and decentralization. Furthermore, it signals growing maturity and acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance, potentially paving the way for wider adoption. For institutions, staking offers a way to generate passive income on their digital asset holdings, adding a new dimension to portfolio management beyond simple price appreciation. Deep Dive into TAO Staking and Bittensor’s Ecosystem Bittensor (TAO) is a fascinating project that aims to create a decentralized, open-source network for machine intelligence. It functions as a marketplace for AI models, where participants contribute computational resources or intellectual property and are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the value they add to the collective intelligence. Staking TAO is integral to the network’s operation, allowing participants to become validators or delegate their tokens to validators to earn rewards from network emissions and transaction fees. The decision by BitGo to offer Bittensor staking specifically highlights the growing interest in AI-focused blockchain projects among institutional investors. As AI continues to dominate technological discussions, networks like Bittensor that merge AI development with decentralized principles are attracting attention. Staking TAO allows institutions not only to earn yield but also to implicitly support and participate in the growth of a cutting-edge decentralized AI infrastructure. BitGo’s Secure Infrastructure for Institutional Staking BitGo is a well-established digital asset trust and security company known for providing institutional-grade custody, trading, and finance services. Their entry into BitGo staking for assets like TAO is a natural extension of their core offerings. For institutions, security and compliance are paramount concerns when dealing with digital assets. BitGo addresses these needs through: Qualified Custody: Secure storage solutions that meet regulatory requirements. Insurance: Protection against potential losses due to theft or other security breaches. Compliance Frameworks: Adherence to relevant financial regulations and AML/KYC procedures. Robust Technology: Infrastructure designed for high availability and protection against slashing risks associated with staking. Partnering with a trusted validator like Yuma further enhances the reliability and performance of the TAO staking service offered by BitGo, ensuring that institutional assets are managed professionally and securely while participating in the Bittensor network. The Role of Yuma Validator in the Partnership While BitGo provides the institutional gateway and secure infrastructure, Yuma serves as the operational validator within the Bittensor network. Validators play a critical role in proof-of-stake systems; they are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks on the blockchain. This work is essential for maintaining the network’s integrity and processing transactions. Yuma’s expertise as a validator in the Bittensor ecosystem is crucial for the success of this institutional offering. They manage the technical complexities of running validator nodes, ensuring high uptime and performance to maximize staking rewards and minimize potential penalties (slashing) that can occur if a validator goes offline or acts maliciously. This partnership leverages the strengths of both entities: BitGo’s institutional-grade security and client management, and Yuma’s specialized technical knowledge in validating for the Bittensor network. Benefits of BitGo’s Institutional TAO Staking For institutions considering adding TAO to their portfolio, staking through BitGo offers several compelling benefits: Yield Generation: Earn passive income on TAO holdings through staking rewards. Enhanced Security: Leverage BitGo’s battle-tested security and custody solutions, mitigating risks associated with self-staking or using less secure platforms. Simplified Participation: BitGo handles the technical complexities of staking, reporting, and reward distribution. Regulatory Compliance: Access staking services that align with institutional compliance requirements. Participation in AI Growth: Support and benefit from the growth of the decentralized Bittensor AI network. This service lowers the barrier for entry for institutions interested in Bittensor staking , providing a familiar and trusted counterparty to manage their digital assets and staking activities. Challenges and Considerations for Institutional Stakers While the benefits are clear, institutions must also consider potential challenges associated with crypto staking : Slashing Risk: Although minimized by professional validators like Yuma and platforms like BitGo, there is always a theoretical risk of losing staked assets if the validator misbehaves or suffers technical issues. Lock-up Periods: Staked assets are typically locked for a certain period, affecting liquidity. Institutions need to understand the unbonding period for TAO. Price Volatility: The value of the staked asset (TAO) can fluctuate significantly, impacting the overall return on investment in fiat terms. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto staking is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Tax Implications: Staking rewards have tax implications that institutions must navigate. BitGo aims to help institutions navigate these complexities by providing secure infrastructure and potentially assisting with reporting, but thorough due diligence is always required. Market Implications and Future Outlook The launch of institutional TAO staking by a major player like BitGo is a positive signal for both Bittensor and the broader institutional crypto market. It indicates increasing institutional appetite for yield-bearing digital assets beyond the major ones like Ethereum. It also validates the importance of specialized service providers like BitGo in bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized networks. As more institutions become comfortable with crypto staking , we can expect to see increased capital flow into proof-of-stake networks, potentially boosting network security and stability. This trend is likely to accelerate as regulatory clarity improves and more mature financial products around staking emerge. Actionable Insights for Institutions Institutions interested in exploring Bittensor staking through BitGo should: Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand the potential risks, including slashing and price volatility. Evaluate Liquidity Needs: Be aware of the lock-up and unbonding periods for TAO. Consult with BitGo: Engage directly with BitGo’s institutional team to understand the specific terms, security measures, and reporting capabilities of their TAO staking service. Review Validator Performance: While BitGo partners with Yuma, understanding Yuma’s track record as a validator is prudent. Consider Regulatory and Tax Implications: Consult with legal and tax professionals regarding staking rewards. Utilizing a trusted platform like BitGo provides a more secure and compliant path compared to navigating the complexities of staking independently. Summary: A New Era for Institutional Crypto Yield BitGo’s launch of institutional TAO staking with Yuma is a significant development, expanding the options available to large investors seeking yield in the crypto space. By providing a secure, compliant, and professionally managed service, BitGo is lowering the barriers for institutions to participate in the Bittensor network and benefit from its growth and staking rewards. This move underscores the increasing maturity of the digital asset market and the growing institutional interest in innovative decentralized projects like Bittensor. As institutional crypto staking continues to evolve, services like this will play a vital role in driving broader adoption and integrating digital assets into traditional financial portfolios.

Some believe it is the key to massive wealth, while others call it pure hype. What’s really going on? Let us break it down. The term GCV in the Pi Network community stands for Global Consensus Value, an idea introduced by Pi enthusiasts to set a fixed value for Pi Coin. Some fans claim that 1 Pi Coin equals $314,159, inspired by the mathematical constant π (pi). They say that Pi’s rising user base, real-world uses, and limited supply justify such a valuation and see it as a motivational tool to encourage adoption and participation. Critics See Red Flags But critics said that since there is no official approval or big exchange listings yet, it is just speculation and an unrealistic hope that might end up disappointing them. They even compare Pi Network to multi-level marketing or Ponzi schemes due to its reliance on social media campaigns and referrals. PI NETWORK NEWS: Big Congratulations to Mr. Vijay Soni as the Head of GCV Ambassador in France! Thank you for your outstanding creativity, leadership, and tireless commitment to advancing the GCV movement in France and across the world! Global GCV Core Team April… pic.twitter.com/JrdjbJqNkw — JoJo-π (@jojo102102) April 13, 2025 Dr Altcoin recently stepped up to clear the air. He clarified that GCV was never backed by market data or the Pi Core Team. It came from a group of early users who truly believed in Pi’s huge potential and promoted the idea through events, campaigns, and community efforts. The Reality Check The catch here is that while the Pi Core Team never officially endorsed GCV, they also never clearly rejected it. Their vague comments like “Pi is worth what pioneers make it worth” allowed the myth to spread. Pi is currently trading at about $0.6323, which is far away from the claimed $314,159. GCV supporters point to many blockchain transactions, but these involve only small items, not big purchases. One case showed paying thousands in fees for a $3 item that was very unrealistic. The GitHub Confusion Some people point to Kosasi’s GitHub to justify GCV, but the analyst says that the code was copied and has no link to the Pi Core Team. Many wrongly think the community can set Pi’s price, but he emphasized that real value comes from scarcity, utility, and trust, and not hype. With 100 billion coins, Pi is not scarce like Bitcoin. GCV would make Pi worth $72 trillion, which would be more than the world’s GDP, and far from being true. He has stressed the need for the Core Team to step up and clear the confusion. Focus on Real Progress Instead of chasing these shallow dreams, the community needs to focus on faster KYC, smooth mainnet launch, tokenomics clarity, migration speed, improved validator rewards, and real-world use cases that give Pi true value. With proper planning, real-world use, and transparency, Dr Altcoin predicts it to reach $100 to $300. Analyst Mr. Spock has also called out GCV promoters for misleading the Pi community. He warned that these false claims have crashed Pi’s price multiple times and hurt real Pioneers. The real threat is not the price, it’s the manipulation by people using Pi for personal gain, he said.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 03:37:04

This has been the fate of reputable projects like Ripple, Block.one and so on. Their regulatory missteps have turned into multi-million-dollar headaches for years now. Let’s take Ripple as a case study . Over the years, the SEC sued Ripple, claiming that XRP was an unregistered security – this has led to lengthy battles. Consequently, this prolonged battle had a huge impact on XRP market value, and holders experienced a significant loss. According to this source , after Ripple was granted a partial victory through summary judgments, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the company has spent over $150 million on its defense. Thus, while there is no perfect approach to staying off the SEC’s radar, especially if you’re founding a solution-driven project. Here is a guide that can arm you with the right compliance strategies to stay off their radar. SEC scrutiny and the regulatory nature of the blockchain startup A lot has happened in recent years with the SEC asserting itself over many projects falling short of its standards. For new companies emanating in the Web 3.0 space, knowing how to build on a compliant basis from day one is no doubt paramount to their survival. Yes, SEC scrutiny might delay a launch, freeze assets or give rise to enforcement actions, but the basic aim of this article is to give a legal-strategic guide to the founders of Web 3.0 projects that wish to identify possible risks tied to the SEC, approach compliance from a proactive standpoint and build up their projects for the long haul. This guide is a sort of seasoned lawyer’s toolkit for compliance without stifling innovation. 1. Understand the SEC’s role in Web 3.0 regulation This is one of the surest ways to avoid SEC scrutiny. Technically, the SEC is charged with protecting investors and maintaining fair, orderly markets. While their interest isn’t limited to ICOs (initial coin offerings) – it extends to DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols, staking mechanisms, NFT (non-fungible token) projects, token-based fundraising and more. One of the common mistakes startup founders make is thinking that decentralization exempts them from scrutiny. According to this source , SEC has increased their dogged vigilance in holding projects accountable, even retroactively. Crypto startup owners must understand that regulators view blockchain through a risk-focused lens, and they prioritize consumer protection over the innovation you’re bringing in. Furthermore, founders have to align operational frameworks with regulatory expectations from inception. Startups that anticipate and respond to the SEC’s evolving stance gain credibility not just with regulators but with investors and users alike. Also, when founders understand the regulators’ triggers and intentions, they can conceive products and ecosystems that innovate within the legal guardrails. 2. The Howey test and token classification – The SEC’s primary lens Once a project structurally passes the Howey test , it has passed the first compliance checkpoint. This test is not just central to SEC enforcement – it’s their primary lens that determines whether a digital asset qualifies as a security. What is a Howey test? It is simply analyzed as an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. Here are the four-pronged Howey test questions to be asked. Is there any investment of money? Is it a common enterprise? Is there an expectation of profits? Is it derived from the efforts of others? If the answer is ‘yes’ to all four, the asset is perceived as a ‘security’ and subject to SEC rules. For years now, many tokens have been sold with speculative promise. To avoid such scrutiny, founders must carefully structure their tokenomics. While this act may include removing profit expectations, decentralizing control and delaying token issuance until the network is sufficiently mature, legal memos and third-party assessments can help support the non-security classification. One of the SEC’s rules has emphasized that simply calling a token a ‘utility’ doesn’t exempt it from being a security. The Howey test is functional, and a rigorous application of it that is backed by legal counsel and documentation is the first line of defense in controlling regulatory risk and avoiding unwanted SEC attention. 3. Smart structuring from day one – Entity formation and jurisdiction One of the smartest ways to avoid SEC scrutiny is to engage in smart structuring from the beginning. How a startup incorporates and where it operates can significantly impact its regulatory exposure. For instance, US-based startups fall directly under the SEC’s oversight, so selecting the right entity type (LLC, C-Corp, Foundation) and jurisdiction is very strategic. While offshore jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or Switzerland may offer more favorable regulatory environments for token-based projects, it doesn’t absolve the startup completely from US law if their citizens’ investments are involved. More so, a project with dual-entity structure – for example, a dual between the US C-Corp for operations and an offshore foundation for protocol governance – can offer balance, but it must be supported by robust governance, crystal clear roles and arms-length dealings. Early legal counsel is critical here because any missteps in entity setup can jeopardize the startup in multi-jurisdictional legal issues that are very costly and time-consuming to resolve. Blockchain birthed decentralization, and decentralization eradicates excessive protocol from the development team. But for it not to be an SEC meal ticket, it must be handled with legal precision to avoid scrutiny. The end goal is to align the structure with the project’s operational goals and compliance needs. 4. Regulatory-first tokenomics design No matter how great your Web 3.0 project ideas are, if you toil with your tokenomics, you’re giving the SEC an open invitation. Startups must think beyond utility and value capture to consider how their token models may be perceived under securities laws. Avoiding profit promises is essential. For example, it’s much safer to design structures for tokens to be earned through network participation or staking instead of speculative promises that entice people to participate during pre-launch. By doing this, you’re reducing legal exposure. More so, vesting schedules for team and investor tokens should be transparent and defensible. The more a token ecosystem is decentralized at launch, the lower the risk. Airdrops and ‘fair launches’ are also under scrutiny if tied to promotional schemes or disguised fundraising. Any Web 3.0 startup that embeds compliance in tokenomics has not only de-risked its operations but has also gained investor confidence by showing that its model can withstand regulatory due diligence. 5. Implementing an education compliance program Education is a powerful key and leveraging it can help Web 3.0 founders to avoid the SEC’s strong scrutiny. By ensuring that your team members understand compliance obligations, you can prevent inadvertent violations. When your team members are armed with the necessary knowledge, like periodic audits and internal legal reviews, how they consult with outside counsel will help smooth your project processes and avoid violations. Meanwhile, it’s also wise to engage with regulators when appropriate, for instance, you could submit no-action letters or seek interpretative guidance. A startup that shows proactive compliance is more likely to receive regulatory cooperation than a sanction. 6. Build a compliance shield – KYC/AML as a non-negotiable pillar While decentralization is a core value of Web 3.0, KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) protocols are non-negotiable from a regulatory perspective. The SEC, along with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), expects any entity engaged in token sales or exchanges to implement KYC/AML safeguards. Failure to do so not only attracts scrutiny but can invite criminal liability. Blockchain startups must integrate identity verification processes for investors and users – particularly during token distributions, fundraising or when providing financial-like services. Tools like Chainalysis or TRM Labs can also help monitor on-chain behavior for suspicious activity. Privacy does not mean anonymity in the eyes of regulators – it means responsible data management. Even decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that facilitate economic activity must consider KYC obligations, depending on their functions. Embedding these checks from day one allows your project to scale lawfully. Moreover, demonstrating AML/KYC readiness opens up institutional partnerships and fiat on-ramp opportunities. In a maturing market, clean compliance can be more valuable than fast growth. 7. Understand how to navigate fundraising – From reg D to reg CF Do you know how to navigate fundraising without raising eyebrows? Whether it’s token sales, SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity) or even NFT-based fundraising, to avoid pitfalls, Web 3.0 founders must align their fundraising approach with one of the SEC’s recognized exemptions. One of these is Regulation D (Reg D). It allows private offerings to accredited investors without full SEC registration. It’s commonly used during token presales but requires proper filings (Form D) and marketing restrictions. Another is Regulation CF (Regulation Crowdfunding). It offers a path for raising from the general public, up to $5 million annually, with lower compliance burdens than IPOs. It still mandates disclosures, investor limits and platform usage. In order not to trigger SEC scrutiny, you must avoid these death traps, and they are as follows: misrepresenting the offering, failing to file accordingly and overselling tokens. More so, ensure your legal counsel is fully involved when structuring these rounds and drafting appropriate documentation. Smart fundraising isn’t just about capital – it’s about regulatory sustainability. 8. Staying ahead, constant monitoring and having an experienced legal counsel The path to success is not just paved with code and capital – it’s fortified with legal foresight. Hiring and retaining experienced legal counsel is not a luxury but a necessity. After my recent LinkedIn interview with Yarden Noy , blockchain legal and regulatory advisor at DTL Law, on the basic requirements of hiring a seasoned blockchain lawyer or advisor, here is his feedback. Noy said, “It’s not enough to simply know the law in this industry. “A seasoned blockchain lawyer should be able to analyze the unique model and features of a project, identify the relevant laws that apply or may apply to it and apply them in this constantly evolving and dynamic landscape. “And all of that must be in a way that facilitates the project’s growth – not stifling it. “Lawyers in this nuanced space need to have a good understanding not only of the law but also of the technology, the industry and the Web 3.0 community. “Even the best legal advice, when not coupled with an understanding of the unique features of the crypto world, would be of little to no use for a crypto entrepreneur.” Your legal advisor should not be left out on tactical activities like periodic legal reviews, audits and compliance updates that surround the legal boundaries of your project. Furthermore, as the SEC continues to evolve its posture on blockchain regulation, Web 3.0 startups must adapt continuously to match the changes in global regulatory frameworks. Startups must maintain internal communication channels for discussing compliance updates, ensuring all stakeholders – from developers to marketers – act in sync. The goal is not just to avoid enforcement but to build a business that can grow confidently under regulatory clarity. In conclusion, if you’re a founder pregnant with a revolutionary Web 3.0 idea, build boldly and legally – compliance isn’t a burden.

Trump-Musk fallout rattles sentiment, Dogecoin drops 20%",https://crypto.news/crypto-market-down-trump-musk-fallout-sentiment-2025/,"The crypto market slid sharply on Friday, June 6, shedding 5% over the past 24 hours as rising political tensions between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk sent investor confidence tumbling. The total crypto market capitalization now stands at $3.29 trillion, down from around $4.1 trillion on June 5. According to data from Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped 12 points, from 57 to 45, marking a move into “fear” territory. This decline in sentiment follows a public clash between Trump and Musk that has also weighed heavily on traditional markets. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down 3.1% and trading at $101,843 at press time. Ethereum ( ETH ) leads the top 10 altcoin losses with a 7.5% slide, while Solana ( SOL ), XRP ( XRP ), and BNB ( BNB ) each slid about 5%. Nearly $986 million in cryptocurrency positions were liquidated in the last day, according to Coinglass data , a 358% increase. The crypto market relative strength index dropped to 32.7, indicating oversold conditions, and open interest dropped 2.71% to $140 billion. The market reaction followed a series of political escalations. The fallout started when Musk resigned from the Department of Government Efficiency and publicly criticized the President’s recent spending bill , dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill. In response, Trump revoked Jared Isaacman’s NASA nomination, a close associate of Musk, and threatened to completely cut off government contracts for businesses run by Musk.

While DOGE lacks intrinsic utility, its price has long been sensitive to Musk’s actions and statements. The token had rallied following Trump’s election win, amid hopes of crypto-friendly policies. However, investors seem to be pulling back as that optimism wanes. Alongside digital assets, cryptocurrency-related stocks also suffered. Mining companies MARA, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific all saw losses of about 5%, while Coinbase fell 4.6% and Strategy fell 2.4%. Meanwhile, political uncertainty continues to attract the interest of the crypto community. Traders currently assign a 10% probability that Trump will be impeached before the end of 2025 on the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket. So far, almost half a million dollars has been wagered on that outcome. Market volatility may persist in the coming days as macro risks increase and sentiment toward cryptocurrencies declines.

Citadel President Jim Esposito is confident that the asset class has surpassed the “point of no return.” Speaking at a Piper Sandler conference on Thursday, he said that institutional investors are taking crypto seriously. “Crypto has passed the point of no return, and it is an asset class that institutional investors, serious and sophisticated investors, are taking seriously,” he noted. Crypto Expansion Under Eased SEC Regulatory Plans Per a Reuters report , the firm is looking into crypto expansion as a part of its “strategic plan,” under the new SEC regulatory regime. “We’re excited by the prospects of the SEC coming out with the rule set,” said Esposito. “So crypto is definitely a space we’re going to get bigger in, and we’re excited about the prospects” Citadel touted in February that it is targeting major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, looking to become a liquidity provider for crypto . Citadel President Warns US Govt. Debt: A ‘Ticking Time Bomb’ Besides the company’s crypto plans, President Esposito stressed that mounting government debt levels are a “ticking time bomb.” The Government’s reaction to this crisis is “super important” at this time, he added. The US deficit has been a growing concern recently among several financial leaders. For instance, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this week that the national debt will create a “tough time” for the bond market and will eventually spread. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has warned that Bitcoin could replace USD eventually , if lawmakers fail to address America’s alarming debt. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control,” he wrote to his 1.5 million followers on X. @brian_armstrong has warned that Bitcoin could replace the USD as the world’s reserve currency if lawmakers fail to address America’s debt. #Bitcoin #USD https://t.co/2NHd9jLGwv — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Early this year, VanEck suggested that accumulating Bitcoin could help offset a portion of the country’s mounting national debt. The US Treasury’s plan to acquire up to 1 million Bitcoin over five years and holding it as a long-term store of value would strengthen the country’s balance sheet , the asset manager noted.

On June 5, Bitcoin traded around $104,300, down 0.50% in 24 hours and off 2.5% over the past seven days. Yet data shows more people are joining the network, and more coins are being passed around. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Wallet Creation Jump According to Santiment, on May 29 nearly 557,000 new wallets appeared. That was the highest number since December 2023. It means thousands of people are opening wallets even though price has stayed just under $105,000. People normally open new wallets to send and receive bitcoins but they somehow come across the idea through new sources, increased talks among friends or create simple curiosity. In any case, an increased wallet holding indeed indicates a much wider usage. 📊 Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has seen sharp rises this week as its price hovers just below $105K: 📈 May 29th: 556,830 new $BTC wallets created (Highest since December 2, 2023) 🔄 June 2nd: 241,360 coins circulated (Highest since December 8, 2024) Growth in a network’s… pic.twitter.com/2DxknVXrKT — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 5, 2025 Increased Token Movement On June 2, over 241,360 BTC changed hands. This was deemed the busiest day since December 2024. Reports from Santiment suggest that high coin turnover usually coincides with increased traffic. Traders might be moving coins in and out of exchanges, or investors could be shifting wallets. Big swings in daily token movement can point to a shift in sentiment—people either getting ready to buy or sell. Right now, it mostly looks like more users are sending coins to each other, which keeps the network busy even when price sits still. Big Holders Step In Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large holders—often called “whales”—are stocking up. Their coin inflows jumped by 145% over the last seven days, and by 214% over the past 30 days. When big players load up, it can tighten supply on exchanges. That makes it tougher for new buyers to get in without driving price higher. If whales keep buying at this rate, it could lead to more upward pressure on price once everyday investors step in again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Mid Tier Investors Buy It’s not just the really big holders adding coins. Wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC added more than 79,000 BTC in just one week. That means these mid-tier holders picked up around 11,320 BTC per day on average. As of June 2, they held over 13 million BTC in total. When both big whales and these mid-level holders keep stacking, it further cuts down the number of coins floating on exchanges. Fewer coins available often mean any shift in demand could move price more.

Wynn, who first gained attention for turning a $7,000 position in the meme coin PEPE into over $25m, shared his story Friday on X. In a candid post, he said he began trading perpetual futures in March, despite having no prior experience with derivatives. “I started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in fact never really traded properly before. I’ve just traded meme coins,” he wrote. I started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in-fact never really traded properly before, I’ve just traded meme coins.

Within a month, Wynn said he turned a $3m position into $100m through a series of high-leverage trades. His success, all trackable on-chain, attracted attention fast. His social media following ballooned as crypto traders scrambled to replicate or monitor his positions. But the newfound visibility proved double-edged. Wynn admitted that the pressure of being in the spotlight warped his judgment. “With all this new attention the trading spiraled out of control. I was basically gambling,” he said. “I got greedy. I wasn’t taking the numbers on the screen seriously.” Transparency Made Wynn a Star—Then a Cautionary Tale In mid-May, Wynn had amassed a $1.25b long position on Bitcoin , betting big at an average entry price of around $108,243. The position, built with as much as 40x leverage, left little margin for error. When US President Donald Trump posted a tweet threatening tariffs on the European Union, global markets turned sharply. Bitcoin dipped below Wynn’s liquidation price, wiping out nearly his entire position in a series of cascading losses. The rapid reversal shocked many in the crypto community, where Wynn had become a divisive figure. Some hailed him as a modern trading icon, while others accused him of reckless gambling or even market manipulation.

The rift came to a head on June 5 during a White House meeting with the German chancellor, where Trump voiced his displeasure with Musk , who until recently had been one of his closest advisers. “I’m very disappointed in Elon,” Trump said. “I’ve helped Elon a lot.” Musk wasted no time responding. In a pointed post on X, he accused Trump of ingratitude and fired back, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election.” The exchange marked a dramatic unraveling of their once-powerful alliance, built during Trump’s second term. Musk Swipe at Trump Adds Fuel to Market Volatility Tensions escalated further when Musk replied “Yes” to a post on X calling for Trump’s impeachment . The remark drew immediate attention, although any such effort is considered politically impossible, as Republicans currently hold majorities in both chambers of Congress. Yes https://t.co/rqRsX8B4Hg — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Markets quickly reflected the fallout. Bitcoin dipped to $100,783 on Thursday before recovering above $102,700. Over $324m have been liquidated in Bitcoin longs in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass data . The broader crypto market fell nearly 5% during the same time. The $TRUMP meme coin, which had surged during the peak of their alliance, slid 10%. Analysts say Musk’s influence in the crypto space, combined with the political uncertainty, has introduced fresh instability into an already volatile market. Tesla Plunges as Rift With Trump Threatens Federal Support Tesla shares, meanwhile, suffered a sharper decline. The stock closed 14% lower on Thursday and has fallen 16% since Musk began attacking Trump’s domestic policy bill last week. The market was hit hard by the Trump and Musk issues.

Until recently, Musk had served as a key informal adviser to Trump, helping shape major policy decisions and frequently representing the administration abroad. His sudden departure from that inner circle has left a noticeable void in tech-policy alignment, with markets now unsure of how the administration will proceed on key issues such as electric vehicles and space infrastructure. Adding to the uncertainty, Musk has hinted at launching a new political movement altogether. That possibility, along with the risk of a regulatory reversal or funding pullback, has left investors bracing for a more hostile environment. And that’s not just for Tesla, but for the broader tech and crypto sectors that have often moved in tandem with Musk’s influence. The clash has become more than a political sideshow. It is a rare case of personality-driven politics colliding with market fundamentals. For now, both crypto and Tesla appear firmly caught in the crossfire.

After the April bounce that led to a significant recovery, VVV halted buying pressure after reaching a high of $5.34 and later took a downturn. This led to a broad retracement phase last month, and the market closed bearishly following a lower low and lower high pattern. Although the $2.7 level held firmly and the bleeding stopped due to a slight recovery. That brought a slight relief in drawdown, and the price increased above $3. Following the bearish pattern, it encountered resistance at $3.15 this week and now appears ready for another leg down on the daily chart. A break below the previous monthly low could fuel more downtrends. Looking ahead, the key level to watch for such a drop lies at $2. A major rebound above this level should trigger a fresh buy capable of bringing positive sentiments back into the market. As of now, it is currently under the bear’s radar. Losing April’s low in the process might cause a major crash to a new low. VVV Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The latest drop is targeted at the $ 2.38 support. If this support fails to produce a bounce, the next key support to keep in mind is $1.8 – April’s low. Breaking lower could crash the price straight to $1. If by chance the bulls find their way back, with a push above the recent $3.15 resistance, higher levels to watch for a test are $4.13 and $5.34, with a potential breakout. Currently, the bears are still in control.

Virtuals latest tallies the total market cap of AI agents at $9.59 billion, down 5.76 percent from a day before. The broad-based downturn hit the major players in the Virtuals ecosystem and their far-flung associates hard. The virtuals protocol itself was down 8.42% in terms of market cap, resting now at 2.16 billion real ones—but its mindshare, a kind of virtual cap that measures how much folks are talking about you across various digital platforms, was up a bit, growing 1.14% to 38.20%. Virtual Market Volatility Hits Legacy Leaders Hard The established players in the AI agent space appear to have taken the worst hits from the ongoing correction. Volatile trading conditions in a liquidity-challenged market have impacted their market caps, which was also the case yesterday for the Virtuals ecosystem, whose native token $VIRTUAL fell to $1.7638—down 8.88% for the day. Maintain necessary ecosystem development and community traction, however, is core to the strategy of these tokens. Generative AI protocol or no, leading projects in this space very much look like candidates for invested capital and the valuation and price recovery that goes with it. The dip in virtuals occurs alongside an increasingly cautious market. As trading volumes retreat and liquidity thins, even the most fundamentally sound projects are seeing sharper price movements. Analysts cite the diverging performance across the sector to novelty—to some extent, the availability of new projects to buy. Newcomers Shine as Capital Rotates While most major initiatives posted red numbers, a scant few emerging names managed to clash with the trend, pulling in capital and attention with gains that delighted in their short-term nature. AURA (@AurraCloud) led the top gainers with a remarkable 24.43% growth in market cap.

Many of these projects are in the early stages of development or adoption, but they appear to be benefiting from a wish-to-innovate trend where users and investors are not just hanging back and waiting on the tried-and-true old networks.

When liquidity is tight, it’s not unusual to see some smaller, more agile projects outperform the competition as they offer up new, different, or even experimental products and services. In the world of AI-driven markets, where “the latest and greatest” quickly becomes the table stakes for a successful product, this element of surprise and delight is a key driver of a project’s perceived value. Virtuals Mindshare Grows Despite Price Drop It is curious that, while the worth of $VIRTUAL was dropping, the value of the ecosystem was apparently on the upswing. Between February 2023 and May 2023, the worth of $VIRTUAL dropped 20.25%. In contrast, the virtuals protocol reached almost 4% increased market share with CryptoSlam as of June 2013 and has increased visibility across social platforms. It is now ranked among the top 5 entities shared about across influencer platforms. The gap between market cap and mind share may indicate that users are not abandoning the protocol but are instead biding their time amid a volatile market and waiting to see which way things will resolve. This seems to be an endorsement of the strength of the Virtuel brand and the community surrounding it, as a lot of upward-trending conversation seems to be going on about AI agents, protocol upgrades, and application use cases. As the AI agent market rebalances, focus is shifting to whether this correction is just a temporary dip or the start of a much larger realignment. For the present, it’s clear that Virtuals is still a dominant force in the space, even if it is feeling the squeeze of some macro-driven price action. With a growing presence in the mental landscape and a considerably loyal user base, the protocol may be set up to rebound in a stabilized market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The TMTG has yet to file official documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Nevada registration may be the legal foundation for a potential spot or futures-based crypto ETF under the Truth Social brand. TMTG registered its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF first According to Nevada’s public business records filed on June 3, Trump’s media company registered its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. Shortly after, NYSE Arca submitted Form 19b-4 to the SEC on behalf of Florida-based Yorkville America Digital, requesting approval to list and trade shares of the ETF. Per the filing, Yorkville America Digital will manage the ETF’s operations and the fund listed on NYSE Arca on approval. Later, on June 5, Yorkville America Digital filed an S-1 registration statement with the commission for the Bitcoin fund. On the same day, the TMTG registered its Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF in Nevada. The ETF offers exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading crypto assets by market cap, and thus may draw in a number of investors. Some have speculated that the fund could eventually include spot- and futures-based investments. Critics, however, believe the company’s crypto assets, if approved, will not offer long-term stability. Dave Nadig, an independent ETF expert, remarked, “I think it’s extraordinarily unlikely that products like [Truth Social Bitcoin ETF] gain long-term assets.” The media company’s growing interest in ETF coincides with the increasing optimism over Bitcoin, which has traded above $100,000 in the last few weeks. In May, the media company also said it planned to raise $1.5 billion in equity and another $1 billion in convertible notes for a “bitcoin treasury.” Addressing a BTC conference in Las Vegas one week later, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. touted cryptocurrencies as a cheaper, faster, and transparent alternative to fiat currency. Trump Jr added that crypto is now a “huge part” of all they do. He later distanced himself and his family from a Trump-themed Bitcoin trading app, saying the Trump Organization had nothing to do with the project. Nonetheless, the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial is set to introduce a crypto wallet soon. TMTG DJT shares fell 8% on Thursday after Trump and Musk’s fallout. Meanwhile, TMTG shares under the ticker DJT dropped 8% Thursday after President Donald Trump’s fallout with billionaire Elon Musk. Their feud began with their difference over a tax and spending bill. Later, the president openly declared that he would cut off all government contracts with Musk-owned companies, while Musk suggested he should be impeached on his social media platform X. Since then, in just a few hours, Tesla lost about $150 billion and closed down 14.3% on Thursday. Jamie Cox, Managing Partner at Harris Financial Group, commented on their fallout: Billionaire spats rarely have any lasting impacts on markets, but this fallout was more than predictable. At some point, there was bound to be some divergence in priorities that led to a split between Trump and Musk. Jamie Cox Mark Malek, Chief Investment Officer at Siebert Financial, also argued that the public is more worried about how the Senate will “skinny down this big beautiful bill.” than the potential deficit. He found it surprising that Elon is now a driving force behind people’s sudden interest in fiscal deficit. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Since launching the Virtuals platform, impressive adoption, creativity, and market traction have emerged around the AI agents. Underscoring this development is a recent milestone: that the total market capitalization of agent tokens now exceeds $200 million. The area is not only deep but also diverse, with more than seven agents crossing the $10 million individually. And while those numbers could suggest we’re looking at some sort of novelty stage, that’s not the case; these are intelligent, purpose-built agents across a range of real use cases. So let’s take a look at the three standout projects that are currently leading the charge. Virtuals are evolving fast since launching their AI agents platform. The total market cap of agent tokens has recently crossed $200M, with 7 agents already over the $10M mark – showing strong diversity and demand. Let’s explore the top 3 agents leading the way right now pic.twitter.com/XQiEWtcLYT — DappRadar (@DappRadar) June 4, 2025 Solace: Emotionally Intelligent AI from a Hackathon-Winning Team One of the most convincing agents is @solacelaunch, created by an award-winning team of students and researchers from UC Berkeley. Solace is not your average chatbot. It is an emotionally intelligent, voice-driven, AI companion designed to support mental health. Working around the clock, Solace offers live, real-time conversation with a virtual support specialist. It also provides the next level of care, weaving in proactively with check-ins (every two weeks, for example) in a way that is more than just a touchpoint. Solace integrates with your calendar, for crying out loud! (I mean, WOW, that’s a feature!) It even wrangles with your wearable devices—talk about a smart solution. In an industry that is often criticized for its speculative nature, Solace stands out as a project with clear utility and a humanitarian aspect. It is gaining traction with a growing user base and a strong community sentiment driving its valuation upward. As mental wellness becomes an ever more critical global issue, Solace could become the anchor of a new category of AI agents that are dedicated to emotional intelligence and care. BasisOS: Autonomous DeFi Execution with Real Returns @BasisOS—created by @logarithm_fi—is pushing the envelope of decentralized finance automation. Designed to run basis trading strategies on Hyperliquid, this agent takes in market data, spits out trades, and manages the whole operation under a set of preconditions that are defined once, at the beginning, and then left alone. It’s a no-touch, plug-and-play surgery exactly as the human mind intends it to be. BasisOS is showing early signs of proving what it is meant to prove. We should not be confused; this is not an exhibit of the basic operating system that might come with a computer. No, BasisOS is a work in progress—a still-unfinished operating system for the Baseline Protocol that will (in theory) allow users to carry out self-executing, peace-promoting transactions based on a certain set of conditions being met. In an environment where human decision-making frequently results in emotional trading and inconsistent outcomes, BasisOS offers a clear and compelling alternative. Its ascendancy in the market suggests a burgeoning demand for not just passive, but also automated active financial tools that smartly combine executable financial contracts with machine-learning-driven decision logic. If this model scales, it could become the foundational infrastructure for a next wave of DeFi investors—both passive and active. AIxVC Axelrod: The AI Hedge Fund Manager of the Future The top three are rounded out by @AIxVC_Axelrod, an agent created by @AIxVC_io that set out to be a real AI-native hedge fund strategist. Axelrod doesn’t just do what agents like Charles do—replicate trading signals, aggregate data, and otherwise emulate a human hedge fund manager. It builds and manages portfolios using its core MCP (Multi-Chain Processing unit) and ACP (Agent Coordination Protocol), fundamentals that make up the brain and network of a next-gen AI strategist. At Axelrod, we operate across chains and agents. This allows us to assess strategies, allocate capital, and manage risk—all in real time. As a user of Axelrod, you get exposure to the DeFi markets. You don’t have to manage every trade manually. We do that for you. Unlike platforms that depend largely on human direction and the signals of short-term trends, Axelrod’s model is meant for something quite different. It is an artificial intelligence not just for executing orders but for thinking and adapting to the circumstances of the DeFi market. For someone wanting a more intelligent, strategic way into DeFi investing, Axelrod could prove a very good companion indeed. Virtuals Ecosystem Expands Rapidly as New Agents Join The evolving Virtuals platform is becoming an all-encompassing discovery engine. With the daily debut of new agents, it’s delivering a use-case extravaganza that gives users ample opportunity to explore the Virtuals ecosystem. And what a virtual ecosystem it is! The platform is sporting some pretty potent offerings in entertainment, soothing a few nerves yesterday with the launch of an AI-driven “virtual therapist.” How’s that for a use-case pivot? From counselor to custodian… “As the sector matures and more capital enters the space, Virtuals is positioning itself at the intersection of AI innovation and crypto-native application. The next few months will be critical for measuring adoption and impact—but if current trends hold, Virtuals could be laying the groundwork for a new generation of intelligent, decentralized digital agents.” Virtuals is one of the most dynamic ecosystems in Web3 today—in a large part because of utility-driven design, becoming in a large part too because of cross-sector innovation, and increasingly in part because of AI-native development. These three aspects make up the ecosystem’s current dynamism. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, the milestone was met with discontent from longtime backer Arca, whose chief investment officer Jeff Dorman publicly criticized the company for granting a disproportionately small IPO allocation. Circle Soars 167% on NYSE Debut as Investor Appetite for Stablecoins Surges Circle, the fintech firm behind the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, made a historic debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 5 under the ticker symbol CRCL, soaring 167% by the close of its first trading day. The firm’s shares opened at $31, surged as high as 235% in early trading, and closed at $82, signaling strong institutional and retail demand for stablecoin-focused firms amid a shifting financial landscape. Circle share price (Source: Yahoo Finance ) This IPO marks one of the most successful public offerings in the digital asset space in 2025 and underscores growing investor interest in blockchain-native financial infrastructure, particularly as stablecoins become increasingly integrated into global finance. Circle’s public market debut was buoyed by backing from some of the most influential players in the financial world. Notably, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, revealed plans to acquire a 10% stake in the IPO. Additionally, ARK Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, was reportedly eyeing a $150 million allocation. This overwhelming demand led Circle to expand its offering to a marketed range of $1.05 billion, with 34 million shares made available to investors. Circle, which issues USDC, one of the most widely used and regulated stablecoins in the market, has long been regarded as a cornerstone of crypto’s integration with traditional finance. USDC is used in decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and corporate treasury management, and has consistently maintained its dollar peg amid past market volatility. A Comeback Story Amid Delays Circle’s path to going public hasn’t been linear. The company initially planned to debut much earlier but delayed its offering due to broader macroeconomic concerns, including heightened geopolitical tensions and global trade uncertainty. However, with improving market sentiment and increasing clarity around crypto regulation in the US, Circle seized the opportunity to list at a time when investors are looking beyond speculative assets and into real-world utility plays in the blockchain space. The timing also aligns with a broader narrative of institutional migration into digital assets. Companies such as Semler Scientific, MicroStrategy, and various ETF issuers have been pivoting into digital asset strategies, further fueling mainstream interest in firms like Circle. What’s Next for Circle? As Circle transitions into its new role as a publicly traded company, it enters a pivotal phase. It will need to demonstrate sustainable revenue models, regulatory compliance, and technological innovation in an increasingly competitive landscape. Rival stablecoin issuers like Tether, PayPal, and decentralized protocols continue to innovate in the space, and Circle will be under pressure to maintain its lead, especially now under the scrutiny of public shareholders. Nevertheless, with nearly $30 billion worth of USDC in circulation and major backing from legacy financial titans, Circle is positioned as a bridge between the old and the new worlds of finance. Its successful debut is not just a win for the company but a signal to the market: stablecoins are here to stay, and the companies behind them are beginning to claim their seat at Wall Street’s table. Arca Blasts Circle Over 'Throwaway' IPO Allocation as Public Trading Begins Despite the landmark public listing, the company faced unexpected backlash from one of its earliest crypto-native supporters just hours after its launch and subsequent stock surge. Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer of Arca, a digital asset investment firm, published an open letter slamming Circle for what he described as an ”inappropriate” and ”insulting” allocation of just $135,000 in the company’s high-profile IPO. Dorman revealed that Arca had submitted a $10 million order, only to be granted a fraction of that amount, sparking outrage and a complete severing of ties between the two companies. “You are the first and only crypto company that has ever treated Arca this way,” Dorman wrote. “I cannot believe our efforts to help you grow for years culminated in you giving us a joke, throwaway allocation.” Full open letter to Circle (Source: Jeff Dorman ) A Relationship Fractures at a Crucial Moment According to Dorman, Arca had supported Circle since its early days and had shown loyalty during times of uncertainty—including rumors that Circle would delay its IPO due to macroeconomic pressures like trade tariffs. Yet, despite that longstanding backing, Arca was reportedly sidelined in favor of larger institutional players during the IPO. The letter struck a deeply personal tone, describing the snub as a betrayal of the crypto-native ethos that companies like Arca had worked to uphold since leaving traditional finance behind nearly a decade ago. “Most of Arca’s management team left Wall Street eight years ago to start a crypto-native company specifically to get away from TradFi clowns like you,” Dorman continued. “Ironically, you’ve come full Circle.” He concluded by announcing that Arca will close all of its accounts with Circle and actively discourage others from doing business with the firm. The incident with Arca has revealed simmering tensions within the crypto industry. As more blockchain-native companies seek traditional financing through IPOs or venture capital, they increasingly face pushback from early supporters who feel abandoned in the process. The Broader Debate: Crypto-Native vs. TradFi Dorman’s letter shines the spotlight on a growing divide between crypto-native firms and those aligning with legacy financial institutions. While going public offers Circle access to capital and credibility in traditional markets, it also comes with scrutiny, and, as Dorman's critique highlights, accusations of compromising the community-first values that helped the company rise. The reaction has prompted wider discussion on social media, with some voices in the crypto space supporting Dorman’s position and others defending Circle’s strategic decision-making. Some pointed out that large IPO allocations are often driven by investment banks and underwriters who prioritize firms with larger check sizes or strategic positioning.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 05:30:00

At the time of writing, the token is trading at $0.2729, reflecting a weekly decline of approximately 1.5%. However, zooming out reveals a broader uptrend, with TRX gaining nearly 12% over the past month, indicating growing market interest amid a backdrop of increased on-chain activity. An assessment of TRON’s network-level data suggests the blockchain is experiencing a surge in usage. According to a recent analysis published on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform by contributor Darkfost, daily transaction volume on the TRON network has crossed the 8 million mark, a notable increase from earlier this year. This growth in network transactions is considered a critical indicator of underlying demand and user engagement, which could influence market sentiment around the asset. Related Reading: TRON Activity Hits All-Time High, Is a TRX Price Breakout Coming? Transaction Volume and Address Activity Show Strong Network Engagement Darkfost noted that TRON’s monthly average for daily transactions has seen consistent growth, with recent data showing a roughly 2 million increase in average daily transactions since February. The network is now processing over 8 million transactions per day, marking a more than 30% rise over the past four months. Importantly, a large share of these transactions is occurring outside centralized exchanges, pointing to the growing utility of the blockchain for peer-to-peer transfers and decentralized application (dApp) usage. This shift away from centralized platforms may reflect increased interest in TRON’s native ecosystem services and its competitive yield offerings. As more users interact directly with the network, transaction-based liquidity grows, which can contribute to stronger economic activity across the TRON protocol. Darkfost emphasized that this trend of non-exchange transactions is a positive signal for the blockchain’s real-world usage and investor adoption. TRON Active Address Metrics Reach New Highs In a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Cryptoonchain highlighted that both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages for active addresses on the TRON network have hit their highest levels to date. This sustained rise in active wallet participation suggests a growing user base that is consistently interacting with the blockchain. While TRX’s price has not fully kept pace with the uptick in address activity, historical trends suggest that increased user engagement often precedes upward price movement.

In a clear vote of confidence, a wallet linked to blockchain software giant Consensys has moved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH, staking a significant portion through Liquid Collective. Meanwhile, staking queues are swelling to levels not seen in over a year, and spot Ethereum ETFs continue to record sustained inflows. These events indicate that Ethereum might be moving into a new stage of capital involvement—an era that has real potential to move both ETH and the wider altcoin market in new directions. Consensys-Linked Wallet Moves $320M, Signals Confidence In a significant on-chain development, a wallet associated with ConsenSys—one of the principal developers of Ethereum infrastructure and tools—made a $320 million ETH withdrawal from Galaxy Digital, a crypto investment and trading firm. Of that amount, $120 million was promptly staked through Liquid Collective, a collaborative liquid staking protocol. Something big is happening behind the scenes A wallet linked to Consensys just moved heavy: ▸ $320M in $ETH withdrawn from Galaxy ▸ $120M staked with Liquid Collective ▸ All routed through a fresh wallet (0x0b2) $ETH is getting attention This kind of shift tells you… pic.twitter.com/srslTrCICq — Cipher X (@Cipher2X) June 5, 2025 Every transaction was sent to a newly established wallet (0x0b2), indicating an intentional and well-thought-out plan to control the funds through a new wallet. The wallet could serve several purposes: enhanced security, better organization, or some combination of the two. But even without knowing the exact reason for this bit of infrastructure, it is possible to draw some overall conclusions about the funds and the people moving them. These conclusions have to do with what the reallocation of the funds seems to indicate. Such activity delivers a clear signal: the most important Ethereum players are doing more than just staying in the game—they’re doubling down by locking up ETH in staking. You don’t do that unless you’re pretty darn sure the network is secure, will scale, and is on a growth path. Staking Queue Hits Yearly High as Participation Grows Ethereum’s staking ecosystem is accelerating. This week, the number of ETH in the staking activation queue hit a 12-month high—340,000 ETH! And we have recent upgrades to Ethereum’s consensus layer to thank for that, as well as the growing adoption of liquid staking platforms. Most of all, though, we can credit a super-charged risk outlook for Ethereum staking and validators. All of this together spells a very bright future for Ethereum staking. #Ethereum momentum continues to grow with an increase in staking. There are currently over 340,277 $ETH in the queue for staking… the most there has been for more than 12 months! pic.twitter.com/5ROQE9lhrX — Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) June 5, 2025 The increasing queue shows an upsurge in the wish to take part in the network’s validator set, which is a main component of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism. With more ETH locked into staking, the supply of Ethereum that is available to the public decreases, and as such, the price of Ethereum might start to increase. The most recent staking activity on Ethereum has two very identifiable characteristics, and I think it’s crucial to understand both. First, unlike earlier waves of staking, which were dominated by individuals, this most recent wave is clearly an institutional one. Liquid Collective—used by the Consensys-linked wallet—is designed to provide enterprise-grade staking solutions. The retail and institutional staking demand is coalescing and creating an activity flywheel that could have significant effects—not just on ETH but also on the multitude of alternative coins built on the Ethereum network. Spot Ethereum ETFs Post 13 Days of Consecutive Inflows ETH’s institutional demand continues to show up in traditional markets. On June 4, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $56.98 million—marking the 13th consecutive day of positive flows. This continuous call for spot Ethereum ETFs comes from the recent U.S. approval of them, a landmark event that many saw as a key moment in Ethereum’s path to mainstream financial acceptance. At first, the inflows were modest next to those for Bitcoin ETFs, but the steady nature of the flows is starting to attract attention. On June 4, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $86.92 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only ETF to record a net inflow. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $56.98 million, marking 13 consecutive days of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjuIVU — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 5, 2025 Capital continues to flow into Ethereum funds even in the times of wider market instability, indicating long-term institutional confidence in Ethereum as a sustainable, regulated, asset class. This is even more true for Ethereum ETFs because they are an institutional-access vehicle to a regulated crypto asset. Ethereum’s recent advance—driven by significant wallet activity, a staking wave, and fresh ETF inflows—portrays something old and something new. Old: An asset maturing in a swiftly changing crypto landscape. New: The Ethereum altcoin ecosystem, which may be at center stage in altcoin land these days but is also moving rapidly in its own direction. Not just the core protocol but the very idea of Ethereum seems to be finding new ways to make its constituents—applications, tokens, and communities—hold value.

Bitcoin BTC dropped below $101,000 overnight before bouncing modestly, with DOGE and ADA among the worst hit, down over 6% each in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the largest crypto assets, shed over 5%. Data from CoinGlass shows that traders lost $988 million in liquidations — of which $888 million were long positions — indicative of a wipeout in bullish positions. Exchanges like Bybit and Binance saw the biggest hits, with Bybit alone accounting for nearly $354 million in liquidations. The liquidations largely hit major tokens, with bitcoin leading the pack at over $342 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. Ether ETH followed with $286 million, reflecting the sharp sell-offs across the broader market. Other tokens like Solana's SOL and Dogecoin DOGE saw $51 million and $27 million liquidated, respectively, as altcoin traders found themselves on the wrong side of the sudden downturn. XRP XRP wasn’t spared either, with $23 million in positions wiped out. The data also shows that high-leverage plays on memecoins, such as 1000PEPE, added to the volatility, as traders rushed to exit. Liquidations to the forced closure of a trader's leveraged position when they can no longer meet the margin requirements. This typically occurs when the price of the underlying asset moves against their position, causing them to lose a large portion, or all, of their initial investment. A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. The sell-off comes as Trump accused Musk of going “crazy” and threatened to terminate government contracts with his companies, while Musk lashed back by linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein’s files. The clash overshadowed what had been a mostly bullish trend for crypto markets in recent weeks, intensifying a profit-taking bout from the start of this week.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|Dogecoin|Liquidations|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|market analysis|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-06 05:32:26
45585166,https://nulltx.com/?p=150264,1749188090,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin Whales Return to Accumulation as On-Chain Activity Surges,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-whales-return-to-accumulation-as-on-chain-activity-surges/,"The on-chain Bitcoin metrics are showing once more that they are pleased with what they see—that hefty investors and little ones are both accumulating again in the face of a network that is waking up from its slumber and starting to do all sorts of things halt and signal traffic on the blockchain. After a slight divergence in the direction of the wallets, the balance making up the distribution cohort has fallen off, and it seems like the path of least resistance with Bitcoin is up, back over the $100,000 mark. The renewed on-chain interaction is feeding the engine of market optimism. Meanwhile, the institutional flows into spot bitcoin ETFs seem to have stabilized. BlackRock’s fund in particular has captured the attention of investors. Wallet Activity Signals Growing Market Confidence On-chain analytics data show us that all main wallet groups are in accumulation mode right now. The main event, though, is taking place at two very different ends of the spectrum: We have wallets that hold less than 1 BTC, and we have wallets that hold between 10 and 100 BTC. Both of these groups have hit an accumulation score of 1.0—basically the highest score you can get—and it indicates that they are both very widespread and also doing some pretty well-synchronized buying. This development shows a strong contrast with prior weeks, in which it seemed that bigger investors were cutting back on their exposure or remaining on the sidelines in response to the presence of market uncertainty. This renewed activity now seems to imply that these larger holders are either positioning for a potential breakout or, more probably, expressing confidence that Bitcoin’s current levels are a buying opportunity. What is especially remarkable is that accumulation is not confined to whales. Lesser retail holders are also amassing a considerable amount and showing very strong buying behavior. This, most often, is a signal that these small retail holders are long-term holders and is also a signal that grassroots adoption is taking place. On-Chain Activity Hits Multi-Month Highs Momentum is building in the network activity of Bitcoin, with multiple metrics registering their most robust performances in months. The most recent day for which we have data, May 29, saw over 556,830 new Bitcoin wallets created—no day since December 2, 2023, has been even close to that in terms of sheer amount. And the reason I find this most interesting is because (now, I’m going to speak more generally about all cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin) a growing number of wallet-holders is a very good sign for the overall health of a cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10–100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 – the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk — glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 Adding to the feel-good factor, June 2 saw 241,360 BTC move across the blockchain—the most coins sent since December 8, 2024. We typically don’t like to draw too many conclusions from single days, but this is a sizeable figure and could indicate that the Bitcoin network is seeing an uptick in user activity—whether trading, transferring, or otherwise moving assets around. Although price often rules market sentiment, these developments really show what direction the network is headed in. If they’re building a price bottom, then user and developer activity is much more desirable than just the network being used temporarily for price speculation. A close watch is being kept by investors because rising on-chain engagement, with prices being relatively stable, can often be a hint of an underlying build-up of momentum that precedes breakout movements—upward or downward. Institutional Flows Remain Focused on BlackRock’s ETF Even with the overall uncertainty of the traditional markets, the sector of Bitcoin ETFs available for direct investment is attracting a not-too-shabby amount of institutional inflows. As of June 4, the combined net inflow across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs was $86.92 million. Even ETF skeptics like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart have been warming up to the idea that, in 2023, the Bitcoin ETF sector has the look of a legitimate business. Interestingly, on the day, the only fund to see a net inflow was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Others either stayed even or experienced slight outflows. Continued preference for IBIT further consolidates BlackRock’s presence in the Bitcoin ETF space and also is a nice little shot of credibility for the digital asset sector. The net positive flows coming back—concentrated in just one issuer, it must be noted—signal that institutional investors aren’t pulling back entirely. They’re still in the market but seem to be doing a more refined, selective kind of allocation. And when you see selective allocation by big, smart money, it’s usually to what’s perceived as the safest and most credible holdings. With Bitcoin holding steady at just below $105,000, renewed wallet accumulation, record highs in on-chain activity, and an ETF flow that can only be described as resilient combine to present an intricate but optimistic look for the market. We are in a period right now, however, where the market has not yet broken out and up decisively. Consequently, it seems wise to stay vigilant, perhaps even bearish for now, until we do see that break. But from where we sit, the combination of these various factors likely means the market has a good shot at getting up and over, rather than back down under, the $100,000 line with Bitcoin. How long it takes and how close we edge up to the actual line figure before the breakout occurs is the present mystery. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45585193,https://nulltx.com/?p=150263,1749188246,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$13 Billion in Token Unlocks Incoming: Volatility Ahead for Crypto Markets,https://nulltx.com/13-billion-in-token-unlocks-incoming-volatility-ahead-for-crypto-markets/,"In the coming half year, a veritable tsunami of token unlocks is set to smash into the crypto space. The unlocks will make available for trading some $13 billion worth of new crypto assets, and they will do so in a most unimpressive—in fact, unwieldy—manner. Not only are the unlocks mostly concentrated by sector and month, but they are also, in many cases, concentrated in individual tokens. This uneven release schedule threatens to create upward volatility for the unlocked tokens and, in some cases, for the sectors they belong to. How the landscape is expected to shift between June and November 2025, from artificial intelligence to meme coins, and from Layer 2s to restaking protocols. October and July to See the Heaviest Release Pressure Even though token unlocks are slated for the latter half of 2025, two months stand out as potential market disruption points: October and July. October is the month that will unlock the most value—almost $4.8 billion—from two sectors very much in the spotlight: AI and DePIN. These two areas together are responsible for emissions with a total value of over $4.8 billion, the vast majority from just three projects: Worldcoin ($WLD), which is taking the lead with $1.29 billion; $TAO with $427 million; and $GRASS with $410 million. Not only are these three projects the main value unlocks that DePIN and AI have to offer in October, but they also exemplify the very type of overlap that could land the Bitcoin ecosystem in some hot water in the not-too-distant future. As for July, it is meme coins that dominate its events. The notables among them are $TRUMP , which will execute a mind-boggling unlock that will send a staggering $2.03 billion worth of tokens—which is 84.1% of its circulating supply—into the wild. Over six months, meme coin unlocks will total around $2.8 billion, so July’s not only part of the whole unlocking narrative but is, in fact, the bulk of it. We’re talking here about a hugely concentrated event risk in the memiest of meme assets, with 72.5% of emissions coming from a single token. Sector-Wide Emissions Show Risk Concentration When examining the releases from the many different sectors, it’s clear that the emissions from AI-related projects take the top spot at $3.42 billion. In a distant second are the meme tokens—something that I still have trouble getting my head around. Those are responsible for $2.8 billion in unlocks! Layer 2s, a generally positive development for the Ethereum network, follow in third with $1.27 billion. In the fields of Liquid Staking and Liquid Restaking, the amounts and emissions are significant. The Liquid Staking sector alone will see the unlocking of a massive $1.15 billion worth of tokens, with the peak amount unlocked coming in August. The leading token here is $ENA, with a whopping $484 million (22% of its supply) set to be unlocked. Following behind is $ETHFI, with $302 million worth of tokens set to be unlocked. What’s interesting is that $ETHFI also shows up in the Liquid Restaking category, which adds another $302 million to its tally and makes it one of the central players in both sectors. The Restaking segment, slated to release $665 million in value, is highly concentrated and peaks in November. $ETHFI, $EIGEN, and $LAYER comprise 76% of emissions here. At the same time, DePIN spews forth $1.38 billion in emissions and very much parallels AI projects, like $TAO and $GRASS—hence the heft of this month’s impact. As for RWA (real-world assets), that’s seeing just $304 million worth of emissions unlocked but in a far more balanced way. Not a single project’s emissions come close to exceeding the $100 million threshold. Over the next 6 months, $13B worth of tokens will hit the market. Not gradually. Not evenly. And definitely not quietly. • AI leads with a $3.4B wave in October • Memes spike big in July — one token dominates • Layer 2 heats up mid-year with $1.3B Here’s the full breakdown -… pic.twitter.com/6f79J71iwg — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) June 4, 2025 Smaller Sectors, Bigger Ratios Although they represent smaller amounts in absolute dollar terms, sectors such as SocialFi and Gaming expose unique risks due to their high unlock-to-circulating supply ratios. SocialFi plans to release $1.26 billion worth of tokens in a semi-annual format that peaks in June. The two principal tokens involved, $CHEEL and $CONX, represent 85% of the total and will release amounts that are over 14 times greater than their current circulating supply—$CHEEL’s case will be over 13 times (in $CHEEL’s case, over 13 times) their current circulating supplies. This token release is significant, especially considering that it could be or drive a supply- or price-related shock. Gaming unlocks are mild, with only $520 million set to be released. September should bring the largest pushes, starting with the $91 million emissions from $IMX, then a second place of $65.7 million from $APE, and followed up nicely by #BIGTIME with $29 million. Overall, it still feels like the sector is under low pressure compared with other sectors that are facing emission challenges and could lead to price-reducing headwinds. $13 billion in tokens are about to be unlocked. On top of that, they will be unlocked at noticeably concentrated intervals. So, as tolerance of the bear market further engulfs the crypto space, those most affected could be the institutional investors and protocols that have staked assets on the layer 1 and layer 2 protocols most prone to this tokenomics-induced downside. Watching this scenario unfold in slow motion is keeping us on the edge of our seats. Will it trigger a major market correction beforehand? Will the space just be a lot more muted post-unlock?

XRP’s ( XRP ) 24-hour volume rose nearly 80% to $2.97 billion, which can be attributed to the ongoing selloff. At the same time, derivatives data from CoinGlass shows a 70% jump in trading volume, while open interest fell by 3.7%. This shift often indicates traders exiting longer positions and rotating into short-term plays, especially during fast-moving markets. XRP’s latest decline is tied to that of the broader crypto market, which suffered a steep pullback on June 6. It shed nearly 5% as political tensions between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk rattled investor confidence. The clash erupted after Musk stepped down from the Department of Government Efficiency and criticized Trump’s new federal spending bill . In response, Trump revoked a NASA nomination tied to Musk’s circle and warned that his businesses could lose federal contracts. The tension grew further when Musk linked Trump to the Jeffrey Epstein files, calling for his impeachment. Trump fired back, saying Musk had “gone crazy.” Tesla shares dropped more than 14%, and Musk said SpaceX would retire its Dragon spacecraft.

Yet in the midst of all this, a record-setting development pace on the chain is apparently unstoppable. Inferring from the scant actual metrics, this means upcoming major infrastructure changes are cooking up something that should be good for all existing and future SOL holders. This week in the Solana ecosystem, things happened from ETF troubles to announcement of funds running to the billion-dollar level. Let’s break down the week, as that same long-term Solana bullishness we keep talking about seems to potentially be even more entrenched than it was last week. Solana SOL Price Falls, But Builders Stay Active This week, we saw a substantial adjustment in Solana’s base currency, the SOL token. The price of SOL took a dip, from $176 down to about $160. Those figures come from prices across various crypto exchanges. A drop like 9% in a single week is certainly noticeable, and it’s tempting to chalk it up to whatever’s latest and greatest in crypto news. But such a move tends to get most of its energy from the asset itself. Week in Solana: A $1 Billion Bet, Despite SEC’s ETF Questions SOL drops 9% as ETF hopes hit legal roadblocks! MetaMask goes Solana-native! $1B investment plan filed! Bonk enters gaming with a win-to-earn shooter! Let’s break down Solana’s week on-chain and off 1/6 pic.twitter.com/RCLjI4MpF6 — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 4, 2025 One signal, however, keeps flashing green: developer activity. Just in May, over 1.4 million new tokens were launched on Solana, and most of them, let’s be honest, were meme coins. Token launches are a kind of crude but effective way to stimulate development and leverage your community for an ecosystem where experimentation is taken to the next level. Most projects won’t go anywhere, but those that do could evolve into the next big thing. No one might care about meme tokens in a year’s time, but when a layer-1 blockchain attracts the sort of development that Solana has lately enjoyed, it’s not something to be scoffed at. The network’s fundamentals demonstrate resilience even during a price downtrend. Outstanding throughput paired with minimal fees renders Solana one of the most appealing chains for serious developers and casual creators. ETF Doubts Surface, But Institutional Interest Grows The largest tale from a regulatory perspective emerged from the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expressed unease over whether Solana-based staking products could be legally set up as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. The agency’s qualms pertain to the mechanics of staking SOL and whether they ought to satisfy the legal parameters for ETF eligibility under U.S. securities law. The cloud of uncertainty hanging over Solana today poses a potential obstacle to the blockchain’s future attractiveness for traditional institutions. Many of these entities prefer regulated financial products—such as ETFs—in order to obtain exposure to digital assets. Solana being SOS’d in by the SEC was not a favorable development for anyone hoping to see the blockchain keep pace with (or better yet, precede) Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of ETF interest. However, institutional money continues to pour into the Solana ecosystem, and this is resilient to any kind of official opposition. A Canadian firm by the name of SOL Strategies has plans on the table to raise no less than $1 billion, and their entire fund is committed to Solana-based investments. Meanwhile, a firm called Classover Holdings is trying to raise a cool $500 million, and 80% of that capital is designated to be directly used for purchasing and holding SOL in their treasury. Some large-scale investors seem to be interpreting these announcements as something other than a harbinger of regulatory trouble. They’re saying: Long-term bet on Solana. Technical backbone plus economic design equals something with potential. MetaMask Solana Integration and BONK Gaming Expansion This week also brought some noteworthy developments in adoption and ecosystems, especially in the areas of accessibility and consumer engagement. One of the most widely used crypto wallets, MetaMask, has officially launched support for the Solana network. This is available via its browser extension, with mobile compatibility expected soon. This move could significantly expand the number of users interacting with Solana-based dApps and tokens. This is especially true for those already using MetaMask on other blockchains like Ethereum or Polygon. From the gaming and cultural side of things, speculators can forget BONK as a trading vehicle. The project launched Bonk Arena , a browser-based first-person shooter where players earn BONK tokens and, presumably, have a great time doing it. Bonk Arena is in the early access stage (you can play on the official site by connecting your Solana wallet), and that’s fitting, considering that entertainment is the main utility of this meme-ified currency. The launch of the game highlights the speedy development of Solana’s ecosystem aimed at consumers. This part of the ecosystem, which is concerned with providing experiences to users, is where Solana the blockchain meets Solana the foundation. And what kinds of experiences are being provided? Ones that merge games, money, and memes. To summarize, even though Solana’s market performance and regulatory clarity took a hit this week, the network received some very lucrative and promising signals of long-term commitment from builders, users, and deep-pocket investors. The network’s ability to grow in parallel with this uncertainty could just as easily place it as a leader in the next cycle of Web3 expansion. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Solano said it was time for a leaner, faster “org” to take the reins. Solano stated that the ApeCoin DAO was born in a different era and may have just run its course. He added that the DAO started with promise but quickly spiraled into gridlock, governance theater, vanity proposals, and low-impact noise. Too many resources went to vanity proposals and low-impact initiatives. According to Yuga Labs boss, the DAO had become misaligned with the future his company aimed to build, although it was instrumental in bootstrapping ApeCoin’s early momentum. He claimed that the next chapter demanded sharper focus, faster execution, and an operating model that backed only the highest-caliber projects. Solano says the AIP clears the ‘cruft’ and installs a professional operation Since returning as CEO, everything I've worked on has aimed at one thing: getting back to the spirit and velocity of year one, when @gordongoner and I were building Yuga from scratch. We've made huge progress. But the biggest unlock would be in getting ApeCoin rowing in the… — Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) June 5, 2025 Solano claimed that the proposal cleared the cruft and installed a professional operation to direct capital with conviction and strategic intent. Yuga Labs’ co-founder Wylie Aronow said he had no words for how annoyed he was with his partner Greg for making him google the word ‘cruft’ on a Sunday but added that he supported the “f**k out of this idea.” Solano explained that the AIP authorized the orderly transition of assets and responsibilities to the new ApeCo entity established by Yuga Labs. ApeCo’s mission was to supercharge the APE ecosystem by supporting high-quality builders and reinforcing three core pillars: ApeChain, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Otherside. According to the Yuga Labs CEO, the redeeming aspect of the DAO was that it funded builders. He pointed out that Yuga still believed in that mission, but the bar on what was worth funding was going way up. The new model must focus on quality, impact, and alignment with the core of what ApeCoin was meant to power. “The DAO served its purpose, but the game has changed…We’re no longer in the experimental phase. We’re building the best chain in crypto and expanding the most iconic brand in NFTs. ApeCoin should be the economic engine for that future.” – Greg Solano , CEO at Yuga Labs Yuga Labs’s Solano also said everything he had worked on since returning as CEO aimed at one thing: getting back to the spirit and velocity of year one when he and Aronow were building Yuga from scratch. He added that the duo had made huge progress, but the biggest unlock would be getting ApeCoin rowing in the right direction. Makash believes sunsetting the DAO for ApeCo is wise Mak Makash, the founder of the Raccoon Gin Ape project and the main initiator of AiP 495, said he had been building with ApeCoin and ApeChain from the trenches–from IRL integrations to premium products that bridged Web2 and Web3. He added that sunsetting the DAO in favor of ApeCo was not the end but the maturation of what the Ape community dreamed ApeCoin could become. Makash believes this AIP was the long-overdue evolution the ecosystem needed, adding that it brought clarity, speed, and quality over chaos. He also said the ApeChain, BAYC, and Otherside Trinity deserved complete focus since builders would finally have a structure that supported innovation at pace, with accountability and purpose. Makash claimed that he fully supported this shift and was ready to start building under ApeCo. Solano stressed that the transition would unleash faster product development and capital deployment, eliminate governance gridlock that held real builders back, and reignite belief in the long-term utility and cultural significance of ApeCoin. He also said it would make ApeChain the most culturally relevant chain in crypto. The Yuga Labs CEO disclosed that killing the ApeCoin DAO enabled experimentation at the cost of quality and encouraged governance participation but became easy to game. He also said it funded some good builders but many bad ones, and it was never optimized for long-term product development or market agility.

New evidence has now emerged, supporting those claims. On Thursday, a trader paid a premium of over $2 million to purchase a total of 61,000 contracts of June-end expiry ether call options at strikes $3,200 and $3,400, according to data source crypto options exchange Deribit. Theoretically, the $3,200 call is a bet that ether's price will rise from the current $2,460 to over $3,200 by the end of the month. The purchase of the $3,400 call indicates expectations for a move above that level. In other words, the trader anticipates a price surge of over 30% in three weeks. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and pays a premium for the asymmetric upside exposure. The premium paid, in this case, $2 million, is the maximum amount the buyer stands to lose in case the market doesn't rise as expected. Stars align for bulls The bullish flow is consistent with the renewed optimism among some analysts about ether's price prospects. According to Youwei Yang, Ph.D., chief economist at BIT Mining, protocol upgrades, institutional moves, and anticipation around new financial products have all come together to restore investor confidence in ether. Ether's parent blockchain, Ethereum, recently implemented the Pectra upgrade to enhance scalability, validator flexibility, and user experience, introducing key features like EIP-7702 to enable regular wallets to leverage smart contract capabilities. ""The Pectra upgrade , which went live on May 7, has been a key turning point. By raising the validator cap from 32 to 2,048 ETH and doubling blob throughput, Ethereum took a major step forward in both staking efficiency and Layer-2 scalability,"" Yang said in an email to CoinDesk. ""It’s a clear signal that the network is serious about scaling and improving its core infrastructure. That’s the kind of technical progress that brings not just developers, but also users and capital, back into the ecosystem,"" Yang added. Yang cited SharpLink Gaming’s announcement that it would move $425 million into Ethereum as a treasury reserve asbold endorsement of ether as the corporate Treasury asset. ""It reminds us of the early wave of Bitcoin treasury adoption by corporates, and it could be just the beginning of something similar for ETH,"" Yang noted. Lastly, speaking of institutional adoption, speculation has been circulating that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot ether ETF with a staking mechanism, opening doors for institutions to take exposure to both the price and the staking yield, a feature missing in BTC ETFs.

They earned a reward of 3.151 BTC, a windfall presently worth over $330,000. These underdog events shine a light on the resilient decentralization of the Bitcoin network, even if some may now use that phrase as a euphemism for its security flaws. In the early morning hours, a rare event took place that caught the crypto community’s eye and kicked off discussions about whether solo mining is a feasible option these days, given that the mining landscape seems dominated by industrial-scale mining operations. A One-in-a-Million Moment The block, officially mined at 4:48:18 a.m. UTC, was verified as valid and included in the Bitcoin blockchain. The total reward of 3.151 BTC consisted of the standard extbf{3.125 BTC block subsidy}, plus an additional extbf{0.026 BTC in transaction fees} amounting to roughly $2,761. The block itself measured 1.66 megabytes in size and included a standard assortment of transactions. This achievement was accomplished by a solo miner even while the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate was over 600 exahashes per second. Most of the computational work that was assembled from the many mining operations that were running at that time was directed towards solving the puzzles that, when solved, would produce valid Bitcoin blocks. The odds of a single miner successfully completing one of those puzzles and finding a valid block were, of course, exceedingly low. **Bitcoin Miner Hits the Jackpot!** Solo CK mined block 899,826 on June 5, 2025, scoring 3.151 BTC (~$330,386)! Here's the breakdown: • Mined at 4:48:18 a.m. UTC • Reward: 3.125 BTC subsidy + 0.026 BTC fees ($2,761) • Block size: 1.66 MB pic.twitter.com/vJuQoh4YAW — Ahmed Osman (@Ahmedot2Osman) June 5, 2025 Though the exact hardware used by the miner remains unspecified, the consensus among experts is that the conditions—successful mining, that is—would necessitate powerful rigs like the Antminer S21 or WhatsMiner M60, both well-regarded for not just their efficiency, but their sheer output of hash power. Even so, elite equipment alone doesn’t tip the scales toward success; the miner has to have a significant chunk of the global hasrate under his influence. Why Solo Mining Is Rare — and Risky In the domain of Bitcoin mining, the majority of players opt to associate themselves with mining pools, for instance, F2Pool, AntPool, or ViaBTC. These mining assemble the computational might of thousands of miners, dishing out smaller, consistent rewards instead of the solitary, do-or-die nature of mining all by oneself. Mining alone means doing everything a miner must do to find a block and then submitting that block to the network. If a solo miner finds a block, the reward is theirs and theirs alone. Obviously, this is a tremendous payday. And for us to even talk about it here, it must happen in the real world. So, let’s look at what it takes to mine alone, and after that, we’ll consider what it means to have a real-life payday scenario. These infrequent solo victories do happen, though, as demonstrated by the most recent case of a miner using Solo CK, a known solo mining pool that still preserves the spirit of decentralized mining by enabling individuals to point their hardware toward block discovery without profit sharing. A Testament to Bitcoin’s Decentralization Even though industrial mining farms and large, centralized pools of hashing power are on the rise, the occasional story of a successful solo Bitcoin miner is a powerful reminder that the Bitcoin network’s decentralized architecture is alive and well. This is a story of a successful solo Bitcoin miner. By “successful,” I mean this individual consistently brings in Bitcoin rewards (“mined” a few himself, but has “earned” quite a few more through participating in the Bitcoin network). By “network,” I mean the assemblage of many computers all over the planet, doing many computations. By “decentralized architecture,” I mean a system of many nodes by which no one node, or set of nodes, can control the whole system. The miner’s triumph has unleashed torrents of excitement and admiration throughout online spaces. It also resurrects a vital discussion: even in a massively parallel, technologically state-of-the-art mining world, Bitcoin remains a theoretically level playing field. It is yet to be seen whether more people will be encouraged to take a stab at solo mining. But this moment serves as evidence that the solo mining dream is not dead. It’s just incredibly hard. The global mining landscape is evolving rapidly. This makes it all the more crucial to illuminate why Bitcoin inspires and captivates people all around the world. It’s not simply about the cash that’s involved. It’s about the very ethos of this network: permissionless participation and decentralized opportunity.

ETH/BTC is a great cryptocurrency spread for a crypto trader to spot relative performance, provide a direction for which crypto to choose, and track the appetite for altcoins. ETH/BTC rising helped altcoin bull runs in the past cycle - something that many crypto traders have been awaiting and is yet to materialize again. By Elior Manier Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) had a rough beginning of 2025 - failing to reach new all-time highs, while Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) smashed through its own ATH multiple times. Solana ( SOL-USD ), providing a cheaper alternative to ETH services, also held stronger than the Ether throughout the latter part of 2024 and beginning 2025. ETH performance is key to the overall crypto market performance; the past Altcoin cycles have always been led by ETH performance over BTC. ETH/BTC is a great cryptocurrency spread for a crypto trader to spot relative performance, provide a direction for which crypto to choose, and track the appetite for altcoins. Through this crypto market update, you will see how ETH/BTC rising helped altcoin bull runs in the past cycle, something that many crypto traders have been awaiting and is yet to materialize again. ETH/BTC and its Correlation to total Market Performance ETH/BTC and Total Crypto Market Cap, 2017 to End 2021 (Source: TradingView) This 2017-2021 chart of ETH/BTC contains essential information about understanding the crypto market. Through 1 and 2, we observe how the first bull run in ETH and ETH/BTC led to the 2017 total crypto market bull run - taking the market cap from $20-30B average to highs of $620B in November 2017. Number 3 on the chart shows how a drop in ETH/BTC leads to a significant cooldown of the crypto market, going back towards a total market cap between $100 and $250B from 2018 to the end of 2020. From end-2020 to the end of 2021, number 4 shows the same correlation of ETH/BTC and crypto markets rallying. This Covid-era bull run introduced crypto for an ever-bigger number of investors, and led to the flurry of altcoins and cryptocurrency projects such as Doge, Avax, Solana. The crypto market cap went from $300B to $2.86T, and this level only got reached again in November 2024. Finally, number 5 shows similarly to number 3 how the drop in market cap correlates with a drop in the ETH/BTC spread. ETH/BTC from 2020 to Today ETH/BTC and Bitcoin, 2020 to June 5, 2025 (Source: TradingView) We take a closer look at the 2021 Bull Run and how the December 2021 top in ETH/BTC led again a significant correction in the crypto market. 2023 was all about Bitcoin Dominance as its rally from $14,475 to its record highs of $112,030 left Ethereum and all other altcoins lagging. We are seeing a breakout from the descent that started at the same level as the 2020 ETH/BTC bullish breakout - we will see if the spread continues upward and if it generates another bull run for altcoins. ETH Daily Chart ETH Daily Chart, June 5, 2025 (Source: TradingView) ETH had a consequent rally after a significant drop between $4,000 highs in December 2024 to $1,363 lows in April 2025. Prices are consolidating between $2,300 and $2,600. The key is to see if Bitcoin prices that are also stagnating above the $100,000 Mark leads to rallies in other cryptos as the same phenomenon happened in past bull cycles.

At first glance, this spike looks like a return to better days for DeFi. But if you look under the hood, you find another engine powering this move — a single mid-cap token, ZKJ, which has added around 50% of the total DEX volume. ZKJ Outpaces Peers by 68x — But Why? Grasping the scale of DEX dominance by ZKJ takes some doing. Consider this: ZKJ itself ranks only about #106 by market cap. That’s an ordinary mid-cap position. And yet, its daily volume sits at a figure close to $6.8 billion. An absolutely astonishing amount when you compare it to other tokens with a similar market cap. For instance, Apecoin (APE), a much-hosted token that ranks close to a similar market cap as ZKJ, sees about $100 million in daily volume. Of that, roughly 90% comes from centralized exchanges. Those figures don’t come close to the amount of trading volume ZKJ pulls in from its decentralized exchange. By contrast, ZKJ’s DEX volume is 68 times that of APE, an incredible discrepancy that raises uncomfortable questions. We may find those answers in a new feature offered by Binance: Binance Alpha 2.0. Binance Alpha 2.0 offers users the chance to trade tokens listed on DEXs straight through the Binance CEX interface, even when those very same tokens exist nowhere on Binance itself in any official capacity. This accounting system effectively stitches together the usability of a centralized exchange with the liquidity of a decentralized one, all while users nicely nestle inside the Binance UI they’ve grown attached to. This new trading system is responsible for up to 80% of ZKJ’s trading in the last 24 hours. Much of the recent surge in trading this token has seen can be accounted for by this mechanism. And that is not entirely a good thing. 1/ The daily DEX Volume on BNB has increased 7 times compared to early May, from approximately $2B to $14B. However, close to 50% of the volume comes from ZKJ Pairs, the token by @PolyhedraZK . 2/ For context, ZKJ is a mid-cap token that ranked at 106. Their 24H volume is… pic.twitter.com/uEaEPV7tIt — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) June 4, 2025 Suspicious Patterns Emerge: Wash Trading or Farming? Researchers have flagged a troublesome pattern associated with Binance Alpha 2.0. More than 150 wallets that exhibit nearly identical trading characteristics when it comes to ZKJ have been identified. What’s more, the analysis of blockchain data shows these wallets also exhibit the following traits: Almost identical total amount of trading Nearly the same amount of buying and selling Almost the same number of trades Almost the same average size of the trade These similarities are causing worries about wash trading, a practice in which traders (or bots) quickly buy and sell the same asset to boost volume and make it seem like there’s demand — a behavior that’s often linked to point farming or platform incentive schemes. Binance has accepted that bot activity exists within the Alpha 2.0 framework, which is linked to a points farming program. The platform has stated that it is monitoring this activity and doing what it can to minimize it. Nonetheless, the trading patterns that these wallets exhibit with uncanny regularity have led many people to believe that the trading volume associated with ZKJ is not generated in an organic way. The behavior of the execution addresses used for these trades is even more puzzling. Binance, acting as the proxy for DEX trades through Alpha 2.0, should be consolidating activity. But the execution addresses show that the ZKJ trade volume is evenly distributed, which is not at all what you’d expect with user-driven activity. This suggests that either an orchestrated strategy or an automated process is responsible for generating the volume. A Question of Transparency and Metrics Integrity The ZKJ episode brings into focus a much larger problem that DeFi and hybrid exchange platforms are forced to confront. They have to find a reliable way to tell real market interest from fake, artificially generated metrics. Even massive volume figures can no longer be automatically trusted. There are a few well-known mechanisms and possibly a handful of bots doing the work to drive up the numbers. And the industry learns once again that volume alone doesn’t tell the full story. This is a cautionary tale for investors. Although the emergence of Alpha 2.0 and cross-platform trading brings with it the promise of exciting new tools and efficiencies, it also gives us reasons to suspect that those tools and efficiencies are being gamed. So why be wary? Because these developments threaten to undermine the appearance of genuine liquidity in the capital markets. Binance is still under scrutiny, and so is ZKJ; meanwhile, the industry is waiting to find out more and, quite possibly, some stricter safeguards to ensure that the next surge in billion-dollar volumes really is based on user activity — as opposed to wallets that have been programmed to look, in almost every way that counts, like real users.

Recent Shocking Predictions from Experts,https://timestabloid.com/will-xrp-dominate-market-in-2025-recent-shocking-predictions-from-experts/,"Several cryptocurrency analysts have recently reignited the conversation surrounding XRP’s future, releasing price forecasts that vary from optimistic to highly speculative. One such analyst, known by the name CryptoBilbuwoo0, referenced the Fibonacci retracement model to support the view that XRP is approaching a major upward shift. He highlighted the asset’s historical price movement, recalling its surge above $ 3.30, which brought it close to its all-time high, as the basis for setting a series of ambitious targets. According to his projections, XRP may see price levels of $4.29 and $6.78 in a relatively conservative scenario. However, he also proposed extreme possibilities, with the token potentially reaching prices in the $26.60 to $28.80 range, putting it close to the $27 target that another prominent analyst has been predicting for years. More strikingly, he suggests estimates extending to $589 and even $1,458.30, raising concerns over the feasibility of such projections under current market dynamics. More Optimistic XRP Predictions In a similar tone, crypto influencer JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) referred to a rumor connecting XRP’s price to a proposed legislative initiative known as the GENIUS Stablecoin Act . The speculation implied that this development could propel the asset to $250. While he did not reveal the reason behind this prediction, some in the community believe it may have ties to RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin. At this stage, however, these connections are based solely on unverified claims. Adding to the chorus of optimistic voices, analyst BarriC (@B_arri_C) stated that XRP is only at the beginning of a dramatic rise, arguing that a $10 valuation is just the early stage of a longer-term upward trend, with $1,000 as the ultimate target. $XRP to $10 is just the beginning of the explosive price action we will see for #XRP $XRP to $1,000 is where $XRP is heading in the near future — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 3, 2025 Although many detractors often cite market cap concerns, well-known experts with good track records are convinced that the digital asset will hit the $1,000 target .

He believes XRP will dominate 2025, and shared a chart showing a massive green candle suggesting a major price rally. Many experts believe the digital asset will experience a notable price rally this year. While some see targets of $100 or more as impossible, others have debunked market cap concerns and expect massive growth as more money flows into the XRP ecosystem and Ripple’s global partnerships expand.

This warning came in the department’s latest foreign-exchange report to Congress, released on Thursday. The Treasury said the BOJ should respond to what’s happening inside Japan’s economy—mainly growth and inflation—and use that to guide rate hikes. They said this would “support a normalization of the yen’s weakness against the dollar and a much-needed structural rebalancing of bilateral trade.” That means Washington wants a stronger yen to cut the trade deficit and level the playing field for American exporters. Treasury points at pension funds and BOJ’s slow pace Besides interest rates, the Treasury also called out Japan’s massive pension funds, saying they shouldn’t invest abroad to try and affect the exchange rate. “Treasury also stresses that government investment vehicles, such as large public pension funds, should invest abroad for risk-adjusted return and diversification purposes, and not to target the exchange rate for competitive purposes,” the report said. The US has rarely made this kind of direct comment on Japan’s monetary policy, but the weak yen has stayed on Washington’s radar for years. It gives Japanese exporters an advantage. Ultra-low interest rates, according to US officials, are part of what’s been keeping the yen stuck at depressed levels. When asked about the US remarks on Friday, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said the government does not interfere with the BOJ’s decisions. “Based on this, we would like to refrain from making comments (on what was pointed out in the report),” Kato said during his regular press briefing. On pension funds, he added it’s “natural” that they manage their portfolios based on their own goals. While the Treasury stopped short of naming any country a currency manipulator in 2024, it did say it would continue monitoring Japan along with China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland. These countries now face more attention from the US for how they manage foreign exchange policies. BOJ lags on rate hikes as trump threatens bigger retaliation The BOJ officially ended its ultra-loose stimulus last year and finally raised its short-term interest rate to 0.5% in January. That came after signs that Japan might hit its 2% inflation goal. But higher US tariffs have started to weigh on growth, and the BOJ cut its economic forecast in May. Even with that early hike, the BOJ has held off on further moves, making markets think the yen will stay weak. A Reuters poll taken between May 7 and 13 showed most economists don’t expect another hike until late 2024, if it even happens at all. Some believe the BOJ may take action by year-end, but that’s far from guaranteed. The Treasury’s latest report is the first full foreign exchange review since Donald Trump returned to the White House. While the report didn’t accuse any country of outright manipulation, it did put China on blast for what it called “its lack of transparency.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement, “The Trump Administration has put our trading partners on notice that macroeconomic policies that incentivize an unbalanced trading relationship with the United States will no longer be accepted.” Scott added that Washington will “continue to strengthen our analysis of currency practices and increase the consequences of any manipulation designation.” During his first term, Trump often went after countries like China and Japan for what he saw as unfair trade practices driven by undervalued currencies. So far, though, his approach has mostly been through tariffs. Even though the Biden administration had seven countries on the monitoring list back in its final November report, Trump’s Treasury has now added Ireland and Switzerland, expanding the group to nine. Under a law passed in 2015, any country that meets two out of three benchmarks related to trade and currency gets flagged for monitoring. That’s how Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland all landed on the current list. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A lot of traders in the comment section seemed to agree with his sentiment and stated that the decision was long overdue. “People want to kill the ApeCoin DAO. This AIP proposes just that. It’s time for a leaner, faster org to take the reins,” said Solano in his post. On June 5 around midnight, the Yuga Labs CEO launched a proposal on the ApeCoin forum titled “Sunsetting the DAO and Launching ApeCo — A New Operating Model for ApeCoin,” aimed at formally dissolving the ecosystem’s DAO. So far, the proposal has garnered 130 votes from the community. “ApeCoin DAO was a bold experiment, but one born of a different era. What started with promise has devolved into sluggish, noisy, and often unserious governance theater. Too many resources have gone to vanity proposals and low-impact initiatives,” wrote Solano in his proposal. Once the DAO is dissolved, Solano claimed the NFT -led project plans to establish a new entity called ApeCo.

First established in March 2022, ApeCoin DAO serves as a decentralized autonomous organization to govern ApeCoin, the Ethereum ( ETH )-based utility and governance token associated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem. The DAO enabled APE holders to vote on proposals affecting the ecosystem, including funding decisions and strategic directions. However, the community began criticizing the DAO for inefficiencies and funding low-impact initiatives. As previously reported by crypto.news, Yuga Labs recently off-loaded its staple NFT brands such as CryptoPunks, Moonbirds, and others.

During his appearance at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on 5 June, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed the company is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins as a potential tool for international money movement. Stablecoins offer “a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value,” describing the technology as “super interesting” for global businesses. According to Khosrowshahi, while opinions on Bitcoin vary, stablecoins stand out for their utility in payments. “Especially for global companies that are moving money around globally, stablecoin is quite promising,” he added. Stablecoins are digital tokens engineered to mirror the value of traditional currencies, most often the US dollar. Anchored by reserves such as cash or short-term government bonds, they blend the rapid settlement and borderless nature of crypto with the trust and stability of fiat.

As previously reported by crypto.news, Fireblocks’ 2025 “State of Stablecoins” survey found that 90% of the surveyed financial institutions were actively integrating stablecoins into their systems. These include major banks, payment processors, and fintech platforms, many of which now process millions of stablecoin transactions each month. Speed was cited as the top advantage by nearly half the respondents, with cost savings and liquidity also ranking high on the list of strategic benefits driving adoption. Besides Uber, other major companies have also shown interest recently. Stripe’s co-founder John Collison revealed in May that the company has been in early discussions with banks on stablecoin integration. Much of the momentum behind stablecoins can be traced to a global shift toward clearer, more supportive policy frameworks. For instance, in the U.S., lawmakers introduced the bipartisan GENIUS Act , establishing a comprehensive framework for payment stablecoins by outlining various requirements for stablecoin issuers. Elsewhere, in Europe, the rollout of MiCA has set a new standard for how digital assets are treated, giving companies firmer ground to build on. At the same time, regulatory developments have also been observed across Asia, in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong , Singapore , and Pakistan , among others. Read more: Why is crypto down today?

Markets are now poised for a further fall below longer-term levels if current support levels break down. However, the decline slowed during early trading in Asia on Friday morning, with a minor recovery to $3.3 trillion. Donald vs Elon The sharp decline appears to have been driven by a spat between US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who said the former’s tariffs “will cause a recession in the second half of this year,” and “Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!” on June 5. As the war of words on each of their respective social media networks escalated, and the bromance collapsed, Musk also said : “In light of the President’s statement about the cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.” In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 For more than a week, Elon Musk has been trashing Trump’s signature piece of legislation, a spending bill called One Big Beautiful Bill. “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,” said Trump on Truth Social. However, the clearly riled billionaire Tesla CEO didn’t stop there, stating on X that it was “time to drop the really big bomb: Donald Trump is in the Epstein files.” “That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” BREAKING: President Trump’s former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon calls for Elon Musk to be deported, per NY Times. https://t.co/Q82Pbhzppt — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 5, 2025 The pair started to cool off late on Thursday with Musk’s admissions that it may be time to reconcile. $1B in Liquidations There has been almost $1 billion in crypto liquidations over the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass. Around 228,000 traders were wrecked, almost 90% of them in BTC long positions, and the total liquidations were around $988 million, it noted. However, analysts had predicted that a leverage flushout was overdue, with open interest on Bitcoin futures markets hitting all-time highs recently. Bitcoin lost almost $5,000 in a matter of hours, falling to a 4-week low just below $101,000 in late trading on Thursday. However, it found support there and recovered marginally to reach $102,800 during Asian trading on Friday. Analyst “CrypNuevo” said that a quick bounce from this level was unlikely and more consolidation could occur, unless the sell-off accelerates. $BTC update: Plan is playing out so far! Let’s see if this psychological support ($100k) can hold. A quick bounce is unlikely imo. I’d expect that, at best, a small consolidation in this area before any interesting move could be the case – unless if we break below it fast. https://t.co/iWql8N6SW7 pic.twitter.com/CIb1KpJt8i — CrypNuevo (@CrypNuevo) June 5, 2025 The post Crypto Markets See Red as Trump-Musk Bromance Ends in Flames appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|featured1|Donald Trump|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-06 06:04:48

In a civil forfeiture complaint filed Thursday in the District Court for the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice alleged that North Korean operatives obtained jobs at blockchain firms and other tech companies using stolen or forged identities. The workers were paid in crypto, often stablecoins such as USDC and USDT , and used complex laundering tactics to mask the funds’ origin before sending the money back to the North Korean state. DOJ Targets North Korea Digital Laundering Network Authorities said the operation aimed to bypass U.S sanctions. It also sought to generate revenue for North Korea’s weapons program. The scheme was linked to Sim Hyon Sop, a representative of North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank. He was previously indicted in April 2023 for his role in similar activities. Department Files Civil Forfeiture Complaint Against Over $7.74M Laundered on Behalf of the North Korean Government : https://t.co/T6nh2ETMYY pic.twitter.com/o23HY6C6Zw — U.S. Department of Justice (@TheJusticeDept) June 5, 2025 Sim allegedly collaborated with Kim Sang Man, who serves as CEO of Chinyong. Chinyong is a state-linked IT firm operating under North Korea’s Ministry of Defense. To conceal the funds, the workers used several tactics. They allegedly opened fake accounts, split transactions into smaller amount and used token-swapping techniques. In addition, they purchased NFTs as a store of value. According to the Justice Department, the funds moved through a web of platforms and intermediaries. Eventually, the money was routed back to the North Korean government. “This forfeiture action highlights, once again, the North Korean government’s exploitation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to fund its illicit priorities,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s Criminal Division. He added that the department would continue using legal tools to disrupt financial lifelines supporting the regime. FBI Warns of North Korean IT Fraud Using Stolen American Identities Officials from the FBI said the investigation uncovered a widespread effort to defraud US businesses by hiring North Korean workers posing as remote freelancers using stolen American identities. Assistant director Roman Rozhavsky called it a sophisticated threat and urged companies to closely examine their remote hiring practices. Thursday’s complaint is part of a wider enforcement campaign that began in 2024 under the Department’s DPRK RevGen initiative. This effort has focused on both North Korean operatives and the US-based enablers who support them. So far, authorities have taken action against domestic facilitators, crypto traders, and schemes involving data theft by North Korean IT workers. The FBI’s Virtual Assets Unit and its Chicago Field Office led the investigation. They were supported by cybercrime prosecutors and national security attorneys. According to officials, the operation reflects an ongoing strategy to cut North Korea off from the global financial system. Moreover, it aims to stop the regime from using cryptocurrency to evade US sanctions.

Price depreciation and active sell-offs both played a role. Interestingly, financial advisers slightly increased their holdings, but overall sentiment shifted toward corporate treasury adoption of Bitcoin. Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT saw record outflows in late May, while treasury-focused firms like Strategy ramped up accumulation. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group filed for a new Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with Crypto.com as custodian, but raised concerns over a clause allowing affiliated parties to front-run trades. In Romania, the postal service installed its first Bitcoin ATM. Despite positive momentum, only 4% of the global population owns Bitcoin, which means that there is still a lot of room for the crypto king to grow. Bitcoin ETF Activity Dips Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by institutional investors experienced the first quarterly decline since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. A recent report from CoinShares revealed that institutional exposure to Bitcoin fell to $21.2 billion in Q1 of 2025, down from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024. This is a 23% drop. Institutions decreased their Bitcoin exposure (Source: CoinShares ) While the majority of this decrease was attributed to an 11% decline in Bitcoin's price over the period, the report also revealed that many investors actively reduced their holdings. This indicates a combination of valuation loss and deliberate selling. Interestingly, financial advisers emerged as an exception by modestly increasing their Bitcoin ETF holdings during the quarter. The broader trend, however, pointed to a shift away from ETF-driven strategies toward corporate-level adoption of Bitcoin for treasury reserves. This transition means that there is a growing preference for long-term savings and value preservation over short-term trading opportunities. Financial advisers increased their Bitcoin holdings in Q1 2025 (Source: CoinShares ) This changing investment behavior was noticed with major developments in Q2 as well. On May 30, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded its largest single-day outflow to date, with over $430 million withdrawn after a streak of 31 consecutive days of inflows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin treasury companies increased their holdings considerably. CoinShares data indicates that these companies held over 1.98 million BTC by the end of Q1, an 18.6% increase year-to-date. Strategy, the leading corporate holder, acquired 15,355 BTC on April 28 alone and has been consistently buying in 17 of the past 20 weeks through June 2025, according to SaylorTracker . ETF flows remained volatile during the first half of the year, and were heavily influenced by shifting macroeconomic narratives. While many institutional players looked for safety in US government bonds due to uncertain market conditions, rising bond yields suggest that confidence in these traditional havens may be diminishing. Analysts now speculate that Bitcoin's long-term growth may be fueled more by declining demand for US bonds than by continued inflows into ETFs. Trump’s Truth Social Files for Bitcoin ETF Despite these findings from CoinShares, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company majority-owned by US President Donald Trump and parent firm of the Truth Social platform, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF. The proposed product is called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, and was formally introduced through an initial registration statement on Form S-1 filed on June 5. According to the company’s filing, the ETF will primarily hold Bitcoin through a custodian and is designed to reflect the performance of the cryptocurrency’s market price. Announcement from TMTG This move follows a separate submission by NYSE Arca, which proposed listing the ETF on its exchange on behalf of Yorkville America Digital, a crypto asset manager and partner of TMTG. The product, if approved, will enter the very competitive landscape of US-based Bitcoin ETFs seeking to capture institutional and retail investor interest in digital assets. One key structural feature of the proposed ETF is its partnership with Crypto.com , which is set to serve as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider for the trust. The filing shared that Crypto.com agreed to offer certain services exclusively to the ETF’s trust, although specific management and transaction fees for the fund have not been revealed yet. The filing also contains a clause that raises eyebrows: it permits the ETF sponsor and related parties to potentially front-run the fund’s Bitcoin transactions. While such language is typically softened or accompanied by conflict-of-interest mitigation in other filings, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF explicitly warns prospective shareholders that affiliated entities may take positions in Bitcoin that are ahead of or opposite to those of the fund, which could negatively impact the ETF’s performance. Additionally, the filing confirms that shareholders will not receive the benefits of any new assets resulting from blockchain forks. In the event of such an event, the trust will forfeit the Incidental Rights and any corresponding forked assets, essentially removing any future claim for holders. Romanian Post Installs First Bitcoin ATM Meanwhile, Poșta Română, Romania’s national postal service, recently took a big step toward digital innovation by installing its first Bitcoin ATM in a branch located in the city of Tulcea. This initiative was launched in partnership with the local crypto exchange Bitcoin Romania (BTR), and it is the beginning of a broader plan to integrate cryptocurrency services across the country. According to the official announcement , more Bitcoin ATMs are set to be deployed in other cities, including Alexandria, Piatra Neamț, Botoșani, and Nădlac. The move is part of a plan by the postal service to modernize its infrastructure and extend digital financial services to underserved and remote communities. Despite the positive momentum, Bitcoin adoption worldwide is still relatively limited. While enthusiasm continues to grow, especially among retail users and businesses adopting BTC as a payment method or a treasury reserve asset, the total number of global Bitcoin holders is still a very small fraction of the population. According to a Q1 2025 report from Bitcoin financial services firm River, only about 4% of the world’s population currently owns Bitcoin. In the United States, the figure is a bit higher at an estimated 14%. Overall, these results show that adoption is progressing unevenly across regions. River’s report also pointed out that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than $100 increased to almost 30 million in January, which was a 25% year-over-year rise. However, analysts warn that Bitcoin’s total addressable market remains under 1%, with limited retail penetration and institutional allocation. BTC’s market cap compared to the global market (Source: River ) Assuming Bitcoin could eventually secure a 50% share of the global store-of-value market—an estimated $225 trillion in assets such as cash, real estate, equities, precious metals, and art—its current $2 trillion market cap suggests that there is still a lot of room for long-term growth.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 06:06:05

Some operatives ran “laptop farms,” simulating normal work behavior from countries like Russia and Laos. Google had previously taken similar steps, removing North Korea-linked accounts. Meanwhile, tech firms like Google and OpenAI have shut down multiple accounts linked to North Korean deception campaigns. Part of Ongoing Crackdown on DPRK’s Digital Networks This seizure follows the DOJ’s broader DPRK RevGen initiative launched in March 2024, aimed at disrupting North Korea’s growing cyber-financial operations. “ US Sanctions are in place for a reason,” said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. “We will continue to investigate and prosecute anyone helping North Korea fund its illegal weapons programs.” Despite a slower pace under the Trump administration, Thursday’s action signals the U.S. is far from easing up on North Korea’s crypto-powered sanctions evasion. FAQ Who is the Lazarus Group and how are they connected to crypto hacks? The Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking unit. They’ve carried out major crypto thefts, including the $620 million Ronin Bridge hack in 2022 , one of the largest in history. Has the DOJ successfully recovered any stolen crypto from North Korea? Yes. The DOJ has seized millions in stolen and laundered cryptocurrency , including the recent $7.74 million from fake IT workers tied to North Korea.

The new law introduces a licensing framework for stablecoin issuers and service providers operating in Hong Kong. The first batch of licenses is expected to be granted later this year. In parallel, the Financial Secretary issued a notice specifying that unlicensed stablecoin issuers may only offer tokens to “professional investors” as defined under the Securities and Futures Ordinance. Reserve Requirements and Issuer Obligations The regulatory framework mandates full reserve backing with high-quality, liquid assets such as cash, bank deposits, or government securities held in the same currency as the stablecoin. These reserves must be segregated from the issuer’s own funds, held in trust, and shielded from creditor claims. Issuers are prohibited from paying interest on stablecoins but may offer non-interest-based incentives. They must be locally incorporated with key personnel based in Hong Kong and meet minimum capital requirements of HKD 25 million or 1% of the total stablecoin issuance, whichever is greater. Redemption at par within one business day is required under normal conditions. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched a consultation on accompanying guidelines, including measures related to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing. Hong Kong is emerging as a global leader with one of the toughest regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. We spoke to HashKey’s Vivien Wong on what this means for stablecoins, cross-border payments, and HK’s digital finance future. #HongKong #Stablec … https://t.co/QEIPwW5d5q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 3, 2025 Hong Kong Leaps Ahead in Regulating Stablecoins “The upcoming implementation of the Ordinance heralds a structured regulatory environment for stablecoin operations,” said Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui. He described the law as a “significant milestone” in advancing Hong Kong’s digital asset ambitions. The stablecoin ordinance forms part of a broader push by the city to establish comprehensive regulatory clarity around crypto assets, with more nations likely to follow. Currently, the US congress is in the middle of passing the Genius Act which will regulate stablecoins in the country in a similar manner as to Hong Kong.

Security researchers at ThreatFabric say Crocodilus, a new and sophisticated strain of malware that targets mobile banking apps and crypto wallets on Android phones. “Crocodilus enters the scene not as a simple clone, but as a fully-fledged threat from the outset, equipped with modern techniques such as remote control, black screen overlays, and advanced data harvesting via accessibility logging.” ThreatFabric says Crocodilus is emerging as a major threat since it first detected the malware in March. “Notably, its campaigns are no longer regionally confined; the malware has extended its reach to new geographical areas, underscoring its transition into a truly global threat.” One alarming evolution detected in Crocodilus is its ability to infiltrate the user’s contact list and add itself to it, bypassing fraud detection programs that flag callers not in a user’s contacts. “…Crocodilus demonstrates a level of maturity uncommon in newly discovered threats. Already observed targeting banks in Spain and Turkey and popular cryptocurrency wallets, Crocodilus is clearly engineered to go after high-value assets. The rise of new threats like Crocodilus shows that basic, signature-based detection methods are no longer enough—especially in the early stages when the malware first starts spreading.

The tech giant is doubling down on cutting-edge artificial intelligence with a new dedicated research and development group. This initiative focuses on the sophisticated realm of Agentic AI and its application in robotics, signaling Amazon’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of automation and intelligent systems. For those tracking major tech shifts, understanding Amazon’s strategy here provides valuable insight into the future trajectory of AI adoption in large enterprises. What is Agentic AI and Why Does Amazon AI Care? Before diving into Amazon’s new group, let’s clarify what Agentic AI entails. Unlike traditional AI systems that primarily react to specific inputs based on pre-programmed rules or trained models, agentic AI refers to systems designed to act autonomously to achieve complex goals. These AI agents can plan, execute tasks, monitor their progress, and even adapt their strategies in response to dynamic environments. Think of them as AI systems with a higher degree of independence and problem-solving capability. Amazon’s interest in this field is deeply strategic. As a company heavily reliant on complex logistics and physical operations, particularly in its vast network of fulfillment centers, enhancing the intelligence and autonomy of its robotic workforce is a natural progression. Amazon AI recognizes that agentic capabilities can unlock new levels of efficiency and flexibility that static automation cannot achieve. Amazon Lab126: The Home of Amazon’s New AI Robotics Effort The new Agentic AI group is being established within Amazon Lab126 . This is a crucial detail, as Lab126 is Amazon’s secretive hardware R&D division responsible for developing groundbreaking devices like the Amazon Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV. Basing the agentic AI team here strongly suggests that the focus is on integrating this advanced AI directly into physical hardware and robotic systems. Locating the group at Amazon Lab126 indicates a hands-on, integrated approach. The goal isn’t just theoretical AI research but the practical application of agentic frameworks to power Amazon’s next generation of devices and operational tools. This setup facilitates close collaboration between AI researchers and hardware engineers, essential for building sophisticated AI Robotics systems. Driving Innovation in Warehouse Automation with AI Robotics One of the primary drivers behind this initiative is the desire to enhance Warehouse Automation . Amazon already utilizes a massive fleet of robots in its fulfillment centers for tasks like moving shelves and sorting packages. However, current warehouse robots often operate within highly structured, predictable environments and perform relatively simple, repetitive tasks. Introducing agentic AI capabilities aims to give these robots more sophisticated skills. Imagine robots that can: Navigate more complex or dynamic warehouse layouts autonomously. Handle a wider variety of tasks that require judgment or adaptation. Collaborate more effectively with human workers or other robots. Troubleshoot minor issues independently. This push in Warehouse Automation through advanced AI Robotics is not just about speed; it’s about creating a more resilient, flexible, and intelligent supply chain operation. It could lead to significant cost savings, improved accuracy, and faster delivery times, all of which are critical competitive advantages for Amazon. The Broader Impact of Agentic AI and AI Robotics While Amazon’s initial focus appears to be on internal operations and potentially future consumer devices developed at Amazon Lab126 , the advancements made by this new group could have broader implications. The frameworks and technologies developed for AI Robotics in warehouses could potentially be applied to other industries or even licensed out in the future. The progress in Agentic AI itself contributes to the global understanding and capability of autonomous systems. This development underscores the increasing importance of AI, not just as a software layer but as an embedded intelligence within physical systems. As companies like Amazon invest heavily in this area, we can expect to see increasingly capable and autonomous robots become commonplace, transforming various sectors from logistics and manufacturing to healthcare and even potentially consumer homes. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for Amazon AI Amazon’s launch of a dedicated R&D group for Agentic AI and robotics at Lab126 is a clear strategic move. It signals the company’s intention to lead in the development and application of highly autonomous AI systems, starting with its core business of Warehouse Automation . By integrating cutting-edge Agentic AI into its physical operations and potentially future hardware, Amazon AI is positioning itself for a future where intelligent robots play an even more central role in its success. This initiative is a significant step forward in the practical implementation of advanced AI, promising to reshape how goods are handled and delivered on a massive scale.

The fight dragged Elon’s name through the mud on Capitol Hill, sent Tesla stock crashing, and exposed just how fast Republican loyalty can disappear. Despite still holding onto the top spot on the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List with around $388 billion, Elon walked away from this one weaker, isolated, and bleeding cash. The blow-up happened after Elon bashed Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill, calling it a fiscal nightmare. What came next was a brutal wave of GOP backlash. Trump hit back immediately. Elon said Trump should be removed from office. Trump fired back again and threatened to cancel his government contracts. Elon tried claiming he helped Trump win in 2024, possibly by rigging it for him. Republicans rally around Trump and cut Elon loose According to reporting from The Wall Street Journal , Troy Nehls, a Republican from Texas and longtime Trump supporter, told reporters on the Capitol steps, “You’ve lost your damn mind.” He stared straight into the cameras and followed up with, “Enough is enough. Stop this.” Trump’s tax bill, which had passed the House by just one vote and is now being reviewed in the Senate, was the center of it all. Elon called the bill “abhorrent” and accused it of wrecking the budget. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise from Louisiana said, “He hasn’t moved a vote,” when asked about Elon’s impact. Tim Burchett, Republican from Tennessee, wasn’t impressed either. “He’s going off the deep end,” he said, reacting to Elon’s call to impeach Trump. Burchett added that Elon’s money didn’t count for much anymore, saying, “He’s got a huge checkbook, obviously, and this town is gutless.” Elon’s influence had once been helpful to GOP lawmakers criticizing the bill. Now, even White House officials said his outbursts were hurting those efforts. Jim Banks, a Republican senator from Indiana, told CNN Trump was “taking the high ground.” He did admit that Elon had helped cut costs in the past but made it clear the Senate would find its own way to tweak the bill if needed. House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to calm things down. He told reporters that he texted Elon to explain the bill after Elon ignored his calls. Johnson called Elon “a friend,” but rejected his claim about helping Trump win in 2024. “I don’t think any one person deserves credit, but if there is one person, that’s Donald J. Trump,” Johnson said. Elon loses allies, Tesla loses value, and Trump walks away stronger Meanwhile as Tesla’s stock tumbled, Forbes calculated his losses at $27 billion, making it one of the worst financial hits he’s ever taken. Even with a massive lead over Mark Zuckerberg, who holds about $236 billion, and Trump, who sits at $5.4 billion and ranks 689th, the loss stung hard. Only a few Republicans dared to support Elon after the dust settled. Two House members who voted against the bill—Thomas Massie from Kentucky and Warren Davidson from Ohio—publicly backed him. Another outlier, David Schweikert of Arizona, said, “Musk is absolutely right,” when asked about the growing debt. Others called it a messy breakup. Aaron Bean, a Republican from Florida and head of the DOGE caucus, said, “You see two friends fighting, and it’s sad that it escalated so quickly.” Bean still pledged support for DOGE and added, “Maybe they can share a Diet Coke together.” But even jokes couldn’t hide the fallout. Elon’s influence in Washington is now seriously damaged. Tensions had been building for weeks. Elon was already mad that the White House pulled Jared Isaacman, a close ally of his, from consideration to lead NASA. He also hated new rules in the tax bill that would remove EV tax credits, a huge blow to Tesla’s bottom line. Still, none of that stopped Republicans from cutting ties. Ralph Norman, a Republican from South Carolina, said, “When you get two strong personalities, it’s bound to happen.” He called the feud “sad for the country” and added, “No one else had the bandwidth to do what he’s done, to identify what he’s done.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-06 07:10:34

Now that it’s back, is it signaling latent momentum. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s quiet volume may be its loudest signal yet Decoding Bitcoin’s Super Signal Institutional investors are still buying the dip Bitcoin’s quiet volume may be its loudest signal yet Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price has eased slightly since reaching a peak of $111,970 on May 22, pulling back to around $103,300 as of June 6, a decline of approx 8%. Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Despite the drop, institutional appetite appears to remain intact. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded around $5.24 billion in net inflows during May, suggesting that investor interest has not diminished with the slowdown in price momentum. Meanwhile, sentiment indicators are showing a neutral picture. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 46, placing the market in the “Neutral” zone and waiting for further triggers. Amid this, on-chain analyst CryptoCon has highlighted a rare but historically consistent pattern known as the “Bitcoin Super Signal.” The signal is triggered when trading volumes fall to extremely low levels while prices remain in a broader uptrend. A new Bitcoin Super Signal has appeared, which happens when volume reaches extremely low levels inside a bull market. This is the lowest volume reading since 2014. The other super signal this cycle gave us a 200% run from October 2023 to March 2024. Before that, only two other… pic.twitter.com/Zkd4rzDaTi — CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) June 4, 2025 Based on CryptoCon’s data, current trading volume is at its lowest level since 2014. Only three previous instances have met the same criteria. Each one was followed by a significant bull run. So far, there is no clear evidence that the current cycle has reached a peak. Bitcoin continues to trade within bullish territory, while volume continues to decline. Historically, this combination has preceded sharp upward moves, even if the market appears quiet on the surface. To make sense of what this signal could mean now, we need to look at its previous appearances, how each one played out, and why it tends to emerge when market conditions appear deceptively calm. Decoding Bitcoin’s Super Signal In Bitcoin’s chart history, sharp rallies often emerge after extended periods of low activity. The Volume Oscillator Super Signal is one of the few indicators that captures this pattern by using volume, rather than price, as the leading input. It highlights moments when trading activity drops to historically low levels while the broader trend remains upward. Only four such signals have appeared: December 2012, October 2016, September 2023, and most recently, June 2025. The indicator works by applying a volume oscillator to Bitcoin’s monthly chart. When volume dips below a defined threshold during a bull trend, it signals a shift in market structure. Most sellers have likely exited, and buyers may be accumulating with minimal resistance. From a liquidity perspective, this implies reduced supply pressure. As a result, even moderate demand can push prices higher once market momentum returns. In 2012, the signal appeared when Bitcoin was trading below $15. Over the following year, the price surged more than 10,600%, forming the 2013 bull cycle that brought Bitcoin into mainstream attention. The next instance came in October 2016, when Bitcoin stood near $700. The cycle that followed peaked around $20,000 in late 2017, marking a 3,461% increase from the signal to the cycle top. In both cases, the signal emerged during low-volume periods, not at moments of retail frenzy. Price was climbing steadily, but broader interest had not yet returned. The same pattern repeated in September 2023. Bitcoin was trading around $25,000, volume dropped into the “extreme low” zone, and the market remained cautious due to macro uncertainty. Within six months, Bitcoin reached $75,000, posting a 200% gain. Institutional investors are still buying the dip The latest Super Signal appeared in June 2025, as the Volume Oscillator dropped into its extreme low zone. Current readings show the lowest volume level since 2014, despite Bitcoin still trading above $100,000 and U.S. spot ETFs continuing to record multi-billion dollar inflows. The contrast may seem counterintuitive, but historically, low volume in a bullish setup often signals that sellers have exited and buyers are accumulating quietly. In such conditions, market depth shrinks. Even moderate inflows of capital can move prices significantly due to a lack of sell-side resistance. Chart data supports this pattern through color-coded volume zones. Red boxes, which mark volume blow-offs and often indicate market tops, have consistently appeared at the end of previous bull cycles, including in 2014, 2018, and 2021. None has appeared so far in this cycle. In contrast, blue-circled areas highlight the Super Signals — moments when volume reaches deeply suppressed levels while the trend remains upward. These signals have historically emerged at early or mid-stages of a rally, not at its end. The current chart closes with a question mark near today’s price, suggesting the current move may still be unfolding. It is important to distinguish between Super Signals and standard volume pivots. Not all volume dips lead to strong rallies. Green-circled pivots on the oscillator identify periods of moderately low volume followed by smaller upward moves. Super Signals occur only when volume is at unusually low levels and the broader price structure remains intact. Macroeconomic conditions add further context. The fiscal environment has shifted once again following the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which brought renewed government spending and added concerns about long-term liquidity. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain elevated, and risk assets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a softer global monetary stance. In that backdrop, Bitcoin holds a structurally favorable position. ETF flows continue to provide consistent demand. Sell-side pressure remains limited, and trading volumes are compressed, creating a setup where price can move quickly if fresh capital enters. On-chain behavior reflects a shift back toward accumulation. According to Glassnode, wallets holding between 10 and 100 BTC now show a perfect accumulation score of 1.0, indicating strong, sustained buying activity. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10–100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 – the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk — glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 The same score has been recorded in wallets holding less than 1 BTC, suggesting retail interest is also building.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bonk (BONK) Source: TradingView Bonk (BONK) has experienced a mixed market trend lately. The price fell by 18.01% over the past week but gained 3.35% in the last month. Over six months, however, it has dropped by 60.21%. Currently, BONK trades between $0.00001427 and $0.00002061. Technical indicators show potential for movement. The RSI stands at 46.91, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic is at 31.50, nearing oversold territory. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.0000001055, suggesting mild bearish sentiment. The price is close to both the 10-day SMA at $0.00001687 and the 100-day SMA at $0.00001677. If BONK breaks above the nearest resistance at $0.00002435, it could target the second resistance at $0.00003069, gaining about 18% and 49% from the current price, respectively. If it dips below the nearest support at $0.00001167, it may test the second support at $0.00000533, potentially decreasing by 18% and 63%. Investors are watching these levels to determine BONK's next direction. Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe (PEPE) has seen notable movements recently. In the past month, its price surged by 54.41%, bringing excitement to investors. However, the past week showed a decline of 10.11%. Over six months, the price decreased by 41.17%. Currently, PEPE trades between $0.00001013 and $0.00001429. Technical indicators provide some clues. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 52.95, indicating neutrality. The Stochastic indicator reads 45.51, also neutral. The MACD level is 7.4190e-9. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $0.00001238, just above the 100-day SMA of $0.00001194, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. Looking forward, the nearest resistance level is $0.00001678. Surpassing this could lead to the next resistance at $0.00002093. On the other hand, if the price dips, the nearest support is at $0.00000847, with a second support at $0.00000431. Monitoring these levels is important, as breaking them could result in significant price shifts. Conclusion BONK and PEPE have made impressive strides, but XYZVerse (XYZ) is set to surpass them with its unique sports-meme blend and ambitious growth plans.

On June 10, lawmakers will review the CLARITY Act, a bill aimed at setting clear rules for digital assets. This review, called a markup, is a key step before the bill can be voted on in the House of Representatives. NEW: @FinancialCmte has officially scheduled a markup of the crypto market structure bill — the CLARITY Act — for Tuesday, June 10 at 10:00 AM EST alongside a handful of other bills. Prepare for a marathon markup sesh! pic.twitter.com/qx6br4hJN9 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 5, 2025 What is CLARITY Act ? The CLARITY Act is designed to make it easier to understand how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the US. It gives clear definitions for digital assets and outlines which agencies, like the SEC and CFTC, should handle what. The goal is to provide a single, easy-to-follow framework for the crypto market. Many in the crypto industry support the bill. Ripple’s legal chief, Stuart Alderoty, called it a big win and a solid foundation for future laws. Lawmakers from both political parties also back the bill, showing rare bipartisan support in Washington. Rep. Bryan Steil supports the CLARITY Act to bring clear crypto rules and protect consumers. However, some critics push for the Fair Tax Act, which would scrap the IRS and replace all federal taxes with a national sales tax for a simpler system. Why the GENIUS Act Matters Too However, the future of the CLARITY Act depends on another bill known as the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoins. If the GENIUS Act fails, it could slow down or block progress on the CLARITY Act. The Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act soon, and many are hopeful it will pass. Democrats Sound the Alarm However, Democratic lawmakers and key witnesses weren’t convinced. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad urged a complete rethink, suggesting the SEC and CFTC work together on a clearer framework instead of redefining legal terms around securities and commodities. Democrats argued the bill would undercut the SEC’s oversight and leave parts of the industry unregulated. Representative Maxine Waters warned that the bill introduces vague definitions and could trigger more lawsuits, giving big banks an advantage over startups. Rep. Stephen Lynch added that the bill seemed designed to allow large crypto firms to skirt proper regulation. Push to Add More Protections Several crypto groups are also asking lawmakers to include another proposal called the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. This would protect DeFi developers who do not manage customer funds, helping them avoid being treated like traditional banks. With growing support and rising pressure, the June 10 session will be a key moment for the future of crypto regulation in the US. FAQ What is the GENIUS Act and what does it regulate? The GENIUS Act establishes a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, requiring issuers to maintain fully backed reserves and regular consumer disclosures. It assigns the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as the main regulator and offers an optional state-level regime for smaller issuers How will the CLARITY Act impact crypto businesses and investors in the U.S.? If enacted, the Act will provide a stable and predictable regulatory environment, making it easier for businesses to comply and for investors to understand their rights and protections.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 07:14:25

According to data from crypto.news, Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) rose 23% to hit an intraday high of $1.07 on June 6 before slightly cooling to $1.04 during the morning Asian session. The token is now up 372% from its year-to-date low. Fartcoin’s market cap has now reclaimed the $1 billion mark. Daily trading volume also doubled to $414 million compared to the previous day, suggesting a significant spike in investor activity. FARTCOIN’s recent addition to Coinbase’s listing roadmap played a key role in driving the price surge. While this doesn’t guarantee immediate trading, the exchange noted that “the launch of trading for these assets is contingent on market-making support and sufficient technical infrastructure,” and a separate announcement would follow once those conditions are met. Coinbase’s announcement came amidst a broader market downturn, sparked by rising political tensions between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, both influential figures in the crypto industry, which shook investor confidence. You might also like: Why is crypto down today? Trump-Musk fallout rattles sentiment, Dogecoin drops 20% Still, the news was enough to spark optimism among Fartcoin traders. A Coinbase listing is typically seen as a major catalyst, opening the door to millions of new users and liquidity. That anticipation seems to have turned the overall sentiment positive, especially on social media platforms. Retail enthusiasm was further fueled by whale activity. Smart money tracker Stalkchain reported that a whale recently scooped up nearly $3 million worth of FARTCOIN, which added to the buying pressure. Such large buys from experienced or institutional investors tend to boost confidence among smaller retail holders and often lead to price surges. Fartcoin price analysis On the technical front, FARTCOIN is currently testing the upper edge of a broadening wedge pattern on the 4-hour USDT chart, a setup often seen as a bullish reversal signal. FARTCOIN price, 50-day SMA — June 6 | Source: crypto.news The token is also closing in on its 50-day moving average, with momentum indicators flashing positive signs. Both the Relative Strength Index and Stochastic Oscillator are trending upward, while the MACD just made a bullish crossover, indicating growing momentum. FARTCOIN MACD and RSI chart — June 6 | Source: crypto.news According to technical analyst Waleed Ahmed, FARTCOIN has formed a bullish Shark Harmonic pattern, which typically points to a strong upside move. A clear breakout above the broadening wedge could invalidate the recent bearish outlook, which had taken shape after the token fell 47% from May 23, when it broke out of an ascending channel . Hence, if the bullish momentum persists, the next upside target is around $1.47, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and a key resistance zone. However, if FARTCOIN fails to hold above the crucial $1 psychological support, sellers may try to push it down to $0.50, a level that would represent a 61% drop from current prices.

In contrast, many alt competitors, such as ETH, BNB, DOGE, ADA, SUI, and LINK, have marked more substantial declines. Consequently, CRYPTOWZR noted that XRP is doing “much better” compared to them. They believe the asset’s actual breakthrough can occur once the XRP/BTC trading pair improves. For now, though, this hasn’t been the case as BTC has taken the latest correction better and is down by just 1%. ERGAG CRYPTO, another popular analyst with over 84,000 followers on X, noted that the upcoming weekend will be crucial for XRP’s price. They said the “retest box” (visible in the chart below) was barely hit, and “we need to see what will happen during the weekend.” In order to turn bullish, the asset would need to close above certain thresholds, the first being $2.3. However, the biggest challenge will be a closure north of $2.65, which will be the “go-go signal.” #XRP – Short-Term Move: To have #Bullish break-out then #XRP has to close: 1️⃣ $2.30 2️⃣ $2.35 3️⃣ $2.36 – break-out from MEGA falling wedge 4️⃣ $2.45 5️⃣ $2.65 Is Go-Go signal #XRPFamily STAY STEAD and STRONG , Together We Rise pic.twitter.com/3Z2TfmWxEV — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 5, 2025 The post XRP Price Closed Bearish: But Here’s The Good News appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-06 07:15:46

Although both digital assets have been available for over a decade, the crypto commentator insists that their most significant gains could still lie ahead. His analysis is centered on the long-term fundamentals of these cryptocurrencies, including supply constraints, increasing institutional demand, and geopolitical shifts that favor broader crypto adoption. Why Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics Point to Massive Upside According to Coach JV, Bitcoin’s scarcity remains one of its strongest value drivers. He notes that 95% of all Bitcoin has already been mined and distributed, leaving only 5% of the supply available for future circulation. This limited supply, coupled with rising demand from both retail and institutional buyers, creates a high probability of price escalation. Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, recently remarked that Bitcoin is in high demand and few are willing to sell, reinforcing the argument that growing interest is colliding with limited supply. Trump, who backs conservative financial policies, placed his baseline price prediction for Bitcoin at $170,000 but acknowledged that the $1 million figure is within reason. Coach JV highlighted that global leaders and political figures are now aligning with pro-Bitcoin policies. He referenced President Donald Trump’s executive order directing the United States to retain its Bitcoin holdings and not liquidate them. This move aligns with several pro-crypto legislative proposals now circulating in Washington, signaling a shift in official sentiment toward digital assets. Institutional Interest and Global Policy Add Momentum Momentum is also building internationally. Zia Yusuf, chairman of Reform UK, warned in a Bloomberg interview that the UK could fall behind economically if it excludes Bitcoin from its sovereign wealth fund. Such warnings underscore the asset’s increasing relevance at a governmental level, a trend that Coach JV argues could support prolonged upward movement in Bitcoin’s price. Supporters of the bullish outlook claim that this global policy trend may move Bitcoin out of its traditional four-year bull-bear cycle into a longer-term growth phase. This new environment, they argue, could be the catalyst for a significant number of new millionaires who accumulate the asset early enough. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin Compared to Early Tech Stocks Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, provided further historical perspective by comparing Bitcoin’s current market position to Apple’s in the mid-1990s. He stated that investing in Bitcoin at $105,000 in 2025 would be similar to buying Apple stock in 1995. Youngelman emphasized that a $1,000 investment in Apple in 1995 would now be worth $63 million, implying that Bitcoin may offer a comparable trajectory over the coming decades. XRP’s Millionaire Potential Coach JV also underscored XRP’s potential as a wealth-building asset. He believes XRP is positioned to benefit from the same wave of financial transformation that is propelling Bitcoin. The analyst argued that as Bitcoin rises, XRP could follow, especially as regulatory clarity around XRP continues to improve. Support for this view comes from other notable voices in the crypto space. Edo Farina predicted that XRP could increase by over 4,000% to reach $100 if Bitcoin reaches the $500,000 mark. Under this scenario, an investment of 10,000 XRP tokens, valued around $20,000 today, could grow into a $1 million portfolio. In addition, BarriC, another market analyst, suggested that XRP could trade between $500 and $1,000 by the 2030s, depending on the broader crypto market’s growth. While these figures are speculative, they reflect the growing optimism about XRP’s potential to create substantial wealth for long-term holders. Coach JV’s analysis, supported by numerous voices in the financial and political space, presents a compelling case that Bitcoin and XRP could generate significant wealth in the years ahead. His perspective emphasizes that, despite their past gains, both assets may still be in the early stages of global adoption. As institutional interest, supply dynamics, and regulatory policies align in favor of crypto, the road to millionaire status may remain open to those who position themselves accordingly.

45588564,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/top-meme-coins-to-buy-in-june-with-50x-potential-for-early-investors,1749194370,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/45588564.jpeg,Top Meme Coins to Buy in June with 50x Potential for Early Investors,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/top-meme-coins-to-buy-in-june-with-50x-potential-for-early-investors,"A new wave of digital tokens is making waves in the cryptocurrency market this June. These meme-inspired coins are gaining traction among investors seeking high-growth potential assets. This article unveils some of the most promising tokens that could offer substantial returns, spotlighting opportunities that early investors might find particularly enticing. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Dogecoin: From Internet Joke to Crypto Contender Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. Its creators used a popular Shiba Inu meme as the logo to bring fun into the cryptocurrency world. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there's no maximum limit. What began as a ""memecoin"" soon gained a massive following. In 2021, its value skyrocketed, making it one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Social media buzz, particularly from Elon Musk, and a booming crypto market pushed its total value beyond $50 billion. Dogecoin shows the power of community and social influence. Its technology is based on Litecoin, allowing fast and low-cost transactions. While some see it as less serious than other coins, its growth tells a different story. In the current market, Dogecoin's plentiful supply and strong fan base could be strengths. Compared to others, it remains affordable and accessible. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin stands out by blending fun with real-world value. Shiba Inu: The Memecoin Turning Heads with Ethereum Power Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by the success of Dogecoin. Created by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB sets itself apart by running on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can tap into Ethereum's vast network of applications. SHIB began with a whopping one quadrillion tokens. In a bold move, half were sent to Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder. Buterin's donation of a large chunk to India's COVID-19 relief and the burning of 40% of the total supply put SHIB in the global spotlight. What makes SHIB exciting is its potential beyond memes. Its connection to Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade without a middleman. Plans are underway for a future NFT platform and a system where the community can have a say in decisions. Unlike Dogecoin, which doesn't have these features, SHIB aims to offer real utility. In the current market, where investors look for coins with solid technology and growth potential, SHIB stands out. Its blend of fun and function could give it an edge over other cryptocurrencies. Breaking Wind in Crypto: FARTCOIN's Memetic Revolution FARTCOIN is the latest memecoin bubbling up on the Solana blockchain, blending internet humor with crypto culture. This playful token invites users to join a fun-filled ecosystem where they can earn FARTCOIN by submitting fart-themed memes, jokes, or short content. Every transaction comes with a cheeky twist: a digital fart sound effect, turning routine transfers into laugh-out-loud moments. It's a lighthearted nod to blockchain's ""gas fees,"" making each interaction a memorable experience. Behind the humor lies innovative technology. The ""Terminal of Truth,"" an AI-powered content engine, fuels creativity and community engagement. By harnessing user-generated content and artificial intelligence, FARTCOIN transforms viral humor into a decentralized social movement. In the current market cycle, where investors seek projects with strong communities and unique value propositions, FARTCOIN stands out. While established coins focus on serious applications, FARTCOIN taps into the memecoin trend popularized by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu but adds its own distinctive flavor. Its potential for virality and community growth could make it an attractive option for those looking to explore the lighter side of crypto. Trump Coin: A Memecoin With Political Roots On January 18, 2025, Donald Trump launched his own memecoin, the Official Trump token (TRUMP), just days before his second presidential inauguration. Designed on the Solana blockchain, TRUMP quickly rose to prominence, peaking at $75.35 the day after its release. However, its value has since declined, reaching an all-time low of $7.14 by April 7, 2025. The memecoin can be used to buy Trump-related memorabilia, giving it some real-world utility that sets it apart from many other celebrity-based tokens. While TRUMP experienced an initial surge in popularity, its future remains uncertain. With a highly centralized supply—80% of the coin's total circulation held by one wallet—and no official whitepaper, concerns about its long-term viability persist. Despite this, its recent price movement has shown some signs of recovery, with technical indicators pointing to a potential rise toward the $10.50 resistance level. Investors and enthusiasts alike are watching closely, wondering whether this celebrity-backed memecoin will have the staying power of other digital currencies or fade into obscurity.

News Background XRP’s week-long price action was influenced by a mix of fundamental developments and market speculation. Ripple recently received approval from Dubai regulators for its RLUSD stablecoin, underscoring the company’s ambition to integrate digital assets into cross-border payment systems. Meanwhile, the market is closely watching for a decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF, expected by June 17. Approval could attract substantial institutional inflows, potentially transforming XRP’s liquidity profile. On the technical front, XRP’s consolidation above its 200-day moving average signals resilience despite broader market volatility. Ripple’s broader strategy — bridging crypto and traditional finance — continues to define XRP’s role as both a settlement asset and a risk-on hedge against traditional assets. Price Action The rebound followed a sharp sell-off that saw XRP tumble to $2.07 during the 19:00-20:00 hour, with volume spiking to 228.6 million units — nearly double the daily average — suggesting capitulation selling rather than steady distribution. XRP’s price has since formed a higher-low pattern with bullish momentum returning as buying interest surged in the $2.10-$2.15 range. While XRP’s price action has regained ground, the $2.50-$2.60 resistance zone remains formidable. The market remains cautious, with traders eyeing the potential ETF decision as a catalyst for a sustained breakout. Technical Analysis Recap XRP climbed from $2.07 to $2.20, a 7% gain. The most significant selling occurred between 19:00-20:00, with volume hitting 228.6 million units — nearly double the daily average. Resistance formed at $2.50-$2.60, with price struggling to sustain gains beyond these levels. Support established at $2.07-$2.10, with high-volume buying interest stabilizing the price action. Price action has formed a higher-low pattern with bullish momentum, though market caution persists. XRP remains technically within a symmetrical triangle formation, hinting at potential breakout scenarios if volume increases and resistance is breached.

With Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum falling, XRP has also slipped over 4% as traders react to political tensions and a wider market sell-off. XRP Nears Key $2.40 Resistance Despite the recent drop, XRP appears to be gaining momentum. Analyst Dark Defender shared recently that XRP is nearing a major resistance level on the weekly chart. If it breaks this key level along with the RSI barrier, it could trigger a strong upward move. He shared that XRP has a strong price support at $2.22. If it holds above this support and breaks key resistance levels like $2.40, it could shoot up to as high as $5.85, an increase of about 144%. The market seems to be ticking toward a breakout, and excitement is building across the XRP community. Analysts Point to Crucial Resistance at $2.36 for Breakout Analyst Egrag Crypto also shared that for a short-term bullish breakout, XRP needs to first close above $2.30 to show buying interest, then surpass $2.35 to build momentum. The crucial level is $2.36, where XRP would break out of a major falling wedge pattern, which is a classic technical signal hinting at an upward trend. If it further closes above $2.45, then it shows strong bullish control, and crossing $2.65 is the key for a big upward move. XRP Could Follow 2017 Pattern, Rally Soon? If XRP follows its 2017 pattern , a final breakout could start in 2-4 weeks. It has already been consolidating for 190 days, close to the 210-day mark back then. So, a big move might be around the corner. But, it may first dip to $2 to grab liquidity before pumping. XRP is trading around $2.12, down 4% in 24 hours. It is now testing key support near $2.07. If it breaks lower, more losses could follow. Almost all of the moving averages are negative except the 200-day EMA at $2.08, which might act as support. Indicators like MACD remain bearish, and traders seem to be waiting for a clear move. All eyes are on June 16 next, as a major Ripple v. SEC update is expected, which could decide XRP’s course. Institutional interest in XRP is also growing as VivoPower, Webus, and ACG are making major investments.

Nigerian authorities released Gambaryan on humanitarian grounds in October and later dropped all charges. His departure comes as Binance moves to resolve its US legal battles. Head of financial crime compliance at Binance, Tigran Gambaryan, is leaving the exchange after an eight-month legal ordeal in Nigeria that drew international attention. Gambaryan, a former US Internal Revenue Service agent, confirmed to Bloomberg News that Friday is his last day at Binance. The Nigerian government detained him last year on money laundering and currency manipulation charges after he traveled to the country on behalf of Binance. Binance Exec Released on Humanitarian Grounds as Nigeria Drops Charges Gambaryan was released in October on humanitarian grounds after his health deteriorated in detention. Nigerian authorities later dropped the charges. “Tigran has made a lasting impact on Binance, just as he did in his previous roles in law enforcement,” a Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg. “We are deeply grateful for his dedication in transforming our financial crimes compliance organization. Thanks to his tireless efforts, the crypto industry is safer for all.” The episode marked a tense chapter for Binance’s global operations. Binance CEO Richard Teng previously alleged in a blog post that officials in Nigeria had sought a “secret” payment to resolve the case — a claim Nigeria denied. Before joining Binance in 2021, Gambaryan built a reputation as a top crypto crimes investigator for the US government, earning the nickname “Crypto Wizard” for tracing illicit blockchain transactions. At Binance, his work focused on enhancing the company’s anti-money laundering protocols and assisting global law enforcement with asset seizures as regulators intensified scrutiny of major exchanges. Tigran Gambaryan, the Binance compliance officer who was unjustly detained in Nigeria, receives the first ever Digital Chamber Hero Award pic.twitter.com/J84L3CpnY2 — CryptoLaw.avax (@RussellKlein) March 26, 2025 His departure comes as Binance moves closer to resolving legal issues in the US. Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a joint motion with Binance to stay its case in federal court. The SEC sued Binance in June 2023, accusing it and co-founder Changpeng Zhao of mishandling customer funds and violating securities laws. Binance and Zhao pleaded guilty to separate charges in November 2023, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in penalties. Zhao was fined $50 million, stepped down as CEO, and served four months in US prison. CZ Confirms Pardon Request After Initial Denial In May, CZ confirmed that he has formally applied for a presidential pardon, weeks after initially denying reports of such a move . Speaking on the Farokh Radio podcast aired May 6, Zhao said his legal team filed the request following widespread media speculation. “I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said during the interview, saying that he ultimately decided to move forward after stories from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal suggested he was pursuing a pardon from former U.S. President Donald Trump. “If they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply,” Zhao added. The former crypto mogul pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in November 2023 as part of a settlement with U.S. authorities. Zhao has since shifted focus to international advisory work, offering guidance to governments in Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan on crypto regulation and blockchain integration.

Although Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain among the best cryptos to buy now for long-term holders, newer investors are questioning their short-term momentum. Meanwhile, the crypto conversation is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new altcoin drawing attention with its high-utility DeFi model and presale momentum. The Mutuum Finance presale is now in phase 5 priced at $0.03. Over $10 million has been raised attracting more than 11,700 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. For traders exploring what crypto to invest in, the contrast between legacy meme coins and innovative newcomers like MUTM may define the next phase of top cryptocurrencies in 2025. SHIB and DOGE Prices Slide as Sentiment Shifts Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently stands at $0.00001321 which is a decrease of over 39% from January 1 and is due to Shibarium updates not impressing traders and the trend of weaker retail interest. Like the rest, Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at around $0.1959, held back mostly by whale activities and the absence of big events to spark the price. Previously considered the top cryptocurrency investments, both meme coins are now struggling with increasing pressure because of ongoing flux in attitudes and no price movement. Although DOGE is still seen as a speculative investment and SHIB as a utility coin, neither looks likely to have a breakout in this quarter. Meanwhile, newly introduced altcoins, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are drawing attention from investors looking for better returns during this market cycle. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows A two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance go viral in 2025. More than 11,700 investors have invested $10 million in the presale. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $6 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is creating a stablecoin backed by the US dollar that will be available on the Ethereum network. Because it is overcollateralized, its price won’t fluctuate drastically like algorithmic stablecoins have. The system relies on audited and safe open-source smart contracts from Certik, so users feel more secure. As legacy meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) face mounting pressure from declining momentum and shifting investor sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a breakout DeFi coin in 2025. Backed by an advanced dual lending model, a Certik audit, and a community of over 11,700 holders, MUTM has already raised more than $10 million in presale funding. With Phase 5 tokens available at $0.03—and a 100% ROI projected by launch at $0.06—this is a pivotal moment for forward-looking investors. Secure your MUTM tokens now before the next price increase and be part of the next-generation DeFi transformation.

Over the past 12 hours, lawmakers, billionaires, and internet personalities have been reacting to the serious accusations, policy threats, and personal insults between the world’s richest man and the President of the United States. After months of frequently praising each other in public and making appearances together at events, Musk and Trump abruptly turned against each other this week. The former is claiming credit for Trump’s 2024 election win, propounding that without his influence, Democrats would have retained the House, and Republicans would have only narrowly held the Senate. “ Without me, Trump would have lost the election ,” Musk posted on social platform X. “ Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude .” President Trump responded by threatening to revoke billions of dollars in government subsidies and contracts for Musk’s SpaceX’s national Space Station, which relies on SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft. Trump and Musk accusations and allegations cause spur On Thursday evening, Musk accused Trump of being “in the Epstein files” without evidence, only backing his claims by saying it was the reason certain documents related to Epstein had not been released to the public. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt bashed the Tesla CEO’s statements and said he was acting out because of his “dissatisfaction with the administration’s legislative priorities.” “ This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted ,” Leavitt said in a statement yesternight. Conservative political commentator and author Candace Owens supported Leavitt’s sentiment, posting on social media: “ Trump is implicated alongside a pedophile, and I knew it but didn’t care because we were friends’ is not the flex you think it is. ” She was backed by internet personality Graham Allen, who questioned Musk’s timing of the claims. “ According to Elon Musk, Trump is on the Epstein list. So naturally, he let him hang out with his kid. I DO NOT BELIEVE ELON ,” Allen said. A source familiar with the administration told CNN that previously released Epstein-related files included references to Trump’s name due to his past association with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s. Still, it reiterated that there are no allegations against the president. The source also talked about several of Musk’s own posts earlier this year, including one in which he wrote, “I love Trump as much as a straight man can love a straight man.” This, according to them, places Musk’s sincerity into question. “ If Elon truly thought the President was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hang out with him for 6 months? ” the source asked. Ye, the rapper who has close ties with both Trump and Musk, took to X to beg the powerheads to reconcile. “Broooos please noooooo,” he wrote , “we love you both so much.” Musk has been reposting Trump’s commentary on social media when the latter lambasted the Biden administration for passing laws that could increase America’s public debt. He told his followers on X that the “big beautiful bill” would trigger a recession by the end of the year. He reposted a February interview with CPAC, warning of fiscal insolvency.

The company warns that the current cycle is different from others and that we may be witnessing “the last Bitcoin rotation before everything changes.” Swan argued that despite being in the final year of the classic four-year cycle, price action has not generated as much excitement as expected. While past cycles have seen parabolic increases in Bitcoin’s third green year, 2025 has so far seen a slower, more measured, and sideways market. According to the analysis, a major shift is taking place under the surface in the Bitcoin market. Investors who have held BTC for a long time are selling above the $100,000 level, while BlackRock, Fidelity, large companies and institutional buyers who have established long-term strategic positions are taking their place. Swan states that this new class of investors is not for sale. Swan CIO Ben Werkman said: “These companies are not buying Bitcoin to trade, but to hold it in their long-term portfolios. They are simply buyers. Not sellers.” When long-term capital is combined with inelastic supply, market supply can dry up quickly, with “explosive” consequences for prices, according to Werkman. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor also contributed to the analysis, stating: “People who are not committed to the long term are exiting the market… and they are being replaced by a completely different class of investors.” Related News: Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping - Is the Trade War Coming to an End? Here Are the Details of the Call Swan notes that this transformation is not only happening among investor types, but also between generations. After the Silent Generation who trusted in gold, the Baby Boomers who accumulated their wealth in stocks, and the Generation X who grew up with technology, now the Millennials who are starting to inherit trillions of dollars are coming onto the scene and they are choosing Bitcoin. In the analysis, it was argued that the structural transformation in Bitcoin is also supported by the macroeconomic background. Swan noted that the rise in bond yields while the US dollar is depreciating is an unusual and dangerous signal for global capital. Swan's remarkable analysis concluded with the following warning: “If you're selling Bitcoin right now, you're probably giving it to an institution that plans to hold it forever. You may not get it back. This isn't just the next cycle, it's the end of an era. The supply is running out. The buyers are different. The macro structure is breaking. This could be the last Bitcoin rotation.” *This is not investment advice.

The newly raised capital is intended to help scale platform operations, increase liquidity depth, and support the development of new product features aimed at both retail and institutional users. The latest round follows a $10 million funding event in March led by Varys Capital and builds on earlier support from Circle Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and the Sui Foundation .

Before its public launch, Momentum spent over two years developing its core technology and establishing partnerships with key ecosystem players such as the Sui Foundation, Bluefin , Cetus Protocol , Agora Finance, AlphaFi, and Ondo Finance. Momentum was also involved in minting the full supply of several stablecoins on Sui, including Agora USD (AUSD), First Digital USD (FDUSD), and USDY. Unlike conventional DEX models that focus on liquidity providers, Momentum employs a vote-escrowed tokenomics model known as ve(3,3) , which incentivizes users to lock up the platform’s governance token, MMT, in exchange for voting power and a share of the protocol’s revenue.

According to the official notice , the region’s stablecoin regulations will come into effect starting on August 1, 2025. Once it is formally implemented, businesses would need to obtain licenses in order to issue stablecoins tied to the Hong Kong dollar or operating in the region. First drafted last May 2025, the bill has evidently been accelerated to advance the region’s budding crypto industry. The main purpose behind the new stablecoin bill, stated in the announcement, is to ensure that all activities involving stablecoins will be regulated. The new licensing regime will also limit stablecoin advertisements to licensed issuers in an effort to prevent scams. Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, said in his statement that the government will provide clear guidelines for industry players interested in delving into the stablecoin market. “After the Ordinance comes into effect, the licensing system will provide appropriate regulations for relevant stablecoin activities marking a milestone in promoting the sustainable development of the stablecoin and digital asset ecosystem in Hong Kong,” said Hui in a translated statement.

The new stablecoin regulation also contains a clause that regulates qualified investors, granting them the ability to issue stablecoins even if they do not hold a license yet. However, it is still unclear whether retail investors still have to abide to certain requirements dictated by financial regulators in order to issue their own stablecoins. “As specified categories of persons, thereby allowing specified stablecoins issued by persons who have not been granted a licence under Section 15 of the Ordinance to be offered to professional investors,” stated authorities in the translated notice. As previously reported by crypto.news, Hong Kong has accelerated its stablecoin regulation so that it may be passed within this year. This move beats out other Asian regions like South Korea, who have only just begun suggesting Korean won-based stablecoins.

The expansion, which was announced in a blog post on June 5, has up to $500,000 in incentives and is backed by $30 million in liquidity. By joining Solana’s ( SOL ) fast and affordable network, Maple Finance ( SYRUP ) aims to provide users throughout the ecosystem with institutional-grade lending tools and consistent yields. syrupUSDC offers a fixed yield of approximately 6.5% and can be bridged from Ethereum ( ETH ). Chainlink’s ( LINK ) cross-chain interoperability protocol, which launched on Solana’s mainnet on May 19, enables the cross-chain capability. Users can more easily access syrupUSDC on either chain thanks to CCIP, a tool that has enabled the safe transfer of tokens and data between Ethereum and Solana. Solana-native protocols like Kamino and Orca are supporting the rollout. Kamino has already added syrupUSDC to its lending, leverage, and liquidity vaults. As part of the launch effort, Maple will distribute weekly rewards of $15,000 to users supplying USDC and USDG, with additional incentives directed toward Paxos’s USDG-based lending. You might also like: Maple Finance price prediction: SYRUP is sweet again — but for how long? This move is a part of Maple’s strategy plan to expand across chains with high liquidity and active decentralized finance ecosystems. With over $11 billion worth of stablecoins, Solana offers a strong foundation for Maple’s future growth. At present, the protocol manages over $1.9 billion in assets, as per Dune Analytics data , with SyrupUSDC’s supply surpassing $550 million. The Solana launch follows a major development in late May when Maple announced a $2 billion Bitcoin-backed lending initiative in partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald. By bringing traditional lending structures on-chain, Maple hopes to bridge the gap between institutional finance and cryptocurrencies. Maple’s entry adds a great deal of firepower as more platforms, such as margin.fi, Port Finance, Save, and Rain.fi, join Solana’s lending market. The protocol is establishing itself as a major player in the upcoming stage of institutional DeFi, supported by strong liquidity, strategic alliances, and a track record of success.

In contrast, trading volumes have surged by 39.75%, reaching $144.4 billion, suggesting a wave of panic selling or forced exits. Amidst this volatility, crypto ETF outflows recorded a sizable $267.1 million withdrawal. Surprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index remains relatively stable at 46, indicating neutral sentiment despite sharp market reactions. Why Did the Crypto Market Crash Today? The following catalysts triggered a domino effect of selling across major tokens. Political & Social Sentiment : A public dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk around policy bills further rattled market confidence, sparking debate and confusion across social media. Mass Liquidation Events : High-leverage positions across multiple assets faced forced closures, exacerbating the downward momentum. Macroeconomic Headwinds : Investors are anxious ahead of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of non-farm payroll data and the unemployment rate later today. These figures could heavily influence Fed policy, prompting cautious sentiment. Crypto Liquidations Hit $1 Billion In the past 24 hours, the crypto market bore over $1 billion in liquidations, a majority of which were $900 million+ worth of long positions. Short liquidations made up just around $100 million, clearly reflecting the bull trap that caught over-leveraged buyers off guard. Bitcoin alone saw $341.76 million in liquidations, followed closely by Ethereum at $285.99 million. Source: Coin Glass Top exchanges like Bybit with $352M, and Binance with $248M led the tally in liquidated positions, with more than 89% of these being long trades. This steep wipeout not only intensified the sell-off but also hints at growing nervousness among traders, especially those relying on leveraged gains. Source: Coin Glass What to Expect Next? Despite today’s fall, the neutral score in the Fear & Greed Index suggests the market isn’t in a full-blown panic yet. Looking at the chart, the total crypto market cap has slipped from above $3.3 trillion to $3.17 trillion, signaling a break below key support. The 9-day SMA at $3.23T now acts as a resistance. If the market fails to reclaim this level soon, further downside toward $3T is likely. If you are keen on Bitcoin’s future, our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 is a must-read! FAQs Why did long trades dominate liquidations today? The sudden market drop caught bullish traders off guard, forcing overleveraged long positions to liquidate in masses. Should investors sell now?

Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support and the price moved toward $641.2. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.25 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,190.17 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into June, BNB is trading approximately $666.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-06 07:52:00

33767162,[object Object],1749196803,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Settling $7.3B/Day In ‘Real’ Volume—How Do Visa, Mastercard Compare?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-settling-7-3b-real-volume-visa-mastercard/,"A report has revealed that Bitcoin is processing $7.3 billion per day in ‘true’ Transfer Volume. Here’s how this compares with traditional processors. Bitcoin Volume Is Sitting At $7.3 Billion Per Day Right Now In a new report in collaboration with the CME Group, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the Transfer Volume on the Bitcoin network has looked lately. The “ Transfer Volume ” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of the cryptocurrency that’s becoming involved in transactions on the blockchain. Here is the chart shared in the report that shows the trend in this metric for BTC: As displayed in the above graph, the daily Bitcoin Transfer Volume has stood at a whopping $48.7 billion recently. This value is larger than the $36.2 billion per day that Visa processes or the $26.7 billion per day that Mastercard does. This volume, however, is unfiltered, meaning that it contains all the noise that comes with a cryptocurrency blockchain, like transfers between the wallets of the same investor. The analytics firm has come up with an approach to mitigate this problem: Glassnode has pioneered the application of advanced filtering heuristics, which allow for the assessment of whether on-chain transaction volumes are economical in nature, or internal transactions such as wallet management by exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. The modified version of the indicator to account for this is called the Entity-Adjusted Volume. This metric only keeps track of the transfers happening between two separate ‘entities,’ where an entity is a cluster of addresses that belong to the same investor. “Once this filtering is applied, the economic transfer volumes are closer to $7.3 billion per day, totalling $2.9T across 2024,” notes the report. This value is lesser than the volume being processed by the traditional payment processors, but is nonetheless impressive. In the same report, Glassnode has also shared a zoomed out view of the Bitcoin “ Realized Cap ,” which measures the total value of the BTC supply by assuming that the value of each individual token is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In short, what this indicator represents is the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s apparent that the BTC Realized Cap stood at $400 billion in November 2022, when the bear market reached its bottom.

The filing is tied to recent debt and equity agreements with 50 investors. The registration statement relates to 56 million shares of equity and 29 million shares related to convertible notes. Bitcoin Treasury Push: CEO Says Company Aims to Acquire “Crown Jewel Assets” The fund will be used to acquire Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes, an official release noted . However, the company has not disclosed how much Bitcoin it plans to purchase. Additionally, the filing includes a universal shelf provision to offer flexibility for future initiatives like mergers and capital raising offerings. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said that the company is exploring all elements needed for its growth and plans, including acquiring “crown jewel assets.” “These activities will provide the Company with the capital, assets, independence, flexibility, and security we need to fulfill our goals of rapid expansion, guaranteeing a wide array of ways to access the capital markets when it’s most advantageous to do so,” he said. TMTG Bitcoin ETF Plans: Will it Be Anywhere Close to Existing Crypto ETFs? TMTG, the media group behind Trump’s Truth Social, has already signed a deal with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch a suite of exchange-traded funds under the Truth.Fi brand. Trump Media has signed a deal with @cryptocom and Yorkville to launch a series of ETFs combining digital assets and U.S.-focused investments. #trump #etf https://t.co/pyvQqgC5Gz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 22, 2025 The funds will combine exposure to digital assets with investments in U.S.-focused sectors such as energy, the company said in April . If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will have Crypto.com as its exclusive custodian and liquidity provider. The ETF would join the increasing number of crypto-related products that are waiting to get approval from the regulator. The new fund will carry exclusive clauses. The filing noted that one of the largest crypto exchanges, Crypto.com, will offer certain services to the trust behind the product. The ETF’s launch comes as the price of Bitcoin has hit above $100,000 amid a wave of optimism. However, given that there is a flurry of spot Bitcoin funds, Truth Social ETF would only join a crowded field, trying to gain the trust of the institutional investment community. “I think it’s extraordinarily unlikely that products like [Truth Social Bitcoin ETF] gain long-term assets,” Dave Nadig, an independent ETF expert, told the FT.

Pi Network’s Core Team has outlined several tips for its users and investors on how they can protect their holdings and stay safe while operating on the Open Network. Stay Safe The blog post started with a warning that if users share their wallet passphrases with bad actors or phishing sites, it could result in draining their PI tokens from the PI Wallet, which are completed in irreversible transactions. The most crucial advice from the team is that users must refrain from interacting with any website, app, pr platform that requests their wallet passphrases, unless it is exactly “wallet.pinet.com” in the Pi Browser. Otherwise, they risk losing their entire PI balance. Although the team said it is working on improving the Pi Browser’s overall safety, it still remains a browser like others, and it is the individual’s responsibility to “determine the safety and legitimacy of the sites and URLs they visit.” Users can distinguish Pi Wallets from fake alternatives by the purple color in the navigation bar that contains a PI logo featuring the Core Team apps logo. “If a scammer creates a fake ‘Pi Wallet’ that tries to phish Pioneers’ wallet secret passphrase, they won’t be able to modify the app URL or the associated UI of the Browser that the official Pi Wallet will have,” reads the post. Social Media Safety The team further advised its users to be “especially careful” on social media platforms, as many fail to prevent the circulation of fake websites or misleading ads. They added that no Pi Core Team member will “ever solicit ANY authentication account information (like wallet passphrases, account passwords, verification codes, etc.)” and will never individually call investors. Users must interact and submit information only to apps that are listed as official and are posted on the Pi Safety Center . PI Price Update Let’s take a look at the native token’s price performance as of late. In the past 24 hours, the asset has joined the broader crypto market and has gone through a price slide of around 4%. As such, it remains inches above $0.6. Its monthly performance, though, is a lot more volatile. Recall that it has pumped from $0.6. to roughly $1.7 on the hype of a massive Pi Network announcement in mid-May, but started to dump even before the news broke. Since then, it has lost almost all gains and, as mentioned above, now fights to stay above $0.6. PI Token Price.

Among them, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) stands out with its substantial fundraising achievement in its ongoing presale. This significant financial milestone has been made possible not only by UNIL's innovative approach to combining decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional finance (TradFi) but also due to its advanced AI-driven asset management platform. The Innovative Edge of Unilabs Finance While traditional meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu occasionally struggle to maintain momentum, Unilabs Finance has capitalized on its unique offerings. The platform's introduction of an AI-powered DeFi asset manager has particularly caught the attention of savvy investors. This technology manages a robust portfolio including meme coin identification, which enhances listing potentials and minimizes risks. Such advancements have not only enabled a rapid fundraising of over $2M but also generated a significant return of 55% for early investors. Enthusiasm around Unilabs continues to grow as the platform offers diverse funds like AI, mining, and Bitcoin, broadening its appeal. Market Dynamics: Dogecoin and Shiba Inu's Current Status Amidst these developments, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown some fluctuations. Recent trends suggest a downturn in their values, with Dogecoin experiencing a drop of nearly 15% over the past week. Despite this, analysts like Trader Tardigrade are optimistic about a potential uptick in Dogecoin's value, expecting significant pumps soon based on historical price patterns. Similarly, Shiba Inu witnessed a decline but remains a focal point for predictions by influencers like SHIB Possessor, who anticipates a strong rebound. Why Unilabs Finance Attracts Crypto Investors Over Meme Coins While meme coins rely heavily on community support and viral trends, Unilabs Finance offers a more stable investment channel through its multifaceted platform. The promise of up to 30% redistribution of platform fees to UNIL holders adds an attractive layer of passive income, further incentivizing investments. As the third phase of its presale concludes successfully, the platform’s market strategy and innovative features hint at a promising upward trajectory, distinguishing it from typical meme coin investments. Conclusion: A Shift in Investment Preference The crypto community's growing interest in platforms offering tangible utilities and passive income potential, like Unilabs Finance, signifies a shift from mere speculative investments towards more sustainable financial growth strategies in the cryptocurrency space.

Not Like This Altcoin As It Just Raised Over $2M in a Flash!,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/doge-and-shib-to-the-moon-not-like-this-altcoin-as-it-just-raised-over-2m-in-a-flash,"Recently, many analysts have made some bullish predictions for the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price. Although they see some red weekly charts, Trader Tardigrade and SHIB Possessor think these meme coins will see big reversals soon. Despite this, one altcoin is stealing their spotlight - Unilabs Finance (UNIL) . This presale star is now in its third phase, which has already raised over $2M and given early buyers a 55% return. Since Unilabs Finance also introduced a one-of-a-kind DeFi asset manager fueled by AI tech, many investors even think UNIL has more growth potential than Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Unilabs Finance (UNIL): Where DeFi Meets TradFi While the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price show some dips, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is making headlines for a good reason. Notably, it has already raised over $2M in just two weeks in its initial coin offering and may reach $3M before June ends. Additionally, early buyers of this altcoin are already experiencing returns of 55%. Interest in Unilabs Finance is sky-high as it launched the first DeFi asset manager fueled by AI technology that already boasts over $30M AUM. On it, users get access to a meme coin identification tool that looks at new meme coins and their listing potential and potential risks. Furthermore, Unilabs Finance offers four distinct funds: AI, mining, RWA and BTC. These features bring exposure to successful markets to all Unilabs Finance users. What attracts traders is the fact that Unilabs Finance will redistribute up to 30% of its platform fees to UNIL altcoin holders. The more UNIL tokens people hold, the higher the rewards. As a result, nearly 500M UNIL tokens have been bought in the third presale round alone. It is now worth just $0.0062, but this altcoin price will soar to $0.0074 after phase four begins. This 20% growth makes UNIL one of the top altcoins to monitor this cycle. Trader Tardigrade: The Dogecoin Price May See a Pump Dogecoin (DOGE) is a meme coin that has recently seen some red price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the Dogecoin price fell nearly 15% in the past seven days. In that period, the value of Dogecoin dropped from around $0.22 to almost $0.19. However, market analyst Trader Tardigrade remains optimistic for Dogecoin (DOGE). According to his X post, the DOGE/BTC pair forms lower lows before every Dogecoin price pump. This signal has appeared again. Thus, Trader Tardigrade predicts a potential jump to $0.000025 for Dogecoin. Despite this bullish Dogecoin price prediction, some traders are still cautiously optimistic. Since it has a high market cap of around $30B, much new money must come for the Dogecoin price to skyrocket. As a result, traders are focusing on altcoins like UNIL instead of Dogecoin. Expert Predicts the Shiba Inu Price Could Surge Soon One of the meme coin titans, Shiba Inu (SHIB), has also seen some turbulence. On the one-week chart, the value of Shiba Inu fell from around $0.000014 to nearly $0.000012. In other words, the Shiba Inu price has dipped almost 10% in just a few short days. However, SHIB Possessor made a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction that turned some heads. In a recent post, he told his X community that he has a feeling this meme coin could pump like crazy soon. SHIB Possessor thinks the Shiba Inu price may soar to $0.00004. Although this statement has made some waves for Shiba Inu (SHIB), many investors are sidestepping it for UNIL. This could be because the Shiba Inu price has dipped nearly 50% in the past 12 months, so it may not sustain a long-term bullish upswing. What Makes Unilabs Finance (UNIL) Stand Out From Meme Coins Like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Although the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price could see rebounds soon, the focus is shifting to Unilabs Finance (UNIL). Unlike these meme coins, which rely on buzz for price growth, UNIL has real utility. Moreover, holding UNIL can be a good investment for its passive income capabilities. Given that UNIL's market cap is lower than Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, it is more likely to gain in value in the long term. Therefore, traders are rushing to buy the UNIL altcoin in anticipation of a surge in value after listing.

The initiative highlights the company’s growing commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for measurable humanitarian purposes, with 2024 serving as a proof-of-concept phase and 2025 anticipated to be a period of broader implementation. Partnerships Supporting Emerging Market Innovation Ripple’s updated strategy, detailed in the company’s Impact Finance annual report, emphasizes partnerships with Mercy Corps Ventures, the International Rescue Committee, and the Lab for Inclusive Fintech at UC Berkeley. Through these collaborations, Ripple is deploying its blockchain infrastructure—specifically the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and RLUSD—to scale financial services that are accessible, affordable, and equitable across underserved regions. These efforts aim to demonstrate how decentralized technologies can enable financial resilience and expand economic opportunities in emerging markets. BREAKING: Ripple just quietly positioned $XRP + $RLUSD as the rails for global impact finance. $30M deployed. 15 pilots launched. 2024 was the test. 2025 is the takeover. #XRP isn’t just innovation. It’s domination. You still have time. For now. pic.twitter.com/JEo3x5XO9d — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 4, 2025 Capital Deployed and Pilot Programs Initiated According to the information included in Ripple’s publication , the company has granted $30 million to NGOs focused on impactful finance since 2018. In partnership with Mercy Corps Ventures, 15 startup investments and pilot programs have already been launched in various emerging markets. In addition, Ripple has committed $1 million specifically to the International Rescue Committee to support humanitarian use cases involving blockchain solutions. Finance Bull’s tweet, referencing this development, frames the current moment as a pivotal one for the adoption of XRP and RLUSD in real-world financial applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Positioning Blockchain at the Center of Global Development Ripple’s move comes as blockchain-based financial tools gain increasing relevance in humanitarian and development sectors, especially in regions where traditional banking infrastructure remains limited or unreliable. By deploying RLUSD and XRP within impact finance initiatives, Ripple is attempting to offer scalable, low-cost settlement infrastructure to organizations working in volatile or underserved environments. While 2024 was largely a pilot year to assess the efficacy of Ripple’s technology stack in humanitarian settings, the infrastructure now in place suggests a more aggressive rollout in 2025. The company’s continued collaboration with academic and non-profit partners adds a layer of credibility and expertise to its operations in this space. X Finance Bull’s remarks highlight the potential magnitude of this transition and suggest that the strategic use of blockchain in humanitarian finance may soon move from the periphery to the center of global development efforts.

According to a June 5 statement from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the agency is seeking to confiscate over $7.74 million in digital assets allegedly earned through illicit employment and laundering schemes designed to evade U.S. sanctions. The funds were initially frozen in April 2023 following the indictment of Sim Hyon Sop , a North Korean Foreign Trade Bank representative based in China, accused of conspiring with DPRK IT workers to funnel crypto earnings back to the regime. Authorities allege these funds were part of a coordinated laundering effort that included chain hopping, token swaps, and fictitious identities to obscure their origin. In its complaint filed in a Washington D.C. federal court, the DOJ has targeted multiple forms of digital property, including Bitcoin, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, and Ethereum Name Service domains.

We will halt your progress, strike back, and take hold of any proceeds you obtained illegally,” U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro said in an accompanying statement. With DPRK-linked hackers reportedly stealing over $1.6 billion from crypto firms in 2024 alone, U.S. officials say more aggressive action is required. The DOJ’s latest Action is part of the broader “DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative,” launched in March 2024 to disrupt North Korea’s revenue-generation networks. A growing threat to crypto North Korean operatives have been linked to some of the largest cryptocurrency heists in recent years, with malicious IT workers increasingly playing a central role in breaching blockchain firms from the inside. Often operating under stolen or fabricated identities, these individuals secure remote jobs at crypto and tech companies, where they typically request payment in stablecoins like USDC and Tether, a tactic believed to help mask their true locations. Once employed, these positions provide a financial lifeline to the regime and, in some cases, access that can later be exploited. Illicit earnings from these roles are often funneled back to the regime through a web of laundering techniques, including fake accounts, small-value transfers, cross-chain swaps, and NFT purchases, before being rerouted, sometimes via sanctioned intermediaries like Chinyong , a company tied to North Korea’s Ministry of Defense. In recent years, North Korean IT workers have continued to expand their operations, adapting their tactics and shifting targets as enforcement efforts intensify . According to an April 2025 report from Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, North Korean IT operatives were increasingly targeting European blockchain firms after heightened scrutiny in the United States. The report detailed cases of DPRK workers building Solana smart contracts and job marketplaces in the UK, often using elaborate webs of fake references and identities to pass recruitment checks. Last month, cryptocurrency trading platform Kraken intercepted one such attempt when a job applicant raised red flags during the recruitment process. Further investigation revealed the candidate was a North Korean operative linked to a broader network of infiltrators who had already secured roles at other crypto firms.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI) , the DeFi venture backed by Donald Trump and his family, has issued a cease-and-desist letter to creators of the controversial wallet tied to the president’s crypto brand, according to a June 5 Bloomberg report. The letter was addressed to Fight Fight Fight LLC, the firm behind Trump-themed memecoin issuer ‘GetTrumpMemes.’ Earlier this week, the company announced the wallet launch in partnership with crypto service provider Magic Eden. With Billions of Trump fans around the world, the $TRUMP mission has always been to make it super easy for Trump supporters to get into crypto and join the $TRUMP community. The $TRUMP Wallet powered by @magiceden is coming soon. Join the $TRUMP community!… pic.twitter.com/7nIubWIdqw — TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) June 3, 2025 WLFI’s legal move follows a series of public denunciations by the president’s sons. On June 3, both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. took to X (formerly Twitter), asserting that the wallet was not endorsed by the family and calling out the project’s use of the Trump name without consent. “This project is not authorized by @Trump. The Trump Organization has zero involvement with this wallet product,” the brothers wrote. Following the cease-and-desist, the wallet’s official website, TrumpWallet.com, which had been accepting sign-ups for a waitlist, has gone offline. However, promotional content from both GetTrumpMemes and Magic Eden remains live on their respective social media accounts. You might also like: Trump coin: Is another Trump-linked memecoin coming? Interestingly, Gettrumpmemes had maintained a cordial relationship with the Trump family and was even present at the recent exclusive dinner hosted by the president for his token’s top holders. The official memecoin website also suggests the firm is an affiliate of the Trump Organization, sharing ownership of 80% of the Trump cards supply. The ongoing dispute adds another layer of uncertainty to the Trump family’s involvement in crypto ventures, which has already come under the scrutiny of lawmakers and the broader public. While Donald Trump’s “crypto president” image has earned him popularity in the industry, questions persist about whether many of the initiatives tied to his name are genuine value-driven projects or just profit-driven schemes.
