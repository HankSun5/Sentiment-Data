This is a new benchmark in the market and is getting the attention of investors including those from Dogecoin’s (DOGE) highly active community. With innovative technology and exponential growth potential Ruvi AI is a token to watch in 2025. Dogecoin’s Unique Charm and Flaws Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke but has since become a serious player in the crypto world. Backed by a passionate community and fueled by internet meme culture Dogecoin has become a symbol of community driven investment. Its appeal is in its simplicity and the camaraderie it brings to its supporters. Dogecoin has strengths like strong community backing and wide recognition but its limitations as a speculative and meme based asset are evident. Critically Dogecoin lacks the robust utility and industry disruption potential that newer tokens like Ruvi AI bring to the table. This gap has led some DOGE investors to look for advanced utility driven tokens to add to their portfolio. Ruvi AI’s Innovation Ruvi AI is revolutionizing blockchain by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) into its ecosystem. Designed for real world applications Ruvi AI powers tools that generate text, images, videos and audio making it a standout in industries like marketing, content creation and video production. Unlike Dogecoin’s entertainment driven appeal Ruvi AI is focused on creating real value through its technology. The $RUVI token is the backbone of the ecosystem providing holders with staking rewards, governance rights and access to premium features. By addressing real world pain points Ruvi AI is moving beyond the meme narrative and carving its own path as a high impact player in the blockchain space. Presale Success Ruvi AI’s presale is going great, the first phase priced at $0.010 per token sold out in 2 weeks and delivered 50% returns to early investors when phase 2 launched at $0.015.Ruvi AI has sold over 135 million tokens with over 1,400 holders in the community. The project just reached a major milestone by getting listed on an exchange before the presale even ends – a testament to its strong leadership and execution. More partnerships and listings are coming soon and the investors are getting excited and Ruvi AI is solidifying its position as a game changing crypto project. Dogecoin vs Ruvi AI The comparison between Dogecoin and Ruvi AI is two different investment propositions. Dogecoin is speculative growth and community, thriving on its meme driven popularity and endorsement culture. But without a clear utility framework its long term growth potential is limited to cyclical market trends. Ruvi AI is innovation at the intersection of blockchain and AI technology. Its real world applications and expanding ecosystem is a big opportunity for investors looking to back projects with disruption potential. With the presale gaining momentum Ruvi AI is positioning itself for exponential growth far beyond what Dogecoin has achieved. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI’s tiered presale structure is very attractive for early adopters. Here’s a breakdown of the returns based on the listing price of $0.07 and a predicted post listing price of $1 per token: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 $RUVI ($750 investment) Bonus : 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 investment) Bonus : 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 investment) Bonus : 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $1,000,000 These scenarios show the great opportunities in Ruvi AI’s presale tiers, affordability and growth.

At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $104,851, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours and roughly 6.3% below its recent peak. This period of relative price stability comes amid cautious sentiment across the broader crypto market, as analysts examine whether the current bull cycle is beginning to shift gears or simply experiencing a temporary pause. CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan has released a comparative analysis of current and past market cycles, noting several distinct behaviors in Bitcoin’s recent price action. Drawing parallels to the bull runs of 2017 and 2021, Dan suggests that while similarities exist, the current cycle has developed unique characteristics. These changes could signal a different structure in how the market plays out, particularly in terms of timing and investor participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Comparing Bitcoin Cycles: 2024–2025 Diverges from Historical Patterns According to Dan, previous cycles saw more predictable corrections and rallies. In 2017, Bitcoin experienced relatively short corrections before entering a prolonged rally that concluded in late December of that year. The 2021 cycle, affected early on by the COVID-19 pandemic, featured a longer initial correction before a strong upward surge. In both cases, once Bitcoin gained momentum, corrections became less frequent and shorter in duration. The current cycle, spanning 2024–2025, has so far been marked by alternating strong rallies and sudden declines, often occurring over short timeframes. These patterns have dampened broader market sentiment, particularly during periods when altcoins significantly underperformed Bitcoin. Dan posits that these repeated pullbacks may not be purely organic. Instead, they could indicate intentional suppression by large players aiming to extend the cycle’s duration and prevent overheating. If this interpretation holds, the bull cycle could end not with a gradual fade, but a sharp spike driven by euphoric buying behavior. Retail Activity Declines as Institutions Drive Market Structure A separate analysis by CryptoQuant’s Burak Kesmeci focuses on the behavior of retail investors since Bitcoin hit its $111,000 high in late May. Data shows that retail transfer volumes, transactions valued between $0 and $10,000, have decreased from $423 million to $408 million. Additionally, the 30-day change in retail demand has slipped into negative territory, shifting from +5 points to -0.11 points. This reduction in retail activity suggests that smaller investors remain sensitive to short-term volatility, stepping back in response to recent price corrections. Related Reading: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History’s Turning Kesmeci argues that for the bull cycle to sustain momentum, consistent participation from retail segments is crucial. At present, institutional interest appears to be the primary source of demand. The divergence between these two investor classes may shape how the next leg of Bitcoin’s market cycle develops.

In a significant move signaling this trend, Zebec Network (ZBCN) has announced its acquisition of Gatenox, a specialized compliance and identity platform. This strategic integration is set to profoundly impact Zebec’s ability to navigate the complex landscape of global financial regulations and expand its reach into highly regulated markets. Why Zebec Needs Enhanced Crypto Compliance At its core, Zebec Network aims to revolutionize how value is transferred in real-time, particularly through its innovative programmable money and payment streams. However, as these financial technologies become more mainstream and interact with traditional finance systems, the necessity for stringent Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Business (KYB), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures becomes paramount. Without these measures, platforms face significant risks: Regulatory penalties and fines Reputational damage Exclusion from partnerships with traditional financial institutions Difficulty in attracting institutional users The acquisition of Gatenox directly addresses these challenges by bringing proven compliance technology in-house. This isn’t just about meeting minimum requirements; it’s about building a foundation of trust and security that is essential for scaling Web3 payment solutions globally. Integrating Gatenox : A Deep Dive into the Benefits The integration of Gatenox’s platform into Zebec’s existing infrastructure is expected to yield multiple benefits, significantly strengthening Zebec’s position in the market: Seamless Compliance Integration: Gatenox specializes in streamlined KYC/KYB processes, making it easier for users and businesses to onboard while adhering to regulatory standards. Integrating this technology directly into the Zebec payment stack means compliance checks can become a more seamless part of the user experience, rather than a cumbersome hurdle. Enhanced Risk Management: With advanced AML tools from Gatenox, Zebec can bolster its ability to detect and prevent illicit activities on its network. This includes transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, and risk scoring, all crucial for maintaining a clean and trustworthy ecosystem. Preparation for Regulatory Registration: A primary driver for this acquisition is Zebec’s ambition to pursue regulatory registration under key frameworks like the EU’s MiCA Regulation and the UK’s FCA Regulation . Having robust, integrated compliance systems is a fundamental prerequisite for obtaining such licenses. The Gatenox acquisition provides Zebec with the necessary technological backbone to demonstrate compliance capabilities to regulators. Expansion into Regulated Markets: Successfully navigating regulations like MiCA and those enforced by the FCA opens the door to operate legally and confidently within major economic blocs like the European Union and the United Kingdom. These markets represent significant opportunities for growth but demand strict adherence to financial regulations. The Gatenox acquisition is a direct investment in accessing these opportunities. What is MiCA Regulation and Why Does it Matter? The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is a landmark legislative package in the European Union designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets and related activities. It aims to provide legal certainty, support innovation, and protect consumers and investors. For a platform like Zebec, compliance with MiCA is crucial for operating within EU member states. Key aspects of MiCA include: Rules for the issuance and admission to trading of crypto-assets. Requirements for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) regarding authorization, governance, and consumer protection. Provisions on market abuse. Meeting MiCA’s requirements demands sophisticated compliance systems, exactly what the Gatenox acquisition is intended to provide for Zebec . Navigating the UK Landscape with FCA Regulation Similarly, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the regulatory body overseeing financial services in the United Kingdom. While the UK is no longer part of the EU, it is developing its own comprehensive framework for crypto-assets, often aligning with international standards and principles similar to MiCA. Obtaining registration or authorization from the FCA is essential for crypto businesses wishing to serve the UK market legally. The FCA focuses heavily on: Preventing financial crime (AML/CTF). Protecting consumers. Ensuring market integrity. Zebec’s pursuit of FCA registration underscores its commitment to operating within established financial regulations, a goal significantly bolstered by the integration of Gatenox’s compliance expertise. Challenges and Considerations While the acquisition presents clear strategic advantages, integrating two distinct technology platforms and organizational cultures can present challenges. Ensuring a smooth technical merger of systems, maintaining data integrity, and aligning operational procedures will be key to realizing the full potential of the Gatenox acquisition. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, requiring continuous adaptation and updates to compliance protocols. Actionable Insights for the Industry Zebec’s move highlights a growing trend in the Web3 and crypto space: the increasing importance of proactive compliance. For other projects and companies in the sector, this acquisition serves as a strong signal: Compliance is not optional: As Web3 technologies mature, integrating robust KYC, KYB, and AML is becoming a necessity, not a luxury. Strategic acquisitions can accelerate compliance: For projects lacking in-house compliance expertise, acquiring specialized firms like Gatenox can be a faster path to regulatory readiness than building from scratch. Focus on regulated markets requires investment: Entering jurisdictions with clear regulatory frameworks (like the EU and UK) demands significant investment in compliance infrastructure and processes. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Regulatory Clarity The acquisition of Gatenox by Zebec Network is a decisive step towards strengthening its crypto compliance capabilities and positioning itself for expansion into regulated markets under frameworks like MiCA Regulation and FCA Regulation . By integrating advanced KYC, KYB, and AML tools, Zebec is not only mitigating risks but also building a foundation of trust essential for the future of Web3 payments. This move underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto industry and its commitment to operating within global financial standards, promising a more secure and accessible future for programmable money.

Botanix Labs , a project focused on bringing more functionality to the Bitcoin network, has just announced a significant strategic move ahead of its anticipated mainnet launch. This development is set to impact how the protocol operates and its path toward greater decentralization, a key goal for any blockchain project. What is Botanix Labs and Why Does a Federated Model Matter? At its core, Botanix Labs is building a Bitcoin layer-2 network. Think of it as an overlay on top of Bitcoin that aims to overcome some of Bitcoin’s inherent limitations, particularly when it comes to running complex applications. Their unique approach utilizes a technology called Spiderchain , which is designed to enable compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means developers could potentially deploy applications and smart contracts similar to those found on Ethereum, but secured by the underlying power of Bitcoin. The shift to a Federated model is a crucial step in this journey. Previously, Botanix Labs might have held more centralized control over the network’s operations. A federated model, in this context, means handing over operational control and validation responsibilities to a group of independent, trusted entities. This moves the network away from being solely controlled by the founding team and distributes power among multiple participants. Leading Operators Join the Federated Model A major highlight of this transition is the caliber of the initial participants in the Federated model . Botanix Labs has brought on board 16 independent node operators. These aren’t just random individuals; they include established names in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. According to reports, prominent entities like AntPool, Fireblocks, and Galaxy are among this initial group. The involvement of such recognized players lends credibility and operational expertise to the network. Adding these independent operators removes Botanix Labs itself from direct operational control over the network’s consensus or validation processes. This is a vital step towards decentralization, making the network less susceptible to single points of failure or control by one entity. As they prepare for the upcoming mainnet launch , having a diverse group of operators already participating in the Federated model is a strong signal of their commitment to building a robust and distributed network from the outset. Spiderchain and Enabling EVM Smart Contracts on Bitcoin The underlying technology making all of this possible is the Spiderchain . This innovative architecture is what allows Botanix Labs to bridge the gap between Bitcoin’s security and the flexibility of EVM smart contracts . By enabling EVM smart contracts on Bitcoin, Botanix Labs aims to unlock a vast array of potential use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to NFTs and more, all while inheriting Bitcoin’s unparalleled security guarantees. The Federated model plays a direct role here too. These independent node operators are crucial for the operation and security of the Spiderchain . They will be responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the state of the layer-2 network, ensuring that the EVM smart contracts function correctly and securely, anchored by the Bitcoin base layer. Why This Matters for the Mainnet Launch The transition to a Federated model is more than just a technical tweak; it’s a foundational step necessary before the mainnet launch later this quarter. Launching a decentralized network requires distributed control from day one. By establishing this group of 16 independent operators now, Botanix Labs is setting the stage for a more resilient and decentralized network when it goes live for public use. The goal is not to stop at 16 operators. Botanix Labs has stated plans to expand to hundreds of globally distributed validators over time. This gradual expansion of the Federated model is key to ensuring long-term decentralization and network resilience against various threats. Benefits of the Federated Model Shift: Enhanced Decentralization: Reduces reliance on the core Botanix Labs team for network operations. Increased Resilience: Distributes control across multiple independent entities, making the network more robust. Preparation for Scale: Establishes a framework for onboarding a larger number of validators for the mainnet. Credibility: Involvement of recognized industry players adds trust and confidence in the network’s operational integrity. Alignment with Bitcoin Ethos: Moves towards a more distributed control structure, aligning with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin itself. What’s Next for Botanix Labs? With the Federated model now in place and initial operators onboarded, the focus is clearly on the impending mainnet launch . This shift is a critical milestone, demonstrating progress towards a decentralized operational structure required for a public network. The success of the Bitcoin layer-2 , its ability to support EVM smart contracts via the Spiderchain , and its overall adoption will heavily depend on the robustness and decentralization achieved through this Federated model and the subsequent expansion of its validator set. Summary Botanix Labs has taken a significant step by transitioning to a Federated model and onboarding 16 independent node operators, including industry heavyweights. This move removes the core team from operational control, bolstering decentralization and network resilience. Utilizing the Spiderchain to enable EVM smart contracts on Bitcoin, this strategic shift is crucial preparation for their highly anticipated mainnet launch later this quarter. It signals a strong commitment to building a decentralized and robust Bitcoin layer-2 solution.

While the report attributes much of this to an 11% drop in BTC’s price, it also reflects active selling pressure by professional money managers. Bitcoin exposure in Q1 2025. Source: CoinShares Notably, financial advisors were one of the few groups that slightly increased their exposure, signaling some resilience within certain investor classes. However, the larger institutional trend suggests a pivot away from short-term speculation and toward long-term treasury-style holdings, particularly among corporates. Adding to the downside pressure, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded a staggering $430 million in outflows on May 30, the largest single-day exit since inception. This ended a 31-day streak of inflows, stoking fears of continued selling. Musk vs Trump Fallout Sparks Panic Selling Sentiment soured further as a very public feud between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk roiled risk assets. The disagreement, which centered around a disputed Congressional spending bill, escalated after Musk called for Trump’s resignation and threatened to push for impeachment. Trump, in turn, defended the bill as a historic tax-cutting measure. The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year https://t.co/rbBC11iynE — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 This clash rattled investor confidence, especially given prior rumors about Musk potentially joining Trump’s 2025 tech policy team.

Can Bitcoin Recover Amid Macro Headwinds? Despite the panic, some analysts believe this dip may open up long-term buying opportunities, especially if Bitcoin follows gold’s historical pattern of rallying during recessions. With Musk warning that Trump’s tariffs could spark a U.S. recession in H2 2025, safe-haven assets may come back into favor.

However, growing corporate use of BTC as a treasury asset may provide a long-term support base even amid institutional ETF outflows. BTC Bull Token Presale Nears $7.91M Cap as 61% APY Staking Draws Yield Hunters With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $6,858,262 out of its $7,911,528 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00255 is expected to rise once the cap is met. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

Aptos (APT) just recorded a 5% price jump after its CEO, Avery Ching, was officially invited to testify before the U.S. Congress. This rare move places Aptos at the center of discussions shaping the legal future of blockchain innovation. Meanwhile, Maker (MKR) pushed through resistance levels that technical analysts believed would hold it back, rising above $1,800 and signaling a potential move to $2,400. These aren’t just random movements—they reflect a broader trend of market confidence in projects with clear value propositions and solid leadership. As this activity continues to build market momentum, one name is steadily gaining recognition among informed participants: Qubetics ($TICS), a presale-stage contender that’s solving a completely different piece of the puzzle—real-world internet security and blockchain interoperability. Qubetics presents itself not merely as another digital token but as a complete infrastructure solution with a core emphasis on application-layer innovations. At its heart is a decentralized VPN that tackles what centralized service providers failed to resolve—digital privacy and censorship resistance. As Aptos enters legislative conversations and Maker breaks bearish flags with confidence, Qubetics emerges with something just as compelling: an active crypto presale backed by quantifiable application value. From a utility standpoint, each of these coins represents a different slice of where blockchain is headed. Aptos is building influence on Capitol Hill. Maker is rewriting market expectations. Qubetics is delivering a tool many internet users have needed for years. In this competitive and trend-driven climate, only one may ultimately be remembered as the next big crypto. Qubetics’ dVPN: Internet Privacy That Finally Works At a time when online surveillance and censorship are no longer theoretical concerns but daily realities for millions, Qubetics has introduced a decentralized VPN (dVPN) as part of its ecosystem. This feature operates on a fully peer-to-peer model, eliminating centralized oversight and control. Unlike traditional VPN services that can be subpoenaed, censored, or shut down, the Qubetics dVPN runs across blockchain infrastructure to ensure no single authority can track, throttle, or log users’ data. This isn’t just relevant for crypto-native users; it holds weight for journalists, NGOs, researchers, and privacy-conscious citizens across the globe—particularly in countries where digital restrictions continue to tighten. The implementation of blockchain-enabled routing and encryption doesn’t just benefit individuals. Businesses with cross-border communication needs stand to benefit significantly from Qubetics’ offering. Consider a financial advisory firm handling sensitive client data, or a pharmaceutical research team working with proprietary information. The decentralized architecture Qubetics has built makes their data both more secure and more agile. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator uniting leading blockchains, Qubetics is uniquely positioned to support scalable applications without compromising the foundational principles of decentralization and freedom. This emphasis on real utility and cross-platform compatibility is what places Qubetics in the ongoing discussion around the next big crypto. Qubetics Presale in Final Phase: Why Analysts Are Watching It as the Next Big Crypto Ahead of Listing Qubetics has officially entered the last phase of its public presale, Stage 37, with a fixed token price of $0.3370. So far, over $17.7 million has been raised, more than 515 million tokens have been distributed, and the project now counts over 27,500 holders. With only 10 million tokens remaining before it moves to exchange listing at $0.40, this stage marks a clear transition point for the project. These strong presale metrics, along with confirmed pricing and growing demand, have led many to identify Qubetics as the next big crypto to watch heading into the second half of 2025. Supporting this momentum is a recent tokenomics revision aimed at long-term sustainability. The total token supply has been reduced significantly—from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion—tightening future supply and improving value support. In parallel, the protocol has increased its public allocation to 38.55%, shifting a larger share of the supply into community hands. This structural change is designed to strengthen decentralization while allowing for more active governance participation by token holders. From a capital planning perspective, a $2,000 allocation at the current presale rate secures approximately 5,937 $TICS tokens. At the confirmed listing price of $0.40, this investment adjusts in value to $2,400. Longer-term projections remain speculative but indicate that if $TICS reaches $5, the same stake could be valued at $29,685. If it rises to $10, that grows to $59,370. With fixed pricing, limited token availability, and a refined roadmap, Qubetics continues to stand out as a serious contender for the next big crypto status among new-generation blockchain projects. Aptos Rallies as Congressional Testimony Sparks 5% Price Boost Aptos made headlines this week with a notable 5% rise in its token price after its co-founder and CEO Avery Ching received an invitation to testify in front of the United States Congress. This opportunity places Aptos in a strategic position to influence key regulatory frameworks for digital assets. The hearing, titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets,” centers around crafting legislation that accommodates Web3 technologies while protecting public interest. Aptos’ involvement not only validates its technical foundation but also strengthens its role in institutional dialogues that could shape the market’s future. This engagement has sparked strong market interest, pushing Aptos to $4.96. The invitation also suggests growing recognition from U.S. lawmakers who are increasingly looking toward tech-native platforms to guide future digital frameworks. While most tokens respond to short-term market sentiment, Aptos is actively engaging in long-term shaping of policy—making its latest price movement more than just a reaction. It reflects credibility, influence, and growing maturity in the sector. Maker Defies Technical Patterns to Eye a $2,400 Target Maker (MKR) has defied bearish expectations by breaking out of a downward pattern and rallying beyond the $1,800 mark. Previously stuck near a bear flag formation with a ceiling at $1,603, the token has not only broken through this ceiling but has also exceeded its realized price of $1,609 for the first time since May 7. Analysts now project MKR could surge as high as $2,400 in the near term. These moves are backed by a favorable Money Flow Index and Bull-Bear Power indicators, both of which suggest continued buying pressure. What stands out most in Maker’s recent activity is its resilience. Despite broader market caution, MKR’s upward movement reflects sustained participant confidence in its long-term value. As it transitions branding efforts toward becoming Sky, Maker is not only changing perception but also fortifying its infrastructure. This combination of technical performance and forward-facing developments is drawing considerable attention from crypto market watchers seeking signals of breakout momentum. The Final Word: Which One Has the Strongest Path Ahead? As June 2025 unfolds, the crypto market continues to shift based on developments that matter. Aptos is moving up the chain of influence by stepping directly into regulatory debates. Maker has proved its ability to surprise analysts by climbing past key resistance levels and keeping momentum alive. Qubetics, meanwhile, is steadily building out its foundational products while drawing participation in its carefully structured presale. Each of these platforms addresses a different pain point in the crypto space—from scalability and regulation to resilience and privacy. But for those watching closely, Qubetics stands out as a project worth watching as it edges toward its launch window. This might be the time to join this best crypto presale before Qubetics transitions into its full-scale mainnet deployment, offering one of the clearest routes to becoming the next big crypto.

Qubetics addresses internet privacy and blockchain interoperability through a decentralized VPN, offering practical use cases for both individuals and businesses. Why is Qubetics being ranked as one of the best crypto presale opportunities this cycle? Because of its limited supply, robust utility applications in real-world digital payments, and a community-driven allocation model, analysts continue to flag it as one of the best crypto presale projects currently active. Why are Aptos and Maker trending in the market right now? Aptos is gaining institutional attention through congressional testimony, while Maker is rising sharply due to strong technical indicators and bullish sentiment.

45572530,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=166656,1749165633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45572530.jpeg,"Crucial US China Trade Talks Resume, Boosting Global Hopes",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-china-trade-talks/,"BitcoinWorld Crucial US China Trade Talks Resume, Boosting Global Hopes In a development that has captured the attention of global financial markets, including the often-volatile world of Cryptocurrency , US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have reportedly agreed to resume Trade Talks . This news, initially reported by Chinese state media CCTV and shared by prominent market commentators like @DeItaone on X, signals a potential de-escalation in tensions that have weighed heavily on the Global Economy . Why Do US China Trade Developments Matter for Cryptocurrency? While seemingly unrelated to digital assets, the relationship between the United States and China is arguably the single most significant bilateral economic dynamic on the planet. The state of US China Trade directly influences: Global Market Sentiment: When the two largest economies are in conflict, uncertainty rises. This often leads to a ‘risk-off’ environment where investors pull capital from perceived riskier assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies, seeking safety in assets like gold or government bonds. Conversely, positive developments can foster a ‘risk-on’ mood, encouraging investment in growth assets. Economic Growth Projections: Trade disputes impact supply chains, manufacturing, and consumer confidence worldwide. A healthier global economy generally provides a more favorable backdrop for asset classes like cryptocurrency, which benefit from increased liquidity and investor confidence. Capital Flows: Major shifts in economic policy or trade relations can influence how and where large pools of capital are deployed globally. Therefore, monitoring the progress of Trade Talks is crucial for anyone looking to understand the broader macroeconomic forces that can significantly influence Market Impact across all asset classes, including digital currencies. The Details of the Agreement: What We Know So Far The agreement to resume negotiations followed a reportedly lengthy and positive call between President Trump and President Xi. Here are the key takeaways: Source of Information: The news was first disseminated via Chinese state media CCTV, picked up by financial news feeds like @DeItaone, and later confirmed by President Trump himself on Truth Social. Call Duration: President Trump described the call as lasting approximately 90 minutes. This duration suggests a substantive conversation rather than a brief check-in. Reported Outcome: According to President Trump, the call ended positively for both nations. Chinese state media reported an agreement to begin a new round of talks “as soon as possible.” Implicit Context: The need to “resume” talks implies that previous negotiations had stalled or broken down, highlighting the significance of this new agreement to restart the process. This development marks a potential turning point after periods of intense tariff exchanges and rhetoric that created significant uncertainty for businesses and investors globally. Navigating the Potential Market Impact The resumption of Trade Talks is generally perceived as a positive catalyst for the Global Economy . Reduced trade tensions could lead to: Increased Business Confidence: Companies might be more willing to invest and expand if the threat of escalating tariffs diminishes. More Stable Supply Chains: Reduced uncertainty allows businesses to plan more effectively and avoid costly disruptions. Improved Consumer Sentiment: Stable economic conditions and potentially lower costs (due to reduced tariffs) can boost consumer spending. For the cryptocurrency market, this could translate into: Potential Benefits: A stronger ‘risk-on’ environment could encourage investors to allocate capital back into cryptocurrencies. Increased stability in traditional markets might reduce knee-jerk sell-offs in crypto during global economic jitters. A generally healthier global economy supports innovation and investment across all sectors, including blockchain and digital assets. Potential Challenges/Risks: Talks could still break down, leading to renewed uncertainty and negative Market Impact . The actual terms of any potential trade deal matter significantly; not all agreements are equally positive for all sectors. Other macroeconomic factors (inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events) still play a major role and can outweigh the positive impact of trade progress. What Actionable Insights Can Crypto Investors Gain? Given the interconnectedness of the Global Economy and financial markets, here’s how crypto enthusiasts can use this information: Monitor Progress: Keep a close eye on news regarding the actual commencement and progress of the US China Trade negotiations. Headlines about breakthroughs or impasses can cause swift market reactions. Observe Market Reaction: Watch how traditional markets (like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and global indices) react to trade news. Positive reactions in these markets often correlate with positive sentiment spilling over into crypto. Diversify Perspective: Understand that while trade is a major factor, it’s not the only one. Consider monetary policy, regulatory news, and technological developments within the crypto space itself. Be Prepared for Volatility: While positive news is good, the path to a trade resolution is often bumpy. Be prepared for potential volatility in the crypto market driven by headlines, both positive and negative. Treating this US China Trade development as a key piece of the global macroeconomic puzzle is essential for making informed decisions in the crypto market. Concluding Thoughts: A Step Towards Stability? The agreement between President Trump and President Xi to resume Trade Talks is a significant development that offers a glimmer of hope for increased stability in the Global Economy . While the outcome of these negotiations remains uncertain, the willingness to return to the table is a positive sign. For the cryptocurrency market, which is increasingly influenced by global macroeconomic trends and overall Market Impact , this represents a crucial factor to watch. The potential for reduced trade tensions could contribute to a more favorable investment climate, but investors should remain vigilant and informed about the progress of these vital discussions.

The crash unfolded alongside a brutal political brawl between Elon and the sitting US president, and it dragged the once-beloved meme coin deep into the red. The drama kicked off earlier this week when Elon took shots at Trump’s latest spending bill. Trump didn’t stay quiet. He hit back by pulling the NASA nomination of Jared Isaacman, Elon’s longtime business ally and the man he wanted leading US space exploration efforts. That withdrawal shattered any illusion of peace between them. Trump threatens to cancel contracts, Musk responds with Dragon shutdown By Thursday, the fight turned into a full-on public war. Trump told the press he was “very disappointed” in Elon. Within hours, Elon fired back on X, writing, “Trump would have lost the election without me.” The next reply from Trump? “CRAZY.” He followed that with a threat to cancel federal contracts held by Elon’s companies. The impact on the market was immediate. Tesla shares fell 14% before closing for the day. Elon didn’t hesitate. He wrote on X, “Go ahead, make my day,” and then announced that SpaceX would begin shutting down its Dragon spacecraft program. Dragon is the only American spacecraft that transports astronauts to and from the International Space Station. There was no direct mention of Dogecoin, but it didn’t matter. The coin has never been tied to any real-world value or asset. Instead, it runs on vibes, hype, memes—and above all—Elon’s influence. That’s why this political chaos hit so hard. Elon leaving Washington means his sway is fading, and Dogecoin holders are taking the hit. In 2022, Dogecoin jumped 15% in a day after Tesla accepted it for merch. In 2023, Elon replaced the Twitter logo with a shiba inu, the Dogecoin mascot, and the price surged over 30%. Now that Elon is out of Trump’s circle, and contracts are under threat, that same price is collapsing. Back in November, after Trump’s win, Dogecoin had rallied with other coins like bitcoin, as crypto traders expected a regulation-free environment. That optimism is dead now. With Elon out and government pressure mounting, buyers are paying the price for betting on their bromance.

According to the South Korean news agency Yonhap , two bills that propose institutionalizing tokenized securities are pending before the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee. Tokenized Securities: High on Political Agenda? The bills were drafted by lawmakers Min Byeong-deok and Kim Jae-seop. The National Assembly has been effectively deadlocked since December last year, when former President Yuoon Seok-yeol unsuccessfully attempted to impose martial law. President Lee Jae-myung on Wednesday unveiled key nominations on his first day of presidency, including the prime minister nominee and his presidential aides, in his first briefing to reporters after entering the presidential office in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. https://t.co/lNUF4jvVvw — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) June 4, 2025 But following yesterday’s inauguration of President Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party (DP) , an end to the impasse is now in sight. The DP has a large majority in parliament. Senior party officials have repeatedly called for Seoul to legalize security token offerings (STOs). This would overturn a much-maligned blanket ban on all forms of public blockchain-based token issuances. The ban dates back to the end of the 2010s. Yonhap wrote that expectations are now high that lawmakers will “quickly” turn their attention to STO regulations. The news agency wrote that expectations about approval grew high in previous sessions. Many felt the committee was on the cusp of approving the bills. The South Korean National Assembly Building in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: SC Jang) Both bills failed to pass the past session “due to external factors such as the National Assembly’s deadlock,” Yonhap wrote. The agency added, “However, the industry thinks that much has since changed.” Firms Ready to Act Scores of South Korean companies have been sitting on tokenized securities-related offerings for years, in anticipation of favorable legislation. This number includes large financial providers, telecom giants, and leading tech companies. Former President Yoon repeatedly pledged to authorize STO approval, but was ultimately unable to deliver on his promises. Domestic firms have told media outlets they are hopeful the same will not be true of President Lee’s government. Lawmakers have reached a de facto consensus about the need to legalize STOs, and the nation’s biggest securities companies want Seoul to fast-track the necessary legislation. Many providers say that this will help them diversify their financial investment product offerings. Yonhap explained: “Both the ruling and opposition parties are, unusually, showing a strong desire to activate the STO market. A bipartisan consensus is emerging.” Lee Jae-myung clinches presidency with record vote count https://t.co/jKFe3xPOyT — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 4, 2025 Financial Inclusion Boost Lawmakers believe STOs will help boost financial inclusion. They think STO will let the public make micro-investments, spending as little as 10,000 won ($7.39) to invest in real estate assets or expensive works of art. However, while the media outlet suggested that politicians will likely push ahead with a vote on Min’s or Kim’s bills once business as usual resumes in the National Assembly, controversy surrounding the fate of Yoon continues to disrupt the chamber’s activities. The DP wants to process several special prosecution laws as it looks to launch an inquiry into Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon-hee. The latter has been accused of crimes including fraud, stock market manipulation, tax evasion, and corruption. The opposition People Power Party has protested the DP’s moves. The former says a plenary session schedule has not yet been agreed upon. President Lee also vowed to launch a KRW-pegged stablecoin in the run-up to June 3’s election . Both he and Min claimed that a won stablecoin could help South Korea “secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony.” The post South Korean Parliament ‘Poised to Approve Tokenized Securities Bill’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|South Korea|Tokenization,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-05 23:30:00

At the forefront of this movement is the concept of Real World Assets (RWA) being brought onto the blockchain. Today, a significant milestone has been reached in this burgeoning sector: Plume Network has officially launched its public mainnet, dubbed Plume Genesis. This launch marks a pivotal moment for RWA Finance (RWAfi), providing a dedicated infrastructure for managing and trading tokenized real-world assets. What is Plume Network and Why Focus on RWA Blockchain? Plume Network positions itself as the first modular L2 blockchain specifically designed for tokenizing Real World Assets . But what exactly does that mean, and why is a dedicated RWA Blockchain necessary? Traditionally, assets like real estate, art, private equity, or even collectibles are illiquid and difficult to trade. Tokenization changes this by creating digital representations (tokens) of these assets on a blockchain. This allows for fractional ownership, increased liquidity, faster settlement, and greater transparency. However, bringing RWAs on-chain isn’t without its complexities. It requires addressing legal and regulatory compliance, ensuring data privacy, and providing robust infrastructure that can handle the unique characteristics of these assets. Plume Network aims to solve these challenges by offering a comprehensive, full-stack solution tailored specifically for RWAfi projects. Their ‘full-stack’ approach means they provide not just the base blockchain layer, but also integrated solutions for asset tokenization, compliance tools, and distribution mechanisms. This makes it easier for businesses and individuals to onboard and manage RWAs in a compliant and efficient manner. Plume Genesis Mainnet: Powering the Future of RWA Finance The launch of Plume Genesis, the public mainnet, signifies that Plume Network is now fully operational and open for users and projects to deploy and interact with RWA-focused applications. This isn’t just another blockchain launch; it’s the debut of infrastructure built from the ground up with RWA Finance as its core mission. Key aspects of the Plume Genesis mainnet include: Dedicated RWA Focus: Optimized for the specific needs of tokenizing and managing real-world assets. Full-Stack Architecture: Provides integrated tools for tokenization, compliance, and distribution. Scalability and Efficiency: As an L2 network, it aims to offer lower transaction costs and higher throughput compared to mainnet layers. EVM Compatibility: Likely built with EVM compatibility in mind, making it easier for developers to migrate or build dApps. This launch is critical because it moves Plume Network from a test environment to a live, production-ready platform where real value can be transferred and managed in the form of tokenized assets. Strong Backing and a Growing Ecosystem A significant indicator of Plume Network’s potential is the caliber of its partnerships and the rapid growth of its ecosystem. The project is backed by notable names in both traditional finance and the crypto space, including: Superstate: A firm founded by Compound founder Robert Leshner, focused on bringing U.S. Treasury bills onto the blockchain. Blackstone: One of the world’s largest alternative investment firms. Invesco: A major global investment management company. These partnerships lend considerable credibility and signal strong interest from institutional players in the potential of the RWA Blockchain space. Their involvement suggests that Plume Network is building infrastructure that meets the standards and needs of large-scale financial institutions. Beyond the backing, Plume Network has already attracted substantial capital and projects to its platform: Over $150 million in RWA capital is reportedly already on-chain. More than 200 projects are building or planning to deploy on the network. This rapid adoption indicates strong demand for a dedicated RWA platform and positions Plume Network as a central hub for future RWA developments. Opportunities on Plume: Staking, Rewards, and Crypto RWA The mainnet launch also opens up several avenues for users to participate and benefit from the Plume Network ecosystem, particularly within the Crypto RWA landscape. One key opportunity is the ability to stake PLUME tokens . Staking is a common mechanism in blockchain networks that allows token holders to support network security and operations while earning rewards. For PLUME token holders, staking provides a way to earn yield directly from the network’s activity. Furthermore, Plume is offering ecosystem rewards . These rewards are designed to incentivize participation and activity on the network, encouraging users to explore the various RWA applications and services being built. An ongoing Plume airdrop is also available, providing early users and participants with an opportunity to receive PLUME tokens. Airdrops are a popular way for new networks to distribute tokens and build community engagement. Adding another layer of opportunity, staking is also available through Nest , which is described as Plume’s RWA yield engine. This suggests that users might be able to stake their PLUME tokens or potentially other RWA-backed tokens within Nest to earn yield derived from the underlying real-world assets or network activity. These features are crucial for bootstrapping the network effect and attracting both users looking for yield opportunities and projects seeking active participants. The Future Landscape of RWA Finance The launch of a dedicated RWA Finance blockchain like Plume Network is a strong signal for the future direction of the crypto industry. It highlights the increasing maturity of blockchain technology and its potential to interact with and transform traditional financial markets. While challenges remain – particularly around regulatory clarity and bridging the gap between physical and digital realms – platforms like Plume are building the necessary infrastructure to overcome them. The significant capital and project interest already seen on Plume suggest that the market is ready for dedicated RWA solutions. The success of Plume Network and similar initiatives could pave the way for a future where a wide range of assets, from real estate fractions to private company equity, are easily traded and managed on-chain, unlocking trillions of dollars in value and creating a more accessible and efficient global financial system. Summary: Plume Network’s Bold Step for Real World Assets In conclusion, the launch of the Plume Genesis public mainnet is a major development for the Real World Assets sector and the broader blockchain industry. By providing a purpose-built, full-stack RWA Blockchain , Plume Network is addressing the specific needs of tokenizing and managing RWAs. With strong backing from traditional finance giants and a rapidly growing ecosystem of projects and capital, Plume is well-positioned to become a key player in the evolution of RWA Finance . Opportunities like PLUME token staking, ecosystem rewards, and the ongoing airdrop offer compelling reasons for users and developers to explore this new platform and participate in the exciting future of Crypto RWA .

A recent development that has captured significant attention involves a major player in the market making a notable addition to its platform. DWF Labs , a prominent global digital asset market maker, has officially announced the listing of the USD1 stablecoin . This particular stablecoin is drawing extra scrutiny due to its association with the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) project, which has been linked to the Trump family. The listing is live on DWF Liquid Markets, the firm’s institutional trading platform, which boasts connectivity to over 1,000 counterparties. This move signifies a potential step towards broader institutional access for USD1, bringing together established financial infrastructure with a project carrying a high-profile political connection. Understanding the Players: DWF Labs and WLFI Project To fully grasp the significance of this development, it’s essential to look at the entities involved. DWF Labs is recognized as a leading force in the digital asset space, specializing in market making, quantitative trading, and Web3 investments. Their platform, DWF Liquid Markets, is designed specifically for institutional clients, offering deep liquidity and access to a wide network of trading partners. On the other side is the WLFI project , or World Liberty Financial. This initiative has gained prominence due to its connection to the Trump family, though the precise nature of the relationship is a subject of discussion. It’s often described as a DeFi project aiming to leverage blockchain technology. The USD1 stablecoin is presented as a core component of this project, intended to provide a stable digital currency pegging its value to the US dollar. What Does a Stablecoin Listing Mean? A stablecoin listing on an institutional platform like DWF Liquid Markets is more than just adding another token. It implies several things: Increased Liquidity: DWF Labs’ role as a market maker means they will actively trade USD1, providing buy and sell orders to ensure smoother price action and easier large-volume trades for institutional clients. Institutional Access: Listing on a platform connected to 1,000+ counterparties opens USD1 up to a vast network of hedge funds, trading firms, and other institutional players who might not typically trade on retail exchanges. Enhanced Visibility: The listing itself generates buzz and brings the USD1 stablecoin and the WLFI project into the spotlight within the professional trading community. Potential for Integration: Inclusion on such a platform can pave the way for USD1’s integration into other institutional crypto products and services. For the USD1 stablecoin and the WLFI project , this listing is a significant milestone in their effort to gain traction in the competitive stablecoin market. The Political Connection: Trump Crypto and Its Implications The term “ Trump crypto ” has become a shorthand for digital asset projects or tokens associated with Donald Trump or his family. While it’s crucial to clarify the exact nature of the connection (often through family members or close associates rather than directly by Donald Trump himself), this association brings both unique opportunities and potential challenges. Potential Opportunities: High Profile: The association generates significant media attention and public awareness, which can be invaluable for a new project. Potential User Base: Could potentially tap into a base of supporters interested in politically aligned digital assets. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Projects linked to prominent political figures may attract increased attention from regulators. Political Polarization: The association can alienate potential users or partners who do not share the same political views. Dependency on Association: The project’s success might become overly reliant on the political connection rather than its underlying technology or utility. Reputational Risk: Any controversy surrounding the political figure could negatively impact the stablecoin and the project. The listing of USD1 by DWF Labs places it squarely at the intersection of finance, technology, and politics, making it a subject of keen interest and careful observation. Navigating the Institutional Crypto Landscape The move by DWF Labs highlights the growing appetite for diverse digital assets within the institutional crypto market. Institutions are increasingly looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to stablecoins, DeFi protocols, and other emerging tokens. Platforms like DWF Liquid Markets cater to the specific needs of these large players, including: Robust security measures High-speed execution Regulatory compliance considerations Access to deep liquidity pools Over-the-counter (OTC) trading options For the WLFI project , having their USD1 stablecoin available on such a platform provides validation and a direct pathway to institutional capital, which is crucial for growth and stability in the long term. What Should Traders and Investors Consider? For those operating in the institutional crypto space or even sophisticated individual traders looking at USD1, several factors warrant consideration: Due Diligence on USD1: Like any stablecoin, understanding its reserve backing, audit frequency, and redemption mechanisms is paramount. Transparency is key. Understanding the WLFI Project: Research the team, the technology, and the broader goals of World Liberty Financial beyond the stablecoin itself. Assessing the Political Risk: Be aware that the association with the Trump family could introduce volatility or regulatory hurdles unrelated to typical market dynamics. Evaluating DWF Liquid Markets: Understand the platform’s fee structure, trading pairs available, and specific terms for trading USD1. Market Competition: USD1 enters a market dominated by giants like USDT, USDC, and others. Its success will depend on adoption, trust, and potential unique features or advantages. While the stablecoin listing by DWF Labs is a positive step for USD1 in terms of accessibility, the unique political context adds layers of complexity that require careful analysis. Conclusion: A Watchful Eye on USD1 and the WLFI Project The listing of the USD1 stablecoin on DWF Liquid Markets marks a significant moment for the WLFI project . It provides institutional access and enhanced liquidity through a major market maker, DWF Labs . However, the project’s association with the “ Trump crypto ” narrative means it will likely face unique challenges and opportunities compared to politically unaligned stablecoins. As the institutional crypto market continues to mature, the inclusion of assets like USD1 demonstrates the expanding scope of digital asset trading. The performance and adoption of USD1, particularly how it navigates the intersection of finance and politics, will be closely watched by market participants and regulators alike. This development underscores the increasingly diverse and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency landscape.

HFSC Holds Critical Crypto Hearing Amid Policy Talks Titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: From Blueprint to a Functional Framework,” the June 4 hearing widely focused on concerns regarding the development of a digital asset regulatory framework . Happening Now: Full Committee hearing examining the Committee’s digital asset market structure framework. WATCH or LISTEN: https://t.co/3qbnUPa7SD — House Committee on Financial Services – Democrats (@USHouseFSC) June 4, 2025 Largely covering the CLARITY Act of 2025, the hearing brought together several crypto-oriented witnesses, including former SEC commissioner Elad Roisman, Etheralize founder Vivek Raman, Uniswap Labs Chief Legal Officer Katherine Minarik, and former CFTC chairman Rostin Benham and Timothy Massad. “I’ve been proudly involved in this issue for over a decade having been former chair of the capital markets subcommittee and having been involved in oversight and investigations,” Huizenga said.“This is the future and we better get our act together.” A Pro-Crypto Senate Showdown Huizenga’s comments come just one week after reports emerged that the House Financial Services Oversight subcommittee chair intends to run for Michigan’s open Senate seat in 2026. Huizenga is known for his crypto-friendly stance toward issues impacting the blockchain sector , having co-sponsored digital asset legislation including FIT21 and the CLARITY Act. The move is likely to upset mainstay Trump-supporters, with Republicans largely backing former Michigan congressman Mike Rogers to campaign for Senate in 2026. Crypto donors have already begun to throw backing in the race, with new crypto super PAC First Principles Digital slated to endorse Rogers in the lead-up to election day. Rogers also has a pro-crypto track record and holds an A rating on digital asset advocacy organization Stand With Crypto’s politician ranking database. “Ensuring that crypto, the next generation of internet information and value flow, is imbued with American values — and payments denominated in American dollars — is paramount,” Rogers said in a recent op-ed published in The Washington Examiner. “Our national security is directly tied to the strength of our economy, and the dollar maintaining its primacy as the global reserve currency.” The post Crypto Is ‘The Future,’ House Financial Services Oversight Subcommittee Chair Says appeared first on Cryptonews .",News|Election|Regulation|U.S. Congress,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|UNI,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-05 23:47:01

Tether, the issuer behind the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, has announced a significant strategic Tether investment in Shiga Digital. This partnership is poised to make waves in the burgeoning Africa blockchain landscape. Who is Shiga Digital and What Does This Tether Investment Mean? Shiga Digital is a financial solutions platform based in Africa, specifically leveraging blockchain technology. While the exact amount of the Tether investment remains undisclosed, the announcement signals a strong commitment from Tether towards supporting digital innovation on the continent. Shiga Digital offers a suite of services designed to empower businesses in Africa, including: Customized virtual accounts Over-the-counter (OTC) trading services Foreign exchange (FX) trading services The company has a clear vision: to place blockchain technology at the core of its future operations. This strategic direction aligns perfectly with the capabilities of stablecoins like USDT stablecoin , which Shiga Digital intends to actively utilize. Why is Africa Becoming a Hotspot for Crypto Investment? The Crypto Africa narrative is one of rapid growth and increasing adoption. Several factors contribute to this trend: High Mobile Penetration: A large portion of the population has access to mobile phones, which serve as gateways to digital financial services. Need for Financial Inclusion: Many Africans remain unbanked or underbanked, and blockchain technology offers potential solutions for broader financial access. Remittances: Africa receives significant remittances, and stablecoins like USDT stablecoin offer a potentially cheaper and faster way to send and receive money across borders. Economic Growth Potential: The continent represents a vast, relatively untapped market with significant economic potential. Tether’s move is not isolated but part of a broader trend of global crypto players recognizing the strategic importance of the Africa blockchain market. Investing in platforms like Shiga Digital provides a localized entry point into this dynamic ecosystem. The Role of USDT Stablecoin in Africa’s Digital Economy The integration of USDT stablecoin into Shiga Digital’s platform is a key aspect of this partnership. Stablecoins offer several advantages that are particularly relevant in African markets: Stability: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, offering a reliable store of value. Cross-Border Transactions: Facilitating cheaper and faster international payments compared to traditional banking channels. Access to Global Markets: Providing a bridge for African businesses and individuals to participate in the global digital economy. Inflation Hedge: In economies experiencing currency fluctuations, holding stablecoins can offer a degree of protection against local currency devaluation. By actively utilizing USDT stablecoin , Shiga Digital can offer its clients more efficient and cost-effective financial services, from trading to cross-border settlements. This directly supports the growth of Crypto Africa . What Services Does Shiga Digital Offer and How Do They Use Blockchain? Shiga Digital is building a platform tailored to the specific needs of the African market. Let’s look closer at their core offerings: Service Description Blockchain Relevance / Benefit Customized Virtual Accounts Providing businesses with digital accounts for managing funds. Potentially leveraging blockchain for transparent record-keeping, faster settlements, and enhanced security. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading Facilitating direct peer-to-peer or business-to-business trading of digital assets and currencies. Blockchain can enable faster, more secure, and potentially lower-cost settlements for large trades. Use of USDT stablecoin simplifies transactions. Foreign Exchange (FX) Trading Allowing businesses to exchange currencies. Blockchain and stablecoins can offer more competitive exchange rates and faster settlement times compared to traditional FX markets. Shiga Digital’s commitment to making blockchain its core business suggests they will continue to innovate, finding new ways to apply distributed ledger technology to solve real-world financial challenges in Africa. The Tether investment will likely accelerate these development efforts. Challenges and Opportunities for Africa Blockchain Adoption While the potential is vast, the path to widespread Africa blockchain adoption is not without hurdles. Challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain varies significantly across African nations. Infrastructure Limitations: Internet connectivity and power supply can be inconsistent in some regions. Education and Awareness: Many potential users are still unfamiliar with blockchain technology and stablecoins like USDT stablecoin . Security Concerns: Protecting users from scams and fraud in a rapidly evolving space is crucial. However, the opportunities often outweigh the challenges. The young, tech-savvy population, the need for better financial infrastructure, and the potential for leapfrogging legacy systems present a fertile ground for growth. The Tether investment in Shiga Digital is a vote of confidence in Africa’s ability to harness these opportunities. Actionable Insights from the Tether-Shiga Digital Partnership What can we learn from this strategic move? Focus on Real-World Use Cases: Projects like Shiga Digital, which address tangible financial needs (payments, trading, accounts), are key to driving adoption in Crypto Africa . Stablecoins as a Catalyst: The emphasis on utilizing USDT stablecoin highlights the role stablecoins play in providing stability and utility in volatile or underserved markets. Strategic Partnerships are Crucial: Global players like Tether partnering with local experts like Shiga Digital can accelerate growth and navigate regional nuances. The Tether investment is a prime example. Africa is a Growth Frontier: This investment reinforces the narrative that Africa is not just a market for adoption but a hub for innovation in the blockchain space. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Africa The strategic Tether investment in Shiga Digital is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a signal of increasing confidence in the potential of Africa blockchain technology. As Shiga Digital expands its services and actively utilizes USDT stablecoin , it has the potential to lower transaction costs, improve financial access, and connect African businesses to the global digital economy more seamlessly. This partnership could serve as a blueprint for future collaborations, further accelerating the growth and adoption of digital finance across the continent. The journey of Crypto Africa is just beginning, and investments like this are paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient financial future.

This is a considerable rise from just 312,200 BTC a year earlier. The reason for the major increase in Bitcoin accumulation is due to various factors. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s value has prompted many more companies to include it in their portfolios. The ongoing support for cryptocurrency by President Donald Trump has created more interest in the sector. After Trump was elected, the U.S. government began to support policies that are beneficial for the crypto industry.

The facility’s administrators say that the bank statements from December 2023 to present show that Dewey, who had access to the account, transferred funds using the peer-to-peer money transfer service Cash App. They also say that the mother has over $16,000 in patient liability, with no payments made since January. Medicaid likewise denied medical assistance due to the old woman’s reported income. The police say that the suspect admitted using Cash App to move money from the PNC bank account and used the funds to purchase groceries and gas, pay personal credit card bills and send money to relatives.

Dogecoin, Solana, and Sui are dealing with tough market conditions like slow momentum, regulatory issues, and technical pressure. In contrast, BlockDAG is making huge moves, separating itself from the pack. It has collected over $287 million and sold 22 billion BDAG coins, with exchange listings set for 20 platforms. Dogecoin is feeling the weight of weak signals, Solana is navigating through legal pressure, and Sui is holding on despite some volatility. These factors are why many are turning toward BlockDAG’s low entry price and big growth potential. Let’s break down the current status of DOGE, SOL, and SUI and explain why BlockDAG is considered one of the top cryptos to buy now for those aiming for major gains before the next bull rally. 1. BlockDAG: Leading the Charge in 2025’s Presale Cryptos Among the top cryptos to buy now, BlockDAG (BDAG) has become a market favorite, supported by solid progress and consistent delivery. Its presale has raised $287 million with 22 billion coins sold. The locked price of $0.0018 until June 13 gives early buyers a shot at 2,678% returns based on its confirmed $0.05 launch rate. There’s also strong chatter about BDAG possibly reaching $1, which could mean over 500x return from today’s rate. Ethereum builders are already moving to BlockDAG thanks to its EVM compatibility, lower costs, and better scalability. Its roadmap includes smart contract kits, builder tools, and real-world use features. Visibility is growing fast, with 20 exchange listings in the pipeline and five already confirmed. With the GO LIVE reveal approaching, interest is climbing. At its current price of $0.0018, BlockDAG isn’t just another coin, it’s fast becoming one of the top cryptos to buy now. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE): Weak Signals Still Dominate DOGE trades near $0.1899, rising just 1.2% daily, but technical signs are not encouraging. It faces pressure at $0.188 and $0.150, and June has often brought declines for the coin. While the range between $0.179 and $0.238 is possible, indicators suggest continued downward pressure. Volume is shrinking, and the trendline is pointing lower, showing low excitement from large-scale buyers. Even though DOGE has an active fan base, there’s no major news or utility-driven spark ahead. This makes it less appealing for those scanning the market for the top cryptos to buy now. Watch key support areas closely if the market dips again. 3. Solana (SOL): Progress Checked by Legal Concerns SOL currently stands at $153.76, rising 1.4% on the day, but last week saw a 10% fall due to legal questions tied to the SEC and Solana-linked ETFs. This has dimmed its recent positive movement. If confidence builds again, it might try to revisit its $177 level or push toward $200. But if it slips under $150, it may drop to $127, especially with rising sell-offs. Solana still shines in speed and app usage, but the legal cloud makes it less attractive as one of the top cryptos to buy now. Other coins offer more near-term promise without regulatory stress. 4. Sui (SUI): Solid Base But Tight Range SUI is hovering at $3.27, gaining 1.9% in 24 hours. It’s holding strong above the key $2.95 support, though concerns remain about a slip to $2.70 if selling grows. Sui’s network is expanding with more dev activity and users, yet its trading zone is narrow. For 2025, prices are forecasted between $2.26 and $3.30, making it more of a stable bet than a high-gain choice. The coin has solid foundations, but those searching for the top cryptos to buy now may look elsewhere. It’s steady, but not leading the charge in growth. Final Remarks! Amid all the noise, a few coins show real strength. DOGE continues to mirror its past June patterns, SOL is weighed down by legal issues, and SUI remains range-bound. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is pushing ahead with a $287 million presale, developer tools, and planned listings. That 2,678% return estimate and a possible $1 price make BlockDAG stand out clearly. Its focus on usability, builder support, and exchange visibility adds to its momentum. For those still wondering about the top cryptos to buy now , BlockDAG may be more than just a good pick, it could be leading the next major crypto run. The current window won’t last long.

A significant piece of clarity has emerged from a key European financial authority regarding the application of the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. This clarification specifically addresses the status of two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin and Ethereum. For those navigating the complexities of crypto regulation Europe , this insight from the Central Bank of Ireland is particularly relevant. Understanding the Core of MiCA Regulation Before diving into the specifics of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s status, it’s essential to grasp what MiCA regulation is and why it’s so important. MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the European Union. Its primary goals are to: Provide legal certainty for crypto assets not covered by existing EU financial services legislation. Support innovation while ensuring financial stability and protecting investors and consumers. Establish harmonized rules for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) across the EU. Address risks related to market integrity and financial stability that could arise from crypto assets. MiCA covers a broad range of crypto assets and activities, but its scope is defined by specific categories of crypto assets and the services provided in relation to them. This is where the detail matters, particularly concerning the requirement of an ‘identifiable issuer’. Central Bank Ireland Crypto Stance: No Issuer, No MiCA? The recent statement causing discussion comes from Mary-Elizabeth McMunn, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland. According to reports, she indicated that both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are currently not subject to the MiCA regulation because they lack an identifiable issuer. This point is crucial. MiCA’s framework largely applies to crypto assets that are issued by a specific entity or group, making that entity accountable for compliance, disclosure, and other requirements. Think of it this way: For many traditional financial instruments, there’s a clear issuer – a company issuing shares, a government issuing bonds, a bank issuing stablecoins (which MiCA does cover under specific categories). This issuer is responsible for meeting regulatory obligations. Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, were launched in a decentralized manner, with no single company, foundation (in the traditional sense), or individual entity acting as a central issuer responsible for their ongoing existence or issuance in the way MiCA defines it. Why the ‘MiCA Issuer’ Point is Key for Bitcoin and Ethereum The distinction regarding the MiCA issuer is fundamental to how the regulation classifies crypto assets. MiCA broadly categorizes crypto assets into: Crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens: This is a broad category, but the issuer requirements still apply for many sub-types. Asset-referenced tokens (ARTs): Crypto assets that purport to maintain a stable value by referencing another value or right, or a combination thereof, including one or more official currencies. E-money tokens (EMTs): Crypto assets that purport to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of one official currency. The requirements for issuing and offering ARTs and EMTs are particularly stringent under MiCA, placing significant obligations on the issuer. For crypto assets that don’t fit neatly into ART or EMT categories, the application of MiCA often still hinges on there being an identifiable entity responsible for the public offering or admission to trading. Because Bitcoin and the original Ether issuance model predate much of this regulatory thinking and operate on decentralized networks without a central issuing authority, they arguably fall outside the direct scope of MiCA’s issuer-centric provisions. This is the basis for the Central Bank of Ireland’s Deputy Governor’s statement on Bitcoin Ethereum MiCA status. Contrasting with Tokens Having an Identifiable Issuer: The XRP Example The original report mentioned a comment from crypto influencer “SMQKE” highlighting XRP as an example of a token that *does* have an identifiable issuer (Ripple Labs). This comparison helps underscore the point made by the Central Bank of Ireland. If a crypto asset has a clear entity responsible for its creation, distribution, and potentially ongoing development or management in a centralized manner, it is far more likely to be considered within MiCA’s scope, potentially as a utility token (depending on its function) or another regulated category if it references assets or fiat. This contrast illustrates the regulatory challenge posed by the diverse nature of crypto assets. Regulators are attempting to fit novel digital assets into frameworks often designed for traditional finance, where identifiable issuers and responsible entities are standard. The decentralized nature of networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum presents a unique case that requires careful interpretation of regulations like MiCA. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation in Europe? The stance from the Central Bank Ireland crypto position offers valuable insight into how national regulators within the EU are interpreting MiCA. While MiCA is an EU-wide regulation, its application and enforcement will involve national competent authorities. This statement suggests that, at least from the perspective of the Irish central bank, the decentralized nature of BTC and ETH places them outside the primary issuance and offering rules of MiCA. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin and Ethereum are entirely unregulated in Europe. Activities involving these assets, such as trading services provided by crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), *are* covered by MiCA. CASPs dealing with BTC, ETH, or any other crypto asset must comply with MiCA’s requirements regarding authorization, governance, consumer protection, market abuse prevention, and more. So, while the assets themselves might not be regulated at the ‘issuer’ level, the businesses that interact with them on behalf of users within the EU *are* subject to comprehensive rules under MiCA. This is a critical distinction. Potential Implications and Benefits of this Clarity For the crypto industry and users in Europe, this clarification, particularly regarding the Bitcoin Ethereum MiCA relationship, offers several potential benefits: Increased Certainty: Reduces ambiguity around the regulatory status of the two largest cryptocurrencies, which are foundational to the broader crypto market. Focus on Services: Reinforces that MiCA’s focus for decentralized assets is on regulating the *services* provided around them (exchanges, wallets, etc.), rather than attempting to regulate the decentralized protocols themselves. Potential for Innovation: By acknowledging the unique structure of truly decentralized networks, this interpretation might provide more space for innovation at the protocol layer, while ensuring consumer protection occurs at the service provider layer. However, this interpretation isn’t without its nuances and potential future considerations. For instance, the status of Ethereum post-merge and its move to Proof-of-Stake, including staking services, is an area that continues to be discussed within regulatory circles. While the core ETH asset may not have a central issuer, services built around staking could potentially have different regulatory considerations. Challenges and Remaining Questions for Crypto Regulation Europe While the Central Bank Ireland crypto statement provides clarity on one aspect, the broader landscape of crypto regulation Europe still presents challenges: Defining ‘Decentralized’: Where is the line drawn between a truly decentralized network and one with enough central control to constitute an ‘issuer’? This will likely be a point of ongoing regulatory scrutiny for newer or less decentralized projects. Scope of Services: As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, determining which activities constitute regulated ‘services’ under MiCA and who is responsible for compliance becomes complex. Harmonization in Practice: While MiCA aims for harmonization, interpretations by national authorities, though guided by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Banking Authority (EBA), might still vary in practice. Future Developments: The crypto space is dynamic. New types of assets and services may require future regulatory adjustments or interpretations. Understanding these complexities is vital for anyone operating or investing in the European crypto market. The focus is clearly shifting towards regulating the gateways and service providers that connect users to the decentralized world, rather than attempting to police the decentralized protocols themselves, especially those lacking a clear MiCA issuer . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Based on this significant clarification and the broader scope of MiCA, here are some actionable insights: For Users: Be aware that while BTC and ETH might not be directly regulated at the protocol level under MiCA, the platforms and wallets you use to buy, sell, or store them within the EU are likely regulated. Choose CASPs that are transparent about their compliance status. For Businesses (CASPs): MiCA compliance is non-negotiable if you operate in the EU. Focus on meeting the stringent requirements for authorization, governance, risk management, and consumer protection, regardless of whether the underlying assets you handle (like BTC or ETH) have an issuer or not. For Project Teams (Developing New Assets): If your project involves issuing a new token, carefully consider whether it falls under MiCA’s definitions, particularly ARTs or EMTs, or if it could be considered to have an identifiable issuer. Seek legal and regulatory advice early in your development process if you intend to target the EU market. Stay Informed: Regulatory interpretations can evolve. Follow updates from EU authorities (ESMA, EBA) and national regulators like the Central Bank of Ireland to stay abreast of developments impacting MiCA regulation and crypto regulation Europe . Summary: A Step Towards Clarity in European Crypto Regulation The statement from the Central Bank of Ireland’s Deputy Governor, Mary-Elizabeth McMunn, provides welcome clarity on a specific but crucial aspect of the MiCA regulation: that Bitcoin and Ethereum, due to their lack of an identifiable issuer, are not subject to the issuance and offering requirements of the framework. This aligns with the decentralized nature of these pioneering networks and reinforces the idea that MiCA’s focus, for such assets, is primarily on regulating the service providers that facilitate access for users. While challenges and questions remain in the complex world of crypto regulation Europe , this interpretation from the Central Bank Ireland crypto stance marks a significant step in understanding the practical application of MiCA and the importance of the MiCA issuer concept in determining regulatory scope, particularly concerning the status of Bitcoin Ethereum MiCA interactions.

Solana is struggling, as it slipped under important support zones. In contrast, Dogecoin shows signs of strength and may be heading toward a bullish breakout. The real surprise is Web3 ai ($WAI) . While its price is still just $0.000422 in Stage 8, it’s drawing serious attention. The listing price is set at $0.005242, which means a possible 1747% return for early buyers. With more than $7.1 million raised already, this project might outpace both DOGE and SOL in terms of real impact. Solana Struggles Despite ETF Talk Around the Corner Solana’s price continues to fall, even as talks around ETF approval pick up. It is now trading under a key support area, and technical charts show rising pressure and weaker momentum. Analysts point out that the declining volume and lack of strong buying signals could mean short-term struggles for SOL. Still, some long-term supporters remain hopeful. With ETFs on the radar, the coin may get a second wind if broader market interest returns to layer-one platforms. Past upgrades and SOL’s efficient ecosystem suggest it could bounce back. If market sentiment changes, this dip may still turn into an opportunity for those watching closely. Dogecoin’s Chart Suggests Big Move Ahead Dogecoin (DOGE) is forming a bullish ascending triangle on its daily chart. That pattern usually hints at a breakout. DOGE is now hovering around $0.17, and analysts believe that closing above $0.175 could rally toward $0.19 or even $0.20. On-chain signals look good. Wallet activity is picking up, and the trading volume is also growing. DOGE has faced plenty of swings, but its strong community and listing across major exchanges keep it relevant. Indicators like RSI and MACD are now moving in the right direction. For traders chasing short-term gains, this setup might be worth watching. Web3 ai Hits $7.1M With $WAI Powering DeFi Focused Features Web3 ai is making quiet but powerful moves during its early stages. The project aims to solve practical problems in crypto using artificial intelligence. At the heart of its ecosystem is $WAI, the utility coin that powers all platform features. Currently in Stage 8, $WAI is priced at $0.000422. The listing price is confirmed at $0.005242, offering a potential return of 1747%. More than $7.1 million has been raised so far, showing strong demand. What makes it even more notable is that this momentum is not driven by celebrity hype or memes, it’s backed by utility. Web3 ai has a total of 50 presale stages. The final stage price is $0.003276, still below the listing price. This gap is drawing attention from early participants. Once live, all AI tools, designed for DeFi users and crypto communities, will become active. These tools include features for tracking market trends, detecting risks, and enhancing research. While many rush into meme coins for fast gains, Web3 ai is focused on building a reliable foundation for AI in crypto. It’s still under one cent, yet already proving its demand. With a clear roadmap, smart utility, and rising traction, Web3 ai could become one of the standout platforms of this cycle. Summing Up! Solana’s technical patterns hint at weakness despite ETF buzz. Dogecoin’s momentum looks better, but its gains depend on market support. Web3 ai stands apart by not relying on hype or short-term spikes. Its AI tools will go live after listing, adding real value. The $WAI token fuels the entire platform. With over $7.1 million raised and a low presale price of $0.000422, the project is building for long-term utility, not just market chatter. If SOL and DOGE feel like stories from past cycles, Web3 ai could be what’s next. In a noisy space, $WAI offers a clear and grounded signal.

Here’s Why This is Good for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/swift-quietly-approves-ripples-interledger-protocol-heres-why-this-is-good-for-xrp/,"An official change request listed on the ISO 20022 website has been approved, and it may significantly alter the future of digital value transfer. Submitted by The Mojaloop Foundation for Payments and Clearing Settlement. This request was approved in late 2024 and proposes an implementation that references Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP), a technology designed to enable seamless, cross-network payments. This approval could significantly benefit XRP in the coming months. This development surfaced through a post on X by crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), who published a short video highlighting the approved ISO change request. In a follow-up, he shared several images pointing to Ripple’s ILP as a key component for value transfer across otherwise incompatible networks. Notably, the documentation proves that the Interledger Protocol is not a theoretical framework, but is already functioning and integrated with Ripple’s existing infrastructure. A Confirmed Connection Between ILP, XRP, and SWIFT The documentation attached to SMQKE’s post reinforces a crucial technical point: Ripple’s Interledger Protocol utilizes XRP in the process of value movement. This integration offers significant potential to modernize global remittance and settlement systems while embedding XRP into the architecture. This functionality becomes especially relevant in the universal mode of ILP, where transactions can occur between untrusted connectors, bypassing the need for notaries by using XRP as a bridging asset . Another excerpt specifies that the ILP system relies on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for final settlement. The diagram outlines the payment flow, showing how connectors facilitate interim exchanges. All claims are ultimately recorded and redeemed on the XRPL. SMQKE also attached a document from SBI Group, a long-time Ripple partner , which acknowledges Ripple’s hybrid technology that combines ILP and XRP Ledger. The slide explains that XRP can be used as a bridge currency in international transfers, eliminating the need for multiple local currencies while enhancing interoperability. YES — RIPPLE’S INTERLEDGER PROTOCOL USES XRP TO MOVE VALUE ACROSS NETWORKS Documented 4x. https://t.co/shLyD5rR2L pic.twitter.com/RJx3di7v63 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 4, 2025 SWIFT Network Compatibility Marks a Turning Point The significance of ISO 20022’s approval lies in the standard’s role as a global foundation for financial messaging, particularly within systems like SWIFT. With Ripple’s ILP now officially linked to a change request involving the ISO 20022 standard, it positions Ripple’s infrastructure as interoperable with the widely used messaging standard. This approval is even more notable because SWIFT has confirmed full migration to the ISO 20022 standard by November. Ripple’s payment system is ISO 20022 compliant, and this integration of ILP into the system gives way for potential XRP adoption in SWIFT’s ecosystem.

A chart analysis posted by a crypto analyst on the social media platform X has given an interesting projection about XRP’s next move. By overlaying XRP’s current weekly chart with its explosive 2017 fractal, the analyst hints that the altcoin might be on the verge of a repeat performance that sends it far beyond its current price range. 2017 XRP Fractal Overlaid Technical analysis of XRP price action on the weekly timeframe reveals an interesting pattern that has been unfolding over multiple weeks. This interesting pattern began with the intense XRP price rally in Q4 2024, which eventually ended in a consolidation around $2, as seen in the current price action. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a flag pattern that is still playing out. Related Reading: Analyst Shows 3-Cycle Ride For XRP Price To Reach $46 The core of the analyst’s technical analysis lies in the uncanny resemblance between XRP’s present market structure and the bullish pattern that preceded the historic 2017 rally. As such, the analyst overlaid the 2017 fractal onto the current price action, revealing a formation that mirrors a giant bull flag, which is often interpreted as a technical continuation pattern. The analysis also places into focus XRP’s ongoing interaction with the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) on the weekly candlestick timeframe. Back in 2017, this level acted as a support base for XRP’s vertical breakout. Now, the current pattern shows the cryptocurrency is once again consolidating directly above this moving average, which the analyst describes as the foundation of a giga bull flag. The resemblance doesn’t stop at price structure. The analyst also draws attention to the RSI behavior. Back in 2017, the RSI entered a flat compressed zone between two spikes on the weekly timeframe, a pattern that appears to be repeating today. The first RSI peak has already formed, and the current flattening phase suggests a possible second spike may soon follow, which could correlate with a breakout in price if the fractal stays valid. What To Expect If 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? The implications are exciting if XRP follows the same trajectory as it did in 2017. The overlay suggests a price rally beyond $20, which would represent the biggest rally so far in XRP’s price history. The projected move would take XRP far beyond its 2018 all-time high of $3.40 and establish a new price floor above double digits for the cryptocurrency. This projection aligns with other projections in similar technical analyses from other cryptocurrency analysts. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Now Targeting $4 After Reversal From ‘Buy Zone’ At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.2, down by 2,3% in the past 24 hours. Whether or not XRP follows the 2017 pattern exactly remains to be seen, but the similarities in price behavior, RSI compression, and EMA support are difficult to dismiss.

This is a great development on the path to regulated digital assets in the US. The bill aims to lay down a comprehensive set of rules for the growing world of cryptocurrencies. With bipartisan support and industry backers, it is now well on its way to one of the most disruptive periods of its journey — the committee review and amendment process. The CLARITY Act is pitched to clarify how digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, are regulated. For years, the crypto industry has complained about murky regulations and conflicting guidance from federal agencies. The bill is trying to define what digital assets are. It also seeks to split the regulatory authority between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). That will allow innovation in crypto to continue — while ensuring that consumers and markets are protected from fraud and abuse, lawmakers who introduced the bill last week on May 29 said. The Financial Services Committee will review the bill at the June 10 markup at the Rayburn House Office Building. They will offer amendments, argue over its wording, and mold it into a final version that could be sent to the full House for a vote. Lawmakers push CLARITY Act forward amid GENIUS Act uncertainty Support for the CLARITY Act is building. That’s celebrated as a boon by crypto businesses, developers, and investors. But there’s a catch: the bill’s future could rely on the fate of another piece of legislation making its way through the Senate — the GENIUS Act . The GENIUS Act aims for stablecoins, several types of crypto that track things in the real world — like the US dollar. The crypto economies rely heavily on stablecoins, the gas on which many digital assets famously ride. The Senate made major progress on June 4 when it took a key procedural vote on the GENIUS Act. The vote was strong and bipartisan — 66 in favor to 32 against. This provides evidence that legislators of both stripes understand the need for new financial rules in an era increasingly dominated by blockchain. The GENIUS Act would impose tight regulations on stablecoin issuers, such as full asset backing and periodic disclosures of reserves. Lawmakers argue that this will foster trust from the public and ultimately allow innovation to persist. Because stablecoins are so integral to the digital asset economy, many believe the GENIUS Act must pass before the CLARITY Act can effectively go to work. If the GENIUS Act flounders in the Senate, it would sap momentum for the CLARITY Act in the House. Crypto advocates push to influence CLARITY Act language With the markup date approaching, crypto advocates are fighting to shape the language that will be included in the final iteration of the CLARITY Act. Eight industry groups have banded together to advocate for language in the bill featuring the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, another proposal that would shield DeFi developers — those who code up decentralized financial platforms but don’t hold user funds. They argue they should not be treated like banks or financial institutions because they do not hold assets. Without these protections, developers fear being saddled with regulations designed for completely different businesses. They also fear conflicts of interest in the legislative process. Yet some warned that clear ethical guidelines needed to be established, or there would be public distrust. There have been suggestions to prohibit federal officials from owning or advocating for cryptocurrencies in office. These are thought necessary to ensure a level playing field for regulating virtual assets and to prevent corruption.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin BTC is trading above $101.5K as Asia begins its trading day, shrugging off fresh tariff uncertainties from the Trump administration. However, the real story, according to Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation at Pythagoras Investments, is that traders continue to be laser-focused on a bull market throughout the remainder of the year, with a high degree of confidence that BTC will reach $120,000, buoyed by persistent corporate buying and declining volatility. ""The uncertainty from unexpected tariff increases by the Trump administration is causing some volatility,"" Gabeljic said in an email to CoinDesk. ""However, bitcoin remains relatively strong, with lower volatility compared to other digital assets."" Institutional bullishness remains resilient, Gabeljic highlighted, noting that traders on Polymarket are ""pricing in a 69% probability that Bitcoin will hit at least $120,000 by year-end."" FlowDesk, a Paris-based market maker, echoed this optimistic outlook despite recent subdued market conditions in a recent note on Telegram. ""The market is clearly coiling, waiting to break out of a narrow band just below all-time highs,"" FlowDesk wrote in their market update note. ""Significant repositioning and rotation from Bitcoin towards altcoins has occurred, though BTC's underlying strength remains evident."" FlowDesk also noted cautious market behavior, as indicated by a modest decline in BTC funding rates on major exchanges like Binance, which suggests a reduction in leverage. However, on-chain borrowing activity has seen renewed vigor, potentially signaling anticipation of an imminent market breakout. Further bolstering the bullish BTC narrative is the continued accumulation by corporate treasuries. Listed companies now hold approximately 809,100 BTC, worth nearly $85 billion, nearly doubling the amount held a year ago, driven by favorable regulatory shifts and accounting changes that allow for the recognition of bitcoin gains. ""The expectation of a continued strong bitcoin remains,"" said Gabeljic. News Roundup $TRUMP Token Drops 9% as Musk-Trump Feud, Family Crypto Clash Spook Investors The presidential-themed $TRUMP memecoin fell 9.3% on Thursday, significantly underperforming the broader crypto market as tracked by the CoinDesk 20, an index covering the largest digital assets, which declined 5%. The token’s sharp downturn followed a heated public exchange between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, sparked by disagreements over Trump’s proposed “Big, Beautiful Bill” and its impact on national debt, CoinDesk previously reported . The argument escalated quickly, with Musk threatening to ground SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft and Trump countering by suggesting the government might sever contracts with Musk-led enterprises. Further pressure on the memecoin came after its newly launched crypto wallet, created in partnership with NFT marketplace Magic Eden, went offline following a cease-and-desist from another Trump-affiliated crypto venture. Trump’s sons publicly distanced themselves from the memecoin project, highlighting their involvement in a separate Ethereum-based DeFi initiative, World Liberty Financial. The internal branding clash added another layer of uncertainty, amplifying investor concerns and weighing heavily on the token’s price. CRCL Soars on First Day of Trading Circle (CRCL) shares soared 167% on their first day of trading, closing at $83 after pricing its IPO at $31, briefly hitting an intraday peak of $104. The surge recalls Coinbase's volatile 2021 IPO, which similarly started strong but rapidly lost momentum, raising caution among investors about long-term stability. The jump in Circle's stock price came amid a modest uptick in stablecoin market activity. Trading volume for Circle's USDC rose 22% over the past 24 hours, while market leader Tether's USDT saw volume increase by 13%. Despite the bullish debut, the coming weeks will test Circle’s staying power as investors assess whether enthusiasm around stablecoin infrastructure translates into sustained stock performance. U.S. Treasury Sanctions Philippines Firm Linked to $200M 'Pig Butchering' Crypto Scams The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Philippines-based tech firm Funnull Technology Inc. and its administrator, Liu Lizhi, for facilitating ""pig butchering"" crypto scams responsible for over $200 million in losses from U.S. victims, CoinDesk previously reported. OFAC accused Funnull Technology of providing digital infrastructure, such as IP addresses and domains, used by cybercriminals to host hundreds of thousands of scam websites designed to deceive victims into fraudulent crypto investments. ""Pig butchering"" refers to elaborate crypto scams that groom victims over time, often beginning through unsolicited messages and fake romantic overtures, before convincing them to invest significant sums. With these sanctions, OFAC prohibits any U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with Funnull or Liu, aiming to disrupt the networks enabling these extensive cyber scams and to safeguard investors in the digital asset ecosystem. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin dropped nearly 4% to test the $100K support level before rebounding above $101.5K, as high-volume selling and major exchange outflows signaled growing market stress amid weakening retail activity. ETH: Ethereum dropped 4% after repeatedly failing to surpass the critical $2,640 resistance level, despite increased institutional buying and notable whale accumulation of over $285 million in ETH. Gold: Gold edged higher to $3,363.58 in early Asian trading amid weak U.S. economic data and signs of easing U.S.-China tensions, as the Gold-Silver Ratio surged past 100—a rare signal historically linked to outsized silver returns. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened higher, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.14%, after a positive 90-minute call between U.S. President Trump and China's Xi Jinping set the stage for resumed trade negotiations. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures flatlined as a public feud between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk added uncertainty to market sentiment.

45575524,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=741641,1749170883,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45575524.jpeg,Citadel Securities president warns US debt is a ticking time bomb,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/citadel-warns-us-debt-is-a-ticking-time-bomb/,"President of Citadel Securities, Jim Esposito, has warned that America’s growing debt is a serious risk. Speaking at Thursday’s Piper Sandler Global Exchange & FinTech Conference, Esposito described the rising budget deficit and national debt as a “ticking time bomb.” “No one is smart enough to predict when exactly it will rear its ugly head,” he said . Esposito’s caution follows a sharp increase in pessimism among top finance executives on the prospects for the US economy. His comments echo those from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who late last month warned that there would be a crack in the bond market after the US government and Federal Reserve “massively overdid” spending and quantitative easing. Goldman’s president, John Waldron, recently said that US debt levels are more concern for bond traders than Trump’s tariff policies. Dimon warned in May that there would be a break in the bond market, emphasizing that it was not a question of if but when. Goldman Sachs President John Waldron also chimed in. He said bond traders are more concerned about the US debt than Trump’s trade tariffs. For him, the biggest risks to market stability are higher borrowing costs and the deficit. Citadel’s billionaire founder and CEO, Ken Griffin, also weighed in, criticizing the Trump-supported tax bill moving through Congress. He called the legislation reckless and warned in a June 5 interview that it would only worsen the nation’s debt crisis. Congress pushes trillion-dollar tax cuts The alert is coming as lawmakers debate huge tax cuts. The US House of Representatives passed it with the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in late May. The measure renews tax cuts in the 2017 Trump-era tax law. But it comes at a high price. The bill would increase the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over a decade, the Congressional Budget Office said. That’s on top of a vast national debt exceeding $36 trillion. Most economists say that the level of borrowing is not sustainable. The US spends over a trillion dollars annually on interest on debt alone. That is more than it spends on the military or public health. Esposito stated that the issue was not about politics but about math, adding that the current debt level is definitely at the upper limit of what is sustainable. Citadel ramps up efforts amid market turbulence Citadel Securities, which is based in Miami, is one of the biggest market makers in the world. The company does well when the market action intensifies and stock trading picks up. The first quarter of 2025 brought record profits and trading revenue for the firm — driven by gyrations in the bond and stock markets. Despite benefiting from turbulence, the broader economic risks are all too real, Mr. Esposito said. He likened the situation to the UK crisis when then-Prime Minister Liz Truss’s unfunded tax cuts touched off a selloff in long-term bonds and forced her to resign. Esposito said he was not suggesting that the US was heading toward a “UK bond moment” but emphasized the need to remain laser-focused on managing the nation’s debt stock. He also spoke about the firm’s growing interest in digital assets, noting that Citadel Securities is expanding into cryptocurrency trading and has seen strong enthusiasm from institutional clients. Esposito said that crypto had reached the point of no return, and once clear regulations are in place, it is expected to become a major asset class.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap new cryptocurrency priced under $0.05, is gaining traction as a serious contender among the best cryptos to buy now. The project is selling at $0.03 and is gaining interest rapidly. Already, more than $9.9 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 11,700 people participating so far, who will witness the tokens appreciate to $0.035 as phase six begins. While ADA remains a staple in long-term portfolios due to its smart contract infrastructure and consistent development, some analysts argue that MUTM’s early positioning and projected tokenomics give it a realistic shot at hitting $2 before ADA reclaims that level. For those wondering what crypto to invest in, this new altcoin may be the breakout pick of the year. Cardano currently hovers around the $0.70 region. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Steam as a Rising DeFi Player Mutuum Finance is attracting even greater investor interest with its growing decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. Leveraging cutting-edge DeFi technology and crypto lending features, the platform has already raised over $9.9 million and built a community of 11,700 holders. Currently, MUTM tokens trade at $0.03, with the following presale round having the price rise to $0.035. The early investors will achieve returns of up to 100%, with the token debuting at a price of $0.06. Increasing Credibility with Certik Audit Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) groundbreaking lending infrastructure is reshaping decentralized markets while cementing its reputation in the DeFi space. A huge milestone was achieved with the successful conduct of a smart contract audit by Certik, a move that drastically boosts investor trust. With this seal of approval, Mutuum Finance is now among the top crypto projects to watch. Leaderboard Feature Boosts Community Engagement To further tap into its users, Mutuum Finance has introduced a leaderboard-based gamification featuring the top 50 token owners in real time. The leaders will receive bonus tokens, creating a fun, competitive way to drive more users up the board and remain there, combining social activity with DeFi strategy. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow As the platform gains traction Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 prize each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Many find the Buy-and-Distribute feature in the Mutuum Finance model one of its most outstanding traits. It works by purchasing tokens on the open market and giving them to people who take part in staking. Because the tokens support an active community, this strategy calls for investors who are in it for the long term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a standout in the DeFi space, backed by over $9.9 million raised and a growing community of 11,700 investors. Priced attractively under $0.05 during its presale, MUTM offers early participants the potential to see their investment double as prices move to $0.06 at launch. Supported by a Certik audit and innovative tokenomics like the Buy-and-Distribute feature Mutuum Finance combines security community incentives and cutting-edge technology to position itself for substantial growth. Investors looking for promising altcoins to buy now should explore MUTM before the next phase ignites its price surge.

According to market insiders, these new contracts track the price of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which has gathered over $72 billion in assets.

This setup lets local traders tap into Bitcoin’s price swings without touching foreign crypto platforms. Quarterly Contracts Linked To IBIT These Bitcoin futures will come out every three months, with the first batch due to expire in September 2025. Based on reports, only qualified investors will be allowed to trade on the MOEX. That means big banks, funds, and other approved financial groups can take part. Ordinary investors won’t get in on these deals. The Bank of Russia gave the green light in May 2025 for such products, but it still warns most firms to steer clear of direct crypto deals. The idea seems to be to let big players handle the risk in a controlled way. Local Settlements Keep Risk In Rubles Moscow Exchange decided to price the contracts in US dollars. However, when it’s time to settle, everything happens in rubles. This approach protects Russia from sudden swings in foreign markets. A trader can lock in a deal based on Bitcoin’s value in dollars, yet get paid in their home currency. It’s a setup that keeps money inside Russia even as it ties to a global crypto product. Some analysts see this as a smart middle ground. It lets Russia join the international cryptocurrency scene but without depending on overseas platforms. 🚀 Moscow Stock Exchange Launches #Bitcoin Futures Contracts will only be available to qualified investors, with the futures tied to the value of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, quoted in US dollars, and settled in Russian rubles.

It approved crypto-linked derivatives for qualified investors, but it hasn’t opened the door for everyone. Most banks and investment firms are told not to put their clients into direct Bitcoin trades. Instead, they can offer tools like these futures if they qualify. This reflects a watchful stance on digital assets. Authorities acknowledge the lure of big profits, but they also want to avoid big losses. By keeping access limited, they hope to keep any trouble contained.

The price of XRP is once again following the lead of Bitcoin, a pattern that has been seen time and again in the crypto market. As Bitcoin experiences a pullback, most altcoins, including XRP, tend to react in a similar way. And right now, things aren’t looking too bright for XRP on the daily chart. According to a recent technical analysis, XRP appears to be forming a bearish head and shoulders pattern — a classic price chart formation that often signals a possible drop ahead. The pattern consists of a left shoulder, a head, and a right shoulder, with a key support level known as the “neckline.” In XRP’s case, this neckline lies between $2.10 and $2.15. The price has started breaking below this zone, although a final confirmation is still needed. What’s Next For XRP Price? An analyst suggests that XRP is in the fifth and final stage of its upward movement. So far, the price has made four upward moves, with a few small dips along the way. Now, it seems to be climbing higher, believed to be in the fifth wave. According to this pattern, once the fifth wave wraps up, the market typically sees a significant price drop or correction. If the trend holds, XRP might soon reach new all-time highs. However, traders should tread carefully, as a major correction often follows when prices hit these new peaks. On a shorter time frame, XRP recently completed a small five-wave upward move, starting from its low in April. Since then, the market has been pulling back, creating what analysts refer to as a three-wave correction. This pullback isn’t finished yet. The expert predicts that XRP might dip a bit more before it resumes its upward trend. The correction zone is currently between $1.27 and $1.79. Ideally, the price could drop one last time to around $1.26 to $1.23 before kicking off a fresh rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 01:37:23

The company failed to persuade the court to discontinue key parts of a federal judge’s order requiring the iPhone maker to immediately open its lucrative App Store to more competition. This court decision stems from the ongoing antitrust litigation initiated by Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, challenging the phone company’s control over in-app payment systems. A three-judge appeals panel denied the phone maker’s appeal to stop an April 30 order prohibiting the company from levying a fee on in-app iPhone transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system. This decision was issued in a two-page decision issued late Thursday. The setback risks diverting billions of dollars in revenue from the tech firm while it overturns the order to rein in its commissions from e-commerce within apps on the iPhone. Apple vows to continue to battle Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers’ ruling Apple had sought to pause the app store order after it was handed down by the US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers. In a stinging rebuke, the judge found the Cupertino, California, company in civil contempt of court and recommended an independent investigation to determine whether a high-ranking executive lied while testifying at the tech giant’s trial in her Oakland, California, courtroom. This represented another turn of the screw in a legal fight that video game developer Epic Games started nearly five years ago when it began accusing Apple of turning the iPhone’s app store into a price-gouging monopoly. The antitrust case focused largely on the 15% to 30% commissions the tech firm charges on some transactions within iPhone apps. The system also prevents app makers from informing users about alternative payment options outside Apple’s own in-app payment system. The phone company vowed to continue to battle that decision in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, in the meantime, Gonzalez-Rogers’s order restraining Apple’s commissions on some in-app commerce will stand while possibly affecting its profits. Tim Sweeney refers to Apple’s fee on in-app iPhone transactions as “the long national nightmare” Following the appeals court rejection of Apple’s request, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney shared an X post claiming that the long national nightmare of the tech firm’s tax is over. He hoped next week’s WWDC would be the Apple-led celebration of freedom developers and users have long deserved. In response, the tech firm expressed disappointment with the court’s denying its request to stay. The company then promised to continue its appeal despite failing this time. The firm claimed it intends to ensure the app store stays an amazing opportunity for developers and a safe and trusted place for our users. It is worth noting that while Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with the tech firm, in her initial 2021 ruling in the same case, she ordered the company to allow apps to link to alternative payment systems. Various parties appealed the decision, including to the Supreme Court in 2024. But they ultimately did not overturn it. In response, the phone maker imposed a 12% to 27% commission, prompting Epic to beg Gonzalez-Rogers to hold Apple in contempt of her order. After a fresh round of hearings that unfolded over nine months from last year until this year, Gonzalez-Rogers dropped a legal hammer on Apple.

The company said that Kling brought in more than 100 million yuan ($14 million) in revenue every month in April and May. Kling is now one of the world’s highest-grossing AI video generation tools, demonstrating Kuaishou’s deep competitive advantages in generative AI . Kling AI operates by selling digital tokens, which it calls “inspiration credits.” Users buy credits and use them to make videos. This is in part due to the nature of the platform, which allows users to spend more credits to create higher-fidelity detailed videos or to produce more videos at lower fidelity with fewer credits. Today, Kuaishou sells 66 inspiration credits for one dollar. Top-quality videos cost around 100 credits apiece, while simpler videos are just 20 credits. This credit system makes service accessible and scalable to individual creators and businesses. Since its introduction a little more than a year ago, Kling has slowly attracted a devoted following of users, using a simple method of creating fast, fun video content. Solid profits catch investors off guard Kuaishou benefited from the strong showing of its social e-commerce and live commerce service Kling AI in surpassing market expectations when it reported its March-quarter financial results last week. The company’s fast-growing revenue from AI proved to be the standout performer, helping to send the stock up. Kuaishou’s shares surged after the announcement, indicating investor confidence in the company’s AI strategy. Kuaishou is one of several major Chinese internet companies turning to artificial intelligence as a new growth driver. Many companies are betting big on AI, believing that building new amenities driven by the technology will amass users in ways that generate revenue beyond their traditional platforms. Competition grows stronger in the AI video generation market The field of AI video generation is an increasingly crowded space. Meanwhile, large Chinese players like Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings have introduced or revamped their own AI video and creative tools this year. New startups are also entering the niche: AI startup Manus, for example, fairly recently demoed a product that appears to create videos on its own just from a written script. Internationally, companies like OpenAI have built tools for creating films, such as Sora, which helps automate video production. Runway AI, focusing on video production and editing, reached a $3 billion valuation in April. This proves a fast-rising, high-investing interest in AI on the video side worldwide. Kling is known for its token-based business model and steadily growing revenue. Its success also hints that there may be significant demand for AI-based tools that generate videos rapidly and inexpensively. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Besides, there was a break below a key rising channel with support at $2,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even dipped below the $2,500 support level. A low was formed at $2,394 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The next key resistance is near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,540 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,680 swing high to the $2,394 low. A clear move above the $2,540 resistance might send the price toward the $2,600 resistance. An upside break above the $2,600 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions.

Here’s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency. Solana Coin Days Destroyed Has Witnessed A Huge Spike In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD) indicator for Solana. A ‘coin day’ is a quantity that one token of the asset accumulates after having stayed dormant (that is, not being involved in any transaction activity) for one day. When a token carrying some number of coin days is moved, its coin days counter resets back to zero, and the coin days that it was carrying are said to be ‘destroyed.’ The CDD measures the total number of coin days being reset in this manner across the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Key Investors Double Down, Buy Another 79,000 BTC When the value of this indicator registers a spike, it means dormant coins are potentially on the move. Generally, this kind of trend is a sign of transaction activity from the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTHs are resolute entities who tend to hold for long periods, so they naturally hold a large number of coin days. As such, transfers from them usually result in the destruction of a significant number of coin days. Now, here is the chart for the Solana CDD shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value during the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana CDD has observed a large spike recently, suggesting the LTHs have made some transactions. In total, this spike involved the destruction of a massive 3.55 billion coin days. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator has seen only two spikes of a greater scale in 2025 so far. February 26th recorded a CDD value of 5.53 billion, while March 3rd saw a value of 4.64 billion. The LTHs usually only break their silence when they want to participate in selling, so movements from them can sometimes spell trouble for the cryptocurrency’s price. Large spikes like these can especially be worth taking note of, as they can point toward a possible shift in holder conviction . The aforementioned two larger spikes occurred one after the other, with a third, slightly smaller-scale spike following later in March. Therefore, it’s possible that more than a couple of diamond hands lost their belief during that period. Related Reading: Bitcoin ATH Fails To Hype Retail—Demand Is Actually Down It now remains to be seen whether the latest Solana CDD spike would also be followed up by another, or if this was just a one-off event. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $153.9, down more than 10% in the last week.

The influx of capital will be used to continue Momentum’s astronomical growth within the Sui DeFi ecosystem. This funding round follows a previous round of $10 million led by Varys Capital in March 2025. OKX Ventures recognizes Momentum’s position as a leading DEX on the Sui blockchain, with its innovative approach to liquidity management and ecosystem development. The investment aligns with OKX Ventures’ strategy of supporting promising infrastructure projects that contribute to blockchain ecosystem growth. Momentum has demonstrated strong technical execution and adoption metrics since its launch, positioning it as an important contributor to the expanding Sui Network ecosystem. “We are delighted to partner with and invest in Momentum, whose model will effectively enhance trading efficiency, boost liquidity depth and increase user rewards. This innovative approach has the potential to make a significant impact in the DeFi space, especially for the Sui ecosystem,” said Cass Cai, Head of KuCoin Ventures. Momentum has established itself as one of the fastest-growing liquidity engines on Sui, powered by its innovative ve(3,3) DEX model. It has achieved $3 billion in swap volume, $69 million in TVL, and has surpassed 420,000 users within just two months. In addition to the respected backers joining Momentum’s latest funding round, additional funding came from prominent industry leaders, including Coin Bureau, Monke Ventures, MultiChain Advisors (MCA), Crypto Lark (@TheCryptoLark) @theonlynom (Core Contributor at Bonk), and others. The latest funding builds on early strategic support from Circle Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and Sui Foundation, and positions Momentum as a leading force in the Sui ecosystem and one of the most highly anticipated projects in DeFi. Led by co-founder ChefWEN (@ChefMMT_X), the architect of MSafe and senior engineer of Meta’s Libra project, Momentum has established its security track record since its launch in May 2022. This is achieved through audited smart contracts, a robust review process, real-time monitoring and 24/7 support, ensuring minimal fund risk while earning and building trust with both retail and institutional investors. “Sui’s architecture sets a new standard for DeFi infrastructure – enabling near-instant transaction finality, scalable performance under heavy load. It takes a strong chain to make a DEX that delivers, and because of this, I’m confident in Momentum’s ability to build a DEX that delivers a seamless, CEX-like experience entirely on-chain,” said ChefWEN. Momentum’s groundbreaking ve(3,3) DEX incentivizes liquidity through vote-escrowed tokenomics, redistributing 100% of protocol revenue to stakers. This flywheel, token locking, voting and deeper liquidity pools set Momentum apart from the competition. About Momentum Momentum is a Move-native DEX built on Sui, offering trading, vesting, and treasury management for both retail and institutional participants. Backed by Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, OKX Ventures, Vary’s Capital, Selini Capital, Amber Group, Protagonist and Sui Foundation, it’s co-founded by ChefWEN, an early architect of Meta’s Libra project. Mirroring the success of Aerodrome which boasts 73% market share of Base on-chain volume, the groundbreaking ve(3,3) model is set to provide deeper liquidity with better rates for traders and higher earnings for liquidity providers.

One unexpected factor contributing to today’s decline is a public feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. The two high-profile figures exchanged some pretty sharp remarks online, creating a surprising amount of tension. Musk took aim at Trump’s past controversies and even called for his impeachment, while Trump responded with strong comments about the economy. While this drama might seem like just another day in the headlines, it has definitely made investors nervous and sent ripples through both traditional and crypto markets. Stock markets opened carefully today, which made traders bet that cryptocurrency prices will keep falling. More traders are opening short positions, which is putting extra pressure on the market and causing prices to drop further. Bitcoin Drops, Altcoins Follow Currently, the global cryptocurrency market cap is sitting at $3.18 trillion, reflecting a 3.42% drop in the last 24 hours. The Fear & Greed Index is at 46, showing a neutral sentiment in the market, while the Altcoin Season Index is low at 23 out of 100. Bitcoin is trading at $101,895 after a 2.77% decrease in the last 24 hours. Ethereum has fallen to $2,424, down nearly 7%, while Solana is priced at $145.39 after a drop of over 5%. XRP has slipped to $2.10, and Dogecoin has taken one of the hardest hits, plummeting nearly 9% to $0.1720. Despite this downturn, analysts believe that this sharp reaction might be short-lived. The tensions between Musk and Trump could ease up soon, which might help stabilize prices. Bitcoin’s crucial support zone is between $100,700 and $98,000. If the market can hold above this range, it may enter a phase of sideways trading before trying to bounce back.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 02:07:48

He also noted that his general bias on AI is that it’s dangerous, and there will be positive and negative consequences regardless of which country comes out on top. Karp has always championed U.S. AI dominance, suggesting in January that the country needs to put more effort into developing more advanced AI models. He argued that the rise of competing artificial intelligence models, such as China’s DeepSeek, is a sign that the U.S. needs to work quickly to develop advanced AI. The entrepreneur also revealed Palantir’s commitment to equipping and enhancing U.S. defense interests in a recent letter to shareholders. Palantir aims to improve AI in the U.S. Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar says the US is in a winner-take-all AI arms race and war with China and DeepSeek has made it clear that ""the time to mobilize has come"" pic.twitter.com/tHLFVFLXpI — Tsarathustra (@tsarnick) February 3, 2025 The tech CEO also mentioned Thursday that the U.S. currently has a leg up in the AI race, and Palantir is leading the way in making companies more secure and efficient with its tools. He said that the company’s growth in recent years has stemmed from ballooning demand for AI solutions, where he agreed Palantir is leading the charge and is poised to transform the way American companies run. “There is no economy in the world with this kind of corporate leadership which is willing to pivot, which understands technologies, which is willing to look at new things, but also has deep domain expertise. Our allies in the West, in Europe, are going to have to learn from us.” -Alex Karp, Palantir CEO. The company’s shares outperformed in 2024 and have continued climbing in 20225 as investors bet on their software and work with key government contractors and agencies. Shares of the Denver-based data analytics and AI software firm are up 74% this year, but investors have to shell out on a higher earning multiple than its tech peers. The tech billionaire said Thursday in response that those who like the firm’s price can exit. He also maintained that Palantir is not surveilling Americans in response to recent allegations that the company is helping the Trump administration gather data on Americans. The President signed an order in March that directed federal agencies to remove unnecessary barriers to data consolidation. The New York Times also reported last week that the tech company expanded the reach of its artificial intelligence product within the U.S. government, which could track Americans’ information, from medical to financial. Warren Davidson, Senator for Ohio, said she hopes to turn Palantir’s power off fundamentally. She argued that the power of combining all information on an individual into one database creates a digital ID and that tech can be abused.

Three events last month also confirmed that the rivalry between the U.S. and China over artificial intelligence has entered a new and more dangerous phase. The U.S. began with a May 8 Senate hearing where lawmakers aired concerns that the country’s lead over China was eroding fast. A sweeping U.S. ban on Huawei’s Ascend AI chips followed. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) warned that using the Chinese firm’s AI chips could trigger criminal penalties under U.S. export control laws. The agency also clarified that Huawei’s Ascend processors, specifically the 910B, 910C, and 910D, are subject to strict export controls because they are believed to be designed or manufactured using U.S.-origin technology. Last month’s last event happened when Trump visited the Middle East to sign expansive AI chip deals with key regional allies. The agreement included building the largest AI campus in Abu Dhabi, giving the UAE access to U.S. advanced AI chips.

This decision not only puts California on the same path as crypto-forward states like Colorado and Utah but also positions it as a national leader in digital asset adoption. The bill outlines a multi-year pilot starting in 2026, overseen by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. This government-led shift could open the door for massive blockchain integrations in public infrastructure.Among these projects, Qubetics ($TICS) is commanding growing attention as a project built not only to meet current blockchain challenges but also to outperform legacy solutions. While competitors still battle limitations in cost, complexity, and cross-border accessibility, Qubetics is advancing with real-world applications and decentralized architecture. Its utility is particularly impactful in the domain of borderless transactions, offering a seamless experience for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. For those researching the best cryptos to buy today, Qubetics is quickly becoming a standout entry point backed by confirmed metrics and active adoption. This legislative momentum coincides with a rising wave of optimism across crypto markets. Key tokens such as XRP and NEAR Protocol have already started reacting to broader trends, with XRP climbing for five straight sessions and NEAR signaling a short-term recovery. As regulatory barriers loosen and institutional sentiment improves, these developments have created fertile ground for renewed interest in scalable and utility-driven crypto projects. Qubetics: Redefining Global Utility Through Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics introduces a transformative infrastructure built to eliminate friction in global payments. Its native platform supports frictionless cross-border transactions, bypassing slow intermediaries and excessive fees. For international consultants, merchants, freelancers, and global teams, this functionality brings unprecedented speed and reliability to everyday financial interactions. Built with interoperability and compliance in mind, the protocol ensures transparent settlement while protecting data integrity and wallet security. Qubetics streamlines the complexity often associated with multi-jurisdictional crypto payments. Users can complete international transfers in seconds, access multiple currencies, and settle in native or fiat tokens—without relying on centralized banking rails. This solution stands in stark contrast to many legacy platforms still tied to outdated infrastructure and compliance bottlenecks. Qubetics Crypto Presale Accelerates Toward Finality Qubetics has officially entered Stage 37—the final chapter of its public token sale. With the crypto presale price set at $0.3370 and the listing price locked at $0.40, current participants are aligned for an instant 20% value increase upon market launch. Over $17.7 million has been secured so far, and more than 515 million $TICS tokens have been distributed. The token holder base has now surpassed 27,500—a sign of widespread adoption and credibility even before centralized exchange listing. The strategic tokenomics revamp earlier this quarter cut the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion. Public allocation was increased to 38.55%, enhancing decentralization and giving the community meaningful control in governance. Unlike speculative ventures that inflate supply for short-term gain, Qubetics has introduced structural scarcity from the outset. For those evaluating short-term strategies, the numbers speak for themselves. A $5,000 contribution at the current presale rate yields 14,810 $TICS tokens. At listing, this stack is immediately valued at $5,925. These metrics are based on confirmed sale terms—not hypothetical forecasts—making Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy today for those seeking defined entry points with transparent upside potential. As supply diminishes and demand intensifies, the chance to lock in this final-stage presale position is closing fast. Qubetics is currently categorized among the best cryptos to buy today by analysts tracking presale momentum, decentralized architecture, and infrastructure utility. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and ETF Momentum Drive Market Attention XRP is undergoing a strategic resurgence. Following its recent 10% rebound from May’s lows, XRP has now posted five consecutive bullish sessions, trading at approximately $2.26. The token is consolidating within a key wedge formation between $2.19 and $2.26, with immediate resistance identified at $2.50. Analysts suggest that a break above this threshold could unlock higher levels of bullish continuation. What’s fueling this renewed interest? Primarily, it’s regulatory clarity. The conclusion of Ripple’s legal conflict with the SEC reaffirmed XRP’s non-security status in the U.S., providing a long-awaited green light for institutional and retail engagement. Added to this is growing speculation around the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF, with a ruling expected by June 17. If greenlit, the ETF could open billions in inflows, reinforcing XRP’s position among the best cryptos to buy today. Market sentiment has also turned increasingly positive. On-chain data shows significant whale accumulation between $2.20 and $2.40, and funding rates in perpetual futures remain positive. Combined with strategic partnerships and upcoming tokenization initiatives, XRP continues to build a foundation of support beneath its price action. XRP has successfully overcome major regulatory hurdles and is positioned for broader institutional adoption. These developments, supported by consistent chart structure and upcoming catalysts, confirm its status as one of the best cryptos to buy today. NEAR Protocol: Momentum Builds as Key Indicators Flip Bullish NEAR Protocol is slowly climbing back after finding a local bottom at $2.25. It currently trades near $2.53, above the 9-period EMA ($2.48), which is often an early signal of short-term recovery. Resistance remains at the 50-day SMA around $2.63, while stronger ceilings sit at $2.73. Although the broader trend faces pressure, technical indicators such as a rising RSI (now at 53) and a bullish MACD crossover suggest growing buying strength. The protocol’s momentum follows a clear setup. A successful break above $2.63 could usher in new bullish sentiment, potentially positioning NEAR for another run toward previous highs. Support levels are currently anchored at $2.44 and $2.25, forming a tight trading band that allows for tactical accumulation. NEAR continues to appeal due to its sharded architecture and developer-centric platform. It enables scalable dApps with low latency and has cultivated a robust ecosystem for smart contract deployment. These strengths, combined with current price structure, make NEAR Protocol one of the best cryptos to buy today, especially for those seeking undervalued Layer 1 opportunities. NEAR Protocol displays a strong technical setup, underpinned by resilient architecture and a loyal builder base. These elements make it a compelling choice for community members seeking the best cryptos to buy today before larger momentum returns. Final Thoughts Legislative action from California has sent a strong signal: digital assets are not just being tolerated—they’re being integrated. This policy tailwind is driving renewed enthusiasm toward technically sound, utility-focused crypto projects with real-world application. Qubetics exemplifies this new standard. From its high-utility cross-border infrastructure to its nearly complete presale phase, the $TICS token offers a compelling mix of short-term upside and long-term sustainability. Meanwhile, XRP’s regulatory clarity and potential ETF catalyst place it on a decisive path, and NEAR Protocol’s resilient indicators suggest a building recovery. For serious participants, the best cryptos to buy today are those that offer transparent metrics, scalable architecture, and time-sensitive access. Qubetics, XRP, and NEAR meet that criteria—and the window to engage at current levels is narrowing quickly.

Qubetics, XRP, and NEAR Protocol are among the most promising due to their momentum, structural strengths, and alignment with broader market catalysts. Why is Qubetics gaining traction in today’s crypto market? Qubetics is advancing in real-world utility with cross-border transaction support and has reached the final stage of its crypto presale with strong participation. Is XRP a good crypto to buy today based on recent trends? Yes. XRP benefits from legal clarity, ETF speculation, and strong accumulation trends, making it one of the top cryptos to monitor right now. What makes NEAR Protocol one of the best cryptos to buy today? NEAR Protocol has shown a bullish crossover in MACD, improved RSI, and technical setups that support near-term recovery potential. How much time is left in the Qubetics presale? Qubetics is currently in Stage 37—the final phase—with limited supply remaining. Early buyers still have a short window to participate before listing.

The price is now consolidating and might aim for a recovery wave above the $2.120 resistance. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.20 zone. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.192 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.120 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips To Support XRP price failed to gain pace for a move above the $2.220 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.2150 and $0.2120 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.192 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Finally, the price tested the $2.050 zone. It is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.281 swing high to the $2.056 low. The price is now trading below $2.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level. The next resistance is $2.1750. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.281 swing high to the $2.056 low. A clear move above the $2.1750 resistance might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance or even $2.2420 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.250. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.15 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.050 level. The next major support is near the $2.020 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.020 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.00 support. The next major support sits near the $1.920 zone.

Now D.C. is moving to take ownership of the funds via the suit. Fake IT workers allegedly sending crypto to North Korea “For years, North Korea has exploited global remote IT contracting and cryptocurrency ecosystems to evade U.S. sanctions and bankroll its weapons programs,” Sue J. Bai, head of the DOJ’s National Security Division, is quoted as saying in the government press release.According to the DOJ, an FBI investigation is said to have revealed a “massive campaign” involving remote IT workers infiltrating U.S. businesses with fraudulent identities, or identities stolen from American citizens. “These tactics hid the North Koreans’ true location and identities, causing unwitting employers to hire them and pay them a salary, often in stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT,” the release notes.To obfuscate the money and send funds back to North Korea, workers allegedly used the following tactics: Fake accounts Micro-transactions Chain-hopping/Token-swapping Hiding value in NFTs (non-fungible tokens) Using U.S.-based accounts to “legitimize” activity Crypto mixing US government use of crypto, fiat also criticized U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro said of the forfeiture action: “Crime may pay in other countries but that’s not how it works here,” noting that “We will halt your progress, strike back, and take hold of any proceeds you obtained illegally.”Some might take issue with Pirro about that. And with Sue J. Bai about the bankrolling of weapons programs. In recent years, hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency have been funneled to “socially acceptable” U.S.-backed military initiatives in Ukraine, including for “lethal equipment.” Elliptic data on Ukraine government’s cryptocurrency expenditures from 2022. Source: Elliptic . Billions in fiat currency have been sent to the Israeli military, as Gazans are killed and ousted from their homes, while the U.S. president backing this bankroll has a controversial, influence-cashgrab memecoin released while in office. Anyway one slices it, it is a messy situation, where “licit” uses of crypto seem to depend more on the power and geopolitical standing of the user, than they do ethics. None of this justifying any ostensible North Korean terror.Regardless, the DOJ release summarizes: “Today’s forfeiture action follows the Department’s announcement of two federal indictments charging Sim for allegedly conspiring (1) with North Korean IT workers to generate revenue through illegal employment at companies in the United States and abroad; and (2) with over-the-counter cryptocurrency traders to use stolen funds to buy goods for North Korea.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|North Korea|USA|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|SPONSORED|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-06 02:30:23

While we often see Bitcoin ATMs popping up in private businesses or dedicated crypto hubs, a national postal service entering the game is certainly big news. This is exactly what’s happening in Romania, marking a significant step for digital finance availability across the country. The launch of a Romania Bitcoin ATM within the traditional postal network signals a fascinating convergence of old and new. The Revolutionary Arrival of the Romania Bitcoin ATM Romania’s national postal service, known as Poșta Română, has officially installed its very first Bitcoin ATM. This isn’t just a one-off experiment; it’s part of a broader strategy to modernize their services and improve digital access for citizens across Romania. The inaugural machine has been placed in the city of Tulcea, a move that brings cryptocurrency convenience to a specific regional hub before potential expansion. This initiative highlights Poșta Română’s commitment to evolving with the times. For decades, postal services have been integral parts of communities, handling everything from mail delivery to financial services like money orders and bill payments. By integrating a Bitcoin ATM, they are positioning themselves as relevant players in the burgeoning digital economy, making it easier for Romanians to buy and sell Bitcoin using cash. Poșta Română Bitcoin: A Strategic Modernization Move Why would a national postal service get involved with Bitcoin? The decision by Poșta Română to launch a Poșta Română Bitcoin service through ATMs is primarily driven by the need for modernization and expanding digital inclusion. In many countries, postal networks have extensive reach, often serving remote areas or populations less familiar with online banking or digital wallets. Leveraging this existing infrastructure provides a unique pathway to introduce cryptocurrency access to a wider demographic. This move can be seen as a strategic response to changing consumer habits and technological advancements. By offering cryptocurrency services, Poșta Română aims to: Enhance Service Portfolio: Add a modern, in-demand financial service. Increase Foot Traffic: Attract new customers interested in crypto. Promote Digital Literacy: Help citizens become more comfortable with digital assets. Support Financial Inclusion: Provide access points for those who may not have easy access to online crypto exchanges. The integration of Bitcoin ATMs into postal branches leverages trust and familiarity associated with a long-standing public institution, potentially lowering the barrier to entry for individuals curious about cryptocurrency but hesitant to use online platforms. The Crucial Partnership with Bitcoin Romania This significant step for Poșta Română is made possible through a partnership with Bitcoin Romania (BTR). Bitcoin Romania is a well-established cryptocurrency exchange and ATM operator within the country. They bring the necessary technical expertise, infrastructure, and regulatory understanding required to operate Bitcoin ATMs effectively and compliantly. Partnerships like this are essential for traditional institutions venturing into the crypto space. Bitcoin Romania’s role likely includes: Providing and maintaining the ATM hardware. Handling the technical backend for transactions. Ensuring compliance with Romanian financial regulations regarding cryptocurrency. Managing the liquidity for the ATM (ensuring there’s enough cash and crypto available). This collaboration allows Poșta Română to quickly deploy crypto services without building the entire technical stack from scratch, while Bitcoin Romania expands its network and reaches new customer segments through the postal service’s extensive presence. Focus on the Tulcea Bitcoin ATM and Future Expansion The initial focus is on the Tulcea Bitcoin ATM . Tulcea, located in southeastern Romania, serves as an important administrative and economic center, particularly for the Danube Delta region. Launching the first ATM here could be a strategic choice to test the service’s viability and public reception in a specific regional market before scaling up. While the exact timeline and specific locations for future expansion haven’t been detailed publicly, the stated intention is to roll out more Bitcoin ATMs in other cities across Romania. This phased approach allows Poșta Română and Bitcoin Romania to learn from the Tulcea launch, optimize operations, and address any challenges that arise before a wider deployment. The potential for a nationwide network of Bitcoin ATMs within postal branches could dramatically change the landscape for cryptocurrency access in Romania. What This Means for Crypto Adoption Romania The launch of a national postal service-backed Bitcoin ATM is a strong indicator of growing Crypto Adoption Romania . It signals that cryptocurrency is moving from being a niche interest to gaining recognition and integration within mainstream public services. This development can have several positive impacts: Increased Awareness: The presence of ATMs in familiar locations like post offices raises public awareness about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Improved Accessibility: Provides a straightforward, often cash-based, method for buying/selling Bitcoin, complementing online options. Potential for Trust Building: Association with a national institution may lend an air of legitimacy and security for newcomers. Setting a Precedent: Could encourage other traditional Romanian institutions to explore crypto-related services. While Romania already has a developing crypto ecosystem, this move by a state-owned entity represents a significant endorsement and infrastructure boost that could accelerate wider adoption. Navigating Access: Benefits and Potential Challenges The introduction of Bitcoin ATMs through Poșta Română offers clear benefits but also presents potential challenges. Benefits: Convenience: Easy access points for buying/selling Bitcoin, often available during standard business hours. Simplicity: ATMs typically offer a user-friendly interface compared to complex online exchanges. Cash Transactions: Facilitates entry into crypto for individuals who prefer using cash or have limited access to traditional banking/online payment methods. Physical Presence: Offers a tangible point of contact and potentially in-person assistance, which can be reassuring for first-time users. Potential Challenges: Fees: Bitcoin ATM transactions often come with higher fees compared to online exchanges due to operational costs. Transaction Limits: ATMs may have daily or per-transaction limits. Privacy Concerns: Depending on local regulations, using an ATM might require identity verification (KYC/AML procedures). Technical Issues: ATMs can experience technical malfunctions or require maintenance. Public Education: Ensuring the general public understands how to use the ATMs and the basics of cryptocurrency is crucial. Despite potential hurdles, the overall impact is likely positive for expanding access and awareness. How Can Romanians Use the New Bitcoin ATM? For residents near the Tulcea location, using the new Tulcea Bitcoin ATM is designed to be relatively straightforward. While specific steps can vary slightly by machine operator (in this case, Bitcoin Romania), the general process typically involves: Verification: Depending on the transaction amount and local regulations, you may need to verify your identity using a phone number, ID card, or passport. Selecting Action: Choose whether you want to buy or sell Bitcoin. Providing Wallet Address (for buying): If buying, you’ll need a Bitcoin wallet. You can often scan your wallet’s QR code using the ATM’s scanner. Inserting Cash (for buying): Insert the desired amount of Romanian Lei (RON) into the machine. Confirming Transaction: Review the transaction details (amount, price, fee) and confirm. The Bitcoin will be sent to your wallet. Receiving Cash (for selling): If selling, you’ll typically send Bitcoin from your wallet to the ATM’s address, wait for confirmation, and then the machine will dispense cash. It’s always advisable to check the specific instructions displayed on the ATM screen and be aware of the current exchange rate and fees before completing a transaction. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Digital Inclusion The launch of the first Romania Bitcoin ATM by the national postal service, Poșta Română, in partnership with Bitcoin Romania, is a significant and revolutionary development. Placing a Poșta Română Bitcoin service in a physical, accessible location like a post office in Tulcea makes cryptocurrency less abstract and more attainable for the average citizen. This move is a clear signal of increasing Crypto Adoption Romania and a forward-thinking approach by a traditional institution seeking modernization. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of increased access, awareness, and financial inclusion are substantial. As Poșta Română plans to expand this network, we could see a notable shift in how Romanians interact with and utilize digital currencies, solidifying the country’s position in the evolving global crypto landscape.

This development highlights the growing complexities surrounding branding and intellectual property within the decentralized finance space. What is the TRUMP Wallet Controversy All About? The controversy centers on the alleged development of a crypto wallet application branded as the “$TRUMP Wallet”. While details about the wallet’s specific features or intended purpose remain somewhat scarce in public reports, its name clearly leverages the widely recognized “TRUMP” brand. The developer behind this project is identified as Fight Fight Fight LLC. The situation gained further attention when it was reported that Magic Eden, a prominent NFT marketplace, was planning to collaborate on the launch of this wallet. The core issue appears to be whether this project had the authorization or endorsement of the Trump family or their associated business entities, including World Liberty Financial. World Liberty Financial Steps In: The Cease and Desist According to reports, World Liberty Financial has issued a cease-and-desist letter directly to Fight Fight Fight LLC. This legal instrument is a formal demand to stop a specific action – in this case, the development and presumably the planned launch and marketing of the “$TRUMP Wallet”. Key aspects of the reported cease-and-desist letter likely include: A demand to immediately halt all development, marketing, and promotional activities related to the “$TRUMP Wallet”. An assertion that the use of the “TRUMP” name or related likenesses is unauthorized and infringes upon intellectual property rights held by the Trump family or their entities. A warning of potential legal consequences if the demands are not met. The letter was also reportedly sent to Magic Eden, presumably to inform them of the dispute and warn them against proceeding with any collaboration or launch related to the unauthorized wallet. The Trump Family’s Stance on Trump Crypto Products This isn’t the first time the Trump family has addressed products leveraging their name in the crypto or digital asset space. Both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have previously issued public statements clarifying which products are officially associated with them and which are not. Specifically regarding the “$TRUMP Wallet”, Donald Trump Jr. reportedly stated that it was not an official Trump product. Eric Trump went further, warning of possible legal action against unauthorized uses of the family’s brand. This consistent stance reinforces the message that any product or service using the Trump name in the crypto realm without explicit, official endorsement is likely doing so without permission and potentially facing legal challenges. This makes discerning official Trump crypto initiatives from unofficial ones crucial for users and investors. Implications for DeFi Project Developers and Users The dispute between World Liberty Financial and the developers of the “$TRUMP Wallet” serves as a significant case study for the broader DeFi project landscape. It highlights several critical implications: Intellectual Property Risks: Developers must be extremely cautious when using or referencing prominent names, brands, or likenesses. Assuming that a name is fair game because it’s associated with a public figure, especially one actively involved in related ventures (like WLFI), is a risky proposition. Due Diligence for Platforms: Platforms like Magic Eden also face risks. Collaborating on or listing products without verifying the necessary rights and permissions can expose them to legal challenges from the legitimate brand owners. User Confusion and Risk: Unauthorized projects create confusion for users. They may mistakenly believe an unofficial product is endorsed, potentially leading to financial loss or exposure to scams. Users interested in official ventures should always seek verification from the official sources. This incident underscores the need for clear legal frameworks and robust due diligence processes within the fast-evolving DeFi space. Navigating Crypto Legal Action: Challenges and Lessons Legal disputes in the crypto world, often involving intellectual property or unauthorized use of branding, present unique challenges. The decentralized nature of some projects, the global reach of the internet, and the pseudonymous nature of participants can complicate enforcement. However, this case demonstrates that traditional legal tools like cease-and-desist letters are still being employed to protect established brands. For developers, the lesson is clear: obtain proper licenses or permissions before using copyrighted or trademarked material. For users, the actionable insight is to verify the legitimacy and official endorsement of any product, especially those leveraging well-known names or brands, before investing time or money. Examples of similar challenges exist across various industries where new technologies intersect with established branding and IP law. The outcome of this specific Crypto legal action will likely provide further clarity on how such disputes are handled within the digital asset ecosystem. In summary, World Liberty Financial’s reported cease-and-desist against the $TRUMP Wallet developer underscores the critical importance of intellectual property rights in the crypto space. As the Trump family’s official DeFi project asserts its position, this legal challenge serves as a stark reminder for developers and users alike to prioritize legitimacy and verification in the complex world of branded digital assets.

He contends that Ripple has found “the only route left by the Judge” by using an institutional structure that moves XRP through regulated intermediaries instead of selling it directly to investors. “It’s not just clever,” he wrote. “It’s compliant by design.” The setup in question was revealed in a recent Form 6-K filing by Webus, which outlined the creation of an XRP Treasury to be managed by Samara Alpha, an SEC-registered investment adviser. The program delegates full control of up to $300 million in XRP to Samara under a phased, regulated structure. While the filing stops short of stating where the XRP will come from, Darkhorse argues the intent is clear: Ripple can legally sell XRP to an SEC-facing intermediary like Samara, which then allocates it to a corporate client like Webus — all without violating the standing injunction. Related Reading: The Worst Case For XRP This Cycle? Just A Giga Rally To $19, Says Analyst “Ripple is enjoined from direct institutional sales without SEC clearance,” Darkhorse explained. “The workaround? Sell to regulated intermediaries (like Samara on behalf of Webus) with treasury agreements that are SEC-transparent and non-retail facing. It’s structured — not casual.” Is Ripple Bypassing The XRP Injunction? Veteran XRP commentator Jay Nisbett pushed back. “I just don’t see any of this as clever or bypassing anything — it’s just adoption,” he replied. Nisbett asserted that Ripple and Webus are not partners, that Webus is simply acquiring XRP like any other participant on the secondary market, and that the asset itself “has been ruled to be not a security in this context.” He added that holding XRP on a balance sheet isn’t the same as triggering a securities transaction. Darkhorse issued a sharp rebuttal. “You’re missing the mechanism,” he told Nisbett, laying out his argument in four parts. First, he emphasized that Webus did not just announce an intent to buy on the open market. “Webus filed via Form 6-K to publicly document a $300M XRP Treasury but not to simply buy on open markets. They delegated management to ‘Samara Alpha,’ an SEC-registered investment adviser, under a phased, regulated structure.” Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $21 This Bull Cycle With 1.618 Fib Level As Next Target Second, he argued that the core issue is Ripple’s inability to sell directly to institutions, which is where the intermediary comes in. “This structure is about creating compliant distance,” he wrote. “It’s not Ripple handing XRP to an investor — it’s routing via an SEC-registered manager who takes custody and executes under regulatory supervision.” Third, Darkhorse disputed Nisbett’s assertion that there’s no relationship between Ripple and Webus. “Check RippleNet corridors and prior Asia-Pacific mobility pilot cases,” he wrote. “Their ties to Ripple’s network and XRPL liquidity routes go back years. Just because it wasn’t front-page news doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.” Finally, he challenged the notion that Webus’s XRP holdings are merely passive. “ ‘Just holding on balance sheet’ is not automatic exemption,” he argued. “This is treasury deployment, not idle custody. The fact that Webus structured this through a delegated SEC-facing manager says they do consider XRP institutional risk a legal factor.” He concluded bluntly: “This isn’t Ripple dumping tokens on exchanges. It’s creating institutional conduits that comply while navigating around the injunction bottleneck.” Despite the detailed structure and SEC-facing components, Nisbett remained unmoved. “No I get what you’re saying… I just disagree in that mechanism being an unexpected event,” he wrote. “It’s just a natural maturation of the market and the market reacting to legislation hurdles as the market always has and will.” With Ripple still bound by Judge Torres’s 2024 permanent injunction — which prohibits direct institutional XRP sales unless registered — the debate hinges on whether the Webus structure constitutes indirect circumvention or lawful evolution. The SEC has yet to comment, and the court recently denied the parties’ request to vacate the injunction, calling it “procedurally improper.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.1989.

Led by prominent figures like Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy, this trend signaled a new era of institutional interest and confidence in digital assets. However, as these companies acquired Bitcoin, often using leverage or issuing debt, a wave of concern emerged: were these corporate Bitcoin buyers taking on excessive Corporate Debt that could lead to instability or forced selling? According to Alex Thorne, head of research at Galaxy Digital, these concerns about debt levels among companies holding Corporate Bitcoin might be largely overblown. His perspective offers a crucial counterpoint to the prevailing anxiety, suggesting that a deeper look at the financials reveals a more stable picture than many assume. Are Corporate Bitcoin Buyers Drowning in Debt? Analyzing the Concerns When companies like MicroStrategy or others began significant Bitcoin Treasury strategies, the market reaction was mixed. While many celebrated the institutional validation, others pointed to the methods used for financing these purchases, particularly the issuance of debt. The primary fears revolved around: Liquidity Risk: If Bitcoin prices dropped significantly, could these companies meet their debt obligations or margin calls? Forced Selling: A severe market downturn might force companies to sell their Bitcoin holdings at a loss to service debt, creating downward pressure on the market. Balance Sheet Health: High debt levels could weaken the company’s overall financial position, impacting its core business and stock value. Interest Rate Risk: Rising interest rates could make servicing existing variable-rate debt more expensive and future refinancing more difficult. These are valid concerns in isolation, but Thorne’s analysis suggests they may not tell the whole story when applied to the specific companies involved in Corporate Bitcoin adoption. Understanding the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Debt Maturity Thorne highlights a key factor often overlooked in the debt panic: the maturity profile of the debt. He stated that if you look at the debt levels of companies buying Bitcoin, it’s not as excessive as one might think, with most of this debt not falling due within the next two years. This is a critical point. Debt that matures far in the future provides a company with significant breathing room. This allows companies with a Bitcoin Treasury to: Ride out short-term market volatility in Bitcoin. Generate operational cash flow from their core business to service interest payments. Strategically plan for refinancing or repayment well in advance of the due date. Benefit from potential future appreciation in Bitcoin’s value before debt needs to be addressed. It implies that the immediate risk of a debt-induced forced sale of Corporate Bitcoin is relatively low for many major holders, at least in the near term. MicroStrategy and Beyond: Examples of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption While several companies have adopted Bitcoin Adoption strategies, MicroStrategy is arguably the most prominent example. Their aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin, financed significantly through convertible notes and secured debt, often puts them at the center of this debt discussion. Let’s consider MicroStrategy ‘s approach: They have issued various forms of debt specifically to acquire Bitcoin. A significant portion of this debt is long-term, such as convertible senior notes maturing in 2025, 2027, and beyond. They also utilized Bitcoin-backed secured debt, which has specific loan-to-value thresholds but provides flexibility. Their core business (business intelligence software) continues to generate revenue, providing a source of funds independent of their Bitcoin holdings. While MicroStrategy ‘s strategy is unique in its scale and financing methods, other companies engaged in Bitcoin Adoption may have different debt structures or hold Bitcoin as a smaller percentage of their overall assets. Evaluating each company individually is crucial. Analyzing Corporate Debt Structures: Not All Debt is Equal The type of debt matters. Companies acquiring Corporate Bitcoin have used various instruments: Convertible Notes: These are unsecured debt that can be converted into equity under certain conditions. They often carry lower interest rates but can dilute shareholders if converted. Secured Term Loans: Debt backed by specific assets, in some cases, the Bitcoin itself. These loans have covenants (like loan-to-value ratios) that, if breached, could trigger margin calls or require additional collateral. Senior Unsecured Notes: Standard corporate bonds not backed by specific assets, relying on the company’s overall creditworthiness. Thorne’s point about maturity applies across these types. Long-dated debt, regardless of structure, pushes the refinancing or repayment risk further into the future, providing a buffer against immediate market downturns impacting the Bitcoin Treasury . What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Adoption? The narrative around Corporate Debt and Bitcoin is important for the future of Bitcoin Adoption . If fears of debt-fueled collapses were realized, it could significantly deter other companies from adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. However, if, as Thorne suggests, the current debt structures are manageable and the risks are being effectively navigated, it could pave the way for more mainstream corporate interest. Successful management of these strategies by pioneers like MicroStrategy provides a potential blueprint and builds confidence. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers What should you take away from this analysis? Look Beyond Headlines: Don’t rely solely on sensational headlines about corporate debt. Investigate the specific companies. Analyze Debt Maturity: Understand when their significant debt tranches are due. Near-term maturities pose higher immediate risk than long-term ones. Evaluate Core Business: Assess the health and cash flow generation of the company’s primary operations, as this is the first line of defense for servicing debt. Understand Debt Structure: Different debt types have different risks and covenants. Consider the Strategic Long Game: Companies adopting Bitcoin Treasury strategies often view Bitcoin as a long-term hedge or growth asset, not just a short-term trade. While risks always exist in finance and volatile assets like Bitcoin, the idea that major corporate holders are on the verge of a debt-induced crisis appears, based on expert analysis, to be significantly exaggerated for now. Summary: Debt Concerns Overblown, But Due Diligence Remains Key In conclusion, the concerns surrounding Corporate Debt taken on by companies pursuing a Bitcoin Treasury strategy seem largely overblown, particularly regarding immediate risks. Expert analysis points to manageable debt levels and, crucially, debt maturity schedules that extend well into the future, providing a buffer against short-term Bitcoin price volatility. While prominent examples like MicroStrategy have used leverage, their specific financial structures and the long-term view on Bitcoin Adoption suggest that a debt-fueled collapse is not an imminent threat for most major players. However, this does not negate the need for investors and observers to conduct their own due diligence and understand the specific financial health and debt obligations of individual companies holding Corporate Bitcoin .

Speaking Thursday at the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco , Khosrowshahi said the company is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins for operational use. “I think stablecoins are one of the more interesting instantiations of crypto that have a practical benefit beyond being a store of value,” Khosrowshahi said. Uber was an early member of the Diem Association (formerly Libra), joining in 2019 to support Meta’s now-defunct stablecoin initiative aimed at reshaping global payments. “You can have your opinions on Bitcoin, it’s a proven commodity, and people differ on where it’s going. But stablecoins seems quite promising, especially for global companies moving money around internationally,” Khosrowshahi continued on Thursday. “That’s super interesting to us, and we’re definitely going to take a look.” The remarks echo what Khosrowshahi told CNBC in September 2021 , when he said Uber would “look into” accepting BTC and other cryptocurrencies as payment. At the time, he dismissed any plans to put crypto on the company’s balance sheet, saying, “We are going to keep our cash safe.” Later, in February 2022, Khosrowshahi told Bloomberg that the company would “absolutely” accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment at “some point” in the future, but emphasized that the time wasn’t right yet. “We’re having conversations all the time,” Khosrowshahi said at the time. “As the exchange mechanism becomes less expensive and becomes more environmentally friendly, I think you will see us leaning into crypto a little bit more.” When he made crypto-related comments in 2021, BTC traded flat for the next three months. However, his February 2022 comments came weeks before the beginning of an industry-shaking major market correction, which kicked off later that spring.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-06 03:01:19

This decision, confirmed by Anthropic Co-founder and Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan, stems largely from recent rumors suggesting that OpenAI , Anthropic’s primary competitor, is on the verge of acquiring Windsurf . Why Anthropic Cut Windsurf Access Speaking at TC Sessions: AI 2025, Jared Kaplan clarified Anthropic’s position. He stated that the company is focused on enabling customers with whom they foresee sustainable, long-term relationships. The prospect of selling access to their valuable Claude AI models to a competitor like OpenAI through a third party like Windsurf was, in Kaplan’s words, ‘odd’. This comment follows reports, including one from Bloomberg, about OpenAI’s potential $3 billion acquisition of Windsurf. Just days before Kaplan’s remarks, Windsurf announced that Anthropic had indeed cut its direct access to popular models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. This has reportedly forced Windsurf to scramble for third-party computing resources on short notice, potentially causing instability for users accessing Claude via Windsurf. Windsurf expressed disappointment regarding Anthropic’s decision, while neither Windsurf nor OpenAI have officially confirmed the acquisition rumors. Resource Constraints and Lasting Partnerships Kaplan also highlighted that part of the reason for the decision is Anthropic’s current computing constraints. The company aims to reserve its valuable compute resources for what Kaplan termed ‘lasting partnerships’. This suggests a strategic prioritization of resources towards collaborations expected to yield long-term benefits and alignment. Despite current limitations, Kaplan expressed optimism about increasing the availability of Claude AI models in the coming months. He mentioned that Anthropic has begun unlocking capacity on a new, substantial computing cluster provided by their partner, Amazon, which is expected to scale significantly. Shifting Focus in AI Coding As Anthropic re-evaluates its partnerships, Kaplan noted the company is actively collaborating with other customers building AI coding tools. He specifically mentioned Cursor, a company Anthropic anticipates working with for a considerable time. Kaplan dismissed the notion that Anthropic is in direct competition with companies like Cursor, even those developing their own AI models. Simultaneously, Anthropic is increasing its focus on developing its own agentic coding products, such as Claude Code. Kaplan suggested that the traditional AI chatbot paradigm, while popular with companies like OpenAI , Google, and Meta, is limiting due to its static nature. He believes that more dynamic AI agents will ultimately prove far more helpful for users tackling complex coding tasks. What This Means for Users and the Market Anthropic’s move to cut Windsurf access underscores the intense competition and strategic maneuvering within the AI industry. For users relying on Windsurf for Claude AI access, this could mean short-term disruptions. For the broader market, it highlights the importance of direct partnerships and resource allocation as companies like Anthropic and OpenAI vie for dominance in specific AI applications, particularly in specialized fields like AI Coding . The situation remains fluid as acquisition rumors persist and Anthropic continues to build out its infrastructure and define its partnership strategy in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

In a sudden move that caught many off guard, the crypto futures market experienced a wave of liquidations, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in leveraged positions within a very short timeframe. What Exactly Happened in the Crypto Futures Market? Recent data from major exchanges paints a stark picture. In just the past hour, a staggering $251 million worth of futures contracts were liquidated. Extending the view, the past 24 hours saw total liquidations surge to over $804 million . These aren’t just numbers; they represent positions closed forcefully due to insufficient margin, primarily impacting traders using high leverage trading strategies. Understanding Liquidations: What are Futures? These are agreements to buy or sell an asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) at a specific price on a future date. In crypto, they are often used for speculation and hedging. What is Leverage Trading? This allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital (margin). For example, 10x leverage means you can control $10,000 worth of crypto with just $1,000 of your own money. What is a Liquidation? When the market price moves against a leveraged position to the point where the trader’s margin is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses, the exchange automatically closes the position. The trader loses their margin and potentially more, depending on the market’s speed. Why Did We See Such Significant Crypto Liquidations? Liquidations of this magnitude don’t happen in a vacuum. They are typically triggered by sharp price movements in the underlying assets. While the exact catalyst can vary, significant market volatility is the primary culprit. When prices swing rapidly, especially downwards for long positions or upwards for short positions, leveraged traders can quickly hit their liquidation price. Factors contributing to recent volatility might include: Macroeconomic news impacting global markets. Specific news related to major cryptocurrencies or the broader crypto industry. Sudden shifts in market sentiment or large whale movements. Technical factors like breaking key support or resistance levels. The speed at which the $251 million was liquidated suggests a particularly sharp and rapid price change occurred within that single hour, cascading into forced closures across various exchanges. Breaking Down the Impact: Which Assets and Exchanges Were Hit Hardest? While the data often aggregates liquidations, these events typically impact positions across various cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures usually account for the largest portions due to their market dominance and trading volume in the futures market . However, altcoins with significant futures trading activity can also see substantial liquidations, often experiencing even higher percentage price swings. Major exchanges offering perpetual futures contracts are where these liquidations occur. Platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, and others regularly report such data. The concentration of the $251 million in a single hour indicates a broad market move affecting positions across multiple leading platforms simultaneously. Challenges of Leverage Trading: While leverage trading can amplify profits, it dramatically increases risk. A small price move against your position can lead to total loss of your margin. The recent crypto liquidations serve as a harsh reminder of this inherent danger, especially in a market known for its extreme market volatility . Actionable Insights: How Can Traders Navigate Volatility and Avoid Liquidations? For anyone participating in or considering the crypto futures market, understanding and managing risk is paramount. The recent $251 million liquidation event underscores the need for caution. Here are some key strategies: Understand Leverage: Don’t use excessive leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading or during periods of high market volatility . Lower leverage gives your position more room to withstand price swings. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level. This limits your potential loss and prevents a full liquidation. Manage Your Margin: Keep a close eye on your margin level. Be prepared to add more collateral if necessary to avoid a margin call or liquidation. Trade with a Plan: Have clear entry and exit points. Don’t make impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Know the Market: Stay informed about factors that could cause sudden price changes. Avoiding forced crypto liquidations requires discipline and a robust risk management strategy, particularly when engaging in leverage trading in the unpredictable futures market . Summary: A Harsh Lesson in Leverage and Volatility The liquidation of $251 million in crypto futures within a single hour, contributing to over $804 million in 24 hours, is a significant event in the futures market . It highlights the inherent risks associated with leverage trading in a market characterized by extreme market volatility . While futures offer opportunities for profit and hedging, the potential for rapid and substantial losses through crypto liquidations is a reality every trader must confront. Understanding these risks and implementing strict risk management practices are essential for survival in this fast-paced environment.

This development, revealed via BitGo’s X account, marks a crucial step in expanding access to yield-generating opportunities within the cryptocurrency market for large-scale investors and financial institutions. The service is being rolled out in partnership with Yuma, a recognized validator in the Bittensor ecosystem, aiming to provide a secure and compliant pathway for institutions looking to participate in network consensus and earn rewards through TAO staking . What is Institutional Staking and Why is it Important? Institutional staking refers to the participation of large financial entities – such as hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations – in the process of staking cryptocurrencies. Unlike retail staking, which can be done individually or through smaller platforms, institutional staking requires robust infrastructure, stringent security measures, regulatory compliance, and sophisticated reporting capabilities. BitGo specializes in providing these high-level services, making them a key player in enabling institutions to enter the staking arena. The importance of institutional involvement in crypto staking cannot be overstated. It brings significant capital into proof-of-stake networks, enhancing their security and decentralization. Furthermore, it signals growing maturity and acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance, potentially paving the way for wider adoption. For institutions, staking offers a way to generate passive income on their digital asset holdings, adding a new dimension to portfolio management beyond simple price appreciation. Deep Dive into TAO Staking and Bittensor’s Ecosystem Bittensor (TAO) is a fascinating project that aims to create a decentralized, open-source network for machine intelligence. It functions as a marketplace for AI models, where participants contribute computational resources or intellectual property and are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the value they add to the collective intelligence. Staking TAO is integral to the network’s operation, allowing participants to become validators or delegate their tokens to validators to earn rewards from network emissions and transaction fees. The decision by BitGo to offer Bittensor staking specifically highlights the growing interest in AI-focused blockchain projects among institutional investors. As AI continues to dominate technological discussions, networks like Bittensor that merge AI development with decentralized principles are attracting attention. Staking TAO allows institutions not only to earn yield but also to implicitly support and participate in the growth of a cutting-edge decentralized AI infrastructure. BitGo’s Secure Infrastructure for Institutional Staking BitGo is a well-established digital asset trust and security company known for providing institutional-grade custody, trading, and finance services. Their entry into BitGo staking for assets like TAO is a natural extension of their core offerings. For institutions, security and compliance are paramount concerns when dealing with digital assets. BitGo addresses these needs through: Qualified Custody: Secure storage solutions that meet regulatory requirements. Insurance: Protection against potential losses due to theft or other security breaches. Compliance Frameworks: Adherence to relevant financial regulations and AML/KYC procedures. Robust Technology: Infrastructure designed for high availability and protection against slashing risks associated with staking. Partnering with a trusted validator like Yuma further enhances the reliability and performance of the TAO staking service offered by BitGo, ensuring that institutional assets are managed professionally and securely while participating in the Bittensor network. The Role of Yuma Validator in the Partnership While BitGo provides the institutional gateway and secure infrastructure, Yuma serves as the operational validator within the Bittensor network. Validators play a critical role in proof-of-stake systems; they are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks on the blockchain. This work is essential for maintaining the network’s integrity and processing transactions. Yuma’s expertise as a validator in the Bittensor ecosystem is crucial for the success of this institutional offering. They manage the technical complexities of running validator nodes, ensuring high uptime and performance to maximize staking rewards and minimize potential penalties (slashing) that can occur if a validator goes offline or acts maliciously. This partnership leverages the strengths of both entities: BitGo’s institutional-grade security and client management, and Yuma’s specialized technical knowledge in validating for the Bittensor network. Benefits of BitGo’s Institutional TAO Staking For institutions considering adding TAO to their portfolio, staking through BitGo offers several compelling benefits: Yield Generation: Earn passive income on TAO holdings through staking rewards. Enhanced Security: Leverage BitGo’s battle-tested security and custody solutions, mitigating risks associated with self-staking or using less secure platforms. Simplified Participation: BitGo handles the technical complexities of staking, reporting, and reward distribution. Regulatory Compliance: Access staking services that align with institutional compliance requirements. Participation in AI Growth: Support and benefit from the growth of the decentralized Bittensor AI network. This service lowers the barrier for entry for institutions interested in Bittensor staking , providing a familiar and trusted counterparty to manage their digital assets and staking activities. Challenges and Considerations for Institutional Stakers While the benefits are clear, institutions must also consider potential challenges associated with crypto staking : Slashing Risk: Although minimized by professional validators like Yuma and platforms like BitGo, there is always a theoretical risk of losing staked assets if the validator misbehaves or suffers technical issues. Lock-up Periods: Staked assets are typically locked for a certain period, affecting liquidity. Institutions need to understand the unbonding period for TAO. Price Volatility: The value of the staked asset (TAO) can fluctuate significantly, impacting the overall return on investment in fiat terms. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto staking is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Tax Implications: Staking rewards have tax implications that institutions must navigate. BitGo aims to help institutions navigate these complexities by providing secure infrastructure and potentially assisting with reporting, but thorough due diligence is always required. Market Implications and Future Outlook The launch of institutional TAO staking by a major player like BitGo is a positive signal for both Bittensor and the broader institutional crypto market. It indicates increasing institutional appetite for yield-bearing digital assets beyond the major ones like Ethereum. It also validates the importance of specialized service providers like BitGo in bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized networks. As more institutions become comfortable with crypto staking , we can expect to see increased capital flow into proof-of-stake networks, potentially boosting network security and stability. This trend is likely to accelerate as regulatory clarity improves and more mature financial products around staking emerge. Actionable Insights for Institutions Institutions interested in exploring Bittensor staking through BitGo should: Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand the potential risks, including slashing and price volatility. Evaluate Liquidity Needs: Be aware of the lock-up and unbonding periods for TAO. Consult with BitGo: Engage directly with BitGo’s institutional team to understand the specific terms, security measures, and reporting capabilities of their TAO staking service. Review Validator Performance: While BitGo partners with Yuma, understanding Yuma’s track record as a validator is prudent. Consider Regulatory and Tax Implications: Consult with legal and tax professionals regarding staking rewards. Utilizing a trusted platform like BitGo provides a more secure and compliant path compared to navigating the complexities of staking independently. Summary: A New Era for Institutional Crypto Yield BitGo’s launch of institutional TAO staking with Yuma is a significant development, expanding the options available to large investors seeking yield in the crypto space. By providing a secure, compliant, and professionally managed service, BitGo is lowering the barriers for institutions to participate in the Bittensor network and benefit from its growth and staking rewards. This move underscores the increasing maturity of the digital asset market and the growing institutional interest in innovative decentralized projects like Bittensor. As institutional crypto staking continues to evolve, services like this will play a vital role in driving broader adoption and integrating digital assets into traditional financial portfolios.

Some believe it is the key to massive wealth, while others call it pure hype. What’s really going on? Let us break it down. The term GCV in the Pi Network community stands for Global Consensus Value, an idea introduced by Pi enthusiasts to set a fixed value for Pi Coin. Some fans claim that 1 Pi Coin equals $314,159, inspired by the mathematical constant π (pi). They say that Pi’s rising user base, real-world uses, and limited supply justify such a valuation and see it as a motivational tool to encourage adoption and participation. Critics See Red Flags But critics said that since there is no official approval or big exchange listings yet, it is just speculation and an unrealistic hope that might end up disappointing them. They even compare Pi Network to multi-level marketing or Ponzi schemes due to its reliance on social media campaigns and referrals. PI NETWORK NEWS: Big Congratulations to Mr. Vijay Soni as the Head of GCV Ambassador in France! Thank you for your outstanding creativity, leadership, and tireless commitment to advancing the GCV movement in France and across the world! Global GCV Core Team April… pic.twitter.com/JrdjbJqNkw — JoJo-π (@jojo102102) April 13, 2025 Dr Altcoin recently stepped up to clear the air. He clarified that GCV was never backed by market data or the Pi Core Team. It came from a group of early users who truly believed in Pi’s huge potential and promoted the idea through events, campaigns, and community efforts. The Reality Check The catch here is that while the Pi Core Team never officially endorsed GCV, they also never clearly rejected it. Their vague comments like “Pi is worth what pioneers make it worth” allowed the myth to spread. Pi is currently trading at about $0.6323, which is far away from the claimed $314,159. GCV supporters point to many blockchain transactions, but these involve only small items, not big purchases. One case showed paying thousands in fees for a $3 item that was very unrealistic. The GitHub Confusion Some people point to Kosasi’s GitHub to justify GCV, but the analyst says that the code was copied and has no link to the Pi Core Team. Many wrongly think the community can set Pi’s price, but he emphasized that real value comes from scarcity, utility, and trust, and not hype. With 100 billion coins, Pi is not scarce like Bitcoin. GCV would make Pi worth $72 trillion, which would be more than the world’s GDP, and far from being true. He has stressed the need for the Core Team to step up and clear the confusion. Focus on Real Progress Instead of chasing these shallow dreams, the community needs to focus on faster KYC, smooth mainnet launch, tokenomics clarity, migration speed, improved validator rewards, and real-world use cases that give Pi true value. With proper planning, real-world use, and transparency, Dr Altcoin predicts it to reach $100 to $300. Analyst Mr. Spock has also called out GCV promoters for misleading the Pi community. He warned that these false claims have crashed Pi’s price multiple times and hurt real Pioneers. The real threat is not the price, it’s the manipulation by people using Pi for personal gain, he said.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 03:37:04

This has been the fate of reputable projects like Ripple, Block.one and so on. Their regulatory missteps have turned into multi-million-dollar headaches for years now. Let’s take Ripple as a case study . Over the years, the SEC sued Ripple, claiming that XRP was an unregistered security – this has led to lengthy battles. Consequently, this prolonged battle had a huge impact on XRP market value, and holders experienced a significant loss. According to this source , after Ripple was granted a partial victory through summary judgments, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the company has spent over $150 million on its defense. Thus, while there is no perfect approach to staying off the SEC’s radar, especially if you’re founding a solution-driven project. Here is a guide that can arm you with the right compliance strategies to stay off their radar. SEC scrutiny and the regulatory nature of the blockchain startup A lot has happened in recent years with the SEC asserting itself over many projects falling short of its standards. For new companies emanating in the Web 3.0 space, knowing how to build on a compliant basis from day one is no doubt paramount to their survival. Yes, SEC scrutiny might delay a launch, freeze assets or give rise to enforcement actions, but the basic aim of this article is to give a legal-strategic guide to the founders of Web 3.0 projects that wish to identify possible risks tied to the SEC, approach compliance from a proactive standpoint and build up their projects for the long haul. This guide is a sort of seasoned lawyer’s toolkit for compliance without stifling innovation. 1. Understand the SEC’s role in Web 3.0 regulation This is one of the surest ways to avoid SEC scrutiny. Technically, the SEC is charged with protecting investors and maintaining fair, orderly markets. While their interest isn’t limited to ICOs (initial coin offerings) – it extends to DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols, staking mechanisms, NFT (non-fungible token) projects, token-based fundraising and more. One of the common mistakes startup founders make is thinking that decentralization exempts them from scrutiny. According to this source , SEC has increased their dogged vigilance in holding projects accountable, even retroactively. Crypto startup owners must understand that regulators view blockchain through a risk-focused lens, and they prioritize consumer protection over the innovation you’re bringing in. Furthermore, founders have to align operational frameworks with regulatory expectations from inception. Startups that anticipate and respond to the SEC’s evolving stance gain credibility not just with regulators but with investors and users alike. Also, when founders understand the regulators’ triggers and intentions, they can conceive products and ecosystems that innovate within the legal guardrails. 2. The Howey test and token classification – The SEC’s primary lens Once a project structurally passes the Howey test , it has passed the first compliance checkpoint. This test is not just central to SEC enforcement – it’s their primary lens that determines whether a digital asset qualifies as a security. What is a Howey test? It is simply analyzed as an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. Here are the four-pronged Howey test questions to be asked. Is there any investment of money? Is it a common enterprise? Is there an expectation of profits? Is it derived from the efforts of others? If the answer is ‘yes’ to all four, the asset is perceived as a ‘security’ and subject to SEC rules. For years now, many tokens have been sold with speculative promise. To avoid such scrutiny, founders must carefully structure their tokenomics. While this act may include removing profit expectations, decentralizing control and delaying token issuance until the network is sufficiently mature, legal memos and third-party assessments can help support the non-security classification. One of the SEC’s rules has emphasized that simply calling a token a ‘utility’ doesn’t exempt it from being a security. The Howey test is functional, and a rigorous application of it that is backed by legal counsel and documentation is the first line of defense in controlling regulatory risk and avoiding unwanted SEC attention. 3. Smart structuring from day one – Entity formation and jurisdiction One of the smartest ways to avoid SEC scrutiny is to engage in smart structuring from the beginning. How a startup incorporates and where it operates can significantly impact its regulatory exposure. For instance, US-based startups fall directly under the SEC’s oversight, so selecting the right entity type (LLC, C-Corp, Foundation) and jurisdiction is very strategic. While offshore jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or Switzerland may offer more favorable regulatory environments for token-based projects, it doesn’t absolve the startup completely from US law if their citizens’ investments are involved. More so, a project with dual-entity structure – for example, a dual between the US C-Corp for operations and an offshore foundation for protocol governance – can offer balance, but it must be supported by robust governance, crystal clear roles and arms-length dealings. Early legal counsel is critical here because any missteps in entity setup can jeopardize the startup in multi-jurisdictional legal issues that are very costly and time-consuming to resolve. Blockchain birthed decentralization, and decentralization eradicates excessive protocol from the development team. But for it not to be an SEC meal ticket, it must be handled with legal precision to avoid scrutiny. The end goal is to align the structure with the project’s operational goals and compliance needs. 4. Regulatory-first tokenomics design No matter how great your Web 3.0 project ideas are, if you toil with your tokenomics, you’re giving the SEC an open invitation. Startups must think beyond utility and value capture to consider how their token models may be perceived under securities laws. Avoiding profit promises is essential. For example, it’s much safer to design structures for tokens to be earned through network participation or staking instead of speculative promises that entice people to participate during pre-launch. By doing this, you’re reducing legal exposure. More so, vesting schedules for team and investor tokens should be transparent and defensible. The more a token ecosystem is decentralized at launch, the lower the risk. Airdrops and ‘fair launches’ are also under scrutiny if tied to promotional schemes or disguised fundraising. Any Web 3.0 startup that embeds compliance in tokenomics has not only de-risked its operations but has also gained investor confidence by showing that its model can withstand regulatory due diligence. 5. Implementing an education compliance program Education is a powerful key and leveraging it can help Web 3.0 founders to avoid the SEC’s strong scrutiny. By ensuring that your team members understand compliance obligations, you can prevent inadvertent violations. When your team members are armed with the necessary knowledge, like periodic audits and internal legal reviews, how they consult with outside counsel will help smooth your project processes and avoid violations. Meanwhile, it’s also wise to engage with regulators when appropriate, for instance, you could submit no-action letters or seek interpretative guidance. A startup that shows proactive compliance is more likely to receive regulatory cooperation than a sanction. 6. Build a compliance shield – KYC/AML as a non-negotiable pillar While decentralization is a core value of Web 3.0, KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) protocols are non-negotiable from a regulatory perspective. The SEC, along with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), expects any entity engaged in token sales or exchanges to implement KYC/AML safeguards. Failure to do so not only attracts scrutiny but can invite criminal liability. Blockchain startups must integrate identity verification processes for investors and users – particularly during token distributions, fundraising or when providing financial-like services. Tools like Chainalysis or TRM Labs can also help monitor on-chain behavior for suspicious activity. Privacy does not mean anonymity in the eyes of regulators – it means responsible data management. Even decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that facilitate economic activity must consider KYC obligations, depending on their functions. Embedding these checks from day one allows your project to scale lawfully. Moreover, demonstrating AML/KYC readiness opens up institutional partnerships and fiat on-ramp opportunities. In a maturing market, clean compliance can be more valuable than fast growth. 7. Understand how to navigate fundraising – From reg D to reg CF Do you know how to navigate fundraising without raising eyebrows? Whether it’s token sales, SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity) or even NFT-based fundraising, to avoid pitfalls, Web 3.0 founders must align their fundraising approach with one of the SEC’s recognized exemptions. One of these is Regulation D (Reg D). It allows private offerings to accredited investors without full SEC registration. It’s commonly used during token presales but requires proper filings (Form D) and marketing restrictions. Another is Regulation CF (Regulation Crowdfunding). It offers a path for raising from the general public, up to $5 million annually, with lower compliance burdens than IPOs. It still mandates disclosures, investor limits and platform usage. In order not to trigger SEC scrutiny, you must avoid these death traps, and they are as follows: misrepresenting the offering, failing to file accordingly and overselling tokens. More so, ensure your legal counsel is fully involved when structuring these rounds and drafting appropriate documentation. Smart fundraising isn’t just about capital – it’s about regulatory sustainability. 8. Staying ahead, constant monitoring and having an experienced legal counsel The path to success is not just paved with code and capital – it’s fortified with legal foresight. Hiring and retaining experienced legal counsel is not a luxury but a necessity. After my recent LinkedIn interview with Yarden Noy , blockchain legal and regulatory advisor at DTL Law, on the basic requirements of hiring a seasoned blockchain lawyer or advisor, here is his feedback. Noy said, “It’s not enough to simply know the law in this industry. “A seasoned blockchain lawyer should be able to analyze the unique model and features of a project, identify the relevant laws that apply or may apply to it and apply them in this constantly evolving and dynamic landscape. “And all of that must be in a way that facilitates the project’s growth – not stifling it. “Lawyers in this nuanced space need to have a good understanding not only of the law but also of the technology, the industry and the Web 3.0 community. “Even the best legal advice, when not coupled with an understanding of the unique features of the crypto world, would be of little to no use for a crypto entrepreneur.” Your legal advisor should not be left out on tactical activities like periodic legal reviews, audits and compliance updates that surround the legal boundaries of your project. Furthermore, as the SEC continues to evolve its posture on blockchain regulation, Web 3.0 startups must adapt continuously to match the changes in global regulatory frameworks. Startups must maintain internal communication channels for discussing compliance updates, ensuring all stakeholders – from developers to marketers – act in sync. The goal is not just to avoid enforcement but to build a business that can grow confidently under regulatory clarity. In conclusion, if you’re a founder pregnant with a revolutionary Web 3.0 idea, build boldly and legally – compliance isn’t a burden.

Trump-Musk fallout rattles sentiment, Dogecoin drops 20%",https://crypto.news/crypto-market-down-trump-musk-fallout-sentiment-2025/,"The crypto market slid sharply on Friday, June 6, shedding 5% over the past 24 hours as rising political tensions between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk sent investor confidence tumbling. The total crypto market capitalization now stands at $3.29 trillion, down from around $4.1 trillion on June 5. According to data from Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped 12 points, from 57 to 45, marking a move into “fear” territory. This decline in sentiment follows a public clash between Trump and Musk that has also weighed heavily on traditional markets. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down 3.1% and trading at $101,843 at press time. Ethereum ( ETH ) leads the top 10 altcoin losses with a 7.5% slide, while Solana ( SOL ), XRP ( XRP ), and BNB ( BNB ) each slid about 5%. Nearly $986 million in cryptocurrency positions were liquidated in the last day, according to Coinglass data , a 358% increase. The crypto market relative strength index dropped to 32.7, indicating oversold conditions, and open interest dropped 2.71% to $140 billion. The market reaction followed a series of political escalations. The fallout started when Musk resigned from the Department of Government Efficiency and publicly criticized the President’s recent spending bill , dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill. In response, Trump revoked Jared Isaacman’s NASA nomination, a close associate of Musk, and threatened to completely cut off government contracts for businesses run by Musk.

While DOGE lacks intrinsic utility, its price has long been sensitive to Musk’s actions and statements. The token had rallied following Trump’s election win, amid hopes of crypto-friendly policies. However, investors seem to be pulling back as that optimism wanes. Alongside digital assets, cryptocurrency-related stocks also suffered. Mining companies MARA, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific all saw losses of about 5%, while Coinbase fell 4.6% and Strategy fell 2.4%. Meanwhile, political uncertainty continues to attract the interest of the crypto community. Traders currently assign a 10% probability that Trump will be impeached before the end of 2025 on the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket. So far, almost half a million dollars has been wagered on that outcome. Market volatility may persist in the coming days as macro risks increase and sentiment toward cryptocurrencies declines.

Citadel President Jim Esposito is confident that the asset class has surpassed the “point of no return.” Speaking at a Piper Sandler conference on Thursday, he said that institutional investors are taking crypto seriously. “Crypto has passed the point of no return, and it is an asset class that institutional investors, serious and sophisticated investors, are taking seriously,” he noted. Crypto Expansion Under Eased SEC Regulatory Plans Per a Reuters report , the firm is looking into crypto expansion as a part of its “strategic plan,” under the new SEC regulatory regime. “We’re excited by the prospects of the SEC coming out with the rule set,” said Esposito. “So crypto is definitely a space we’re going to get bigger in, and we’re excited about the prospects” Citadel touted in February that it is targeting major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, looking to become a liquidity provider for crypto . Citadel President Warns US Govt. Debt: A ‘Ticking Time Bomb’ Besides the company’s crypto plans, President Esposito stressed that mounting government debt levels are a “ticking time bomb.” The Government’s reaction to this crisis is “super important” at this time, he added. The US deficit has been a growing concern recently among several financial leaders. For instance, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this week that the national debt will create a “tough time” for the bond market and will eventually spread. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has warned that Bitcoin could replace USD eventually , if lawmakers fail to address America’s alarming debt. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control,” he wrote to his 1.5 million followers on X. @brian_armstrong has warned that Bitcoin could replace the USD as the world’s reserve currency if lawmakers fail to address America’s debt. #Bitcoin #USD https://t.co/2NHd9jLGwv — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Early this year, VanEck suggested that accumulating Bitcoin could help offset a portion of the country’s mounting national debt. The US Treasury’s plan to acquire up to 1 million Bitcoin over five years and holding it as a long-term store of value would strengthen the country’s balance sheet , the asset manager noted.

On June 5, Bitcoin traded around $104,300, down 0.50% in 24 hours and off 2.5% over the past seven days. Yet data shows more people are joining the network, and more coins are being passed around. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Wallet Creation Jump According to Santiment, on May 29 nearly 557,000 new wallets appeared. That was the highest number since December 2023. It means thousands of people are opening wallets even though price has stayed just under $105,000. People normally open new wallets to send and receive bitcoins but they somehow come across the idea through new sources, increased talks among friends or create simple curiosity. In any case, an increased wallet holding indeed indicates a much wider usage. 📊 Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has seen sharp rises this week as its price hovers just below $105K: 📈 May 29th: 556,830 new $BTC wallets created (Highest since December 2, 2023) 🔄 June 2nd: 241,360 coins circulated (Highest since December 8, 2024) Growth in a network’s… pic.twitter.com/2DxknVXrKT — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 5, 2025 Increased Token Movement On June 2, over 241,360 BTC changed hands. This was deemed the busiest day since December 2024. Reports from Santiment suggest that high coin turnover usually coincides with increased traffic. Traders might be moving coins in and out of exchanges, or investors could be shifting wallets. Big swings in daily token movement can point to a shift in sentiment—people either getting ready to buy or sell. Right now, it mostly looks like more users are sending coins to each other, which keeps the network busy even when price sits still. Big Holders Step In Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large holders—often called “whales”—are stocking up. Their coin inflows jumped by 145% over the last seven days, and by 214% over the past 30 days. When big players load up, it can tighten supply on exchanges. That makes it tougher for new buyers to get in without driving price higher. If whales keep buying at this rate, it could lead to more upward pressure on price once everyday investors step in again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Mid Tier Investors Buy It’s not just the really big holders adding coins. Wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC added more than 79,000 BTC in just one week. That means these mid-tier holders picked up around 11,320 BTC per day on average. As of June 2, they held over 13 million BTC in total. When both big whales and these mid-level holders keep stacking, it further cuts down the number of coins floating on exchanges. Fewer coins available often mean any shift in demand could move price more.

Wynn, who first gained attention for turning a $7,000 position in the meme coin PEPE into over $25m, shared his story Friday on X. In a candid post, he said he began trading perpetual futures in March, despite having no prior experience with derivatives. “I started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in fact never really traded properly before. I’ve just traded meme coins,” he wrote. I started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in-fact never really traded properly before, I’ve just traded meme coins.

Within a month, Wynn said he turned a $3m position into $100m through a series of high-leverage trades. His success, all trackable on-chain, attracted attention fast. His social media following ballooned as crypto traders scrambled to replicate or monitor his positions. But the newfound visibility proved double-edged. Wynn admitted that the pressure of being in the spotlight warped his judgment. “With all this new attention the trading spiraled out of control. I was basically gambling,” he said. “I got greedy. I wasn’t taking the numbers on the screen seriously.” Transparency Made Wynn a Star—Then a Cautionary Tale In mid-May, Wynn had amassed a $1.25b long position on Bitcoin , betting big at an average entry price of around $108,243. The position, built with as much as 40x leverage, left little margin for error. When US President Donald Trump posted a tweet threatening tariffs on the European Union, global markets turned sharply. Bitcoin dipped below Wynn’s liquidation price, wiping out nearly his entire position in a series of cascading losses. The rapid reversal shocked many in the crypto community, where Wynn had become a divisive figure. Some hailed him as a modern trading icon, while others accused him of reckless gambling or even market manipulation.

The rift came to a head on June 5 during a White House meeting with the German chancellor, where Trump voiced his displeasure with Musk , who until recently had been one of his closest advisers. “I’m very disappointed in Elon,” Trump said. “I’ve helped Elon a lot.” Musk wasted no time responding. In a pointed post on X, he accused Trump of ingratitude and fired back, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election.” The exchange marked a dramatic unraveling of their once-powerful alliance, built during Trump’s second term. Musk Swipe at Trump Adds Fuel to Market Volatility Tensions escalated further when Musk replied “Yes” to a post on X calling for Trump’s impeachment . The remark drew immediate attention, although any such effort is considered politically impossible, as Republicans currently hold majorities in both chambers of Congress. Yes https://t.co/rqRsX8B4Hg — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Markets quickly reflected the fallout. Bitcoin dipped to $100,783 on Thursday before recovering above $102,700. Over $324m have been liquidated in Bitcoin longs in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass data . The broader crypto market fell nearly 5% during the same time. The $TRUMP meme coin, which had surged during the peak of their alliance, slid 10%. Analysts say Musk’s influence in the crypto space, combined with the political uncertainty, has introduced fresh instability into an already volatile market. Tesla Plunges as Rift With Trump Threatens Federal Support Tesla shares, meanwhile, suffered a sharper decline. The stock closed 14% lower on Thursday and has fallen 16% since Musk began attacking Trump’s domestic policy bill last week. The market was hit hard by the Trump and Musk issues.

Until recently, Musk had served as a key informal adviser to Trump, helping shape major policy decisions and frequently representing the administration abroad. His sudden departure from that inner circle has left a noticeable void in tech-policy alignment, with markets now unsure of how the administration will proceed on key issues such as electric vehicles and space infrastructure. Adding to the uncertainty, Musk has hinted at launching a new political movement altogether. That possibility, along with the risk of a regulatory reversal or funding pullback, has left investors bracing for a more hostile environment. And that’s not just for Tesla, but for the broader tech and crypto sectors that have often moved in tandem with Musk’s influence. The clash has become more than a political sideshow. It is a rare case of personality-driven politics colliding with market fundamentals. For now, both crypto and Tesla appear firmly caught in the crossfire.

After the April bounce that led to a significant recovery, VVV halted buying pressure after reaching a high of $5.34 and later took a downturn. This led to a broad retracement phase last month, and the market closed bearishly following a lower low and lower high pattern. Although the $2.7 level held firmly and the bleeding stopped due to a slight recovery. That brought a slight relief in drawdown, and the price increased above $3. Following the bearish pattern, it encountered resistance at $3.15 this week and now appears ready for another leg down on the daily chart. A break below the previous monthly low could fuel more downtrends. Looking ahead, the key level to watch for such a drop lies at $2. A major rebound above this level should trigger a fresh buy capable of bringing positive sentiments back into the market. As of now, it is currently under the bear’s radar. Losing April’s low in the process might cause a major crash to a new low. VVV Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The latest drop is targeted at the $ 2.38 support. If this support fails to produce a bounce, the next key support to keep in mind is $1.8 – April’s low. Breaking lower could crash the price straight to $1. If by chance the bulls find their way back, with a push above the recent $3.15 resistance, higher levels to watch for a test are $4.13 and $5.34, with a potential breakout. Currently, the bears are still in control.

Virtuals latest tallies the total market cap of AI agents at $9.59 billion, down 5.76 percent from a day before. The broad-based downturn hit the major players in the Virtuals ecosystem and their far-flung associates hard. The virtuals protocol itself was down 8.42% in terms of market cap, resting now at 2.16 billion real ones—but its mindshare, a kind of virtual cap that measures how much folks are talking about you across various digital platforms, was up a bit, growing 1.14% to 38.20%. Virtual Market Volatility Hits Legacy Leaders Hard The established players in the AI agent space appear to have taken the worst hits from the ongoing correction. Volatile trading conditions in a liquidity-challenged market have impacted their market caps, which was also the case yesterday for the Virtuals ecosystem, whose native token $VIRTUAL fell to $1.7638—down 8.88% for the day. Maintain necessary ecosystem development and community traction, however, is core to the strategy of these tokens. Generative AI protocol or no, leading projects in this space very much look like candidates for invested capital and the valuation and price recovery that goes with it. The dip in virtuals occurs alongside an increasingly cautious market. As trading volumes retreat and liquidity thins, even the most fundamentally sound projects are seeing sharper price movements. Analysts cite the diverging performance across the sector to novelty—to some extent, the availability of new projects to buy. Newcomers Shine as Capital Rotates While most major initiatives posted red numbers, a scant few emerging names managed to clash with the trend, pulling in capital and attention with gains that delighted in their short-term nature. AURA (@AurraCloud) led the top gainers with a remarkable 24.43% growth in market cap.

Many of these projects are in the early stages of development or adoption, but they appear to be benefiting from a wish-to-innovate trend where users and investors are not just hanging back and waiting on the tried-and-true old networks.

When liquidity is tight, it’s not unusual to see some smaller, more agile projects outperform the competition as they offer up new, different, or even experimental products and services. In the world of AI-driven markets, where “the latest and greatest” quickly becomes the table stakes for a successful product, this element of surprise and delight is a key driver of a project’s perceived value. Virtuals Mindshare Grows Despite Price Drop It is curious that, while the worth of $VIRTUAL was dropping, the value of the ecosystem was apparently on the upswing. Between February 2023 and May 2023, the worth of $VIRTUAL dropped 20.25%. In contrast, the virtuals protocol reached almost 4% increased market share with CryptoSlam as of June 2013 and has increased visibility across social platforms. It is now ranked among the top 5 entities shared about across influencer platforms. The gap between market cap and mind share may indicate that users are not abandoning the protocol but are instead biding their time amid a volatile market and waiting to see which way things will resolve. This seems to be an endorsement of the strength of the Virtuel brand and the community surrounding it, as a lot of upward-trending conversation seems to be going on about AI agents, protocol upgrades, and application use cases. As the AI agent market rebalances, focus is shifting to whether this correction is just a temporary dip or the start of a much larger realignment. For the present, it’s clear that Virtuals is still a dominant force in the space, even if it is feeling the squeeze of some macro-driven price action. With a growing presence in the mental landscape and a considerably loyal user base, the protocol may be set up to rebound in a stabilized market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The TMTG has yet to file official documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Nevada registration may be the legal foundation for a potential spot or futures-based crypto ETF under the Truth Social brand. TMTG registered its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF first According to Nevada’s public business records filed on June 3, Trump’s media company registered its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. Shortly after, NYSE Arca submitted Form 19b-4 to the SEC on behalf of Florida-based Yorkville America Digital, requesting approval to list and trade shares of the ETF. Per the filing, Yorkville America Digital will manage the ETF’s operations and the fund listed on NYSE Arca on approval. Later, on June 5, Yorkville America Digital filed an S-1 registration statement with the commission for the Bitcoin fund. On the same day, the TMTG registered its Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF in Nevada. The ETF offers exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading crypto assets by market cap, and thus may draw in a number of investors. Some have speculated that the fund could eventually include spot- and futures-based investments. Critics, however, believe the company’s crypto assets, if approved, will not offer long-term stability. Dave Nadig, an independent ETF expert, remarked, “I think it’s extraordinarily unlikely that products like [Truth Social Bitcoin ETF] gain long-term assets.” The media company’s growing interest in ETF coincides with the increasing optimism over Bitcoin, which has traded above $100,000 in the last few weeks. In May, the media company also said it planned to raise $1.5 billion in equity and another $1 billion in convertible notes for a “bitcoin treasury.” Addressing a BTC conference in Las Vegas one week later, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. touted cryptocurrencies as a cheaper, faster, and transparent alternative to fiat currency. Trump Jr added that crypto is now a “huge part” of all they do. He later distanced himself and his family from a Trump-themed Bitcoin trading app, saying the Trump Organization had nothing to do with the project. Nonetheless, the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial is set to introduce a crypto wallet soon. TMTG DJT shares fell 8% on Thursday after Trump and Musk’s fallout. Meanwhile, TMTG shares under the ticker DJT dropped 8% Thursday after President Donald Trump’s fallout with billionaire Elon Musk. Their feud began with their difference over a tax and spending bill. Later, the president openly declared that he would cut off all government contracts with Musk-owned companies, while Musk suggested he should be impeached on his social media platform X. Since then, in just a few hours, Tesla lost about $150 billion and closed down 14.3% on Thursday. Jamie Cox, Managing Partner at Harris Financial Group, commented on their fallout: Billionaire spats rarely have any lasting impacts on markets, but this fallout was more than predictable. At some point, there was bound to be some divergence in priorities that led to a split between Trump and Musk. Jamie Cox Mark Malek, Chief Investment Officer at Siebert Financial, also argued that the public is more worried about how the Senate will “skinny down this big beautiful bill.” than the potential deficit. He found it surprising that Elon is now a driving force behind people’s sudden interest in fiscal deficit. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Since launching the Virtuals platform, impressive adoption, creativity, and market traction have emerged around the AI agents. Underscoring this development is a recent milestone: that the total market capitalization of agent tokens now exceeds $200 million. The area is not only deep but also diverse, with more than seven agents crossing the $10 million individually. And while those numbers could suggest we’re looking at some sort of novelty stage, that’s not the case; these are intelligent, purpose-built agents across a range of real use cases. So let’s take a look at the three standout projects that are currently leading the charge. Virtuals are evolving fast since launching their AI agents platform. The total market cap of agent tokens has recently crossed $200M, with 7 agents already over the $10M mark – showing strong diversity and demand. Let’s explore the top 3 agents leading the way right now pic.twitter.com/XQiEWtcLYT — DappRadar (@DappRadar) June 4, 2025 Solace: Emotionally Intelligent AI from a Hackathon-Winning Team One of the most convincing agents is @solacelaunch, created by an award-winning team of students and researchers from UC Berkeley. Solace is not your average chatbot. It is an emotionally intelligent, voice-driven, AI companion designed to support mental health. Working around the clock, Solace offers live, real-time conversation with a virtual support specialist. It also provides the next level of care, weaving in proactively with check-ins (every two weeks, for example) in a way that is more than just a touchpoint. Solace integrates with your calendar, for crying out loud! (I mean, WOW, that’s a feature!) It even wrangles with your wearable devices—talk about a smart solution. In an industry that is often criticized for its speculative nature, Solace stands out as a project with clear utility and a humanitarian aspect. It is gaining traction with a growing user base and a strong community sentiment driving its valuation upward. As mental wellness becomes an ever more critical global issue, Solace could become the anchor of a new category of AI agents that are dedicated to emotional intelligence and care. BasisOS: Autonomous DeFi Execution with Real Returns @BasisOS—created by @logarithm_fi—is pushing the envelope of decentralized finance automation. Designed to run basis trading strategies on Hyperliquid, this agent takes in market data, spits out trades, and manages the whole operation under a set of preconditions that are defined once, at the beginning, and then left alone. It’s a no-touch, plug-and-play surgery exactly as the human mind intends it to be. BasisOS is showing early signs of proving what it is meant to prove. We should not be confused; this is not an exhibit of the basic operating system that might come with a computer. No, BasisOS is a work in progress—a still-unfinished operating system for the Baseline Protocol that will (in theory) allow users to carry out self-executing, peace-promoting transactions based on a certain set of conditions being met. In an environment where human decision-making frequently results in emotional trading and inconsistent outcomes, BasisOS offers a clear and compelling alternative. Its ascendancy in the market suggests a burgeoning demand for not just passive, but also automated active financial tools that smartly combine executable financial contracts with machine-learning-driven decision logic. If this model scales, it could become the foundational infrastructure for a next wave of DeFi investors—both passive and active. AIxVC Axelrod: The AI Hedge Fund Manager of the Future The top three are rounded out by @AIxVC_Axelrod, an agent created by @AIxVC_io that set out to be a real AI-native hedge fund strategist. Axelrod doesn’t just do what agents like Charles do—replicate trading signals, aggregate data, and otherwise emulate a human hedge fund manager. It builds and manages portfolios using its core MCP (Multi-Chain Processing unit) and ACP (Agent Coordination Protocol), fundamentals that make up the brain and network of a next-gen AI strategist. At Axelrod, we operate across chains and agents. This allows us to assess strategies, allocate capital, and manage risk—all in real time. As a user of Axelrod, you get exposure to the DeFi markets. You don’t have to manage every trade manually. We do that for you. Unlike platforms that depend largely on human direction and the signals of short-term trends, Axelrod’s model is meant for something quite different. It is an artificial intelligence not just for executing orders but for thinking and adapting to the circumstances of the DeFi market. For someone wanting a more intelligent, strategic way into DeFi investing, Axelrod could prove a very good companion indeed. Virtuals Ecosystem Expands Rapidly as New Agents Join The evolving Virtuals platform is becoming an all-encompassing discovery engine. With the daily debut of new agents, it’s delivering a use-case extravaganza that gives users ample opportunity to explore the Virtuals ecosystem. And what a virtual ecosystem it is! The platform is sporting some pretty potent offerings in entertainment, soothing a few nerves yesterday with the launch of an AI-driven “virtual therapist.” How’s that for a use-case pivot? From counselor to custodian… “As the sector matures and more capital enters the space, Virtuals is positioning itself at the intersection of AI innovation and crypto-native application. The next few months will be critical for measuring adoption and impact—but if current trends hold, Virtuals could be laying the groundwork for a new generation of intelligent, decentralized digital agents.” Virtuals is one of the most dynamic ecosystems in Web3 today—in a large part because of utility-driven design, becoming in a large part too because of cross-sector innovation, and increasingly in part because of AI-native development. These three aspects make up the ecosystem’s current dynamism. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, the milestone was met with discontent from longtime backer Arca, whose chief investment officer Jeff Dorman publicly criticized the company for granting a disproportionately small IPO allocation. Circle Soars 167% on NYSE Debut as Investor Appetite for Stablecoins Surges Circle, the fintech firm behind the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, made a historic debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 5 under the ticker symbol CRCL, soaring 167% by the close of its first trading day. The firm’s shares opened at $31, surged as high as 235% in early trading, and closed at $82, signaling strong institutional and retail demand for stablecoin-focused firms amid a shifting financial landscape. Circle share price (Source: Yahoo Finance ) This IPO marks one of the most successful public offerings in the digital asset space in 2025 and underscores growing investor interest in blockchain-native financial infrastructure, particularly as stablecoins become increasingly integrated into global finance. Circle’s public market debut was buoyed by backing from some of the most influential players in the financial world. Notably, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, revealed plans to acquire a 10% stake in the IPO. Additionally, ARK Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, was reportedly eyeing a $150 million allocation. This overwhelming demand led Circle to expand its offering to a marketed range of $1.05 billion, with 34 million shares made available to investors. Circle, which issues USDC, one of the most widely used and regulated stablecoins in the market, has long been regarded as a cornerstone of crypto’s integration with traditional finance. USDC is used in decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and corporate treasury management, and has consistently maintained its dollar peg amid past market volatility. A Comeback Story Amid Delays Circle’s path to going public hasn’t been linear. The company initially planned to debut much earlier but delayed its offering due to broader macroeconomic concerns, including heightened geopolitical tensions and global trade uncertainty. However, with improving market sentiment and increasing clarity around crypto regulation in the US, Circle seized the opportunity to list at a time when investors are looking beyond speculative assets and into real-world utility plays in the blockchain space. The timing also aligns with a broader narrative of institutional migration into digital assets. Companies such as Semler Scientific, MicroStrategy, and various ETF issuers have been pivoting into digital asset strategies, further fueling mainstream interest in firms like Circle. What’s Next for Circle? As Circle transitions into its new role as a publicly traded company, it enters a pivotal phase. It will need to demonstrate sustainable revenue models, regulatory compliance, and technological innovation in an increasingly competitive landscape. Rival stablecoin issuers like Tether, PayPal, and decentralized protocols continue to innovate in the space, and Circle will be under pressure to maintain its lead, especially now under the scrutiny of public shareholders. Nevertheless, with nearly $30 billion worth of USDC in circulation and major backing from legacy financial titans, Circle is positioned as a bridge between the old and the new worlds of finance. Its successful debut is not just a win for the company but a signal to the market: stablecoins are here to stay, and the companies behind them are beginning to claim their seat at Wall Street’s table. Arca Blasts Circle Over 'Throwaway' IPO Allocation as Public Trading Begins Despite the landmark public listing, the company faced unexpected backlash from one of its earliest crypto-native supporters just hours after its launch and subsequent stock surge. Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer of Arca, a digital asset investment firm, published an open letter slamming Circle for what he described as an ”inappropriate” and ”insulting” allocation of just $135,000 in the company’s high-profile IPO. Dorman revealed that Arca had submitted a $10 million order, only to be granted a fraction of that amount, sparking outrage and a complete severing of ties between the two companies. “You are the first and only crypto company that has ever treated Arca this way,” Dorman wrote. “I cannot believe our efforts to help you grow for years culminated in you giving us a joke, throwaway allocation.” Full open letter to Circle (Source: Jeff Dorman ) A Relationship Fractures at a Crucial Moment According to Dorman, Arca had supported Circle since its early days and had shown loyalty during times of uncertainty—including rumors that Circle would delay its IPO due to macroeconomic pressures like trade tariffs. Yet, despite that longstanding backing, Arca was reportedly sidelined in favor of larger institutional players during the IPO. The letter struck a deeply personal tone, describing the snub as a betrayal of the crypto-native ethos that companies like Arca had worked to uphold since leaving traditional finance behind nearly a decade ago. “Most of Arca’s management team left Wall Street eight years ago to start a crypto-native company specifically to get away from TradFi clowns like you,” Dorman continued. “Ironically, you’ve come full Circle.” He concluded by announcing that Arca will close all of its accounts with Circle and actively discourage others from doing business with the firm. The incident with Arca has revealed simmering tensions within the crypto industry. As more blockchain-native companies seek traditional financing through IPOs or venture capital, they increasingly face pushback from early supporters who feel abandoned in the process. The Broader Debate: Crypto-Native vs. TradFi Dorman’s letter shines the spotlight on a growing divide between crypto-native firms and those aligning with legacy financial institutions. While going public offers Circle access to capital and credibility in traditional markets, it also comes with scrutiny, and, as Dorman's critique highlights, accusations of compromising the community-first values that helped the company rise. The reaction has prompted wider discussion on social media, with some voices in the crypto space supporting Dorman’s position and others defending Circle’s strategic decision-making. Some pointed out that large IPO allocations are often driven by investment banks and underwriters who prioritize firms with larger check sizes or strategic positioning.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 05:30:00

At the time of writing, the token is trading at $0.2729, reflecting a weekly decline of approximately 1.5%. However, zooming out reveals a broader uptrend, with TRX gaining nearly 12% over the past month, indicating growing market interest amid a backdrop of increased on-chain activity. An assessment of TRON’s network-level data suggests the blockchain is experiencing a surge in usage. According to a recent analysis published on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform by contributor Darkfost, daily transaction volume on the TRON network has crossed the 8 million mark, a notable increase from earlier this year. This growth in network transactions is considered a critical indicator of underlying demand and user engagement, which could influence market sentiment around the asset. Related Reading: TRON Activity Hits All-Time High, Is a TRX Price Breakout Coming? Transaction Volume and Address Activity Show Strong Network Engagement Darkfost noted that TRON’s monthly average for daily transactions has seen consistent growth, with recent data showing a roughly 2 million increase in average daily transactions since February. The network is now processing over 8 million transactions per day, marking a more than 30% rise over the past four months. Importantly, a large share of these transactions is occurring outside centralized exchanges, pointing to the growing utility of the blockchain for peer-to-peer transfers and decentralized application (dApp) usage. This shift away from centralized platforms may reflect increased interest in TRON’s native ecosystem services and its competitive yield offerings. As more users interact directly with the network, transaction-based liquidity grows, which can contribute to stronger economic activity across the TRON protocol. Darkfost emphasized that this trend of non-exchange transactions is a positive signal for the blockchain’s real-world usage and investor adoption. TRON Active Address Metrics Reach New Highs In a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Cryptoonchain highlighted that both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages for active addresses on the TRON network have hit their highest levels to date. This sustained rise in active wallet participation suggests a growing user base that is consistently interacting with the blockchain. While TRX’s price has not fully kept pace with the uptick in address activity, historical trends suggest that increased user engagement often precedes upward price movement.

In a clear vote of confidence, a wallet linked to blockchain software giant Consensys has moved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH, staking a significant portion through Liquid Collective. Meanwhile, staking queues are swelling to levels not seen in over a year, and spot Ethereum ETFs continue to record sustained inflows. These events indicate that Ethereum might be moving into a new stage of capital involvement—an era that has real potential to move both ETH and the wider altcoin market in new directions. Consensys-Linked Wallet Moves $320M, Signals Confidence In a significant on-chain development, a wallet associated with ConsenSys—one of the principal developers of Ethereum infrastructure and tools—made a $320 million ETH withdrawal from Galaxy Digital, a crypto investment and trading firm. Of that amount, $120 million was promptly staked through Liquid Collective, a collaborative liquid staking protocol. Something big is happening behind the scenes A wallet linked to Consensys just moved heavy: ▸ $320M in $ETH withdrawn from Galaxy ▸ $120M staked with Liquid Collective ▸ All routed through a fresh wallet (0x0b2) $ETH is getting attention This kind of shift tells you… pic.twitter.com/srslTrCICq — Cipher X (@Cipher2X) June 5, 2025 Every transaction was sent to a newly established wallet (0x0b2), indicating an intentional and well-thought-out plan to control the funds through a new wallet. The wallet could serve several purposes: enhanced security, better organization, or some combination of the two. But even without knowing the exact reason for this bit of infrastructure, it is possible to draw some overall conclusions about the funds and the people moving them. These conclusions have to do with what the reallocation of the funds seems to indicate. Such activity delivers a clear signal: the most important Ethereum players are doing more than just staying in the game—they’re doubling down by locking up ETH in staking. You don’t do that unless you’re pretty darn sure the network is secure, will scale, and is on a growth path. Staking Queue Hits Yearly High as Participation Grows Ethereum’s staking ecosystem is accelerating. This week, the number of ETH in the staking activation queue hit a 12-month high—340,000 ETH! And we have recent upgrades to Ethereum’s consensus layer to thank for that, as well as the growing adoption of liquid staking platforms. Most of all, though, we can credit a super-charged risk outlook for Ethereum staking and validators. All of this together spells a very bright future for Ethereum staking. #Ethereum momentum continues to grow with an increase in staking. There are currently over 340,277 $ETH in the queue for staking… the most there has been for more than 12 months! pic.twitter.com/5ROQE9lhrX — Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) June 5, 2025 The increasing queue shows an upsurge in the wish to take part in the network’s validator set, which is a main component of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism. With more ETH locked into staking, the supply of Ethereum that is available to the public decreases, and as such, the price of Ethereum might start to increase. The most recent staking activity on Ethereum has two very identifiable characteristics, and I think it’s crucial to understand both. First, unlike earlier waves of staking, which were dominated by individuals, this most recent wave is clearly an institutional one. Liquid Collective—used by the Consensys-linked wallet—is designed to provide enterprise-grade staking solutions. The retail and institutional staking demand is coalescing and creating an activity flywheel that could have significant effects—not just on ETH but also on the multitude of alternative coins built on the Ethereum network. Spot Ethereum ETFs Post 13 Days of Consecutive Inflows ETH’s institutional demand continues to show up in traditional markets. On June 4, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $56.98 million—marking the 13th consecutive day of positive flows. This continuous call for spot Ethereum ETFs comes from the recent U.S. approval of them, a landmark event that many saw as a key moment in Ethereum’s path to mainstream financial acceptance. At first, the inflows were modest next to those for Bitcoin ETFs, but the steady nature of the flows is starting to attract attention. On June 4, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $86.92 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only ETF to record a net inflow. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $56.98 million, marking 13 consecutive days of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjuIVU — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 5, 2025 Capital continues to flow into Ethereum funds even in the times of wider market instability, indicating long-term institutional confidence in Ethereum as a sustainable, regulated, asset class. This is even more true for Ethereum ETFs because they are an institutional-access vehicle to a regulated crypto asset. Ethereum’s recent advance—driven by significant wallet activity, a staking wave, and fresh ETF inflows—portrays something old and something new. Old: An asset maturing in a swiftly changing crypto landscape. New: The Ethereum altcoin ecosystem, which may be at center stage in altcoin land these days but is also moving rapidly in its own direction. Not just the core protocol but the very idea of Ethereum seems to be finding new ways to make its constituents—applications, tokens, and communities—hold value.

Bitcoin BTC dropped below $101,000 overnight before bouncing modestly, with DOGE and ADA among the worst hit, down over 6% each in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the largest crypto assets, shed over 5%. Data from CoinGlass shows that traders lost $988 million in liquidations — of which $888 million were long positions — indicative of a wipeout in bullish positions. Exchanges like Bybit and Binance saw the biggest hits, with Bybit alone accounting for nearly $354 million in liquidations. The liquidations largely hit major tokens, with bitcoin leading the pack at over $342 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. Ether ETH followed with $286 million, reflecting the sharp sell-offs across the broader market. Other tokens like Solana's SOL and Dogecoin DOGE saw $51 million and $27 million liquidated, respectively, as altcoin traders found themselves on the wrong side of the sudden downturn. XRP XRP wasn’t spared either, with $23 million in positions wiped out. The data also shows that high-leverage plays on memecoins, such as 1000PEPE, added to the volatility, as traders rushed to exit. Liquidations to the forced closure of a trader's leveraged position when they can no longer meet the margin requirements. This typically occurs when the price of the underlying asset moves against their position, causing them to lose a large portion, or all, of their initial investment. A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. The sell-off comes as Trump accused Musk of going “crazy” and threatened to terminate government contracts with his companies, while Musk lashed back by linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein’s files. The clash overshadowed what had been a mostly bullish trend for crypto markets in recent weeks, intensifying a profit-taking bout from the start of this week.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|Dogecoin|Liquidations|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|market analysis|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-06 05:32:26
45585166,https://nulltx.com/?p=150264,1749188090,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin Whales Return to Accumulation as On-Chain Activity Surges,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-whales-return-to-accumulation-as-on-chain-activity-surges/,"The on-chain Bitcoin metrics are showing once more that they are pleased with what they see—that hefty investors and little ones are both accumulating again in the face of a network that is waking up from its slumber and starting to do all sorts of things halt and signal traffic on the blockchain. After a slight divergence in the direction of the wallets, the balance making up the distribution cohort has fallen off, and it seems like the path of least resistance with Bitcoin is up, back over the $100,000 mark. The renewed on-chain interaction is feeding the engine of market optimism. Meanwhile, the institutional flows into spot bitcoin ETFs seem to have stabilized. BlackRock’s fund in particular has captured the attention of investors. Wallet Activity Signals Growing Market Confidence On-chain analytics data show us that all main wallet groups are in accumulation mode right now. The main event, though, is taking place at two very different ends of the spectrum: We have wallets that hold less than 1 BTC, and we have wallets that hold between 10 and 100 BTC. Both of these groups have hit an accumulation score of 1.0—basically the highest score you can get—and it indicates that they are both very widespread and also doing some pretty well-synchronized buying. This development shows a strong contrast with prior weeks, in which it seemed that bigger investors were cutting back on their exposure or remaining on the sidelines in response to the presence of market uncertainty. This renewed activity now seems to imply that these larger holders are either positioning for a potential breakout or, more probably, expressing confidence that Bitcoin’s current levels are a buying opportunity. What is especially remarkable is that accumulation is not confined to whales. Lesser retail holders are also amassing a considerable amount and showing very strong buying behavior. This, most often, is a signal that these small retail holders are long-term holders and is also a signal that grassroots adoption is taking place. On-Chain Activity Hits Multi-Month Highs Momentum is building in the network activity of Bitcoin, with multiple metrics registering their most robust performances in months. The most recent day for which we have data, May 29, saw over 556,830 new Bitcoin wallets created—no day since December 2, 2023, has been even close to that in terms of sheer amount. And the reason I find this most interesting is because (now, I’m going to speak more generally about all cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin) a growing number of wallet-holders is a very good sign for the overall health of a cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10–100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 – the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk — glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 Adding to the feel-good factor, June 2 saw 241,360 BTC move across the blockchain—the most coins sent since December 8, 2024. We typically don’t like to draw too many conclusions from single days, but this is a sizeable figure and could indicate that the Bitcoin network is seeing an uptick in user activity—whether trading, transferring, or otherwise moving assets around. Although price often rules market sentiment, these developments really show what direction the network is headed in. If they’re building a price bottom, then user and developer activity is much more desirable than just the network being used temporarily for price speculation. A close watch is being kept by investors because rising on-chain engagement, with prices being relatively stable, can often be a hint of an underlying build-up of momentum that precedes breakout movements—upward or downward. Institutional Flows Remain Focused on BlackRock’s ETF Even with the overall uncertainty of the traditional markets, the sector of Bitcoin ETFs available for direct investment is attracting a not-too-shabby amount of institutional inflows. As of June 4, the combined net inflow across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs was $86.92 million. Even ETF skeptics like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart have been warming up to the idea that, in 2023, the Bitcoin ETF sector has the look of a legitimate business. Interestingly, on the day, the only fund to see a net inflow was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Others either stayed even or experienced slight outflows. Continued preference for IBIT further consolidates BlackRock’s presence in the Bitcoin ETF space and also is a nice little shot of credibility for the digital asset sector. The net positive flows coming back—concentrated in just one issuer, it must be noted—signal that institutional investors aren’t pulling back entirely. They’re still in the market but seem to be doing a more refined, selective kind of allocation. And when you see selective allocation by big, smart money, it’s usually to what’s perceived as the safest and most credible holdings. With Bitcoin holding steady at just below $105,000, renewed wallet accumulation, record highs in on-chain activity, and an ETF flow that can only be described as resilient combine to present an intricate but optimistic look for the market. We are in a period right now, however, where the market has not yet broken out and up decisively. Consequently, it seems wise to stay vigilant, perhaps even bearish for now, until we do see that break. But from where we sit, the combination of these various factors likely means the market has a good shot at getting up and over, rather than back down under, the $100,000 line with Bitcoin. How long it takes and how close we edge up to the actual line figure before the breakout occurs is the present mystery. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45585193,https://nulltx.com/?p=150263,1749188246,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$13 Billion in Token Unlocks Incoming: Volatility Ahead for Crypto Markets,https://nulltx.com/13-billion-in-token-unlocks-incoming-volatility-ahead-for-crypto-markets/,"In the coming half year, a veritable tsunami of token unlocks is set to smash into the crypto space. The unlocks will make available for trading some $13 billion worth of new crypto assets, and they will do so in a most unimpressive—in fact, unwieldy—manner. Not only are the unlocks mostly concentrated by sector and month, but they are also, in many cases, concentrated in individual tokens. This uneven release schedule threatens to create upward volatility for the unlocked tokens and, in some cases, for the sectors they belong to. How the landscape is expected to shift between June and November 2025, from artificial intelligence to meme coins, and from Layer 2s to restaking protocols. October and July to See the Heaviest Release Pressure Even though token unlocks are slated for the latter half of 2025, two months stand out as potential market disruption points: October and July. October is the month that will unlock the most value—almost $4.8 billion—from two sectors very much in the spotlight: AI and DePIN. These two areas together are responsible for emissions with a total value of over $4.8 billion, the vast majority from just three projects: Worldcoin ($WLD), which is taking the lead with $1.29 billion; $TAO with $427 million; and $GRASS with $410 million. Not only are these three projects the main value unlocks that DePIN and AI have to offer in October, but they also exemplify the very type of overlap that could land the Bitcoin ecosystem in some hot water in the not-too-distant future. As for July, it is meme coins that dominate its events. The notables among them are $TRUMP , which will execute a mind-boggling unlock that will send a staggering $2.03 billion worth of tokens—which is 84.1% of its circulating supply—into the wild. Over six months, meme coin unlocks will total around $2.8 billion, so July’s not only part of the whole unlocking narrative but is, in fact, the bulk of it. We’re talking here about a hugely concentrated event risk in the memiest of meme assets, with 72.5% of emissions coming from a single token. Sector-Wide Emissions Show Risk Concentration When examining the releases from the many different sectors, it’s clear that the emissions from AI-related projects take the top spot at $3.42 billion. In a distant second are the meme tokens—something that I still have trouble getting my head around. Those are responsible for $2.8 billion in unlocks! Layer 2s, a generally positive development for the Ethereum network, follow in third with $1.27 billion. In the fields of Liquid Staking and Liquid Restaking, the amounts and emissions are significant. The Liquid Staking sector alone will see the unlocking of a massive $1.15 billion worth of tokens, with the peak amount unlocked coming in August. The leading token here is $ENA, with a whopping $484 million (22% of its supply) set to be unlocked. Following behind is $ETHFI, with $302 million worth of tokens set to be unlocked. What’s interesting is that $ETHFI also shows up in the Liquid Restaking category, which adds another $302 million to its tally and makes it one of the central players in both sectors. The Restaking segment, slated to release $665 million in value, is highly concentrated and peaks in November. $ETHFI, $EIGEN, and $LAYER comprise 76% of emissions here. At the same time, DePIN spews forth $1.38 billion in emissions and very much parallels AI projects, like $TAO and $GRASS—hence the heft of this month’s impact. As for RWA (real-world assets), that’s seeing just $304 million worth of emissions unlocked but in a far more balanced way. Not a single project’s emissions come close to exceeding the $100 million threshold. Over the next 6 months, $13B worth of tokens will hit the market. Not gradually. Not evenly. And definitely not quietly. • AI leads with a $3.4B wave in October • Memes spike big in July — one token dominates • Layer 2 heats up mid-year with $1.3B Here’s the full breakdown -… pic.twitter.com/6f79J71iwg — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) June 4, 2025 Smaller Sectors, Bigger Ratios Although they represent smaller amounts in absolute dollar terms, sectors such as SocialFi and Gaming expose unique risks due to their high unlock-to-circulating supply ratios. SocialFi plans to release $1.26 billion worth of tokens in a semi-annual format that peaks in June. The two principal tokens involved, $CHEEL and $CONX, represent 85% of the total and will release amounts that are over 14 times greater than their current circulating supply—$CHEEL’s case will be over 13 times (in $CHEEL’s case, over 13 times) their current circulating supplies. This token release is significant, especially considering that it could be or drive a supply- or price-related shock. Gaming unlocks are mild, with only $520 million set to be released. September should bring the largest pushes, starting with the $91 million emissions from $IMX, then a second place of $65.7 million from $APE, and followed up nicely by #BIGTIME with $29 million. Overall, it still feels like the sector is under low pressure compared with other sectors that are facing emission challenges and could lead to price-reducing headwinds. $13 billion in tokens are about to be unlocked. On top of that, they will be unlocked at noticeably concentrated intervals. So, as tolerance of the bear market further engulfs the crypto space, those most affected could be the institutional investors and protocols that have staked assets on the layer 1 and layer 2 protocols most prone to this tokenomics-induced downside. Watching this scenario unfold in slow motion is keeping us on the edge of our seats. Will it trigger a major market correction beforehand? Will the space just be a lot more muted post-unlock?

XRP’s ( XRP ) 24-hour volume rose nearly 80% to $2.97 billion, which can be attributed to the ongoing selloff. At the same time, derivatives data from CoinGlass shows a 70% jump in trading volume, while open interest fell by 3.7%. This shift often indicates traders exiting longer positions and rotating into short-term plays, especially during fast-moving markets. XRP’s latest decline is tied to that of the broader crypto market, which suffered a steep pullback on June 6. It shed nearly 5% as political tensions between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk rattled investor confidence. The clash erupted after Musk stepped down from the Department of Government Efficiency and criticized Trump’s new federal spending bill . In response, Trump revoked a NASA nomination tied to Musk’s circle and warned that his businesses could lose federal contracts. The tension grew further when Musk linked Trump to the Jeffrey Epstein files, calling for his impeachment. Trump fired back, saying Musk had “gone crazy.” Tesla shares dropped more than 14%, and Musk said SpaceX would retire its Dragon spacecraft.

Yet in the midst of all this, a record-setting development pace on the chain is apparently unstoppable. Inferring from the scant actual metrics, this means upcoming major infrastructure changes are cooking up something that should be good for all existing and future SOL holders. This week in the Solana ecosystem, things happened from ETF troubles to announcement of funds running to the billion-dollar level. Let’s break down the week, as that same long-term Solana bullishness we keep talking about seems to potentially be even more entrenched than it was last week. Solana SOL Price Falls, But Builders Stay Active This week, we saw a substantial adjustment in Solana’s base currency, the SOL token. The price of SOL took a dip, from $176 down to about $160. Those figures come from prices across various crypto exchanges. A drop like 9% in a single week is certainly noticeable, and it’s tempting to chalk it up to whatever’s latest and greatest in crypto news. But such a move tends to get most of its energy from the asset itself. Week in Solana: A $1 Billion Bet, Despite SEC’s ETF Questions SOL drops 9% as ETF hopes hit legal roadblocks! MetaMask goes Solana-native! $1B investment plan filed! Bonk enters gaming with a win-to-earn shooter! Let’s break down Solana’s week on-chain and off 1/6 pic.twitter.com/RCLjI4MpF6 — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 4, 2025 One signal, however, keeps flashing green: developer activity. Just in May, over 1.4 million new tokens were launched on Solana, and most of them, let’s be honest, were meme coins. Token launches are a kind of crude but effective way to stimulate development and leverage your community for an ecosystem where experimentation is taken to the next level. Most projects won’t go anywhere, but those that do could evolve into the next big thing. No one might care about meme tokens in a year’s time, but when a layer-1 blockchain attracts the sort of development that Solana has lately enjoyed, it’s not something to be scoffed at. The network’s fundamentals demonstrate resilience even during a price downtrend. Outstanding throughput paired with minimal fees renders Solana one of the most appealing chains for serious developers and casual creators. ETF Doubts Surface, But Institutional Interest Grows The largest tale from a regulatory perspective emerged from the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expressed unease over whether Solana-based staking products could be legally set up as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. The agency’s qualms pertain to the mechanics of staking SOL and whether they ought to satisfy the legal parameters for ETF eligibility under U.S. securities law. The cloud of uncertainty hanging over Solana today poses a potential obstacle to the blockchain’s future attractiveness for traditional institutions. Many of these entities prefer regulated financial products—such as ETFs—in order to obtain exposure to digital assets. Solana being SOS’d in by the SEC was not a favorable development for anyone hoping to see the blockchain keep pace with (or better yet, precede) Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of ETF interest. However, institutional money continues to pour into the Solana ecosystem, and this is resilient to any kind of official opposition. A Canadian firm by the name of SOL Strategies has plans on the table to raise no less than $1 billion, and their entire fund is committed to Solana-based investments. Meanwhile, a firm called Classover Holdings is trying to raise a cool $500 million, and 80% of that capital is designated to be directly used for purchasing and holding SOL in their treasury. Some large-scale investors seem to be interpreting these announcements as something other than a harbinger of regulatory trouble. They’re saying: Long-term bet on Solana. Technical backbone plus economic design equals something with potential. MetaMask Solana Integration and BONK Gaming Expansion This week also brought some noteworthy developments in adoption and ecosystems, especially in the areas of accessibility and consumer engagement. One of the most widely used crypto wallets, MetaMask, has officially launched support for the Solana network. This is available via its browser extension, with mobile compatibility expected soon. This move could significantly expand the number of users interacting with Solana-based dApps and tokens. This is especially true for those already using MetaMask on other blockchains like Ethereum or Polygon. From the gaming and cultural side of things, speculators can forget BONK as a trading vehicle. The project launched Bonk Arena , a browser-based first-person shooter where players earn BONK tokens and, presumably, have a great time doing it. Bonk Arena is in the early access stage (you can play on the official site by connecting your Solana wallet), and that’s fitting, considering that entertainment is the main utility of this meme-ified currency. The launch of the game highlights the speedy development of Solana’s ecosystem aimed at consumers. This part of the ecosystem, which is concerned with providing experiences to users, is where Solana the blockchain meets Solana the foundation. And what kinds of experiences are being provided? Ones that merge games, money, and memes. To summarize, even though Solana’s market performance and regulatory clarity took a hit this week, the network received some very lucrative and promising signals of long-term commitment from builders, users, and deep-pocket investors. The network’s ability to grow in parallel with this uncertainty could just as easily place it as a leader in the next cycle of Web3 expansion. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Solano said it was time for a leaner, faster “org” to take the reins. Solano stated that the ApeCoin DAO was born in a different era and may have just run its course. He added that the DAO started with promise but quickly spiraled into gridlock, governance theater, vanity proposals, and low-impact noise. Too many resources went to vanity proposals and low-impact initiatives. According to Yuga Labs boss, the DAO had become misaligned with the future his company aimed to build, although it was instrumental in bootstrapping ApeCoin’s early momentum. He claimed that the next chapter demanded sharper focus, faster execution, and an operating model that backed only the highest-caliber projects. Solano says the AIP clears the ‘cruft’ and installs a professional operation Since returning as CEO, everything I've worked on has aimed at one thing: getting back to the spirit and velocity of year one, when @gordongoner and I were building Yuga from scratch. We've made huge progress. But the biggest unlock would be in getting ApeCoin rowing in the… — Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) June 5, 2025 Solano claimed that the proposal cleared the cruft and installed a professional operation to direct capital with conviction and strategic intent. Yuga Labs’ co-founder Wylie Aronow said he had no words for how annoyed he was with his partner Greg for making him google the word ‘cruft’ on a Sunday but added that he supported the “f**k out of this idea.” Solano explained that the AIP authorized the orderly transition of assets and responsibilities to the new ApeCo entity established by Yuga Labs. ApeCo’s mission was to supercharge the APE ecosystem by supporting high-quality builders and reinforcing three core pillars: ApeChain, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Otherside. According to the Yuga Labs CEO, the redeeming aspect of the DAO was that it funded builders. He pointed out that Yuga still believed in that mission, but the bar on what was worth funding was going way up. The new model must focus on quality, impact, and alignment with the core of what ApeCoin was meant to power. “The DAO served its purpose, but the game has changed…We’re no longer in the experimental phase. We’re building the best chain in crypto and expanding the most iconic brand in NFTs. ApeCoin should be the economic engine for that future.” – Greg Solano , CEO at Yuga Labs Yuga Labs’s Solano also said everything he had worked on since returning as CEO aimed at one thing: getting back to the spirit and velocity of year one when he and Aronow were building Yuga from scratch. He added that the duo had made huge progress, but the biggest unlock would be getting ApeCoin rowing in the right direction. Makash believes sunsetting the DAO for ApeCo is wise Mak Makash, the founder of the Raccoon Gin Ape project and the main initiator of AiP 495, said he had been building with ApeCoin and ApeChain from the trenches–from IRL integrations to premium products that bridged Web2 and Web3. He added that sunsetting the DAO in favor of ApeCo was not the end but the maturation of what the Ape community dreamed ApeCoin could become. Makash believes this AIP was the long-overdue evolution the ecosystem needed, adding that it brought clarity, speed, and quality over chaos. He also said the ApeChain, BAYC, and Otherside Trinity deserved complete focus since builders would finally have a structure that supported innovation at pace, with accountability and purpose. Makash claimed that he fully supported this shift and was ready to start building under ApeCo. Solano stressed that the transition would unleash faster product development and capital deployment, eliminate governance gridlock that held real builders back, and reignite belief in the long-term utility and cultural significance of ApeCoin. He also said it would make ApeChain the most culturally relevant chain in crypto. The Yuga Labs CEO disclosed that killing the ApeCoin DAO enabled experimentation at the cost of quality and encouraged governance participation but became easy to game. He also said it funded some good builders but many bad ones, and it was never optimized for long-term product development or market agility.

New evidence has now emerged, supporting those claims. On Thursday, a trader paid a premium of over $2 million to purchase a total of 61,000 contracts of June-end expiry ether call options at strikes $3,200 and $3,400, according to data source crypto options exchange Deribit. Theoretically, the $3,200 call is a bet that ether's price will rise from the current $2,460 to over $3,200 by the end of the month. The purchase of the $3,400 call indicates expectations for a move above that level. In other words, the trader anticipates a price surge of over 30% in three weeks. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and pays a premium for the asymmetric upside exposure. The premium paid, in this case, $2 million, is the maximum amount the buyer stands to lose in case the market doesn't rise as expected. Stars align for bulls The bullish flow is consistent with the renewed optimism among some analysts about ether's price prospects. According to Youwei Yang, Ph.D., chief economist at BIT Mining, protocol upgrades, institutional moves, and anticipation around new financial products have all come together to restore investor confidence in ether. Ether's parent blockchain, Ethereum, recently implemented the Pectra upgrade to enhance scalability, validator flexibility, and user experience, introducing key features like EIP-7702 to enable regular wallets to leverage smart contract capabilities. ""The Pectra upgrade , which went live on May 7, has been a key turning point. By raising the validator cap from 32 to 2,048 ETH and doubling blob throughput, Ethereum took a major step forward in both staking efficiency and Layer-2 scalability,"" Yang said in an email to CoinDesk. ""It’s a clear signal that the network is serious about scaling and improving its core infrastructure. That’s the kind of technical progress that brings not just developers, but also users and capital, back into the ecosystem,"" Yang added. Yang cited SharpLink Gaming’s announcement that it would move $425 million into Ethereum as a treasury reserve asbold endorsement of ether as the corporate Treasury asset. ""It reminds us of the early wave of Bitcoin treasury adoption by corporates, and it could be just the beginning of something similar for ETH,"" Yang noted. Lastly, speaking of institutional adoption, speculation has been circulating that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot ether ETF with a staking mechanism, opening doors for institutions to take exposure to both the price and the staking yield, a feature missing in BTC ETFs.

They earned a reward of 3.151 BTC, a windfall presently worth over $330,000. These underdog events shine a light on the resilient decentralization of the Bitcoin network, even if some may now use that phrase as a euphemism for its security flaws. In the early morning hours, a rare event took place that caught the crypto community’s eye and kicked off discussions about whether solo mining is a feasible option these days, given that the mining landscape seems dominated by industrial-scale mining operations. A One-in-a-Million Moment The block, officially mined at 4:48:18 a.m. UTC, was verified as valid and included in the Bitcoin blockchain. The total reward of 3.151 BTC consisted of the standard extbf{3.125 BTC block subsidy}, plus an additional extbf{0.026 BTC in transaction fees} amounting to roughly $2,761. The block itself measured 1.66 megabytes in size and included a standard assortment of transactions. This achievement was accomplished by a solo miner even while the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate was over 600 exahashes per second. Most of the computational work that was assembled from the many mining operations that were running at that time was directed towards solving the puzzles that, when solved, would produce valid Bitcoin blocks. The odds of a single miner successfully completing one of those puzzles and finding a valid block were, of course, exceedingly low. **Bitcoin Miner Hits the Jackpot!** Solo CK mined block 899,826 on June 5, 2025, scoring 3.151 BTC (~$330,386)! Here's the breakdown: • Mined at 4:48:18 a.m. UTC • Reward: 3.125 BTC subsidy + 0.026 BTC fees ($2,761) • Block size: 1.66 MB pic.twitter.com/vJuQoh4YAW — Ahmed Osman (@Ahmedot2Osman) June 5, 2025 Though the exact hardware used by the miner remains unspecified, the consensus among experts is that the conditions—successful mining, that is—would necessitate powerful rigs like the Antminer S21 or WhatsMiner M60, both well-regarded for not just their efficiency, but their sheer output of hash power. Even so, elite equipment alone doesn’t tip the scales toward success; the miner has to have a significant chunk of the global hasrate under his influence. Why Solo Mining Is Rare — and Risky In the domain of Bitcoin mining, the majority of players opt to associate themselves with mining pools, for instance, F2Pool, AntPool, or ViaBTC. These mining assemble the computational might of thousands of miners, dishing out smaller, consistent rewards instead of the solitary, do-or-die nature of mining all by oneself. Mining alone means doing everything a miner must do to find a block and then submitting that block to the network. If a solo miner finds a block, the reward is theirs and theirs alone. Obviously, this is a tremendous payday. And for us to even talk about it here, it must happen in the real world. So, let’s look at what it takes to mine alone, and after that, we’ll consider what it means to have a real-life payday scenario. These infrequent solo victories do happen, though, as demonstrated by the most recent case of a miner using Solo CK, a known solo mining pool that still preserves the spirit of decentralized mining by enabling individuals to point their hardware toward block discovery without profit sharing. A Testament to Bitcoin’s Decentralization Even though industrial mining farms and large, centralized pools of hashing power are on the rise, the occasional story of a successful solo Bitcoin miner is a powerful reminder that the Bitcoin network’s decentralized architecture is alive and well. This is a story of a successful solo Bitcoin miner. By “successful,” I mean this individual consistently brings in Bitcoin rewards (“mined” a few himself, but has “earned” quite a few more through participating in the Bitcoin network). By “network,” I mean the assemblage of many computers all over the planet, doing many computations. By “decentralized architecture,” I mean a system of many nodes by which no one node, or set of nodes, can control the whole system. The miner’s triumph has unleashed torrents of excitement and admiration throughout online spaces. It also resurrects a vital discussion: even in a massively parallel, technologically state-of-the-art mining world, Bitcoin remains a theoretically level playing field. It is yet to be seen whether more people will be encouraged to take a stab at solo mining. But this moment serves as evidence that the solo mining dream is not dead. It’s just incredibly hard. The global mining landscape is evolving rapidly. This makes it all the more crucial to illuminate why Bitcoin inspires and captivates people all around the world. It’s not simply about the cash that’s involved. It’s about the very ethos of this network: permissionless participation and decentralized opportunity.

ETH/BTC is a great cryptocurrency spread for a crypto trader to spot relative performance, provide a direction for which crypto to choose, and track the appetite for altcoins. ETH/BTC rising helped altcoin bull runs in the past cycle - something that many crypto traders have been awaiting and is yet to materialize again. By Elior Manier Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) had a rough beginning of 2025 - failing to reach new all-time highs, while Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) smashed through its own ATH multiple times. Solana ( SOL-USD ), providing a cheaper alternative to ETH services, also held stronger than the Ether throughout the latter part of 2024 and beginning 2025. ETH performance is key to the overall crypto market performance; the past Altcoin cycles have always been led by ETH performance over BTC. ETH/BTC is a great cryptocurrency spread for a crypto trader to spot relative performance, provide a direction for which crypto to choose, and track the appetite for altcoins. Through this crypto market update, you will see how ETH/BTC rising helped altcoin bull runs in the past cycle, something that many crypto traders have been awaiting and is yet to materialize again. ETH/BTC and its Correlation to total Market Performance ETH/BTC and Total Crypto Market Cap, 2017 to End 2021 (Source: TradingView) This 2017-2021 chart of ETH/BTC contains essential information about understanding the crypto market. Through 1 and 2, we observe how the first bull run in ETH and ETH/BTC led to the 2017 total crypto market bull run - taking the market cap from $20-30B average to highs of $620B in November 2017. Number 3 on the chart shows how a drop in ETH/BTC leads to a significant cooldown of the crypto market, going back towards a total market cap between $100 and $250B from 2018 to the end of 2020. From end-2020 to the end of 2021, number 4 shows the same correlation of ETH/BTC and crypto markets rallying. This Covid-era bull run introduced crypto for an ever-bigger number of investors, and led to the flurry of altcoins and cryptocurrency projects such as Doge, Avax, Solana. The crypto market cap went from $300B to $2.86T, and this level only got reached again in November 2024. Finally, number 5 shows similarly to number 3 how the drop in market cap correlates with a drop in the ETH/BTC spread. ETH/BTC from 2020 to Today ETH/BTC and Bitcoin, 2020 to June 5, 2025 (Source: TradingView) We take a closer look at the 2021 Bull Run and how the December 2021 top in ETH/BTC led again a significant correction in the crypto market. 2023 was all about Bitcoin Dominance as its rally from $14,475 to its record highs of $112,030 left Ethereum and all other altcoins lagging. We are seeing a breakout from the descent that started at the same level as the 2020 ETH/BTC bullish breakout - we will see if the spread continues upward and if it generates another bull run for altcoins. ETH Daily Chart ETH Daily Chart, June 5, 2025 (Source: TradingView) ETH had a consequent rally after a significant drop between $4,000 highs in December 2024 to $1,363 lows in April 2025. Prices are consolidating between $2,300 and $2,600. The key is to see if Bitcoin prices that are also stagnating above the $100,000 Mark leads to rallies in other cryptos as the same phenomenon happened in past bull cycles.

At first glance, this spike looks like a return to better days for DeFi. But if you look under the hood, you find another engine powering this move — a single mid-cap token, ZKJ, which has added around 50% of the total DEX volume. ZKJ Outpaces Peers by 68x — But Why? Grasping the scale of DEX dominance by ZKJ takes some doing. Consider this: ZKJ itself ranks only about #106 by market cap. That’s an ordinary mid-cap position. And yet, its daily volume sits at a figure close to $6.8 billion. An absolutely astonishing amount when you compare it to other tokens with a similar market cap. For instance, Apecoin (APE), a much-hosted token that ranks close to a similar market cap as ZKJ, sees about $100 million in daily volume. Of that, roughly 90% comes from centralized exchanges. Those figures don’t come close to the amount of trading volume ZKJ pulls in from its decentralized exchange. By contrast, ZKJ’s DEX volume is 68 times that of APE, an incredible discrepancy that raises uncomfortable questions. We may find those answers in a new feature offered by Binance: Binance Alpha 2.0. Binance Alpha 2.0 offers users the chance to trade tokens listed on DEXs straight through the Binance CEX interface, even when those very same tokens exist nowhere on Binance itself in any official capacity. This accounting system effectively stitches together the usability of a centralized exchange with the liquidity of a decentralized one, all while users nicely nestle inside the Binance UI they’ve grown attached to. This new trading system is responsible for up to 80% of ZKJ’s trading in the last 24 hours. Much of the recent surge in trading this token has seen can be accounted for by this mechanism. And that is not entirely a good thing. 1/ The daily DEX Volume on BNB has increased 7 times compared to early May, from approximately $2B to $14B. However, close to 50% of the volume comes from ZKJ Pairs, the token by @PolyhedraZK . 2/ For context, ZKJ is a mid-cap token that ranked at 106. Their 24H volume is… pic.twitter.com/uEaEPV7tIt — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) June 4, 2025 Suspicious Patterns Emerge: Wash Trading or Farming? Researchers have flagged a troublesome pattern associated with Binance Alpha 2.0. More than 150 wallets that exhibit nearly identical trading characteristics when it comes to ZKJ have been identified. What’s more, the analysis of blockchain data shows these wallets also exhibit the following traits: Almost identical total amount of trading Nearly the same amount of buying and selling Almost the same number of trades Almost the same average size of the trade These similarities are causing worries about wash trading, a practice in which traders (or bots) quickly buy and sell the same asset to boost volume and make it seem like there’s demand — a behavior that’s often linked to point farming or platform incentive schemes. Binance has accepted that bot activity exists within the Alpha 2.0 framework, which is linked to a points farming program. The platform has stated that it is monitoring this activity and doing what it can to minimize it. Nonetheless, the trading patterns that these wallets exhibit with uncanny regularity have led many people to believe that the trading volume associated with ZKJ is not generated in an organic way. The behavior of the execution addresses used for these trades is even more puzzling. Binance, acting as the proxy for DEX trades through Alpha 2.0, should be consolidating activity. But the execution addresses show that the ZKJ trade volume is evenly distributed, which is not at all what you’d expect with user-driven activity. This suggests that either an orchestrated strategy or an automated process is responsible for generating the volume. A Question of Transparency and Metrics Integrity The ZKJ episode brings into focus a much larger problem that DeFi and hybrid exchange platforms are forced to confront. They have to find a reliable way to tell real market interest from fake, artificially generated metrics. Even massive volume figures can no longer be automatically trusted. There are a few well-known mechanisms and possibly a handful of bots doing the work to drive up the numbers. And the industry learns once again that volume alone doesn’t tell the full story. This is a cautionary tale for investors. Although the emergence of Alpha 2.0 and cross-platform trading brings with it the promise of exciting new tools and efficiencies, it also gives us reasons to suspect that those tools and efficiencies are being gamed. So why be wary? Because these developments threaten to undermine the appearance of genuine liquidity in the capital markets. Binance is still under scrutiny, and so is ZKJ; meanwhile, the industry is waiting to find out more and, quite possibly, some stricter safeguards to ensure that the next surge in billion-dollar volumes really is based on user activity — as opposed to wallets that have been programmed to look, in almost every way that counts, like real users.

Recent Shocking Predictions from Experts,https://timestabloid.com/will-xrp-dominate-market-in-2025-recent-shocking-predictions-from-experts/,"Several cryptocurrency analysts have recently reignited the conversation surrounding XRP’s future, releasing price forecasts that vary from optimistic to highly speculative. One such analyst, known by the name CryptoBilbuwoo0, referenced the Fibonacci retracement model to support the view that XRP is approaching a major upward shift. He highlighted the asset’s historical price movement, recalling its surge above $ 3.30, which brought it close to its all-time high, as the basis for setting a series of ambitious targets. According to his projections, XRP may see price levels of $4.29 and $6.78 in a relatively conservative scenario. However, he also proposed extreme possibilities, with the token potentially reaching prices in the $26.60 to $28.80 range, putting it close to the $27 target that another prominent analyst has been predicting for years. More strikingly, he suggests estimates extending to $589 and even $1,458.30, raising concerns over the feasibility of such projections under current market dynamics. More Optimistic XRP Predictions In a similar tone, crypto influencer JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) referred to a rumor connecting XRP’s price to a proposed legislative initiative known as the GENIUS Stablecoin Act . The speculation implied that this development could propel the asset to $250. While he did not reveal the reason behind this prediction, some in the community believe it may have ties to RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin. At this stage, however, these connections are based solely on unverified claims. Adding to the chorus of optimistic voices, analyst BarriC (@B_arri_C) stated that XRP is only at the beginning of a dramatic rise, arguing that a $10 valuation is just the early stage of a longer-term upward trend, with $1,000 as the ultimate target. $XRP to $10 is just the beginning of the explosive price action we will see for #XRP $XRP to $1,000 is where $XRP is heading in the near future — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 3, 2025 Although many detractors often cite market cap concerns, well-known experts with good track records are convinced that the digital asset will hit the $1,000 target .

He believes XRP will dominate 2025, and shared a chart showing a massive green candle suggesting a major price rally. Many experts believe the digital asset will experience a notable price rally this year. While some see targets of $100 or more as impossible, others have debunked market cap concerns and expect massive growth as more money flows into the XRP ecosystem and Ripple’s global partnerships expand.

This warning came in the department’s latest foreign-exchange report to Congress, released on Thursday. The Treasury said the BOJ should respond to what’s happening inside Japan’s economy—mainly growth and inflation—and use that to guide rate hikes. They said this would “support a normalization of the yen’s weakness against the dollar and a much-needed structural rebalancing of bilateral trade.” That means Washington wants a stronger yen to cut the trade deficit and level the playing field for American exporters. Treasury points at pension funds and BOJ’s slow pace Besides interest rates, the Treasury also called out Japan’s massive pension funds, saying they shouldn’t invest abroad to try and affect the exchange rate. “Treasury also stresses that government investment vehicles, such as large public pension funds, should invest abroad for risk-adjusted return and diversification purposes, and not to target the exchange rate for competitive purposes,” the report said. The US has rarely made this kind of direct comment on Japan’s monetary policy, but the weak yen has stayed on Washington’s radar for years. It gives Japanese exporters an advantage. Ultra-low interest rates, according to US officials, are part of what’s been keeping the yen stuck at depressed levels. When asked about the US remarks on Friday, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said the government does not interfere with the BOJ’s decisions. “Based on this, we would like to refrain from making comments (on what was pointed out in the report),” Kato said during his regular press briefing. On pension funds, he added it’s “natural” that they manage their portfolios based on their own goals. While the Treasury stopped short of naming any country a currency manipulator in 2024, it did say it would continue monitoring Japan along with China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland. These countries now face more attention from the US for how they manage foreign exchange policies. BOJ lags on rate hikes as trump threatens bigger retaliation The BOJ officially ended its ultra-loose stimulus last year and finally raised its short-term interest rate to 0.5% in January. That came after signs that Japan might hit its 2% inflation goal. But higher US tariffs have started to weigh on growth, and the BOJ cut its economic forecast in May. Even with that early hike, the BOJ has held off on further moves, making markets think the yen will stay weak. A Reuters poll taken between May 7 and 13 showed most economists don’t expect another hike until late 2024, if it even happens at all. Some believe the BOJ may take action by year-end, but that’s far from guaranteed. The Treasury’s latest report is the first full foreign exchange review since Donald Trump returned to the White House. While the report didn’t accuse any country of outright manipulation, it did put China on blast for what it called “its lack of transparency.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement, “The Trump Administration has put our trading partners on notice that macroeconomic policies that incentivize an unbalanced trading relationship with the United States will no longer be accepted.” Scott added that Washington will “continue to strengthen our analysis of currency practices and increase the consequences of any manipulation designation.” During his first term, Trump often went after countries like China and Japan for what he saw as unfair trade practices driven by undervalued currencies. So far, though, his approach has mostly been through tariffs. Even though the Biden administration had seven countries on the monitoring list back in its final November report, Trump’s Treasury has now added Ireland and Switzerland, expanding the group to nine. Under a law passed in 2015, any country that meets two out of three benchmarks related to trade and currency gets flagged for monitoring. That’s how Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland all landed on the current list. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A lot of traders in the comment section seemed to agree with his sentiment and stated that the decision was long overdue. “People want to kill the ApeCoin DAO. This AIP proposes just that. It’s time for a leaner, faster org to take the reins,” said Solano in his post. On June 5 around midnight, the Yuga Labs CEO launched a proposal on the ApeCoin forum titled “Sunsetting the DAO and Launching ApeCo — A New Operating Model for ApeCoin,” aimed at formally dissolving the ecosystem’s DAO. So far, the proposal has garnered 130 votes from the community. “ApeCoin DAO was a bold experiment, but one born of a different era. What started with promise has devolved into sluggish, noisy, and often unserious governance theater. Too many resources have gone to vanity proposals and low-impact initiatives,” wrote Solano in his proposal. Once the DAO is dissolved, Solano claimed the NFT -led project plans to establish a new entity called ApeCo.

First established in March 2022, ApeCoin DAO serves as a decentralized autonomous organization to govern ApeCoin, the Ethereum ( ETH )-based utility and governance token associated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem. The DAO enabled APE holders to vote on proposals affecting the ecosystem, including funding decisions and strategic directions. However, the community began criticizing the DAO for inefficiencies and funding low-impact initiatives. As previously reported by crypto.news, Yuga Labs recently off-loaded its staple NFT brands such as CryptoPunks, Moonbirds, and others.

During his appearance at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on 5 June, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed the company is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins as a potential tool for international money movement. Stablecoins offer “a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value,” describing the technology as “super interesting” for global businesses. According to Khosrowshahi, while opinions on Bitcoin vary, stablecoins stand out for their utility in payments. “Especially for global companies that are moving money around globally, stablecoin is quite promising,” he added. Stablecoins are digital tokens engineered to mirror the value of traditional currencies, most often the US dollar. Anchored by reserves such as cash or short-term government bonds, they blend the rapid settlement and borderless nature of crypto with the trust and stability of fiat.

As previously reported by crypto.news, Fireblocks’ 2025 “State of Stablecoins” survey found that 90% of the surveyed financial institutions were actively integrating stablecoins into their systems. These include major banks, payment processors, and fintech platforms, many of which now process millions of stablecoin transactions each month. Speed was cited as the top advantage by nearly half the respondents, with cost savings and liquidity also ranking high on the list of strategic benefits driving adoption. Besides Uber, other major companies have also shown interest recently. Stripe’s co-founder John Collison revealed in May that the company has been in early discussions with banks on stablecoin integration. Much of the momentum behind stablecoins can be traced to a global shift toward clearer, more supportive policy frameworks. For instance, in the U.S., lawmakers introduced the bipartisan GENIUS Act , establishing a comprehensive framework for payment stablecoins by outlining various requirements for stablecoin issuers. Elsewhere, in Europe, the rollout of MiCA has set a new standard for how digital assets are treated, giving companies firmer ground to build on. At the same time, regulatory developments have also been observed across Asia, in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong , Singapore , and Pakistan , among others. Read more: Why is crypto down today?

Markets are now poised for a further fall below longer-term levels if current support levels break down. However, the decline slowed during early trading in Asia on Friday morning, with a minor recovery to $3.3 trillion. Donald vs Elon The sharp decline appears to have been driven by a spat between US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who said the former’s tariffs “will cause a recession in the second half of this year,” and “Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!” on June 5. As the war of words on each of their respective social media networks escalated, and the bromance collapsed, Musk also said : “In light of the President’s statement about the cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.” In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 For more than a week, Elon Musk has been trashing Trump’s signature piece of legislation, a spending bill called One Big Beautiful Bill. “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,” said Trump on Truth Social. However, the clearly riled billionaire Tesla CEO didn’t stop there, stating on X that it was “time to drop the really big bomb: Donald Trump is in the Epstein files.” “That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” BREAKING: President Trump’s former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon calls for Elon Musk to be deported, per NY Times. https://t.co/Q82Pbhzppt — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 5, 2025 The pair started to cool off late on Thursday with Musk’s admissions that it may be time to reconcile. $1B in Liquidations There has been almost $1 billion in crypto liquidations over the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass. Around 228,000 traders were wrecked, almost 90% of them in BTC long positions, and the total liquidations were around $988 million, it noted. However, analysts had predicted that a leverage flushout was overdue, with open interest on Bitcoin futures markets hitting all-time highs recently. Bitcoin lost almost $5,000 in a matter of hours, falling to a 4-week low just below $101,000 in late trading on Thursday. However, it found support there and recovered marginally to reach $102,800 during Asian trading on Friday. Analyst “CrypNuevo” said that a quick bounce from this level was unlikely and more consolidation could occur, unless the sell-off accelerates. $BTC update: Plan is playing out so far! Let’s see if this psychological support ($100k) can hold. A quick bounce is unlikely imo. I’d expect that, at best, a small consolidation in this area before any interesting move could be the case – unless if we break below it fast. https://t.co/iWql8N6SW7 pic.twitter.com/CIb1KpJt8i — CrypNuevo (@CrypNuevo) June 5, 2025 The post Crypto Markets See Red as Trump-Musk Bromance Ends in Flames appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|featured1|Donald Trump|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-06 06:04:48

In a civil forfeiture complaint filed Thursday in the District Court for the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice alleged that North Korean operatives obtained jobs at blockchain firms and other tech companies using stolen or forged identities. The workers were paid in crypto, often stablecoins such as USDC and USDT , and used complex laundering tactics to mask the funds’ origin before sending the money back to the North Korean state. DOJ Targets North Korea Digital Laundering Network Authorities said the operation aimed to bypass U.S sanctions. It also sought to generate revenue for North Korea’s weapons program. The scheme was linked to Sim Hyon Sop, a representative of North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank. He was previously indicted in April 2023 for his role in similar activities. Department Files Civil Forfeiture Complaint Against Over $7.74M Laundered on Behalf of the North Korean Government : https://t.co/T6nh2ETMYY pic.twitter.com/o23HY6C6Zw — U.S. Department of Justice (@TheJusticeDept) June 5, 2025 Sim allegedly collaborated with Kim Sang Man, who serves as CEO of Chinyong. Chinyong is a state-linked IT firm operating under North Korea’s Ministry of Defense. To conceal the funds, the workers used several tactics. They allegedly opened fake accounts, split transactions into smaller amount and used token-swapping techniques. In addition, they purchased NFTs as a store of value. According to the Justice Department, the funds moved through a web of platforms and intermediaries. Eventually, the money was routed back to the North Korean government. “This forfeiture action highlights, once again, the North Korean government’s exploitation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to fund its illicit priorities,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s Criminal Division. He added that the department would continue using legal tools to disrupt financial lifelines supporting the regime. FBI Warns of North Korean IT Fraud Using Stolen American Identities Officials from the FBI said the investigation uncovered a widespread effort to defraud US businesses by hiring North Korean workers posing as remote freelancers using stolen American identities. Assistant director Roman Rozhavsky called it a sophisticated threat and urged companies to closely examine their remote hiring practices. Thursday’s complaint is part of a wider enforcement campaign that began in 2024 under the Department’s DPRK RevGen initiative. This effort has focused on both North Korean operatives and the US-based enablers who support them. So far, authorities have taken action against domestic facilitators, crypto traders, and schemes involving data theft by North Korean IT workers. The FBI’s Virtual Assets Unit and its Chicago Field Office led the investigation. They were supported by cybercrime prosecutors and national security attorneys. According to officials, the operation reflects an ongoing strategy to cut North Korea off from the global financial system. Moreover, it aims to stop the regime from using cryptocurrency to evade US sanctions.

Price depreciation and active sell-offs both played a role. Interestingly, financial advisers slightly increased their holdings, but overall sentiment shifted toward corporate treasury adoption of Bitcoin. Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT saw record outflows in late May, while treasury-focused firms like Strategy ramped up accumulation. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group filed for a new Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with Crypto.com as custodian, but raised concerns over a clause allowing affiliated parties to front-run trades. In Romania, the postal service installed its first Bitcoin ATM. Despite positive momentum, only 4% of the global population owns Bitcoin, which means that there is still a lot of room for the crypto king to grow. Bitcoin ETF Activity Dips Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by institutional investors experienced the first quarterly decline since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. A recent report from CoinShares revealed that institutional exposure to Bitcoin fell to $21.2 billion in Q1 of 2025, down from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024. This is a 23% drop. Institutions decreased their Bitcoin exposure (Source: CoinShares ) While the majority of this decrease was attributed to an 11% decline in Bitcoin's price over the period, the report also revealed that many investors actively reduced their holdings. This indicates a combination of valuation loss and deliberate selling. Interestingly, financial advisers emerged as an exception by modestly increasing their Bitcoin ETF holdings during the quarter. The broader trend, however, pointed to a shift away from ETF-driven strategies toward corporate-level adoption of Bitcoin for treasury reserves. This transition means that there is a growing preference for long-term savings and value preservation over short-term trading opportunities. Financial advisers increased their Bitcoin holdings in Q1 2025 (Source: CoinShares ) This changing investment behavior was noticed with major developments in Q2 as well. On May 30, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded its largest single-day outflow to date, with over $430 million withdrawn after a streak of 31 consecutive days of inflows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin treasury companies increased their holdings considerably. CoinShares data indicates that these companies held over 1.98 million BTC by the end of Q1, an 18.6% increase year-to-date. Strategy, the leading corporate holder, acquired 15,355 BTC on April 28 alone and has been consistently buying in 17 of the past 20 weeks through June 2025, according to SaylorTracker . ETF flows remained volatile during the first half of the year, and were heavily influenced by shifting macroeconomic narratives. While many institutional players looked for safety in US government bonds due to uncertain market conditions, rising bond yields suggest that confidence in these traditional havens may be diminishing. Analysts now speculate that Bitcoin's long-term growth may be fueled more by declining demand for US bonds than by continued inflows into ETFs. Trump’s Truth Social Files for Bitcoin ETF Despite these findings from CoinShares, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company majority-owned by US President Donald Trump and parent firm of the Truth Social platform, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF. The proposed product is called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, and was formally introduced through an initial registration statement on Form S-1 filed on June 5. According to the company’s filing, the ETF will primarily hold Bitcoin through a custodian and is designed to reflect the performance of the cryptocurrency’s market price. Announcement from TMTG This move follows a separate submission by NYSE Arca, which proposed listing the ETF on its exchange on behalf of Yorkville America Digital, a crypto asset manager and partner of TMTG. The product, if approved, will enter the very competitive landscape of US-based Bitcoin ETFs seeking to capture institutional and retail investor interest in digital assets. One key structural feature of the proposed ETF is its partnership with Crypto.com , which is set to serve as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider for the trust. The filing shared that Crypto.com agreed to offer certain services exclusively to the ETF’s trust, although specific management and transaction fees for the fund have not been revealed yet. The filing also contains a clause that raises eyebrows: it permits the ETF sponsor and related parties to potentially front-run the fund’s Bitcoin transactions. While such language is typically softened or accompanied by conflict-of-interest mitigation in other filings, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF explicitly warns prospective shareholders that affiliated entities may take positions in Bitcoin that are ahead of or opposite to those of the fund, which could negatively impact the ETF’s performance. Additionally, the filing confirms that shareholders will not receive the benefits of any new assets resulting from blockchain forks. In the event of such an event, the trust will forfeit the Incidental Rights and any corresponding forked assets, essentially removing any future claim for holders. Romanian Post Installs First Bitcoin ATM Meanwhile, Poșta Română, Romania’s national postal service, recently took a big step toward digital innovation by installing its first Bitcoin ATM in a branch located in the city of Tulcea. This initiative was launched in partnership with the local crypto exchange Bitcoin Romania (BTR), and it is the beginning of a broader plan to integrate cryptocurrency services across the country. According to the official announcement , more Bitcoin ATMs are set to be deployed in other cities, including Alexandria, Piatra Neamț, Botoșani, and Nădlac. The move is part of a plan by the postal service to modernize its infrastructure and extend digital financial services to underserved and remote communities. Despite the positive momentum, Bitcoin adoption worldwide is still relatively limited. While enthusiasm continues to grow, especially among retail users and businesses adopting BTC as a payment method or a treasury reserve asset, the total number of global Bitcoin holders is still a very small fraction of the population. According to a Q1 2025 report from Bitcoin financial services firm River, only about 4% of the world’s population currently owns Bitcoin. In the United States, the figure is a bit higher at an estimated 14%. Overall, these results show that adoption is progressing unevenly across regions. River’s report also pointed out that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than $100 increased to almost 30 million in January, which was a 25% year-over-year rise. However, analysts warn that Bitcoin’s total addressable market remains under 1%, with limited retail penetration and institutional allocation. BTC’s market cap compared to the global market (Source: River ) Assuming Bitcoin could eventually secure a 50% share of the global store-of-value market—an estimated $225 trillion in assets such as cash, real estate, equities, precious metals, and art—its current $2 trillion market cap suggests that there is still a lot of room for long-term growth.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 06:06:05

Some operatives ran “laptop farms,” simulating normal work behavior from countries like Russia and Laos. Google had previously taken similar steps, removing North Korea-linked accounts. Meanwhile, tech firms like Google and OpenAI have shut down multiple accounts linked to North Korean deception campaigns. Part of Ongoing Crackdown on DPRK’s Digital Networks This seizure follows the DOJ’s broader DPRK RevGen initiative launched in March 2024, aimed at disrupting North Korea’s growing cyber-financial operations. “ US Sanctions are in place for a reason,” said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. “We will continue to investigate and prosecute anyone helping North Korea fund its illegal weapons programs.” Despite a slower pace under the Trump administration, Thursday’s action signals the U.S. is far from easing up on North Korea’s crypto-powered sanctions evasion. FAQ Who is the Lazarus Group and how are they connected to crypto hacks? The Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking unit. They’ve carried out major crypto thefts, including the $620 million Ronin Bridge hack in 2022 , one of the largest in history. Has the DOJ successfully recovered any stolen crypto from North Korea? Yes. The DOJ has seized millions in stolen and laundered cryptocurrency , including the recent $7.74 million from fake IT workers tied to North Korea.

The new law introduces a licensing framework for stablecoin issuers and service providers operating in Hong Kong. The first batch of licenses is expected to be granted later this year. In parallel, the Financial Secretary issued a notice specifying that unlicensed stablecoin issuers may only offer tokens to “professional investors” as defined under the Securities and Futures Ordinance. Reserve Requirements and Issuer Obligations The regulatory framework mandates full reserve backing with high-quality, liquid assets such as cash, bank deposits, or government securities held in the same currency as the stablecoin. These reserves must be segregated from the issuer’s own funds, held in trust, and shielded from creditor claims. Issuers are prohibited from paying interest on stablecoins but may offer non-interest-based incentives. They must be locally incorporated with key personnel based in Hong Kong and meet minimum capital requirements of HKD 25 million or 1% of the total stablecoin issuance, whichever is greater. Redemption at par within one business day is required under normal conditions. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched a consultation on accompanying guidelines, including measures related to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing. Hong Kong is emerging as a global leader with one of the toughest regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. We spoke to HashKey’s Vivien Wong on what this means for stablecoins, cross-border payments, and HK’s digital finance future. #HongKong #Stablec … https://t.co/QEIPwW5d5q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 3, 2025 Hong Kong Leaps Ahead in Regulating Stablecoins “The upcoming implementation of the Ordinance heralds a structured regulatory environment for stablecoin operations,” said Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui. He described the law as a “significant milestone” in advancing Hong Kong’s digital asset ambitions. The stablecoin ordinance forms part of a broader push by the city to establish comprehensive regulatory clarity around crypto assets, with more nations likely to follow. Currently, the US congress is in the middle of passing the Genius Act which will regulate stablecoins in the country in a similar manner as to Hong Kong.

Security researchers at ThreatFabric say Crocodilus, a new and sophisticated strain of malware that targets mobile banking apps and crypto wallets on Android phones. “Crocodilus enters the scene not as a simple clone, but as a fully-fledged threat from the outset, equipped with modern techniques such as remote control, black screen overlays, and advanced data harvesting via accessibility logging.” ThreatFabric says Crocodilus is emerging as a major threat since it first detected the malware in March. “Notably, its campaigns are no longer regionally confined; the malware has extended its reach to new geographical areas, underscoring its transition into a truly global threat.” One alarming evolution detected in Crocodilus is its ability to infiltrate the user’s contact list and add itself to it, bypassing fraud detection programs that flag callers not in a user’s contacts. “…Crocodilus demonstrates a level of maturity uncommon in newly discovered threats. Already observed targeting banks in Spain and Turkey and popular cryptocurrency wallets, Crocodilus is clearly engineered to go after high-value assets. The rise of new threats like Crocodilus shows that basic, signature-based detection methods are no longer enough—especially in the early stages when the malware first starts spreading.

The tech giant is doubling down on cutting-edge artificial intelligence with a new dedicated research and development group. This initiative focuses on the sophisticated realm of Agentic AI and its application in robotics, signaling Amazon’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of automation and intelligent systems. For those tracking major tech shifts, understanding Amazon’s strategy here provides valuable insight into the future trajectory of AI adoption in large enterprises. What is Agentic AI and Why Does Amazon AI Care? Before diving into Amazon’s new group, let’s clarify what Agentic AI entails. Unlike traditional AI systems that primarily react to specific inputs based on pre-programmed rules or trained models, agentic AI refers to systems designed to act autonomously to achieve complex goals. These AI agents can plan, execute tasks, monitor their progress, and even adapt their strategies in response to dynamic environments. Think of them as AI systems with a higher degree of independence and problem-solving capability. Amazon’s interest in this field is deeply strategic. As a company heavily reliant on complex logistics and physical operations, particularly in its vast network of fulfillment centers, enhancing the intelligence and autonomy of its robotic workforce is a natural progression. Amazon AI recognizes that agentic capabilities can unlock new levels of efficiency and flexibility that static automation cannot achieve. Amazon Lab126: The Home of Amazon’s New AI Robotics Effort The new Agentic AI group is being established within Amazon Lab126 . This is a crucial detail, as Lab126 is Amazon’s secretive hardware R&D division responsible for developing groundbreaking devices like the Amazon Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV. Basing the agentic AI team here strongly suggests that the focus is on integrating this advanced AI directly into physical hardware and robotic systems. Locating the group at Amazon Lab126 indicates a hands-on, integrated approach. The goal isn’t just theoretical AI research but the practical application of agentic frameworks to power Amazon’s next generation of devices and operational tools. This setup facilitates close collaboration between AI researchers and hardware engineers, essential for building sophisticated AI Robotics systems. Driving Innovation in Warehouse Automation with AI Robotics One of the primary drivers behind this initiative is the desire to enhance Warehouse Automation . Amazon already utilizes a massive fleet of robots in its fulfillment centers for tasks like moving shelves and sorting packages. However, current warehouse robots often operate within highly structured, predictable environments and perform relatively simple, repetitive tasks. Introducing agentic AI capabilities aims to give these robots more sophisticated skills. Imagine robots that can: Navigate more complex or dynamic warehouse layouts autonomously. Handle a wider variety of tasks that require judgment or adaptation. Collaborate more effectively with human workers or other robots. Troubleshoot minor issues independently. This push in Warehouse Automation through advanced AI Robotics is not just about speed; it’s about creating a more resilient, flexible, and intelligent supply chain operation. It could lead to significant cost savings, improved accuracy, and faster delivery times, all of which are critical competitive advantages for Amazon. The Broader Impact of Agentic AI and AI Robotics While Amazon’s initial focus appears to be on internal operations and potentially future consumer devices developed at Amazon Lab126 , the advancements made by this new group could have broader implications. The frameworks and technologies developed for AI Robotics in warehouses could potentially be applied to other industries or even licensed out in the future. The progress in Agentic AI itself contributes to the global understanding and capability of autonomous systems. This development underscores the increasing importance of AI, not just as a software layer but as an embedded intelligence within physical systems. As companies like Amazon invest heavily in this area, we can expect to see increasingly capable and autonomous robots become commonplace, transforming various sectors from logistics and manufacturing to healthcare and even potentially consumer homes. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for Amazon AI Amazon’s launch of a dedicated R&D group for Agentic AI and robotics at Lab126 is a clear strategic move. It signals the company’s intention to lead in the development and application of highly autonomous AI systems, starting with its core business of Warehouse Automation . By integrating cutting-edge Agentic AI into its physical operations and potentially future hardware, Amazon AI is positioning itself for a future where intelligent robots play an even more central role in its success. This initiative is a significant step forward in the practical implementation of advanced AI, promising to reshape how goods are handled and delivered on a massive scale.

The fight dragged Elon’s name through the mud on Capitol Hill, sent Tesla stock crashing, and exposed just how fast Republican loyalty can disappear. Despite still holding onto the top spot on the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List with around $388 billion, Elon walked away from this one weaker, isolated, and bleeding cash. The blow-up happened after Elon bashed Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill, calling it a fiscal nightmare. What came next was a brutal wave of GOP backlash. Trump hit back immediately. Elon said Trump should be removed from office. Trump fired back again and threatened to cancel his government contracts. Elon tried claiming he helped Trump win in 2024, possibly by rigging it for him. Republicans rally around Trump and cut Elon loose According to reporting from The Wall Street Journal , Troy Nehls, a Republican from Texas and longtime Trump supporter, told reporters on the Capitol steps, “You’ve lost your damn mind.” He stared straight into the cameras and followed up with, “Enough is enough. Stop this.” Trump’s tax bill, which had passed the House by just one vote and is now being reviewed in the Senate, was the center of it all. Elon called the bill “abhorrent” and accused it of wrecking the budget. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise from Louisiana said, “He hasn’t moved a vote,” when asked about Elon’s impact. Tim Burchett, Republican from Tennessee, wasn’t impressed either. “He’s going off the deep end,” he said, reacting to Elon’s call to impeach Trump. Burchett added that Elon’s money didn’t count for much anymore, saying, “He’s got a huge checkbook, obviously, and this town is gutless.” Elon’s influence had once been helpful to GOP lawmakers criticizing the bill. Now, even White House officials said his outbursts were hurting those efforts. Jim Banks, a Republican senator from Indiana, told CNN Trump was “taking the high ground.” He did admit that Elon had helped cut costs in the past but made it clear the Senate would find its own way to tweak the bill if needed. House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to calm things down. He told reporters that he texted Elon to explain the bill after Elon ignored his calls. Johnson called Elon “a friend,” but rejected his claim about helping Trump win in 2024. “I don’t think any one person deserves credit, but if there is one person, that’s Donald J. Trump,” Johnson said. Elon loses allies, Tesla loses value, and Trump walks away stronger Meanwhile as Tesla’s stock tumbled, Forbes calculated his losses at $27 billion, making it one of the worst financial hits he’s ever taken. Even with a massive lead over Mark Zuckerberg, who holds about $236 billion, and Trump, who sits at $5.4 billion and ranks 689th, the loss stung hard. Only a few Republicans dared to support Elon after the dust settled. Two House members who voted against the bill—Thomas Massie from Kentucky and Warren Davidson from Ohio—publicly backed him. Another outlier, David Schweikert of Arizona, said, “Musk is absolutely right,” when asked about the growing debt. Others called it a messy breakup. Aaron Bean, a Republican from Florida and head of the DOGE caucus, said, “You see two friends fighting, and it’s sad that it escalated so quickly.” Bean still pledged support for DOGE and added, “Maybe they can share a Diet Coke together.” But even jokes couldn’t hide the fallout. Elon’s influence in Washington is now seriously damaged. Tensions had been building for weeks. Elon was already mad that the White House pulled Jared Isaacman, a close ally of his, from consideration to lead NASA. He also hated new rules in the tax bill that would remove EV tax credits, a huge blow to Tesla’s bottom line. Still, none of that stopped Republicans from cutting ties. Ralph Norman, a Republican from South Carolina, said, “When you get two strong personalities, it’s bound to happen.” He called the feud “sad for the country” and added, “No one else had the bandwidth to do what he’s done, to identify what he’s done.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-06 07:10:34

Now that it’s back, is it signaling latent momentum. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s quiet volume may be its loudest signal yet Decoding Bitcoin’s Super Signal Institutional investors are still buying the dip Bitcoin’s quiet volume may be its loudest signal yet Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price has eased slightly since reaching a peak of $111,970 on May 22, pulling back to around $103,300 as of June 6, a decline of approx 8%. Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Despite the drop, institutional appetite appears to remain intact. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded around $5.24 billion in net inflows during May, suggesting that investor interest has not diminished with the slowdown in price momentum. Meanwhile, sentiment indicators are showing a neutral picture. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 46, placing the market in the “Neutral” zone and waiting for further triggers. Amid this, on-chain analyst CryptoCon has highlighted a rare but historically consistent pattern known as the “Bitcoin Super Signal.” The signal is triggered when trading volumes fall to extremely low levels while prices remain in a broader uptrend. A new Bitcoin Super Signal has appeared, which happens when volume reaches extremely low levels inside a bull market. This is the lowest volume reading since 2014. The other super signal this cycle gave us a 200% run from October 2023 to March 2024. Before that, only two other… pic.twitter.com/Zkd4rzDaTi — CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) June 4, 2025 Based on CryptoCon’s data, current trading volume is at its lowest level since 2014. Only three previous instances have met the same criteria. Each one was followed by a significant bull run. So far, there is no clear evidence that the current cycle has reached a peak. Bitcoin continues to trade within bullish territory, while volume continues to decline. Historically, this combination has preceded sharp upward moves, even if the market appears quiet on the surface. To make sense of what this signal could mean now, we need to look at its previous appearances, how each one played out, and why it tends to emerge when market conditions appear deceptively calm. Decoding Bitcoin’s Super Signal In Bitcoin’s chart history, sharp rallies often emerge after extended periods of low activity. The Volume Oscillator Super Signal is one of the few indicators that captures this pattern by using volume, rather than price, as the leading input. It highlights moments when trading activity drops to historically low levels while the broader trend remains upward. Only four such signals have appeared: December 2012, October 2016, September 2023, and most recently, June 2025. The indicator works by applying a volume oscillator to Bitcoin’s monthly chart. When volume dips below a defined threshold during a bull trend, it signals a shift in market structure. Most sellers have likely exited, and buyers may be accumulating with minimal resistance. From a liquidity perspective, this implies reduced supply pressure. As a result, even moderate demand can push prices higher once market momentum returns. In 2012, the signal appeared when Bitcoin was trading below $15. Over the following year, the price surged more than 10,600%, forming the 2013 bull cycle that brought Bitcoin into mainstream attention. The next instance came in October 2016, when Bitcoin stood near $700. The cycle that followed peaked around $20,000 in late 2017, marking a 3,461% increase from the signal to the cycle top. In both cases, the signal emerged during low-volume periods, not at moments of retail frenzy. Price was climbing steadily, but broader interest had not yet returned. The same pattern repeated in September 2023. Bitcoin was trading around $25,000, volume dropped into the “extreme low” zone, and the market remained cautious due to macro uncertainty. Within six months, Bitcoin reached $75,000, posting a 200% gain. Institutional investors are still buying the dip The latest Super Signal appeared in June 2025, as the Volume Oscillator dropped into its extreme low zone. Current readings show the lowest volume level since 2014, despite Bitcoin still trading above $100,000 and U.S. spot ETFs continuing to record multi-billion dollar inflows. The contrast may seem counterintuitive, but historically, low volume in a bullish setup often signals that sellers have exited and buyers are accumulating quietly. In such conditions, market depth shrinks. Even moderate inflows of capital can move prices significantly due to a lack of sell-side resistance. Chart data supports this pattern through color-coded volume zones. Red boxes, which mark volume blow-offs and often indicate market tops, have consistently appeared at the end of previous bull cycles, including in 2014, 2018, and 2021. None has appeared so far in this cycle. In contrast, blue-circled areas highlight the Super Signals — moments when volume reaches deeply suppressed levels while the trend remains upward. These signals have historically emerged at early or mid-stages of a rally, not at its end. The current chart closes with a question mark near today’s price, suggesting the current move may still be unfolding. It is important to distinguish between Super Signals and standard volume pivots. Not all volume dips lead to strong rallies. Green-circled pivots on the oscillator identify periods of moderately low volume followed by smaller upward moves. Super Signals occur only when volume is at unusually low levels and the broader price structure remains intact. Macroeconomic conditions add further context. The fiscal environment has shifted once again following the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which brought renewed government spending and added concerns about long-term liquidity. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain elevated, and risk assets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a softer global monetary stance. In that backdrop, Bitcoin holds a structurally favorable position. ETF flows continue to provide consistent demand. Sell-side pressure remains limited, and trading volumes are compressed, creating a setup where price can move quickly if fresh capital enters. On-chain behavior reflects a shift back toward accumulation. According to Glassnode, wallets holding between 10 and 100 BTC now show a perfect accumulation score of 1.0, indicating strong, sustained buying activity. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10–100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 – the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk — glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 The same score has been recorded in wallets holding less than 1 BTC, suggesting retail interest is also building.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bonk (BONK) Source: TradingView Bonk (BONK) has experienced a mixed market trend lately. The price fell by 18.01% over the past week but gained 3.35% in the last month. Over six months, however, it has dropped by 60.21%. Currently, BONK trades between $0.00001427 and $0.00002061. Technical indicators show potential for movement. The RSI stands at 46.91, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic is at 31.50, nearing oversold territory. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.0000001055, suggesting mild bearish sentiment. The price is close to both the 10-day SMA at $0.00001687 and the 100-day SMA at $0.00001677. If BONK breaks above the nearest resistance at $0.00002435, it could target the second resistance at $0.00003069, gaining about 18% and 49% from the current price, respectively. If it dips below the nearest support at $0.00001167, it may test the second support at $0.00000533, potentially decreasing by 18% and 63%. Investors are watching these levels to determine BONK's next direction. Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe (PEPE) has seen notable movements recently. In the past month, its price surged by 54.41%, bringing excitement to investors. However, the past week showed a decline of 10.11%. Over six months, the price decreased by 41.17%. Currently, PEPE trades between $0.00001013 and $0.00001429. Technical indicators provide some clues. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 52.95, indicating neutrality. The Stochastic indicator reads 45.51, also neutral. The MACD level is 7.4190e-9. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $0.00001238, just above the 100-day SMA of $0.00001194, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. Looking forward, the nearest resistance level is $0.00001678. Surpassing this could lead to the next resistance at $0.00002093. On the other hand, if the price dips, the nearest support is at $0.00000847, with a second support at $0.00000431. Monitoring these levels is important, as breaking them could result in significant price shifts. Conclusion BONK and PEPE have made impressive strides, but XYZVerse (XYZ) is set to surpass them with its unique sports-meme blend and ambitious growth plans.

On June 10, lawmakers will review the CLARITY Act, a bill aimed at setting clear rules for digital assets. This review, called a markup, is a key step before the bill can be voted on in the House of Representatives. NEW: @FinancialCmte has officially scheduled a markup of the crypto market structure bill — the CLARITY Act — for Tuesday, June 10 at 10:00 AM EST alongside a handful of other bills. Prepare for a marathon markup sesh! pic.twitter.com/qx6br4hJN9 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 5, 2025 What is CLARITY Act ? The CLARITY Act is designed to make it easier to understand how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the US. It gives clear definitions for digital assets and outlines which agencies, like the SEC and CFTC, should handle what. The goal is to provide a single, easy-to-follow framework for the crypto market. Many in the crypto industry support the bill. Ripple’s legal chief, Stuart Alderoty, called it a big win and a solid foundation for future laws. Lawmakers from both political parties also back the bill, showing rare bipartisan support in Washington. Rep. Bryan Steil supports the CLARITY Act to bring clear crypto rules and protect consumers. However, some critics push for the Fair Tax Act, which would scrap the IRS and replace all federal taxes with a national sales tax for a simpler system. Why the GENIUS Act Matters Too However, the future of the CLARITY Act depends on another bill known as the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoins. If the GENIUS Act fails, it could slow down or block progress on the CLARITY Act. The Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act soon, and many are hopeful it will pass. Democrats Sound the Alarm However, Democratic lawmakers and key witnesses weren’t convinced. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad urged a complete rethink, suggesting the SEC and CFTC work together on a clearer framework instead of redefining legal terms around securities and commodities. Democrats argued the bill would undercut the SEC’s oversight and leave parts of the industry unregulated. Representative Maxine Waters warned that the bill introduces vague definitions and could trigger more lawsuits, giving big banks an advantage over startups. Rep. Stephen Lynch added that the bill seemed designed to allow large crypto firms to skirt proper regulation. Push to Add More Protections Several crypto groups are also asking lawmakers to include another proposal called the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. This would protect DeFi developers who do not manage customer funds, helping them avoid being treated like traditional banks. With growing support and rising pressure, the June 10 session will be a key moment for the future of crypto regulation in the US. FAQ What is the GENIUS Act and what does it regulate? The GENIUS Act establishes a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, requiring issuers to maintain fully backed reserves and regular consumer disclosures. It assigns the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as the main regulator and offers an optional state-level regime for smaller issuers How will the CLARITY Act impact crypto businesses and investors in the U.S.? If enacted, the Act will provide a stable and predictable regulatory environment, making it easier for businesses to comply and for investors to understand their rights and protections.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 07:14:25

According to data from crypto.news, Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) rose 23% to hit an intraday high of $1.07 on June 6 before slightly cooling to $1.04 during the morning Asian session. The token is now up 372% from its year-to-date low. Fartcoin’s market cap has now reclaimed the $1 billion mark. Daily trading volume also doubled to $414 million compared to the previous day, suggesting a significant spike in investor activity. FARTCOIN’s recent addition to Coinbase’s listing roadmap played a key role in driving the price surge. While this doesn’t guarantee immediate trading, the exchange noted that “the launch of trading for these assets is contingent on market-making support and sufficient technical infrastructure,” and a separate announcement would follow once those conditions are met. Coinbase’s announcement came amidst a broader market downturn, sparked by rising political tensions between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, both influential figures in the crypto industry, which shook investor confidence. You might also like: Why is crypto down today? Trump-Musk fallout rattles sentiment, Dogecoin drops 20% Still, the news was enough to spark optimism among Fartcoin traders. A Coinbase listing is typically seen as a major catalyst, opening the door to millions of new users and liquidity. That anticipation seems to have turned the overall sentiment positive, especially on social media platforms. Retail enthusiasm was further fueled by whale activity. Smart money tracker Stalkchain reported that a whale recently scooped up nearly $3 million worth of FARTCOIN, which added to the buying pressure. Such large buys from experienced or institutional investors tend to boost confidence among smaller retail holders and often lead to price surges. Fartcoin price analysis On the technical front, FARTCOIN is currently testing the upper edge of a broadening wedge pattern on the 4-hour USDT chart, a setup often seen as a bullish reversal signal. FARTCOIN price, 50-day SMA — June 6 | Source: crypto.news The token is also closing in on its 50-day moving average, with momentum indicators flashing positive signs. Both the Relative Strength Index and Stochastic Oscillator are trending upward, while the MACD just made a bullish crossover, indicating growing momentum. FARTCOIN MACD and RSI chart — June 6 | Source: crypto.news According to technical analyst Waleed Ahmed, FARTCOIN has formed a bullish Shark Harmonic pattern, which typically points to a strong upside move. A clear breakout above the broadening wedge could invalidate the recent bearish outlook, which had taken shape after the token fell 47% from May 23, when it broke out of an ascending channel . Hence, if the bullish momentum persists, the next upside target is around $1.47, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and a key resistance zone. However, if FARTCOIN fails to hold above the crucial $1 psychological support, sellers may try to push it down to $0.50, a level that would represent a 61% drop from current prices.

In contrast, many alt competitors, such as ETH, BNB, DOGE, ADA, SUI, and LINK, have marked more substantial declines. Consequently, CRYPTOWZR noted that XRP is doing “much better” compared to them. They believe the asset’s actual breakthrough can occur once the XRP/BTC trading pair improves. For now, though, this hasn’t been the case as BTC has taken the latest correction better and is down by just 1%. ERGAG CRYPTO, another popular analyst with over 84,000 followers on X, noted that the upcoming weekend will be crucial for XRP’s price. They said the “retest box” (visible in the chart below) was barely hit, and “we need to see what will happen during the weekend.” In order to turn bullish, the asset would need to close above certain thresholds, the first being $2.3. However, the biggest challenge will be a closure north of $2.65, which will be the “go-go signal.” #XRP – Short-Term Move: To have #Bullish break-out then #XRP has to close: 1️⃣ $2.30 2️⃣ $2.35 3️⃣ $2.36 – break-out from MEGA falling wedge 4️⃣ $2.45 5️⃣ $2.65 Is Go-Go signal #XRPFamily STAY STEAD and STRONG , Together We Rise pic.twitter.com/3Z2TfmWxEV — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 5, 2025 The post XRP Price Closed Bearish: But Here’s The Good News appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-06 07:15:46

These meme-inspired coins are gaining traction among investors seeking high-growth potential assets. This article unveils some of the most promising tokens that could offer substantial returns, spotlighting opportunities that early investors might find particularly enticing. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Dogecoin: From Internet Joke to Crypto Contender Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. Its creators used a popular Shiba Inu meme as the logo to bring fun into the cryptocurrency world. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there's no maximum limit. What began as a ""memecoin"" soon gained a massive following. In 2021, its value skyrocketed, making it one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Social media buzz, particularly from Elon Musk, and a booming crypto market pushed its total value beyond $50 billion. Dogecoin shows the power of community and social influence. Its technology is based on Litecoin, allowing fast and low-cost transactions. While some see it as less serious than other coins, its growth tells a different story. In the current market, Dogecoin's plentiful supply and strong fan base could be strengths. Compared to others, it remains affordable and accessible. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin stands out by blending fun with real-world value. Shiba Inu: The Memecoin Turning Heads with Ethereum Power Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by the success of Dogecoin. Created by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB sets itself apart by running on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can tap into Ethereum's vast network of applications. SHIB began with a whopping one quadrillion tokens. In a bold move, half were sent to Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder. Buterin's donation of a large chunk to India's COVID-19 relief and the burning of 40% of the total supply put SHIB in the global spotlight. What makes SHIB exciting is its potential beyond memes. Its connection to Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade without a middleman. Plans are underway for a future NFT platform and a system where the community can have a say in decisions. Unlike Dogecoin, which doesn't have these features, SHIB aims to offer real utility. In the current market, where investors look for coins with solid technology and growth potential, SHIB stands out. Its blend of fun and function could give it an edge over other cryptocurrencies. Breaking Wind in Crypto: FARTCOIN's Memetic Revolution FARTCOIN is the latest memecoin bubbling up on the Solana blockchain, blending internet humor with crypto culture. This playful token invites users to join a fun-filled ecosystem where they can earn FARTCOIN by submitting fart-themed memes, jokes, or short content. Every transaction comes with a cheeky twist: a digital fart sound effect, turning routine transfers into laugh-out-loud moments. It's a lighthearted nod to blockchain's ""gas fees,"" making each interaction a memorable experience. Behind the humor lies innovative technology. The ""Terminal of Truth,"" an AI-powered content engine, fuels creativity and community engagement. By harnessing user-generated content and artificial intelligence, FARTCOIN transforms viral humor into a decentralized social movement. In the current market cycle, where investors seek projects with strong communities and unique value propositions, FARTCOIN stands out. While established coins focus on serious applications, FARTCOIN taps into the memecoin trend popularized by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu but adds its own distinctive flavor. Its potential for virality and community growth could make it an attractive option for those looking to explore the lighter side of crypto. Trump Coin: A Memecoin With Political Roots On January 18, 2025, Donald Trump launched his own memecoin, the Official Trump token (TRUMP), just days before his second presidential inauguration. Designed on the Solana blockchain, TRUMP quickly rose to prominence, peaking at $75.35 the day after its release. However, its value has since declined, reaching an all-time low of $7.14 by April 7, 2025. The memecoin can be used to buy Trump-related memorabilia, giving it some real-world utility that sets it apart from many other celebrity-based tokens. While TRUMP experienced an initial surge in popularity, its future remains uncertain. With a highly centralized supply—80% of the coin's total circulation held by one wallet—and no official whitepaper, concerns about its long-term viability persist. Despite this, its recent price movement has shown some signs of recovery, with technical indicators pointing to a potential rise toward the $10.50 resistance level. Investors and enthusiasts alike are watching closely, wondering whether this celebrity-backed memecoin will have the staying power of other digital currencies or fade into obscurity. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, FART, and TRUMP are strong options, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans and meme culture, aiming for massive growth through a community-driven ecosystem.

45588568,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70045,1749194370,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Making of Millionaires: Expert Reveals Why Bitcoin and XRP Are Just Getting Started,https://timestabloid.com/making-of-millionaires-expert-reveals-why-bitcoin-and-xrp-are-just-getting-started/,"Coach JV, a well-known voice in the cryptocurrency space, has presented a detailed case for why Bitcoin and XRP remain two of the most promising assets for future millionaires. Although both digital assets have been available for over a decade, the crypto commentator insists that their most significant gains could still lie ahead. His analysis is centered on the long-term fundamentals of these cryptocurrencies, including supply constraints, increasing institutional demand, and geopolitical shifts that favor broader crypto adoption. Why Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics Point to Massive Upside According to Coach JV, Bitcoin’s scarcity remains one of its strongest value drivers. He notes that 95% of all Bitcoin has already been mined and distributed, leaving only 5% of the supply available for future circulation. This limited supply, coupled with rising demand from both retail and institutional buyers, creates a high probability of price escalation. Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, recently remarked that Bitcoin is in high demand and few are willing to sell, reinforcing the argument that growing interest is colliding with limited supply. Trump, who backs conservative financial policies, placed his baseline price prediction for Bitcoin at $170,000 but acknowledged that the $1 million figure is within reason. Coach JV highlighted that global leaders and political figures are now aligning with pro-Bitcoin policies. He referenced President Donald Trump’s executive order directing the United States to retain its Bitcoin holdings and not liquidate them. This move aligns with several pro-crypto legislative proposals now circulating in Washington, signaling a shift in official sentiment toward digital assets. Institutional Interest and Global Policy Add Momentum Momentum is also building internationally. Zia Yusuf, chairman of Reform UK, warned in a Bloomberg interview that the UK could fall behind economically if it excludes Bitcoin from its sovereign wealth fund. Such warnings underscore the asset’s increasing relevance at a governmental level, a trend that Coach JV argues could support prolonged upward movement in Bitcoin’s price. Supporters of the bullish outlook claim that this global policy trend may move Bitcoin out of its traditional four-year bull-bear cycle into a longer-term growth phase. This new environment, they argue, could be the catalyst for a significant number of new millionaires who accumulate the asset early enough. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin Compared to Early Tech Stocks Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, provided further historical perspective by comparing Bitcoin’s current market position to Apple’s in the mid-1990s. He stated that investing in Bitcoin at $105,000 in 2025 would be similar to buying Apple stock in 1995. Youngelman emphasized that a $1,000 investment in Apple in 1995 would now be worth $63 million, implying that Bitcoin may offer a comparable trajectory over the coming decades. XRP’s Millionaire Potential Coach JV also underscored XRP’s potential as a wealth-building asset. He believes XRP is positioned to benefit from the same wave of financial transformation that is propelling Bitcoin. The analyst argued that as Bitcoin rises, XRP could follow, especially as regulatory clarity around XRP continues to improve. Support for this view comes from other notable voices in the crypto space. Edo Farina predicted that XRP could increase by over 4,000% to reach $100 if Bitcoin reaches the $500,000 mark. Under this scenario, an investment of 10,000 XRP tokens, valued around $20,000 today, could grow into a $1 million portfolio. In addition, BarriC, another market analyst, suggested that XRP could trade between $500 and $1,000 by the 2030s, depending on the broader crypto market’s growth. While these figures are speculative, they reflect the growing optimism about XRP’s potential to create substantial wealth for long-term holders. Coach JV’s analysis, supported by numerous voices in the financial and political space, presents a compelling case that Bitcoin and XRP could generate significant wealth in the years ahead. His perspective emphasizes that, despite their past gains, both assets may still be in the early stages of global adoption. As institutional interest, supply dynamics, and regulatory policies align in favor of crypto, the road to millionaire status may remain open to those who position themselves accordingly.

News Background XRP’s week-long price action was influenced by a mix of fundamental developments and market speculation. Ripple recently received approval from Dubai regulators for its RLUSD stablecoin, underscoring the company’s ambition to integrate digital assets into cross-border payment systems. Meanwhile, the market is closely watching for a decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF, expected by June 17. Approval could attract substantial institutional inflows, potentially transforming XRP’s liquidity profile. On the technical front, XRP’s consolidation above its 200-day moving average signals resilience despite broader market volatility. Ripple’s broader strategy — bridging crypto and traditional finance — continues to define XRP’s role as both a settlement asset and a risk-on hedge against traditional assets. Price Action The rebound followed a sharp sell-off that saw XRP tumble to $2.07 during the 19:00-20:00 hour, with volume spiking to 228.6 million units — nearly double the daily average — suggesting capitulation selling rather than steady distribution. XRP’s price has since formed a higher-low pattern with bullish momentum returning as buying interest surged in the $2.10-$2.15 range. While XRP’s price action has regained ground, the $2.50-$2.60 resistance zone remains formidable. The market remains cautious, with traders eyeing the potential ETF decision as a catalyst for a sustained breakout. Technical Analysis Recap XRP climbed from $2.07 to $2.20, a 7% gain. The most significant selling occurred between 19:00-20:00, with volume hitting 228.6 million units — nearly double the daily average. Resistance formed at $2.50-$2.60, with price struggling to sustain gains beyond these levels. Support established at $2.07-$2.10, with high-volume buying interest stabilizing the price action. Price action has formed a higher-low pattern with bullish momentum, though market caution persists. XRP remains technically within a symmetrical triangle formation, hinting at potential breakout scenarios if volume increases and resistance is breached.

With Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum falling, XRP has also slipped over 4% as traders react to political tensions and a wider market sell-off. XRP Nears Key $2.40 Resistance Despite the recent drop, XRP appears to be gaining momentum. Analyst Dark Defender shared recently that XRP is nearing a major resistance level on the weekly chart. If it breaks this key level along with the RSI barrier, it could trigger a strong upward move. He shared that XRP has a strong price support at $2.22. If it holds above this support and breaks key resistance levels like $2.40, it could shoot up to as high as $5.85, an increase of about 144%. The market seems to be ticking toward a breakout, and excitement is building across the XRP community. Analysts Point to Crucial Resistance at $2.36 for Breakout Analyst Egrag Crypto also shared that for a short-term bullish breakout, XRP needs to first close above $2.30 to show buying interest, then surpass $2.35 to build momentum. The crucial level is $2.36, where XRP would break out of a major falling wedge pattern, which is a classic technical signal hinting at an upward trend. If it further closes above $2.45, then it shows strong bullish control, and crossing $2.65 is the key for a big upward move. XRP Could Follow 2017 Pattern, Rally Soon? If XRP follows its 2017 pattern , a final breakout could start in 2-4 weeks. It has already been consolidating for 190 days, close to the 210-day mark back then. So, a big move might be around the corner. But, it may first dip to $2 to grab liquidity before pumping. XRP is trading around $2.12, down 4% in 24 hours. It is now testing key support near $2.07. If it breaks lower, more losses could follow. Almost all of the moving averages are negative except the 200-day EMA at $2.08, which might act as support. Indicators like MACD remain bearish, and traders seem to be waiting for a clear move. All eyes are on June 16 next, as a major Ripple v. SEC update is expected, which could decide XRP’s course. Institutional interest in XRP is also growing as VivoPower, Webus, and ACG are making major investments.

Nigerian authorities released Gambaryan on humanitarian grounds in October and later dropped all charges. His departure comes as Binance moves to resolve its US legal battles. Head of financial crime compliance at Binance, Tigran Gambaryan, is leaving the exchange after an eight-month legal ordeal in Nigeria that drew international attention. Gambaryan, a former US Internal Revenue Service agent, confirmed to Bloomberg News that Friday is his last day at Binance. The Nigerian government detained him last year on money laundering and currency manipulation charges after he traveled to the country on behalf of Binance. Binance Exec Released on Humanitarian Grounds as Nigeria Drops Charges Gambaryan was released in October on humanitarian grounds after his health deteriorated in detention. Nigerian authorities later dropped the charges. “Tigran has made a lasting impact on Binance, just as he did in his previous roles in law enforcement,” a Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg. “We are deeply grateful for his dedication in transforming our financial crimes compliance organization. Thanks to his tireless efforts, the crypto industry is safer for all.” The episode marked a tense chapter for Binance’s global operations. Binance CEO Richard Teng previously alleged in a blog post that officials in Nigeria had sought a “secret” payment to resolve the case — a claim Nigeria denied. Before joining Binance in 2021, Gambaryan built a reputation as a top crypto crimes investigator for the US government, earning the nickname “Crypto Wizard” for tracing illicit blockchain transactions. At Binance, his work focused on enhancing the company’s anti-money laundering protocols and assisting global law enforcement with asset seizures as regulators intensified scrutiny of major exchanges. Tigran Gambaryan, the Binance compliance officer who was unjustly detained in Nigeria, receives the first ever Digital Chamber Hero Award pic.twitter.com/J84L3CpnY2 — CryptoLaw.avax (@RussellKlein) March 26, 2025 His departure comes as Binance moves closer to resolving legal issues in the US. Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a joint motion with Binance to stay its case in federal court. The SEC sued Binance in June 2023, accusing it and co-founder Changpeng Zhao of mishandling customer funds and violating securities laws. Binance and Zhao pleaded guilty to separate charges in November 2023, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in penalties. Zhao was fined $50 million, stepped down as CEO, and served four months in US prison. CZ Confirms Pardon Request After Initial Denial In May, CZ confirmed that he has formally applied for a presidential pardon, weeks after initially denying reports of such a move . Speaking on the Farokh Radio podcast aired May 6, Zhao said his legal team filed the request following widespread media speculation. “I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said during the interview, saying that he ultimately decided to move forward after stories from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal suggested he was pursuing a pardon from former U.S. President Donald Trump. “If they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply,” Zhao added. The former crypto mogul pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in November 2023 as part of a settlement with U.S. authorities. Zhao has since shifted focus to international advisory work, offering guidance to governments in Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan on crypto regulation and blockchain integration.

Although Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain among the best cryptos to buy now for long-term holders, newer investors are questioning their short-term momentum. Meanwhile, the crypto conversation is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new altcoin drawing attention with its high-utility DeFi model and presale momentum. The Mutuum Finance presale is now in phase 5 priced at $0.03. Over $10 million has been raised attracting more than 11,700 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. For traders exploring what crypto to invest in, the contrast between legacy meme coins and innovative newcomers like MUTM may define the next phase of top cryptocurrencies in 2025. SHIB and DOGE Prices Slide as Sentiment Shifts Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently stands at $0.00001321 which is a decrease of over 39% from January 1 and is due to Shibarium updates not impressing traders and the trend of weaker retail interest. Like the rest, Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at around $0.1959, held back mostly by whale activities and the absence of big events to spark the price. Previously considered the top cryptocurrency investments, both meme coins are now struggling with increasing pressure because of ongoing flux in attitudes and no price movement. Although DOGE is still seen as a speculative investment and SHIB as a utility coin, neither looks likely to have a breakout in this quarter. Meanwhile, newly introduced altcoins, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are drawing attention from investors looking for better returns during this market cycle. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows A two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance go viral in 2025. More than 11,700 investors have invested $10 million in the presale. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $6 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is creating a stablecoin backed by the US dollar that will be available on the Ethereum network. Because it is overcollateralized, its price won’t fluctuate drastically like algorithmic stablecoins have. The system relies on audited and safe open-source smart contracts from Certik, so users feel more secure. As legacy meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) face mounting pressure from declining momentum and shifting investor sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a breakout DeFi coin in 2025. Backed by an advanced dual lending model, a Certik audit, and a community of over 11,700 holders, MUTM has already raised more than $10 million in presale funding. With Phase 5 tokens available at $0.03—and a 100% ROI projected by launch at $0.06—this is a pivotal moment for forward-looking investors. Secure your MUTM tokens now before the next price increase and be part of the next-generation DeFi transformation.

Over the past 12 hours, lawmakers, billionaires, and internet personalities have been reacting to the serious accusations, policy threats, and personal insults between the world’s richest man and the President of the United States. After months of frequently praising each other in public and making appearances together at events, Musk and Trump abruptly turned against each other this week. The former is claiming credit for Trump’s 2024 election win, propounding that without his influence, Democrats would have retained the House, and Republicans would have only narrowly held the Senate. “ Without me, Trump would have lost the election ,” Musk posted on social platform X. “ Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude .” President Trump responded by threatening to revoke billions of dollars in government subsidies and contracts for Musk’s SpaceX’s national Space Station, which relies on SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft. Trump and Musk accusations and allegations cause spur On Thursday evening, Musk accused Trump of being “in the Epstein files” without evidence, only backing his claims by saying it was the reason certain documents related to Epstein had not been released to the public. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt bashed the Tesla CEO’s statements and said he was acting out because of his “dissatisfaction with the administration’s legislative priorities.” “ This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted ,” Leavitt said in a statement yesternight. Conservative political commentator and author Candace Owens supported Leavitt’s sentiment, posting on social media: “ Trump is implicated alongside a pedophile, and I knew it but didn’t care because we were friends’ is not the flex you think it is. ” She was backed by internet personality Graham Allen, who questioned Musk’s timing of the claims. “ According to Elon Musk, Trump is on the Epstein list. So naturally, he let him hang out with his kid. I DO NOT BELIEVE ELON ,” Allen said. A source familiar with the administration told CNN that previously released Epstein-related files included references to Trump’s name due to his past association with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s. Still, it reiterated that there are no allegations against the president. The source also talked about several of Musk’s own posts earlier this year, including one in which he wrote, “I love Trump as much as a straight man can love a straight man.” This, according to them, places Musk’s sincerity into question. “ If Elon truly thought the President was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hang out with him for 6 months? ” the source asked. Ye, the rapper who has close ties with both Trump and Musk, took to X to beg the powerheads to reconcile. “Broooos please noooooo,” he wrote , “we love you both so much.” Musk has been reposting Trump’s commentary on social media when the latter lambasted the Biden administration for passing laws that could increase America’s public debt. He told his followers on X that the “big beautiful bill” would trigger a recession by the end of the year. He reposted a February interview with CPAC, warning of fiscal insolvency.

The company warns that the current cycle is different from others and that we may be witnessing “the last Bitcoin rotation before everything changes.” Swan argued that despite being in the final year of the classic four-year cycle, price action has not generated as much excitement as expected. While past cycles have seen parabolic increases in Bitcoin’s third green year, 2025 has so far seen a slower, more measured, and sideways market. According to the analysis, a major shift is taking place under the surface in the Bitcoin market. Investors who have held BTC for a long time are selling above the $100,000 level, while BlackRock, Fidelity, large companies and institutional buyers who have established long-term strategic positions are taking their place. Swan states that this new class of investors is not for sale. Swan CIO Ben Werkman said: “These companies are not buying Bitcoin to trade, but to hold it in their long-term portfolios. They are simply buyers. Not sellers.” When long-term capital is combined with inelastic supply, market supply can dry up quickly, with “explosive” consequences for prices, according to Werkman. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor also contributed to the analysis, stating: “People who are not committed to the long term are exiting the market… and they are being replaced by a completely different class of investors.” Related News: Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping - Is the Trade War Coming to an End? Here Are the Details of the Call Swan notes that this transformation is not only happening among investor types, but also between generations. After the Silent Generation who trusted in gold, the Baby Boomers who accumulated their wealth in stocks, and the Generation X who grew up with technology, now the Millennials who are starting to inherit trillions of dollars are coming onto the scene and they are choosing Bitcoin. In the analysis, it was argued that the structural transformation in Bitcoin is also supported by the macroeconomic background. Swan noted that the rise in bond yields while the US dollar is depreciating is an unusual and dangerous signal for global capital. Swan's remarkable analysis concluded with the following warning: “If you're selling Bitcoin right now, you're probably giving it to an institution that plans to hold it forever. You may not get it back. This isn't just the next cycle, it's the end of an era. The supply is running out. The buyers are different. The macro structure is breaking. This could be the last Bitcoin rotation.” *This is not investment advice.

The newly raised capital is intended to help scale platform operations, increase liquidity depth, and support the development of new product features aimed at both retail and institutional users. The latest round follows a $10 million funding event in March led by Varys Capital and builds on earlier support from Circle Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and the Sui Foundation .

According to the official notice , the region’s stablecoin regulations will come into effect starting on August 1, 2025. Once it is formally implemented, businesses would need to obtain licenses in order to issue stablecoins tied to the Hong Kong dollar or operating in the region. First drafted last May 2025, the bill has evidently been accelerated to advance the region’s budding crypto industry. The main purpose behind the new stablecoin bill, stated in the announcement, is to ensure that all activities involving stablecoins will be regulated. The new licensing regime will also limit stablecoin advertisements to licensed issuers in an effort to prevent scams. Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, said in his statement that the government will provide clear guidelines for industry players interested in delving into the stablecoin market. “After the Ordinance comes into effect, the licensing system will provide appropriate regulations for relevant stablecoin activities marking a milestone in promoting the sustainable development of the stablecoin and digital asset ecosystem in Hong Kong,” said Hui in a translated statement.

The new stablecoin regulation also contains a clause that regulates qualified investors, granting them the ability to issue stablecoins even if they do not hold a license yet. However, it is still unclear whether retail investors still have to abide to certain requirements dictated by financial regulators in order to issue their own stablecoins. “As specified categories of persons, thereby allowing specified stablecoins issued by persons who have not been granted a licence under Section 15 of the Ordinance to be offered to professional investors,” stated authorities in the translated notice. As previously reported by crypto.news, Hong Kong has accelerated its stablecoin regulation so that it may be passed within this year.

The expansion, which was announced in a blog post on June 5, has up to $500,000 in incentives and is backed by $30 million in liquidity. By joining Solana’s ( SOL ) fast and affordable network, Maple Finance ( SYRUP ) aims to provide users throughout the ecosystem with institutional-grade lending tools and consistent yields. syrupUSDC offers a fixed yield of approximately 6.5% and can be bridged from Ethereum ( ETH ). Chainlink’s ( LINK ) cross-chain interoperability protocol, which launched on Solana’s mainnet on May 19, enables the cross-chain capability. Users can more easily access syrupUSDC on either chain thanks to CCIP, a tool that has enabled the safe transfer of tokens and data between Ethereum and Solana. Solana-native protocols like Kamino and Orca are supporting the rollout. Kamino has already added syrupUSDC to its lending, leverage, and liquidity vaults. As part of the launch effort, Maple will distribute weekly rewards of $15,000 to users supplying USDC and USDG, with additional incentives directed toward Paxos’s USDG-based lending. You might also like: Maple Finance price prediction: SYRUP is sweet again — but for how long? This move is a part of Maple’s strategy plan to expand across chains with high liquidity and active decentralized finance ecosystems. With over $11 billion worth of stablecoins, Solana offers a strong foundation for Maple’s future growth. At present, the protocol manages over $1.9 billion in assets, as per Dune Analytics data , with SyrupUSDC’s supply surpassing $550 million. The Solana launch follows a major development in late May when Maple announced a $2 billion Bitcoin-backed lending initiative in partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald. By bringing traditional lending structures on-chain, Maple hopes to bridge the gap between institutional finance and cryptocurrencies. Maple’s entry adds a great deal of firepower as more platforms, such as margin.fi, Port Finance, Save, and Rain.fi, join Solana’s lending market. The protocol is establishing itself as a major player in the upcoming stage of institutional DeFi, supported by strong liquidity, strategic alliances, and a track record of success.

In contrast, trading volumes have surged by 39.75%, reaching $144.4 billion, suggesting a wave of panic selling or forced exits. Amidst this volatility, crypto ETF outflows recorded a sizable $267.1 million withdrawal. Surprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index remains relatively stable at 46, indicating neutral sentiment despite sharp market reactions. Why Did the Crypto Market Crash Today? The following catalysts triggered a domino effect of selling across major tokens. Political & Social Sentiment : A public dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk around policy bills further rattled market confidence, sparking debate and confusion across social media. Mass Liquidation Events : High-leverage positions across multiple assets faced forced closures, exacerbating the downward momentum. Macroeconomic Headwinds : Investors are anxious ahead of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of non-farm payroll data and the unemployment rate later today. These figures could heavily influence Fed policy, prompting cautious sentiment. Crypto Liquidations Hit $1 Billion In the past 24 hours, the crypto market bore over $1 billion in liquidations, a majority of which were $900 million+ worth of long positions. Short liquidations made up just around $100 million, clearly reflecting the bull trap that caught over-leveraged buyers off guard. Bitcoin alone saw $341.76 million in liquidations, followed closely by Ethereum at $285.99 million. Source: Coin Glass Top exchanges like Bybit with $352M, and Binance with $248M led the tally in liquidated positions, with more than 89% of these being long trades. This steep wipeout not only intensified the sell-off but also hints at growing nervousness among traders, especially those relying on leveraged gains. Source: Coin Glass What to Expect Next? Despite today’s fall, the neutral score in the Fear & Greed Index suggests the market isn’t in a full-blown panic yet. Looking at the chart, the total crypto market cap has slipped from above $3.3 trillion to $3.17 trillion, signaling a break below key support. The 9-day SMA at $3.23T now acts as a resistance. If the market fails to reclaim this level soon, further downside toward $3T is likely. If you are keen on Bitcoin’s future, our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 is a must-read! FAQs Why did long trades dominate liquidations today? The sudden market drop caught bullish traders off guard, forcing overleveraged long positions to liquidate in masses. Should investors sell now?

By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $5,190.17 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

BNB/USDT price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of Binance Coin confirmed an upward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has appreciated to $641.2, the high for the day. A green candlestick on the price chart signifies a returning buyers support.

BNB/USDT shows domination between buyers The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral area. The indicator’s value has increased to index 44.87 in the past 24 hours.

BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin confirmed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The BNB/USD value has slightly dropped to $641.4 in the past few hours. Despite the upswing in the early hours, currently, the bears are in the lead, which proves that selling pressure is still present above the current price level. The Bollinger Bands are expanding, resulting in increasing volatility. The increasing volatility signifies a higher chance of an upcoming reversal. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $682.6, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $639.5, marking yet another resistance. Binance Coin descends to $641.4 The RSI indicator is present within the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has deteriorated to index 35.42 in the past few hours.

Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.25 percent of its value today. Technical indicators give out a bullish signal, and the price charts also project a bullish market scenario. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support and the price moved toward $641.2. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.25 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,190.17 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into June, BNB is trading approximately $666.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-06 07:52:00

The filing is tied to recent debt and equity agreements with 50 investors. The registration statement relates to 56 million shares of equity and 29 million shares related to convertible notes. Bitcoin Treasury Push: CEO Says Company Aims to Acquire “Crown Jewel Assets” The fund will be used to acquire Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes, an official release noted . However, the company has not disclosed how much Bitcoin it plans to purchase. Additionally, the filing includes a universal shelf provision to offer flexibility for future initiatives like mergers and capital raising offerings. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said that the company is exploring all elements needed for its growth and plans, including acquiring “crown jewel assets.” “These activities will provide the Company with the capital, assets, independence, flexibility, and security we need to fulfill our goals of rapid expansion, guaranteeing a wide array of ways to access the capital markets when it’s most advantageous to do so,” he said. TMTG Bitcoin ETF Plans: Will it Be Anywhere Close to Existing Crypto ETFs? TMTG, the media group behind Trump’s Truth Social, has already signed a deal with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch a suite of exchange-traded funds under the Truth.Fi brand. Trump Media has signed a deal with @cryptocom and Yorkville to launch a series of ETFs combining digital assets and U.S.-focused investments. #trump #etf https://t.co/pyvQqgC5Gz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 22, 2025 The funds will combine exposure to digital assets with investments in U.S.-focused sectors such as energy, the company said in April . If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will have Crypto.com as its exclusive custodian and liquidity provider. The ETF would join the increasing number of crypto-related products that are waiting to get approval from the regulator. The new fund will carry exclusive clauses. The filing noted that one of the largest crypto exchanges, Crypto.com, will offer certain services to the trust behind the product. The ETF’s launch comes as the price of Bitcoin has hit above $100,000 amid a wave of optimism. However, given that there is a flurry of spot Bitcoin funds, Truth Social ETF would only join a crowded field, trying to gain the trust of the institutional investment community. “I think it’s extraordinarily unlikely that products like [Truth Social Bitcoin ETF] gain long-term assets,” Dave Nadig, an independent ETF expert, told the FT.

The most crucial advice from the team is that users must refrain from interacting with any website, app, pr platform that requests their wallet passphrases, unless it is exactly “wallet.pinet.com” in the Pi Browser. Otherwise, they risk losing their entire PI balance. Although the team said it is working on improving the Pi Browser’s overall safety, it still remains a browser like others, and it is the individual’s responsibility to “determine the safety and legitimacy of the sites and URLs they visit.” Users can distinguish Pi Wallets from fake alternatives by the purple color in the navigation bar that contains a PI logo featuring the Core Team apps logo. “If a scammer creates a fake ‘Pi Wallet’ that tries to phish Pioneers’ wallet secret passphrase, they won’t be able to modify the app URL or the associated UI of the Browser that the official Pi Wallet will have,” reads the post. Social Media Safety The team further advised its users to be “especially careful” on social media platforms, as many fail to prevent the circulation of fake websites or misleading ads. They added that no Pi Core Team member will “ever solicit ANY authentication account information (like wallet passphrases, account passwords, verification codes, etc.)” and will never individually call investors. Users must interact and submit information only to apps that are listed as official and are posted on the Pi Safety Center . PI Price Update Let’s take a look at the native token’s price performance as of late. In the past 24 hours, the asset has joined the broader crypto market and has gone through a price slide of around 4%. As such, it remains inches above $0.6. Its monthly performance, though, is a lot more volatile. Recall that it has pumped from $0.6. to roughly $1.7 on the hype of a massive Pi Network announcement in mid-May, but started to dump even before the news broke. Since then, it has lost almost all gains and, as mentioned above, now fights to stay above $0.6. PI Token Price.

Among them, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) stands out with its substantial fundraising achievement in its ongoing presale. This significant financial milestone has been made possible not only by UNIL's innovative approach to combining decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional finance (TradFi) but also due to its advanced AI-driven asset management platform. The Innovative Edge of Unilabs Finance While traditional meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu occasionally struggle to maintain momentum, Unilabs Finance has capitalized on its unique offerings. The platform's introduction of an AI-powered DeFi asset manager has particularly caught the attention of savvy investors. This technology manages a robust portfolio including meme coin identification, which enhances listing potentials and minimizes risks. Such advancements have not only enabled a rapid fundraising of over $2M but also generated a significant return of 55% for early investors. Enthusiasm around Unilabs continues to grow as the platform offers diverse funds like AI, mining, and Bitcoin, broadening its appeal. Market Dynamics: Dogecoin and Shiba Inu's Current Status Amidst these developments, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown some fluctuations. Recent trends suggest a downturn in their values, with Dogecoin experiencing a drop of nearly 15% over the past week. Despite this, analysts like Trader Tardigrade are optimistic about a potential uptick in Dogecoin's value, expecting significant pumps soon based on historical price patterns. Similarly, Shiba Inu witnessed a decline but remains a focal point for predictions by influencers like SHIB Possessor, who anticipates a strong rebound. Why Unilabs Finance Attracts Crypto Investors Over Meme Coins While meme coins rely heavily on community support and viral trends, Unilabs Finance offers a more stable investment channel through its multifaceted platform. The promise of up to 30% redistribution of platform fees to UNIL holders adds an attractive layer of passive income, further incentivizing investments. As the third phase of its presale concludes successfully, the platform’s market strategy and innovative features hint at a promising upward trajectory, distinguishing it from typical meme coin investments. Conclusion: A Shift in Investment Preference The crypto community's growing interest in platforms offering tangible utilities and passive income potential, like Unilabs Finance, signifies a shift from mere speculative investments towards more sustainable financial growth strategies in the cryptocurrency space.

Not Like This Altcoin As It Just Raised Over $2M in a Flash!,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/doge-and-shib-to-the-moon-not-like-this-altcoin-as-it-just-raised-over-2m-in-a-flash,"Recently, many analysts have made some bullish predictions for the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price. Although they see some red weekly charts, Trader Tardigrade and SHIB Possessor think these meme coins will see big reversals soon. Despite this, one altcoin is stealing their spotlight - Unilabs Finance (UNIL) . This presale star is now in its third phase, which has already raised over $2M and given early buyers a 55% return. Since Unilabs Finance also introduced a one-of-a-kind DeFi asset manager fueled by AI tech, many investors even think UNIL has more growth potential than Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Unilabs Finance (UNIL): Where DeFi Meets TradFi While the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price show some dips, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is making headlines for a good reason. Notably, it has already raised over $2M in just two weeks in its initial coin offering and may reach $3M before June ends. Additionally, early buyers of this altcoin are already experiencing returns of 55%. Interest in Unilabs Finance is sky-high as it launched the first DeFi asset manager fueled by AI technology that already boasts over $30M AUM. On it, users get access to a meme coin identification tool that looks at new meme coins and their listing potential and potential risks. Furthermore, Unilabs Finance offers four distinct funds: AI, mining, RWA and BTC. These features bring exposure to successful markets to all Unilabs Finance users. What attracts traders is the fact that Unilabs Finance will redistribute up to 30% of its platform fees to UNIL altcoin holders. The more UNIL tokens people hold, the higher the rewards. As a result, nearly 500M UNIL tokens have been bought in the third presale round alone. It is now worth just $0.0062, but this altcoin price will soar to $0.0074 after phase four begins. This 20% growth makes UNIL one of the top altcoins to monitor this cycle. Trader Tardigrade: The Dogecoin Price May See a Pump Dogecoin (DOGE) is a meme coin that has recently seen some red price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the Dogecoin price fell nearly 15% in the past seven days. In that period, the value of Dogecoin dropped from around $0.22 to almost $0.19. However, market analyst Trader Tardigrade remains optimistic for Dogecoin (DOGE). According to his X post, the DOGE/BTC pair forms lower lows before every Dogecoin price pump. This signal has appeared again. Thus, Trader Tardigrade predicts a potential jump to $0.000025 for Dogecoin. Despite this bullish Dogecoin price prediction, some traders are still cautiously optimistic. Since it has a high market cap of around $30B, much new money must come for the Dogecoin price to skyrocket. As a result, traders are focusing on altcoins like UNIL instead of Dogecoin. Expert Predicts the Shiba Inu Price Could Surge Soon One of the meme coin titans, Shiba Inu (SHIB), has also seen some turbulence. On the one-week chart, the value of Shiba Inu fell from around $0.000014 to nearly $0.000012. In other words, the Shiba Inu price has dipped almost 10% in just a few short days. However, SHIB Possessor made a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction that turned some heads. In a recent post, he told his X community that he has a feeling this meme coin could pump like crazy soon. SHIB Possessor thinks the Shiba Inu price may soar to $0.00004. Although this statement has made some waves for Shiba Inu (SHIB), many investors are sidestepping it for UNIL. This could be because the Shiba Inu price has dipped nearly 50% in the past 12 months, so it may not sustain a long-term bullish upswing. What Makes Unilabs Finance (UNIL) Stand Out From Meme Coins Like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Although the Dogecoin price and the Shiba Inu price could see rebounds soon, the focus is shifting to Unilabs Finance (UNIL). Unlike these meme coins, which rely on buzz for price growth, UNIL has real utility. Moreover, holding UNIL can be a good investment for its passive income capabilities. Given that UNIL's market cap is lower than Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, it is more likely to gain in value in the long term. Therefore, traders are rushing to buy the UNIL altcoin in anticipation of a surge in value after listing.

The initiative highlights the company’s growing commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for measurable humanitarian purposes, with 2024 serving as a proof-of-concept phase and 2025 anticipated to be a period of broader implementation. Partnerships Supporting Emerging Market Innovation Ripple’s updated strategy, detailed in the company’s Impact Finance annual report, emphasizes partnerships with Mercy Corps Ventures, the International Rescue Committee, and the Lab for Inclusive Fintech at UC Berkeley. Through these collaborations, Ripple is deploying its blockchain infrastructure—specifically the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and RLUSD—to scale financial services that are accessible, affordable, and equitable across underserved regions. These efforts aim to demonstrate how decentralized technologies can enable financial resilience and expand economic opportunities in emerging markets. BREAKING: Ripple just quietly positioned $XRP + $RLUSD as the rails for global impact finance. $30M deployed. 15 pilots launched. 2024 was the test. 2025 is the takeover. #XRP isn’t just innovation. It’s domination. You still have time. For now. pic.twitter.com/JEo3x5XO9d — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 4, 2025 Capital Deployed and Pilot Programs Initiated According to the information included in Ripple’s publication , the company has granted $30 million to NGOs focused on impactful finance since 2018. In partnership with Mercy Corps Ventures, 15 startup investments and pilot programs have already been launched in various emerging markets. In addition, Ripple has committed $1 million specifically to the International Rescue Committee to support humanitarian use cases involving blockchain solutions. Finance Bull’s tweet, referencing this development, frames the current moment as a pivotal one for the adoption of XRP and RLUSD in real-world financial applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Positioning Blockchain at the Center of Global Development Ripple’s move comes as blockchain-based financial tools gain increasing relevance in humanitarian and development sectors, especially in regions where traditional banking infrastructure remains limited or unreliable. By deploying RLUSD and XRP within impact finance initiatives, Ripple is attempting to offer scalable, low-cost settlement infrastructure to organizations working in volatile or underserved environments. While 2024 was largely a pilot year to assess the efficacy of Ripple’s technology stack in humanitarian settings, the infrastructure now in place suggests a more aggressive rollout in 2025. The company’s continued collaboration with academic and non-profit partners adds a layer of credibility and expertise to its operations in this space. X Finance Bull’s remarks highlight the potential magnitude of this transition and suggest that the strategic use of blockchain in humanitarian finance may soon move from the periphery to the center of global development efforts.

According to a June 5 statement from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the agency is seeking to confiscate over $7.74 million in digital assets allegedly earned through illicit employment and laundering schemes designed to evade U.S. sanctions. The funds were initially frozen in April 2023 following the indictment of Sim Hyon Sop , a North Korean Foreign Trade Bank representative based in China, accused of conspiring with DPRK IT workers to funnel crypto earnings back to the regime. Authorities allege these funds were part of a coordinated laundering effort that included chain hopping, token swaps, and fictitious identities to obscure their origin. In its complaint filed in a Washington D.C. federal court, the DOJ has targeted multiple forms of digital property, including Bitcoin, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, and Ethereum Name Service domains. You might also like: Crypto exchange Kraken flags North Korean infiltration attempt through fake job application Officials allege these operations were part of a broader effort by North Korea to sidestep international sanctions and fund its weapons programme through cyber-enabled revenue streams. “Sanctions are in place against North Korea for a reason, and we will diligently investigate and prosecute anyone who tries to evade them. We will halt your progress, strike back, and take hold of any proceeds you obtained illegally,” U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro said in an accompanying statement. With DPRK-linked hackers reportedly stealing over $1.6 billion from crypto firms in 2024 alone, U.S. officials say more aggressive action is required. The DOJ’s latest Action is part of the broader “DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative,” launched in March 2024 to disrupt North Korea’s revenue-generation networks. A growing threat to crypto North Korean operatives have been linked to some of the largest cryptocurrency heists in recent years, with malicious IT workers increasingly playing a central role in breaching blockchain firms from the inside. Often operating under stolen or fabricated identities, these individuals secure remote jobs at crypto and tech companies, where they typically request payment in stablecoins like USDC and Tether, a tactic believed to help mask their true locations. Once employed, these positions provide a financial lifeline to the regime and, in some cases, access that can later be exploited. Illicit earnings from these roles are often funneled back to the regime through a web of laundering techniques, including fake accounts, small-value transfers, cross-chain swaps, and NFT purchases, before being rerouted, sometimes via sanctioned intermediaries like Chinyong , a company tied to North Korea’s Ministry of Defense. In recent years, North Korean IT workers have continued to expand their operations, adapting their tactics and shifting targets as enforcement efforts intensify . According to an April 2025 report from Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, North Korean IT operatives were increasingly targeting European blockchain firms after heightened scrutiny in the United States. The report detailed cases of DPRK workers building Solana smart contracts and job marketplaces in the UK, often using elaborate webs of fake references and identities to pass recruitment checks. Last month, cryptocurrency trading platform Kraken intercepted one such attempt when a job applicant raised red flags during the recruitment process. Further investigation revealed the candidate was a North Korean operative linked to a broader network of infiltrators who had already secured roles at other crypto firms.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI) , the DeFi venture backed by Donald Trump and his family, has issued a cease-and-desist letter to creators of the controversial wallet tied to the president’s crypto brand, according to a June 5 Bloomberg report. The letter was addressed to Fight Fight Fight LLC, the firm behind Trump-themed memecoin issuer ‘GetTrumpMemes.’ Earlier this week, the company announced the wallet launch in partnership with crypto service provider Magic Eden.

The Trump Organization has zero involvement with this wallet product,” the brothers wrote. Following the cease-and-desist, the wallet’s official website, TrumpWallet.com, which had been accepting sign-ups for a waitlist, has gone offline. However, promotional content from both GetTrumpMemes and Magic Eden remains live on their respective social media accounts. You might also like: Trump coin: Is another Trump-linked memecoin coming? Interestingly, Gettrumpmemes had maintained a cordial relationship with the Trump family and was even present at the recent exclusive dinner hosted by the president for his token’s top holders. The official memecoin website also suggests the firm is an affiliate of the Trump Organization, sharing ownership of 80% of the Trump cards supply. The ongoing dispute adds another layer of uncertainty to the Trump family’s involvement in crypto ventures, which has already come under the scrutiny of lawmakers and the broader public. While Donald Trump’s “crypto president” image has earned him popularity in the industry, questions persist about whether many of the initiatives tied to his name are genuine value-driven projects or just profit-driven schemes.

On June 5, the DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, the Solana Policy Institute, The Digital Chamber, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, and the Bitcoin Policy Institute issued a joint statement urging lawmakers to incorporate the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) into the broader Clarity Act. The groups argued that software developers and infrastructure providers behind non-custodial crypto platforms should not be classified as money transmitters. The coalition stressed that such developers “have little in common with traditional financial institutions and should not be treated as such,” warning that without these safeguards, US innovation in the crypto space could suffer and developers may face undue legal exposure. The groups are calling for the BRCA , reintroduced by Representatives Tom Emmer and Ritchie Torres, to be added as an amendment. BRCA would explicitly exempt developers of non-custodial, peer-to-peer software from money transmitter obligations under current financial laws. Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal, in an accompanying X post , said the coalition is closely watching for “the ever-present risk of unconstitutional surveillance requirements” in upcoming legislation. Agrawal noted that the BRCA would codify existing FinCEN guidance from 2013 and 2019, which clearly states that such developers are not money transmitters, criticising recent actions in cases against Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet , where the Department of Justice disregarded it. With bipartisan backing from Representatives Emmer and Torres, Agrawal stated that the bill is “ready to pass” and offers a straightforward, nonpartisan solution to a growing legal threat. What is the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act? The Clarity Act, introduced in May 2025, would establish a formal regulatory structure for digital assets in the United States by defining the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission while also distinguishing between digital commodities and securities. The bill also outlines regulations around stablecoins, custody, and investor protections, with the goal of keeping crypto firms and capital within the country. Representative French Hill, one of the sponsors, said the legislation would help ensure the US fosters crypto innovation without compromising oversight. But despite growing support for regulatory clarity, internal divisions in Congress have already begun to complicate the bill’s progress. During a June 4 House hearing, the bill sparked partisan disagreements . Democrats accused the SEC of providing Republicans with private written analysis while offering minimal and unhelpful technical assistance to their side. There are also concerns among Democrats that the Clarity Act could reduce the SEC’s oversight and allow traditional finance firms to exploit regulatory gaps by posing as crypto businesses. They argue this may increase risks to consumers. Supporters, on the other hand, argue that the real risk lies in overregulating the wrong actors. At the same hearing, Uniswap Labs CLO Katherine Minarik warned that expanding money transmitter rules to cover non-custodial platforms presents “a profound threat” that could stifle innovation. Congressman Tom Emmer echoed the concern, noting that developers “who never touch users’ funds” still face “potential questions of liability,” warned that without clear legal boundaries, the US risks driving talent and crypto development offshore. The fate of the bill now lies in the upcoming markup session, scheduled by the House Financial Services Committee for June 10, where lawmakers are expected to debate and potentially amend the legislation before it moves forward in the legislative process.

Fresh data indicates a significant decrease in the total value held, raising questions about the appetite for digital assets among large financial entities. Understanding the drivers behind this change is crucial for anyone tracking the integration of cryptocurrency into traditional finance. Understanding the Drop in Institutional Bitcoin Holdings According to a recent CoinShares report , based on SEC 13-F filings, institutional holdings in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced their first quarterly decline since their highly anticipated launch in January 2024. The total value held by these institutions dropped from $27.4 billion at the end of Q4 2024 to $21.2 billion by the close of Q1 2025. This represents a 23% decrease over the three-month period. While a 23% drop might sound alarming on the surface, it’s essential to look beyond the headline number to understand the nuances of institutional behavior in the Crypto Market . Was it a Sell-Off? Analyzing the BTC Price Impact The primary driver behind the decline in the dollar value of institutional Bitcoin ETF holdings was not a mass exodus of investors. CoinShares highlighted that a substantial portion of the decrease in assets under management (AUM) was attributable to the performance of the underlying asset itself – Bitcoin. The BTC price experienced an 11% drop during Q1 2025. When the price of an asset within an ETF declines, the total dollar value of the ETF’s holdings naturally decreases, even if the number of shares held remains constant or changes only slightly. Consider this: If an institution held 1,000 shares of a Bitcoin ETF. If each share represented a certain amount of BTC, and the BTC price fell by 11%. The dollar value of that institution’s holding would also fall, even if they didn’t sell a single share. This suggests that while some selling did occur, a significant part of the 23% drop was a passive effect of market price fluctuations rather than aggressive liquidation. Different Strategies: How Institutional Investors Approached Q1 The CoinShares report provided further insight by differentiating the actions of various types of institutional investors. This paints a more detailed picture of the evolving institutional approach to Bitcoin ETF investments: Hedge Funds: These investors, often known for more active trading strategies and shorter time horizons, significantly trimmed their stakes. Their holdings reportedly dropped by nearly a third. This move is likely indicative of profit-taking, especially given the strong performance of Bitcoin leading up to and immediately after the ETF launches. Hedge funds may capitalize on gains and reallocate capital elsewhere. Financial Advisors (RIAs – Registered Investment Advisors): In contrast to hedge funds, financial advisors managing client portfolios appeared to increase their holdings in BTC terms. While the dollar value may have decreased due to price, their actual allocation to Bitcoin, measured in the amount of BTC held via the ETFs, increased. This behavior suggests a more long-term perspective, potentially viewing the price dip as an opportunity to accumulate or continuing a planned strategy of gradually introducing clients to Bitcoin exposure. This divergence highlights the different roles and strategies within the Institutional Bitcoin landscape. Hedge funds might be trading the volatility, while financial advisors are potentially building long-term strategic allocations for their clients. What Does This CoinShares Report Signal for the Crypto Market? The data from the CoinShares report offers several key takeaways for the broader Crypto Market : Price Sensitivity: The AUM of Bitcoin ETFs is highly sensitive to the underlying BTC price . This is a fundamental characteristic of commodity-backed ETFs but is particularly pronounced with Bitcoin’s volatility. Divergent Institutional Behavior: Not all institutions are acting in unison. Understanding the difference between speculative short-term plays (like some hedge funds) and longer-term strategic allocations (like some financial advisors) is crucial. Gradual Adoption Continues: The increase in BTC terms by financial advisors suggests that the process of integrating Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios is still underway, albeit perhaps slower or more nuanced than initially anticipated by some. This indicates continued underlying demand for Institutional Bitcoin exposure through regulated products. Importance of 13-F Filings: SEC 13-F filings provide valuable, albeit slightly delayed, insights into the actual holdings of significant institutional players, offering a glimpse into how they are positioning themselves in the Crypto Market . While the 23% drop in dollar value might seem like a setback, a deeper look reveals a market adjusting to price movements and different types of institutions executing distinct strategies. The continued accumulation by financial advisors, in particular, points to ongoing, deliberate allocation towards Bitcoin within traditional finance. Conclusion: Navigating the Institutional Bitcoin Landscape The Q1 2025 data on Institutional Bitcoin ETF holdings, as detailed in the CoinShares report , presents a complex picture. The overall decline in dollar value was largely a function of the BTC price correction, not a panic sell-off. Crucially, the data reveals a split in institutional behavior, with hedge funds taking profits while financial advisors potentially increased their exposure in terms of Bitcoin quantity. This suggests that while short-term trading activity exists, the underlying trend of long-term allocation to Bitcoin ETF products by certain segments of traditional finance continues. Monitoring future 13-F filings and BTC price movements will be key to understanding the ongoing evolution of institutional involvement in the Crypto Market .

You can always spot the crypto CMO. They’re the ones with a twitch in their eye, a forced smile, and at least one draft email trying to explain (against all odds) why this company is a ‘game-changer.’ Meanwhile, the CFO treats marketing like an optional subscription he forgot to cancel. The CEO is pitching ‘the next big thing,’ which sounds suspiciously like the last big thing. The investors? Already out, sipping cocktails somewhere tax-friendly. You might also like: Hibernating when the market slows down? Think twice about your crypto PR strategy | Opinion Every early-stage crypto company sounds big until you realize you’ve walked into a crime scene armed with a Canva subscription and an espresso machine. So what’s it like to do the job? What are the actual challenges that crypto CMOs face? And most importantly, how can you avoid rehearsing your ‘lessons learned’ LinkedIn post ahead of schedule? Let’s dive in. Follow the money (or lack thereof) Before you start dreaming up campaigns, take a hard look at the business. Does it actually make money, or is it surviving on investor fumes and venture capital optimism? Start by grilling the CEO and CFO, as if your career depends on it, because it does. If they start sweating at basic financial questions, congratulations: you’re about to join a company that expects marketing to ‘figure out growth strategy’ while finance figures out how to delay payroll. Here’s what you need to grasp: What’s the burn rate, and how long is the runway? ( Translation : Are they casually setting cash on fire, and how long before the CFO starts rationing office coffee?) Are they reliant on hype cycles, token speculation, or ‘the next bull run’ as a revenue strategy? (Because if that’s the case, you’ll also need a personal risk strategy.) What happens when investor money dries up? ( Spoiler alert: Marketing budgets get slashed first.) Abandon hope if… The founders dodge financial questions like a bad Tinder date dodges commitment. Burn rate is high, but break-even is an ideological goal, not a financial one. Revenue is like a UFO sighting—there are reports, but nobody’s ever actually seen it. User acquisition is aggressive, but nobody has a plan to make those users profitable. Reality check: In crypto, companies move fast, but not all movement is forward. If revenue is a ‘future concern,’ so is your paycheck. If the financials are ugly, marketing is always the first to get squeezed. You’ll be asked to “do more with less” until there’s nothing left to do. Scaling a business or inflating a valuation? Early-stage crypto companies live and die by their investors. Some understand that real growth takes time, others just want vanity metrics slapped onto a slide deck so they can vanish before reality catches up. So, before you start plotting a marketing strategy, ask: Are investors prioritizing sustainable growth, or is this just about inflating numbers for the next funding round? ( Translation : Are we building a business or just making the deck look pretty?) How does the company define “traction”? (If growth is measured in active community members and Twitter likes, congratulations, you’re about to become the Head of Discord.) Abandon hope if… The investor list looks like a rug-pull leaderboard. All short-term speculators, no long-term vision. They blew half the marketing budget on a YouTuber who mispronounced the company name. Marketing is expected to ‘build momentum’ while the engineers are still arguing about which chain to build on. Reality check: They might assure you the product is ‘on track,’ but so was the Titanic before it hit the iceberg. If investors are obsessed with traction but allergic to business models, and the real goal is securing the next funding round, you’re not scaling a company, you’re just inflating a valuation. WAGMI? Maybe. But first, show me the business model A crypto company without a working business model is just a very expensive science experiment. So, before you start crafting campaigns, you need to know: Does this project have a real, sustainable business model, or is it running on bull market prayers? Is monetization an actual plan, or is it a “later problem”? (If it’s the latter, you’re not a CMO, you’re just the exit liquidity wrapped in a fancy job title.) Is marketing expected to generate revenue because the product isn’t? ( Translation : Am I here to build a brand or to perform financial CPR?) Abandon hope if… They claim to be “pre-revenue,” but they’ve been around for three years. The monetization plan is “TBD,” but they’re already hiring influencers and running PR campaigns. The business model is a mystery, but marketing is expected to ‘unlock new revenue streams.’ Reality check: Here’s the hard truth: No working business model is what economists call a “dead business.” In crypto, we call it “the future of finance.” No amount of creative genius can save a company built on wishful thinking. If their entire revenue strategy is “wait for mass adoption,” then your marketing plan is “wait for your next job.” Regulatory risks: Are we a business or a future case study? Crypto is a regulatory minefield, and marketing often gets caught in the crossfire. If a company isn’t legally compliant, you’re not taking a marketing job, you’re volunteering to be the spokesperson when the regulators come knocking. And when they do, don’t expect the CEO to stick around for the press release. So, here’s what you have to understand: Where does the company operate, and who are its primary users? (So you know if you need to market to traders, institutions, or your future cellmates.) How does the product fit within evolving regulations? ( Translation : Do you need a legal disclaimer under every campaign?) What’s the legal team’s involvement in marketing? (Because the last thing you need is launching a campaign only to have the SEC slide into your DMs.) Abandon hope if… The answers about compliance are vague, overly optimistic, or “we’re working on it.” The company is operating in regulatory gray zones with no clear jurisdiction. The legal team seems… nonexistent. (Or consists of one overworked generalist who mostly writes disclaimers.) Reality check: Crypto regulation is like gravity, it doesn’t care whether you believe in it. If compliance is treated as a “later problem,” assume it’s already a problem, and marketing is just painting a target on your back. Just remember: When regulators come knocking, the CEO will be on a “scheduled media blackout,” and you’ll be the one issuing a statement. The highest-paid yes man: Do you have real authority? Chief Marketing Officer sounds important. It suggests strategy, influence, and leadership. But in crypto, it often means sitting through a monologue where the CEO explains marketing to you, usually referencing: Elon Musk’s Twitter antics, “Community-driven growth” (translation: free marketing), How Apple “never needed ads.” Your job? Nod, smile, and mentally prepare for the moment they ask if you can ‘growth-hack’ your way to free customer acquisition. Then, when they finally pause for breath, you casually mention that Steve Jobs spent over $100 million on marketing in the first year of the iMac. So, before you sign up, establish: Do you actually have decision-making power, or just here to execute the CEO’s gut instincts? Is marketing a strategic function or just an afterthought? Who owns the budget, brand, and growth strategy? Abandon hope if… The CEO thinks marketing is just “community growth” (translation: free). The board thinks branding is a logo. Every decision requires five meetings and a founder’s mood check. Growth is your responsibility, but you have no authority over budget, hiring, or strategy. Reality check: A CMO title means nothing if you have no control over strategy, budget, or priorities. If leadership sees marketing as a necessary evil, expect every strategy meeting to feel like explaining TikTok to your dad. And if you’re expected to ‘own growth’ but have no authority to make real decisions, you’re just there to execute someone else’s gut instincts, and every major decision is made in a Telegram group chat you’re not in. What it takes to make it Marketing in crypto isn’t for the faint of heart. One day, you’re building a brand. Next, you’re explaining to the CFO why marketing isn’t a luxury expense. Then, before you know it, you’re on Twitter damage control because the CEO just called regulators “haters” in all caps. Five rules to stay sane: Secure budget and decision-making authority upfront. Push for KPIs tied to real revenue, not vanity metrics. Involve legal early, because no campaign is worth a subpoena. Stay realistic, marketing can’t fix a broken business model. If the founders can’t answer tough financial questions, run. At the end of the day, in crypto, only the smart money survives. The dumb money? Well, they hire a CMO to fix the unfixable. If you thrive on unpredictability, if you see opportunity where others see chaos, if you can turn a vague roadmap into a compelling vision, you’ve found the perfect job. If not? Well, there’s always web2.

After plunging 45.3% in Q1 , ETH rebounded with a 34.9% gain this quarter , including a staggering 41.1% surge in May —the highest monthly return of the year. But June has started on a quieter note. So far, ETH is down 2.61% , and market momentum appears weak. Still, a whopping $2 million call option bet is shaking up sentiment—hinting at a potential breakout by month’s end. $2 Million Ethereum Bet Fuels Bullish Sentiment According to reports, a high-stakes trader spent $2 million in premiums to buy 61,000 ETH call options , set to expire at the end of June . The strike prices? $3,200 and $3,400 —over 30% higher than Ethereum’s current price of $2,465 . This bold move suggests strong conviction that Ethereum will rally sharply in the coming weeks. Ethereum Price Action: Why Optimism? At the start of June, ETH was priced at $2,526 . It briefly surged to $2,678 on June 4, before dipping to $2,413 the next day—a 7.41% drop . Despite the correction, investor sentiment remains bullish . Many analysts believe ETH can break the $3,000 resistance this month, backed by growing institutional interest and major network upgrades. What’s Fueling Confidence in Ethereum? Ethereum’s Pectara upgrade , launched on May 7 , has significantly improved scalability. Key features include: Raising the validator cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH Doubling data capacity EIP-7702 implementation, enabling smart contract features for regular wallets According to Youwei Yang , Ph.D., Chief Economist at BIT Mining , these upgrades demonstrate Ethereum’s focus on long-term network efficiency—boosting investor confidence.

Analysts think that if wider market trends continue, Shiba Inu could have a bullish breakout. As Shibarium Layer 2 is upgraded further and SHIB gets more involved in the DeFi scene, it changes from being just a meme token to a serious contender to become one of the top cryptocurrencies. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing well in the presale, quickly catching attention as the next major player in DeFi. Over $10 million has been raised and the project now has 11700 holders. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Outlook for June 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently available at $0.00001322 which is 0.03% higher than yesterday’s price. In spite of market movements, SHIB still holds its place as one of the top cryptos to purchase, particularly for people who want an inexpensive way to begin investing in crypto. Analysts expect that the value of SHIB may hit $0.00001825 by early July, but only if the market stays positive and the SHIB ecosystem keeps developing. But indicators point to a fact that SHIB could see more short-term movements, as it has just dropped beneath important support lines. People who invest should keep an eye on how the market is doing. Also, new altcoins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are being noticed as possible profitable investments in the growing crypto market. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built to avoid depeg risks. Thanks to the safe, open and Certik-audited nature of this project, blockchain investors enjoy stability. Through the merger of modern finance tech and powerful infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is turning the future of decentralized finance upside down. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.9 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,700 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. From the investors 10 will be chosen to share a $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the project from the beginning. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to strengthen its utility through Shibarium and maintain its affordability, it remains a solid choice for investors seeking long-term potential in the meme coin sector. However, the spotlight is increasingly shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is quickly becoming a major player in the DeFi space. Having raised over $10 million and attracted more than 11,700 holders, MUTM is proving its momentum ahead of launch. Its hybrid lending model, Certik-audited security, and early investor rewards demonstrate strong fundamentals and innovation.

Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price gained minor selling demand after sellers gained control and plunged the price below $0.000011. This was triggered by the recent low buying activity and increasing profit-taking sentiment. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A whale moved 500 billion $PEPE worth $3.85M to Binance after facing a huge $450,000 loss for holding $PEPE for 40 days. PEPE Price Prediction June 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) June 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

The mood in the crypto world can shift quickly, and a key indicator just flashed a warning sign. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , a popular tool for gauging overall market sentiment, has taken a notable dip, moving firmly into the ‘Fear Zone’. This shift is prompting many investors and traders to reassess their positions and strategies. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Let’s start with the basics. What exactly is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index ? Provided by software development platform Alternative, this index is designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a barometer for investor psychology. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are highly worried, potentially panic selling. This can sometimes signal a potential buying opportunity for contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is negative, caution prevails. People are hesitant to buy, and selling pressure might increase. This is the zone the market has just entered. 50-50: Neutral – The market is balanced, neither overly fearful nor overly greedy. 51-74: Greed – Investors are getting optimistic and excited. Prices are often rising, attracting more buyers. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is euphoric, potentially overheated. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is high, and this can sometimes precede a market correction. The core idea behind the index is based on the principle that excessive fear can drive prices below their intrinsic value, while excessive greed can inflate prices into bubble territory. By measuring these emotions, the index aims to give investors a snapshot of the market’s psychological state. What Factors Influence the Index and Crypto Market Sentiment ? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from analyzing six different weighted factors. Understanding these components helps us appreciate why the index moves and how different market dynamics contribute to overall Crypto Market Sentiment . Here are the factors and their weightings: Volatility (25%): This measures how much the price of Bitcoin (and to some extent, other major cryptocurrencies) fluctuates compared to its average levels. High volatility often indicates a nervous market, contributing to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to average levels over the past 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greed, while high selling volume in a falling market suggests fear. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes posts on social media platforms (primarily Twitter, now X) for specific terms and their frequency. A rapid increase in posts about crypto, especially with certain keywords, can indicate growing interest and potential greed, or panic depending on the context. Surveys (15%): While currently paused by the index provider, historically, polls were conducted to gather investor opinions directly. High survey participation and bullish responses would indicate greed, while low participation and bearish responses would suggest fear. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin Dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be selling altcoins and moving back into the relative safety of Bitcoin during uncertain times. Conversely, falling dominance can suggest growing confidence in altcoins, indicating greed or a shift in market dynamics. Google Trends (10%): The index analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in search interest, especially for terms like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “buy crypto,” can signal increasing retail interest and potential greed. Searches related to crashes or selling might indicate fear. Each of these factors provides a piece of the puzzle, and together they paint a broader picture of the prevailing mood in the crypto market. The Current Situation: Index Falls to 45, Entering the Fear Zone As of June 6th, the index registered a value of 45. This wasn’t just a small dip; it represented a significant 12-point drop from the previous day’s reading. This movement pushed the index from the ‘Neutral’ or lower ‘Greed’ zone squarely into the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49). A 12-point drop in a single day is quite substantial and indicates a rapid shift in market sentiment. What could be driving this change? Several factors might be at play: Recent Price Action: Have major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced downward price pressure? Significant drops often trigger fear. Macroeconomic News: Global economic indicators, inflation data, interest rate outlooks, or changes in traditional markets can spill over into crypto. Regulatory Uncertainty: News about potential regulations or enforcement actions from governments can spook investors. Specific Crypto News: Negative news related to exchanges, projects, hacks, or prominent figures can also impact sentiment. Without looking at the specific market events leading up to June 6th, we can infer that a combination of these elements likely contributed to the rapid decline in the index score and the move into the Fear Zone . Implications of Being in the Fear Zone : What Does History Tell Us? So, the index is at 45, indicating fear. What does this typically mean for the market? Historically, periods of high fear (especially extreme fear) have often coincided with market bottoms or periods just before a significant price rebound. The famous quote, “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,” often comes to mind here. However, it’s crucial to understand that the index is not a crystal ball. Being in the Fear Zone does not guarantee a market bounce is imminent. It simply reflects the current emotional state. Extended periods of fear can occur during prolonged bear markets. Potential implications include: Increased Selling Pressure: Fearful investors are more likely to sell their holdings, potentially driving prices down further. Reduced Buying Interest: New money may be hesitant to enter the market during times of fear. Potential Contrarian Opportunity: Experienced traders or long-term investors who believe in the underlying technology might view the fear-driven price dips as opportunities to buy assets at a discount. Higher Volatility: Emotional markets can be more volatile, with sharp price swings in both directions. Looking back at historical charts of the index alongside Bitcoin’s price action can provide valuable context, but past performance is never indicative of future results. How Traders and Investors Use the Index How do participants in the crypto market actually utilize the Crypto Fear and Greed Index ? It’s primarily used as a sentiment indicator and often as a potential contrarian signal: Sentiment Check: It provides a quick, easy-to-understand overview of the market mood. Is everyone euphoric (potential top)? Or is everyone panicking (potential bottom)? Contrarian Tool: Some traders use high fear levels as a signal to consider buying or increasing their positions, betting that the market’s emotional reaction is overblown. Conversely, extreme greed might be seen as a signal to take profits or reduce exposure. Confirmation: Investors might use the index to confirm signals they are getting from other forms of analysis (technical analysis, fundamental analysis). If technical indicators suggest a potential bottom and the index is showing extreme fear, it might add conviction to a buying decision. Risk Management: During periods of extreme greed, the index can serve as a reminder that the market might be getting frothy and risk is increasing. During periods of extreme fear, it might highlight potential opportunities but also the risk of further downside if the fear is justified by underlying issues. It’s vital to remember that the index is just one tool among many. Relying solely on the Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions is generally not recommended. A comprehensive strategy should include technical analysis, fundamental analysis, understanding market structure, and managing risk effectively. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Sentiment Let’s take a closer look at the Bitcoin Dominance factor. Why is Bitcoin’s share of the total market cap included in a general crypto sentiment index? Bitcoin is the largest and most established cryptocurrency, often seen as the benchmark for the entire market. Its dominance level can reveal underlying trends about investor confidence. When Bitcoin Dominance rises, it can suggest that investors are rotating out of smaller, riskier altcoins and consolidating their positions in Bitcoin. This flight to perceived safety often occurs during periods of market uncertainty or fear. Conversely, when dominance falls, it can indicate that investors are becoming more comfortable taking on risk, moving capital into altcoins in search of potentially higher returns, which is typical of periods of increasing greed or a bullish altcoin market cycle. So, an increase in Bitcoin Dominance can contribute to a lower Fear & Greed Index score, reflecting a more cautious or fearful market environment as capital concentrates in the market leader. Addressing Crypto Volatility and Its Impact Crypto Volatility is another major component, weighted at a significant 25%. The cryptocurrency market is known for its rapid and often dramatic price swings. High volatility can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, high volatility is what attracts many traders looking for quick profits. On the other hand, sharp downward movements fueled by high volatility can quickly erode confidence and trigger panic selling, contributing significantly to the ‘Fear’ side of the index. Similarly, rapid upward movements can fuel FOMO and contribute to ‘Greed’. The index specifically looks at volatility relative to average levels. If prices are swinging much more wildly than usual, regardless of direction initially, it signals an unstable market, which often leans towards increasing fear due to the heightened risk. Understanding Crypto Volatility is crucial for anyone participating in this market, and its inclusion in the index highlights how central it is to investor psychology and market sentiment. Challenges and Limitations of the Index While a useful tool, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is not without its limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index often reflects sentiment that has already been influenced by price action. It doesn’t necessarily predict future moves, but rather summarizes the current state. Simplified View: It combines diverse factors into a single number, potentially oversimplifying complex market dynamics. Weighting Subjectivity: The specific weightings assigned to each factor (25% for volatility, 10% for Google Trends, etc.) are determined by the index creators and could potentially be adjusted or debated. Data Sources: Reliance on specific data sources (like certain social media platforms or Google Trends) means the index is only as good as the data it consumes. Not a Trading Signal on Its Own: As mentioned, it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Market bottoms can occur even when the index isn’t at extreme fear, and tops can form without hitting extreme greed. Investors should use the index as supplementary information to complement their own research and analysis, not as a definitive buy or sell signal. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Fear Zone With the index now in the Fear Zone , how might you approach the market? Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Periods of fear can see further price declines. Ensure your portfolio is aligned with your comfort level for risk. Revisit Your Investment Thesis: Are you a long-term holder? Does the current price action change your fundamental view of the assets you hold or are considering buying? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For many, entering or adding to positions during periods of fear using a DCA strategy (investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price) can be a disciplined approach to potentially benefit from lower prices without trying to perfectly time the bottom. Look for Opportunities (Cautiously): If you are a contrarian investor, the Fear Zone might present potential buying opportunities for assets you’ve researched. However, exercise caution and do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions often lead to poor outcomes. If you have a long-term strategy, a dip into the Fear Zone might not be a reason to abandon it. Stay Informed: Understand what specific news or market events might be driving the current fear. Is it temporary FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or are there fundamental concerns? Ultimately, how you react to the index being in the Fear Zone depends entirely on your personal investment strategy, goals, and risk profile. It’s a prompt to pay closer attention and make informed decisions, not an automatic signal to act. Conclusion: A Barometer for Market Mood The drop in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 45 and its entry into the ‘Fear’ zone is a significant development reflecting a clear shift in market sentiment. Driven by factors including Crypto Volatility , market momentum, social media trends, Bitcoin Dominance , and search interest, the index provides a valuable, albeit simplified, snapshot of the market’s emotional state. While periods of fear have historically presented opportunities for contrarian investors, being in the Fear Zone does not guarantee an imminent price recovery. It signals caution, increased selling pressure, and reduced buying interest are currently prevalent. Savvy market participants use this index as one tool among many to gauge the mood, confirm other signals, and inform their risk management strategies. As always, navigating the crypto market requires careful research, a clear strategy, and avoiding decisions based solely on emotion.

According to a recent CoinShares report, institutional exposure to Bitcoin via ETFs dropped from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024 to $21.2 billion in Q1 2025—a significant 23% decrease. The report, compiled from filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), noted that the reduction was largely due to an 11% quarter-over-quarter decline in BTC price. However, some investors also appeared to actively reduce their positions, suggesting that both valuation pressures and strategic profit-taking contributed to the fall. Treasury Demand Offsets ETF Outflows While many professional money managers stepped back, financial advisers bucked the trend by slightly increasing their Bitcoin holdings during the same period. More notably, Bitcoin’s growing role in corporate treasuries gained momentum. CoinShares observed that the quarter was driven less by speculative ETF investments and more by corporations acquiring BTC for reserve and treasury use—a long-term strategic pivot rather than a short-term gain approach. Bitcoin treasury companies now collectively hold more than 1.98 million BTC, an 18.6% increase since the start of the year. SaylorTracker data shows that the largest Bitcoin-holding corporation, Strategy, accumulated Bitcoin during 17 of the 20 weeks leading up to June 2025. On May 30, BlackRock’s IBIT marked its largest single-day outflow, with over $430 million withdrawn—ending a 31-day streak of continuous inflows. This sudden reversal underscores the fragile sentiment among institutional investors amid broader market volatility. Analysts Weigh Future Drivers of Bitcoin Price Despite mixed ETF flows so far in 2025, some analysts argue that BTC’s long-term potential may not hinge entirely on ETF demand. With U.S. bond yields on the rise and investor trust in government securities showing signs of weakening, BTC could benefit from its reputation as a hedge against traditional financial instability. In summary, the Q1 decline in institutional Bitcoin ETF holdings reflects a complex mix of market correction, risk-aversion, and evolving investor strategies. Yet the increased corporate adoption suggests that Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value continues to strengthen—even if institutional ETFs are temporarily losing steam.

NEAR Protocol has demonstrated resilience amid this volatility, recovering from a sharp 5.2% decline to establish support at $2.42. The recent price action shows promising signs of accumulation, with increasing volume on the second test of support forming a potential double bottom pattern on short time frames. This technical structure, combined with the successful break above the $2.46-$2.47 resistance zone, suggests buyers are regaining control despite broader market turbulence. NEAR's recovery may indicate growing institutional confidence in blockchain infrastructure projects with real-world utility. Technical Analysis NEAR-USD exhibited substantial volatility over a 24-hour period, with a range of 0.132 (5.2%) between the high of 2.547 and low of 2.415. The asset experienced a sharp decline during the 20:00 hour on June 4th, establishing a key support level at 2.423 with above-average volume of 2.69M. A potential double bottom pattern formed with increasing volume on the second test of support, suggesting accumulation at lower levels. Resistance established around 2.462-2.470, with the current recovery approaching this critical zone. In the last hour, NEAR-USD demonstrated significant bullish momentum, climbing from 2.433 to 2.455, representing a 0.9% gain. Price action formed a clear uptrend with notable volume spikes at 07:15 (206K) and 07:37 (120K), indicating strong buyer interest. A temporary peak of 2.462 was reached at 07:34 before a sharp pullback to 2.445, establishing a new support level. Recovery from this dip culminated in a final push to 2.458 at 07:54, followed by consolidation around 2.455.

You’re not alone. The latest reading from a key market indicator sheds light on the current state of the Crypto Market , and it points towards a familiar pattern: Bitcoin Season . What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index , a valuable metric tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, provides a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It helps investors understand whether the market is currently favoring Bitcoin or the myriad of other digital assets, collectively known as altcoins. Here’s a breakdown of how it works: It compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. A high score (typically 75 or above) indicates Altcoin Season , meaning 75% or more of these top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. A low score (typically 25 or below) signals Bitcoin Season , where 25% or fewer of these altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the same period. Scores between 25 and 75 suggest a more neutral or mixed market phase. Understanding whether we are in Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season is crucial because it can significantly influence investment strategies and potential returns. During Altcoin Season , many altcoins can see massive percentage gains, often far exceeding Bitcoin’s performance. Conversely, during Bitcoin Season , Bitcoin tends to consolidate its dominance, and while altcoins might still rise, their gains are often more modest relative to BTC, or they may even lose value against Bitcoin. Current State: Altcoin Season Index at 23 Confirms Bitcoin Season As of June 6th, the Altcoin Season Index registered a value of 23. This reading, remaining unchanged from the previous day, firmly places the market in Bitcoin Season according to the index’s criteria. This means that over the last 90 days, a significant majority of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed compared to Bitcoin. This data aligns with the observed market behavior over recent months, where Bitcoin has often led rallies and shown relative strength during pullbacks, maintaining or increasing its market dominance. While individual altcoins may experience pumps due to specific news or developments, the broad market trend, as indicated by the index, favors Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: What’s the Difference? These two market phases represent different dynamics within the Cryptocurrency ecosystem. Let’s look at the key distinctions: Bitcoin Season Characteristics: Bitcoin typically shows stronger performance relative to most altcoins. Bitcoin’s market dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) often increases or remains high. Investor focus tends to be more on Bitcoin as the primary store of value or growth asset. Altcoins may still see gains, but they often lag behind BTC or experience larger drawdowns during corrections. This phase can occur during periods of market uncertainty, initial stages of a bull run (where money flows into BTC first), or when Bitcoin-specific narratives (like halving events or institutional adoption) are dominant. Altcoin Season Characteristics: A large percentage of altcoins (especially smaller caps) experience significant price pumps. Bitcoin’s market dominance often decreases as capital flows from BTC into altcoins. Investor sentiment is typically highly bullish and speculative across the altcoin market. This phase often occurs after Bitcoin has had a significant run-up and investors start looking for higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. Narratives around specific sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI tokens, etc.) often drive different waves of altcoin pumps within a broader Altcoin Season. Understanding which season we are in is not about predicting the future with certainty, but rather about recognizing the prevailing market conditions and adjusting strategies accordingly. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 23, indicating a firm Bitcoin Season , what might this mean for investors? Here are some considerations: 1. Focus on Bitcoin Strength: In a Bitcoin Season, Bitcoin itself is often the strongest performer. This might be a time to prioritize exposure to BTC or observe its price action closely as a leading indicator for the broader Crypto Market . 2. Altcoin Underperformance: Be prepared for many altcoins to potentially underperform Bitcoin. While selective altcoin investments can still yield returns, the broad-based, explosive gains seen in Altcoin Season are less likely for the majority of the market. 3. Selective Altcoin Strategy: Instead of a broad altcoin portfolio, focus on specific projects with strong fundamentals, upcoming catalysts (upgrades, partnerships, etc.), or unique narratives that might allow them to buck the general trend. 4. Risk Management: Bitcoin Season can sometimes be followed by periods of consolidation or correction. Maintain appropriate risk management, consider setting stop losses, and avoid over-leveraging, especially on altcoins that may be more volatile. 5. Accumulation Opportunity? For long-term investors, periods of Bitcoin dominance and subsequent altcoin underperformance could present opportunities to accumulate positions in favored altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. 6. Watch for Shifts: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A sustained move upwards in the index (towards 75) and a decrease in Bitcoin dominance could signal a potential shift back towards Altcoin Season . When Might Altcoin Season Return? Predicting the exact timing of market shifts is impossible, but historical cycles provide some clues. Typically, Altcoin Season tends to follow significant upward movements in Bitcoin’s price. Once Bitcoin has made substantial gains and potentially consolidated, capital often flows down the risk curve into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Factors that could potentially trigger a return to Altcoin Season include: A period of sideways consolidation or slight correction for Bitcoin after a major rally. Increased positive news and development milestones across various altcoin ecosystems. Growing investor confidence and risk appetite in the broader financial markets. Specific sector rotations within crypto (e.g., a surge in DeFi tokens, gaming tokens, etc.). However, until the Altcoin Season Index shows a sustained move above the 25 threshold and ideally towards 75, the prevailing winds in the Cryptocurrency market are likely to favor Bitcoin. Conclusion: Navigating the Seasons The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 23 clearly indicates that the Crypto Market is experiencing Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin’s relative strength and the general underperformance of many altcoins. While this doesn’t mean altcoins won’t see any gains, it suggests a strategic approach is needed, perhaps focusing more on Bitcoin or being highly selective with altcoin investments. Staying informed about market indicators like the Altcoin Season Index is essential for navigating the cyclical nature of the Cryptocurrency space. By understanding the current season, investors can better position themselves and manage expectations, whether patiently waiting for the next Altcoin Season or capitalizing on Bitcoin’s current dominance.

Now cleared of all charges, Gambaryan confirmed in a recent interview that Friday, June 6 will mark his final day at Binance. Tigran Gambaryan Bids Farewell to Binance After Nigeria Clears Charge In February 2024 , Tigran Gambaryan—once a top agent at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service—was arrested alongside a colleague during a business trip to Nigeria. The arrest sparked international attention and backlash from Binance. Binance CEO Richard Teng later accused Nigerian officials of corruption, claiming that they had sought a “secret payment” to resolve the case. Nigerian authorities denied the allegation but eventually dropped the charges in October 2024 . Now in 2025 , Gambaryan has chosen to exit the crypto giant. Binance Honors Gambaryan’s Contributions to Crypto Compliance In an emotional company-wide farewell, Binance expressed gratitude for Gambaryan’s service. A Binance spokesperson stated: “We are deeply grateful for his dedication in transforming our financial crimes compliance organization. Thanks to his tireless efforts, the crypto industry is safer for all.” From “Crypto Wizard” to Binance Compliance Lead Before joining Binance in 2021 , Gambaryan was renowned as a “crypto wizard” in U.S. law enforcement circles for his success in tracing illicit blockchain transactions. At Binance, he focused on strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks and collaborated closely with global law enforcement agencies in seizing illicit digital assets. His departure comes as Binance navigates through multiple regulatory challenges worldwide. SEC vs Binance: Legal Battle Comes to an End The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance in June 2023 , accusing the exchange and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of misusing customer funds and violating securities laws. In November 2023 , Binance and CZ pleaded guilty to separate charges and paid a combined $4.3 billion in penalties. CZ was also fined $50 million and served four months in a U.S. prison, following his resignation as CEO. CZ Seeks Presidential Pardon from Trump In May 2025 , Changpeng Zhao revealed that he had formally applied for a presidential pardon from former President Donald Trump. After major media outlets including the Wall Street Journal reported on the move, CZ confirmed: “If they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply.” Zhao is now shifting focus, helping Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan develop crypto regulatory frameworks and blockchain adoption strategies.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 09:40:45

While many investors chase fleeting meme coin pumps, seasoned traders are shifting focus to utility-first projects built to last. Nexchain has managed to break through the noise by offering something more than speculative upside—it’s delivering the foundations of a new AI-integrated blockchain era. From AI smart contracts to on-chain automation, Nexchain positions itself as a leading contender for those scouting the best crypto presale to invest in before the next bull wave. Nexchain: Powering a Smarter, Faster, and Fairer Future With a presale that’s already raised over $3.9 million, Nexchain is being hailed as a serious contender for 2025’s most impactful blockchain project. Its value proposition starts with architecture—Nexchain is a Layer-1 protocol built from the ground up using artificial intelligence to solve pain points of scalability, cost, and centralization. Running at speeds of up to 400,000 TPS with $0.001 transaction fees, Nexchain supports next-gen dApps through Smart Contracts 2.0, predictive gas fee models, and cross-chain AI routing. The project’s use of AI isn’t superficial—it’s embedded deep into its consensus, user tools, and governance mechanisms. Currently in Stage 17 at $0.066, the presale price reflects an early entry before the $0.30 listing. That gives early supporters a potential ROI of 455%. Investors can use BTC, SOL, or TRX directly to purchase, avoiding intermediaries. With features like vesting tools, real-time dashboard upgrades, and an airdrop on the horizon, Nexchain is not just preparing to launch—it’s preparing to lead. Other Presales Making Waves in 2025 While Nexchain leads every top cryptocurrency ICO list this year, other presales are also creating interest. Solaxy is carving out a niche in renewable energy tokenization by exposing consumers to sustainable energy infrastructure via blockchain-backed assets. It offers eco-conscious investors a means to balance financial development and environmental damage. Then there’s BTC BULL, a derivative currency that follows leveraged Bitcoin moves. With BTC at all-time highs, BTC BULL provides traders with an aggressive way to magnify gains during market rises. These ideas demonstrate how diversified the 2025 presale scene has evolved, encompassing AI-enhanced infrastructure, renewable energy, and leveraged financial products. However, few of these choices provide the whole package that Nexchain does: passive income, improved security, cross-chain support, and AI-driven efficiency. While there is worth in investigating these alternative presales, Nexchain remains the clear choice for long-term value and utility-driven growth. Why Nexchain May Be the Top Crypto Presale to Buy Now The crypto presale market is filled with promises, but very few projects deliver both innovation and execution. Nexchain stands apart by focusing on infrastructure that matters—AI-driven automation, high-speed consensus, and fair economic distribution. For anyone eyeing long-term value and utility in the next bull cycle, this isn’t just a chance at a strong ROI. It’s a shot at owning a piece of the future AI blockchain stack. In 2025, Nexchain isn’t trying to be loud. It’s trying to be better. And so far, it’s succeeding.

At the recent XRP Las Vegas event, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, shared his opinion on how close the market might be to seeing an XRP ETF. Investors Eager for More Than Just Bitcoin Speaking at the event, Hougan explained how ETFs have become the go-to option for crypto-friendly investors looking for easy, regulated access to digital assets. So far, Bitcoin ETFs have led the way, but attention is now turning to other popular tokens like XRP and Solana. When asked how soon these new ETFs could arrive, Hougan said he couldn’t comment on specific filings but quietly hinted the industry is making steady progress. Signs of Progress at the SEC Hougan said that several signs indicate things are moving in the right direction. Regulated futures trading is expanding, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is beginning to consider more innovative crypto products. “We’re reaching the point in the timeline where the SEC will have to say yes or no,” Hougan explained, adding that he remains hopeful about big announcements this year. Growing Institutional Demand for XRP Another reason for his positive attitude is the rising interest from institutional investors. According to Hougan, many large investors already have exposure to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and financial risks. Now, they’re looking to broaden their portfolios and explore what other blockchain networks like XRP can offer — from stablecoins to tokenized assets. “The demand for non-Bitcoin crypto investments is growing fast,” Hougan said. According to him, people are eager to see what else blockchain technology can do. Final Word While there’s no official approval yet, industry insiders like Matt Hougan believe it’s only a matter of time before XRP ETFs and other crypto investment products start gaining the green light.

The intervention reportedly involved three of the country’s most powerful regulatory agencies: the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the National Development and Reform Commission. Senior representatives from over a dozen automakers, including Zhejiang Geely Holding Group and Xiaomi Corp., were present, the people said. Officials instructed the automakers to “self-regulate” their pricing strategies and warned against selling vehicles below cost or engaging in “discount campaigns.” The discussion touched on “zero-mileage” vehicles and unpaid bills to suppliers, which are supposedly contorting supply chain finances and functioning as de facto debt instruments. Authorities seek market stability in competitive markets According to anonymous sources , the Chinese leadership worries that prolonged price cuts are pushing some automakers toward insolvency. Although the meeting resulted in no formal directive, the tone of the conversation exuded “seriousness,” insiders said. A spokesperson from Geely cited Chairman Li Shufu’s recent remarks, in which he said the company is “against price wars.” Moreover, at a press briefing on Thursday, the Ministry of Commerce reiterated that it will continue to work with other departments to improve oversight of the auto industry and create an environment with fair competition. Late last month, BYD cut prices by up to 34%, a decision that industry groups and state media outlets did not receive well . Without naming BYD directly, the China Automobile Manufacturers Association bashed a recent pricing action by “a certain company” for triggering “price war panic” and plunging the industry into what it described as a “vicious cycle.” The group warned that indiscriminate discounting was undermining profitability across the sector and endangering supply chain security. On Friday, according to Google Finance data , shares of BYD fell by as much as 2.7%, while Xiaomi dropped 2.4%. Geely Automobile Holdings declined 1.7% in Hong Kong trading. State media criticizes discount practices Chinese state-run media outlets, including Xinhua, the People’s Daily, and CCTV, have published reports calling for an end to reckless discounting, asking automakers to focus on quality and industry stability. The People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, argued that such pricing tactics could lead to low-quality output and tarnish the international image of “Made-in-China” products. According to accounting consultancy GMT Research, BYD’s real net debt may be as high as 323 billion yuan ($45 billion), significantly higher than the 27.7 billion yuan listed in its mid-2024 financial disclosures. The firm said that the gap could have been caused by BYD’s practice of delaying supplier payments and fiddly financing strategies. BYD looks towards the South African market Away from the heat at home, BYD plans to nearly triple its dealership network in South Africa by next year, according to a senior company executive. Steve Chang, General Manager of BYD Auto South Africa, said in a Wednesday interview that the company will grow its dealerships from 13 to approximately 30–35 by the end of next year. “ We want to educate and cultivate the market of South Africa ,” Chang told Reuters. South Africa’s new energy vehicle (NEV) market is still in the early stages but is growing fast. According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA), NEV sales rose to 15,611 units in 2024, up from 7,782 in 2023. Chang is hopeful BYD will move ahead of its competitors in the African market by setting up shop in the continent early.

According to data retrieved by Finbold research from CoinMarketCap, TRUMP’s market cap plummeted from $2.168 billion to $1.935 billion over the past 24 hours, erasing $233 million in value. At the time of writing, TRUMP is trading at $9.66, down 10.74% on the day and 15.58% over the past week. Official Trump biggest loser among top 100 cryptocurrencies. Source: CoinMarketCap The sell-off comes amid a dramatic surge in trading activity. 24-hour volume soared to $876.85 million, up 211.87%, as traders rushed to position around the fallout from Trump and Musk’s increasingly personal public spat. Politics and crypto collide The rift between Trump and Musk, once unlikely allies, went viral after Musk publicly criticized one of Trump’s flagship tax and spending bills. In response, Trump posted that he was “disappointed” with Musk and hinted that this could mark the end of their “great relationship.” Musk then fired back, accusing Trump of “ ingratitude ” and adding pointedly: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election.” Dogecoin also caught in the crossfire Interestingly, Dogecoin ( DOGE ), a coin long championed by Musk, also featured among the top five crypto losers in the past 24 hours. DOGE is down 7.1% over the same period, with trading volume soaring to nearly $2 billion, a 149.75% increase. DOGE 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold The rapid decline in TRUMP’s and DOGE price highlights how closely some cryptocurrencies are tied to online sentiment, and how vulnerable they can be to sudden shifts in public narrative. Furthermore, the surge in trading volume suggests that both retail traders and larger market participants were quick to react to the headlines, with some likely cashing out and others attempting to trade the volatility. What’s next? With Trump and Musk continuing to trade barbs across the platforms they each control, it remains unclear whether this feud will cool or continue to drive volatility. For now, the Official Trump token remains highly reactive to the political drama, while Dogecoin traders appear to be watching closely for further Musk comments that could sway its short-term price direction. One thing is clear: crypto markets are becoming ever more intertwined with real-world political events, and traders are moving faster than ever to capitalize on those narratives.

Believe, the SocialFi memecoin launchpad formerly known as Clout, has rolled out new features designed to protect users against rugpulls and scam tokens. These include automatic fee blocking for the first 24 hours after a new token launch, a feature intended to deter immediate sell-offs often associated with rugpulls . The platform also enabled manual fee blocking for any new token, encouraging users to report suspicious projects quickly. Additionally, all Believe token contract addresses now end with “BLV,” making it easy for users to identify tokens launched on the platform — similar to how Pump.fun memecoins are recognized by the “pump” suffix in their CAs. Within the next 24 hours, Believe also plans to publicly display token health status and creator fee earnings, along with significant optimizations to its iOS token release process that are expected to increase the proportion of tokens released through the app from 1% to nearly 100% by the end of the month. You might also like: Cardi B’s WAP memecoin pump ends in another rug pull … again Believe , previously known as Clout, is a Web3-based SocialFi platform that allows users to create and launch tokens through social interactions on X. Users can create new tokens simply by tweeting details and tagging the platform’s launch command, which triggers automatic token creation. Tokens begin trading on a bonding curve and graduate to Meteora once their market caps reach $100,000. At that point, trading fees are split 50/50 between Believe and the token creator. Creators can claim their earnings daily by linking their X account to the Believe app. LAUNCHCOIN , originally the PASTERNAK coin, remains closely linked to Believe through Ben Pasternak, founder of both Clout (now Believe) and the token. While not officially Believe’s native coin, its rebranding alongside the platform sparked speculation about its future role in the ecosystem. This drove LAUNCHCOIN price surge from a $10 million market cap on May 12 to over $240 million by May 14. However, it has since retraced to $142 million.

Yuga Labs, the powerhouse behind the iconic Bored Ape Yacht Club collection and a key player in the ApeCoin ecosystem, is reportedly floating a radical idea: dissolving the ApeCoin DAO . This proposal, if it moves forward, could fundamentally reshape the future of the ApeCoin token and its associated community. Why is Yuga Labs Targeting the ApeCoin DAO ? According to reports from JinSe Finance, Yuga Labs is looking to make a significant pivot from its previous stance of maintaining distance from the ApeCoin token’s governance. The proposal, attributed to Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano, doesn’t pull any punches, describing the current DAO structure as an “outdated, inefficient and unproductive governance experiment.” Strong words, indeed. The core argument seems to be that the decentralized autonomous organization, intended to empower token holders, has instead become a drain on resources without delivering effective or timely governance outcomes. This critique raises fundamental questions about the practicalities and challenges of large-scale decentralized governance in dynamic ecosystems. What Does the Proposal Actually Entail for ApeCoin Holders? The plan outlined in the reported proposal is quite straightforward, yet dramatic: Dissolution of the DAO: The existing ApeCoin DAO structure would be formally dissolved. Transfer of Assets and Responsibilities: All assets, treasury funds, and operational responsibilities currently held by the DAO would be transferred to a newly formed entity. Introduction of ApeCo: This new entity is proposed to be a Yuga Labs-controlled subsidiary or division named “ApeCo.” Revocation of Governance Rights: Crucially, the proposal calls for revoking the governance rights currently held by existing ApeCoin token holders. This means APE holders would no longer vote on proposals governing the ecosystem’s future. Essentially, this is a move to centralize control under Yuga Labs’ direct management, a stark contrast to the decentralized vision often touted in the crypto space. The Shift in Yuga Labs ‘ Relationship with ApeCoin It’s important to remember the history here. When ApeCoin (APE) was launched in March 2022, Yuga Labs deliberately positioned it as a separate entity governed by the ApeCoin DAO. While Yuga Labs was a significant stakeholder and the token was designed for use within their ecosystem (like the Otherside metaverse), the governance was explicitly handed over to the community via the DAO and its governing body, the Ape Foundation. This distance was often framed as a way to ensure decentralization and community ownership. The reported proposal marks a significant U-turn, suggesting Yuga Labs now believes direct control is necessary for the ecosystem’s health and growth. Is Centralization the Answer for Crypto Governance ? This proposal reignites a long-standing debate within the crypto and blockchain world: the trade-off between decentralization and efficiency. DAOs are designed to be democratic and censorship-resistant, allowing token holders to collectively make decisions. However, they can often be slow, cumbersome, and prone to apathy or conflicts of interest. Arguments for centralization often highlight: Speed and Agility: Centralized entities can make decisions and execute plans much faster. Clear Vision: A single leadership team can maintain a consistent strategic direction. Resource Allocation: Centralized control might allow for more efficient use of treasury funds on key development priorities. However, the benefits of decentralization are also significant: Community Empowerment: Token holders feel a sense of ownership and have a direct say. Resilience: Decision-making isn’t solely dependent on a single point of control. Transparency: On-chain governance can be highly transparent (though the decision-making process itself might not be). Yuga Labs’ reported proposal clearly leans into the ‘efficiency’ argument, suggesting they find the current decentralized model hindering progress rather than helping it. What Are the Potential Implications and Challenges? If this proposal were to pass (though the mechanism for ‘passing’ a proposal that dissolves the governance body itself is unclear and potentially complex), the implications for ApeCoin and the wider ecosystem would be profound: Loss of Holder Voice: ApeCoin holders would lose their direct ability to vote on how the ecosystem’s treasury is spent or how the token and its utility evolve. Concentration of Power: Yuga Labs would gain direct control over significant assets and decision-making authority. Community Backlash: Expect significant pushback from community members who bought APE with the understanding of decentralized governance. This could impact token sentiment and loyalty. Legal and Regulatory Questions: Dissolving a DAO and transferring assets to a corporate entity could raise complex legal and regulatory questions. Impact on APE Token Value: The market reaction is uncertain. Some might see centralization under Yuga as positive for execution, while others might view the loss of decentralization negatively, potentially impacting the token’s value. This move could set a precedent for other projects that have experimented with decentralized governance, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of DAO structures across the industry. Looking Ahead: What Happens Next? As of now, this is a reported proposal, not a finalized plan or vote. The details of how such a dissolution would even be put to a vote or implemented within the existing DAO framework are complex and likely to face significant debate. ApeCoin holders and the broader crypto community will be watching closely to see how Yuga Labs formally presents this idea, what justification they provide beyond the initial comments, and how the community reacts. The future of ApeCoin ‘s governance hangs in the balance. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for ApeCoin and Crypto Governance? Yuga Labs’ reported proposal to dissolve the ApeCoin DAO represents a potentially defining moment for one of the largest NFT-adjacent crypto ecosystems. It highlights the inherent tension between the ideals of decentralization and the practical demands of efficient development and resource management in the fast-paced Web3 world. Whether this move is seen as a necessary step for the ecosystem’s growth or a betrayal of decentralized principles will be debated fiercely within the community and could have lasting implications for the perception and structure of future crypto projects.

This trend isn’t isolated. In fact, firms like Stripe are also exploring integrations, while governments in Russia and Abu Dhabi are testing national stablecoin models. Meanwhile, Circle, the issuer of USDC, recently made headlines by going public on the NYSE under the ticker CRCL. It was able to raise $1.05 billion, which could mean that there is growing institutional confidence in stablecoin infrastructure. USDC’s market cap surged 40% year-to-date, solidifying its role as the second-largest stablecoin after Tether. Maple Finance also joined the stablecoin race by launching syrupUSD on Solana to tap into the network’s very impressive DeFi growth. The move is supported by Chainlink’s CCIP, and is the start of a strategic expansion into high-speed, low-cost ecosystems. Uber Takes Interest in Stablecoins Uber is exploring the use of stablecoins to cut costs associated with moving money internationally, according to CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. At the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on June 5, Khosrowshahi described stablecoins as one of the more practical applications of cryptocurrency, and said that the company is currently in the “study phase” of examining their potential. While acknowledging the varying opinions around Bitcoin, he placed a lot of emphasis on the tangible benefits of stablecoins, particularly for global businesses managing cross-border payments. Stablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies that are designed to mirror the value of traditional fiat currencies, most commonly the US dollar, and are typically backed by reserves like cash or short-term government bonds. Khosrowshahi said they are “super interesting” to Uber, especially as a cost-efficient payment mechanism. Interest in stablecoins is growing across the corporate and financial landscape. In May, Stripe co-founder John Collison revealed that his company entered early discussions with banks about potential stablecoin integrations. A report from Fireblocks also found that 90% of institutional players that were surveyed are exploring stablecoins in some form. Governments are also testing the waters. Russia’s finance ministry floated plans for a national stablecoin, and in Abu Dhabi, three major institutions are developing a new dirham-pegged version . Meanwhile, the market cap of US dollar-backed stablecoins exceeded $230 billion in April, which was a 54% rise year-over-year, according to Citigroup . Tether (USDT) and USDC are still the dominant focus in the industry as they commany about 90% of the market. Stablecoin transaction volumes surged as well. In 2024, they reached $27.6 trillion. This means that stablecoin volumes outpaced the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard by 7.7%. Data from Artemis shows that $94.2 billion worth of stablecoin transactions were settled between January of 2023 and February of 2025. Circle Makes Public Debut on NYSE One stablecoin issuer is certainly turning quite a few heads at the moment. Circle, the issuer behind the USDC stablecoin, officially started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CRCL. The company's debut is a huge milestone not only for Circle itself but also for the broader crypto industry. CEO Jeremy Allaire shared the news on X on June 5, and mentioned the significance of Circle’s transition into a public company. Allaire co-founded Circle with Sean Neville 12 years ago, with a vision to rebuild the global financial system using internet-native tools and infrastructure. He described the listing as a powerful step forward and a clear indication that the world is ready to begin transitioning toward an internet-based financial system. The public listing follows Circle’s upsized initial public offering, which raised $1.05 billion through the sale of 34 million shares at $31 each. This was well above its initial plan to sell 24 million shares priced between $24 and $26. The IPO drew a lot of attention in the crypto sector. People like Strategy’s Michael Saylor and Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal were among those who publicly congratulated the firm. Allaire also acknowledged the many people and institutions that played a role in Circle’s journey, and called the event a meaningful step in the merging of global finance with digital innovation. Circle’s public launch coincides with a period of impressive growth for USDC, which is the company’s flagship dollar-pegged stablecoin. According to CoinGecko data , USDC’s market cap increased by over 40% since the beginning of the year, rising from $43.7 billion on Jan. 1 to $61.5 billion in June. USDC currently ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency overall and is the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether’s USDT, which boasts a market cap of close to $154 billion. USDC’s market cap over the past year (Source: CoinGecko ) While Tether has no immediate plans to go public, other firms like PayPal joined the stablecoin race by launching their own offerings like PYUSD, which holds a market cap under $1 billion. Maple Launches syrupUSD on Solana Another stablecoin is also making moves to gain an edge. Maple Finance, a decentralized lending platform, is expanding its footprint by launching on the Solana network . The main goal of the move is to broaden its user base and tap into the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Solana. Previously available only on Ethereum, Maple’s syrupUSD yield-bearing stablecoin will now be integrated into Solana-based platforms Kamino and Orca. The expansion begins with $30 million in liquidity to support lending, trading, and collateral provisioning, providing a solid foundation for Maple’s entry into the new ecosystem. The integration is powered by Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which recently went live on Solana’s mainnet on May 19. CCIP enables seamless data and asset transfers between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chains. This functionality is expected to enhance cost-effective scaling and streamline operations for multi-chain DeFi applications. According to Maple co-founder and CEO Sid Powell, Solana’s high-speed and high-capacity infrastructure makes it an ideal environment for expanding Maple’s services to a more diverse range of users, including institutions and advanced DeFi participants. Solana TVL (Source: DeFiLlama ) Solana’s DeFi sector experienced some impressive growth , with the total value locked (TVL) rising by 500% over the past 18 months—from $1.4 billion in December 2023 to $8.2 billion currently. This growth created a competitive environment where Maple will now operate alongside existing Solana lending protocols like Save, margin.fi, Rain.fi, and Port Finance. Despite Ethereum remaining the dominant blockchain in terms of DeFi value, with a TVL of $61.4 billion, it saw a painful 43% drop since its 2021 peak and now faces increasing competition from faster, more scalable alternatives like Solana. Overall, Maple Finance’s strategic move to Solana shows that it is ready to capitalize on its momentum.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 09:52:01

Circle’s IPO Exceeds Expectations Circle’s stock opened at $69, well above its IPO pricing of $31. Throughout the day, the shares reached a peak of $103.75, showcasing strong investor enthusiasm. The IPO was priced late Wednesday, exceeding the anticipated range of $27 to $28, and substantially outpacing an earlier range of $24 to $26. This pricing strategy valued the company at approximately $6.8 billion before trading commenced.

This impressive performance positions Circle alongside other cryptocurrency firms like Coinbase, Mara Holdings, and Riot Platforms as a notable player in the US market. CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized the importance of building relationships with governments and policymakers, stating, “To realize our vision, we needed to forge relationships with governments… it’s got to work in mainstream society and you need to have those rules of the road.” Allaire highlighted Circle’s commitment to compliance and transparency, which he believes has contributed to the company’s success in a challenging regulatory environment. Could Higher Prices Follow For Future Listings? The strong debut of Circle’s IPO could signal a shift in how institutional investors approach upcoming listings, potentially leading to higher initial public offering prices for future offerings. Notable companies preparing for IPOs include Omada Health, which is pricing on Thursday, and Klarna, a fintech firm set to list next week. While Circle’s IPO share price initially set its market value at $6.1 billion—below its last private market valuation of $7.7 billion from 2021—Thursday’s trading surge adjusted that figure. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 By the close of trading, Circle’s market capitalization, excluding employee options, stood at an impressive $16.7 billion. The company successfully raised approximately $1.1 billion through the offering. Circle’s journey to this point has been marked by challenges, including its previous attempt to go public. Circle’s previous attempt to go public via a merger was with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which collapsed in late 2022 due to regulatory hurdles. The company’s largest outside shareholders include General Catalyst and IDG Capital, holding approximately 8.9% and 8.8% of all stock, respectively. Other significant backers such as Accel, Breyer Capital, and Oak Investment Partners continue to support Circle’s vision in the evolving crypto marketplace.

Even before Elon Musk and President Donald Trump fell out in public, selling debt for the tech mogul’s companies has always been tricky with Morgan Stanley. However, for xAI Corp., it was supposed to be different. The Musk-Trump clash derailed Morgan Stanley’s xAI pitch Amid the recent excitement about artificial intelligence in the markets, internal data shared by the bank with a small group of investors on Thursday, June 5, reveals key projections. According to someone familiar with the information, the company expects to earn over $13 billion annually by 2029. However, the escalating public feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump — unfolding as a highly visible, back-and-forth conflict — will likely make the bankers’ job significantly more difficult. With his history at institutions like Harvard and Columbia University , Trump has demonstrated a willingness to use unconventional tactics to set an example for those who challenge him. As a result, all of Musk’s companies, including xAI, could find themselves caught in the crosshairs. Interestingly, investor sentiment is changing fast. Tesla shares fell 14%, and a trader said that one of xAI’s outstanding loans fell to 95 cents on the dollar from 99 cents before the spat went public. The price decline could signal trouble ahead for Morgan Stanley’s sale. Additionally, the price of a loan for social media platform X, another of Musk’s companies affiliated with xAI in a larger enterprise, was trading down about 1.25 points as the battle between the two sides increasingly turned fierce online How the clash affected the effort to sell the debt is unclear. So far, the buyers who expressed initial interest in the deal have not walked away, and the debt sale is not due to close until later this month, according to a person familiar with the matter. By late Thursday, Musk indicated that he wanted to ease the tensions with Trump. Meanwhile, according to reliable sources, White House staff arranged a call between them to prevent further issues. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley chose not to comment, and xAI did not reply to a request for comments made after regular business hours. Elon Musk revealed shifting his focus from politics to running his companies Elon Musk highlighted plans to sell $5 billion of debt for his artificial intelligence startup, xAI Corp., the latest in financing rounds across his business empire as the billionaire shifts away from politics and toward running his various businesses. People familiar with early pricing discussions say Morgan Stanley is marketing the debt for xAI with a double-digit interest rate. The funding could enable Musk to increase spending on AI infrastructure as he constructs a massive data center in Memphis. In a statement, Musk signaled that he is eager to turn his attention to his suite of businesses after revealing last week that he would be stepping back from politics. For months, he served as a senior adviser and frequent travel partner to President Trump, whom he campaigned for in the 2024 campaign and was one of his leading financial backers . Musk’s debt package enables him to keep spending on AI infrastructure The debt package includes a floating-rate term loan, a fixed-rate term loan, and senior secured notes, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity due to the private nature of the discussions. Proceeds from the bond offering will be used for general corporate purposes, with investor commitments due by June 17. Early pricing talks were 7 percentage points over the benchmark for the floating-rate term loan and a roughly 12 yield on the senior notes, other people with knowledge of the matter said. Demand for the debt sale already tops $3.5 billion, they said. Musk’s involvement in Washington, where he managed a large government cost-cutting project called the Department of Government Efficiency, attracted significant criticism directed at him. This raised worries about how well his companies are doing. Tesla Inc., where Musk serves as CEO, has seen its stock prices drop by 20% since the inauguration. Besides xAI’s debt offering, Musk secured $650 million for his neurotechnology firm, Neuralink Corp. He also revealed plans to sell $300 million in xAI shares through a secondary offering, as reported by the Financial Times. A spokesperson for xAI chose not to comment. Morgan Stanley also did not respond immediately. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Its dramatic rise proved that hype can momentarily push a coin’s value through the roof. Now, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) priced at $0.03 in presale phase 5, traders recognize a different breed of opportunity: a token to be built on real utility, sustainable revenue models, and a growing user base. While Dogecoin (DOGE)’s run was driven by social media fervor and celebrity endorsements, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) model stands on a foundation of lending technology, staking logic, passive income streams, and proven security. By blending real-world use cases with a rapidly expanding community, MUTM is poised to deliver even more consistent and long-term upside. Utility versus Meme Hype Dogecoin (DOGE)’s success in 2021 came from sheer speculation. Its blockchain does not power advanced applications, and its protocol lacks built-in revenue mechanisms. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate as a decentralized protocol that enables users to lend and borrow assets through both pool-based (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models. This model will allow participants to choose from a wide range of supported tokens. In the P2C pools, those who deposit ETH or DAI will earn dynamic interest based on real-time liquidity demand. In the P2P ladder, traders will be able to lend and borrow tokens that are often excluded by other platforms, such as memecoins like Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). By delivering transparent, practical services, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) transcends meme culture and attracts users dedicated to earning reliable income. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Works After the launch, when a user will supply assets into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), they will receive mtTokens, which represent both the deposit and the interest it generates. This means every lender benefits from automatic yield accumulation without complex interactions. For instance, depositing $3,000 worth of DAI into a P2C pool with a 75% utilization rate will generate an annual yield of approximately 10%, providing $300 in passive income without selling the underlying DAI. The corresponding mtTokens will increase in value over time, reflecting the accrued interest. On the borrowing side, users will be able to deposit collateral to borrow stablecoins or other tokens, avoiding taxable events that would occur from selling assets and preserving exposure to future price rallies. This flexibility attracts a broad audience of investors, traders, and crypto holders. Robust Technology Infrastructure Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s architecture will be built with Layer-2 integration to ensure fast and low-cost transactions. Layer-1 networks often become congested, driving fees sky-high and degrading user experience. By leveraging Layer-2 solutions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) guarantees that small and large investors alike can transact without worrying about prohibitive gas costs. Whether someone wants to deposit $5,000 of ETH or $2,000 of BNB, the low transaction fees preserve more capital for actual investment. This technical advantage attracts users who demand efficiency, and it differentiates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from competing protocols that remain constrained by slower, more expensive infrastructure. As DeFi adoption grows, seamless usability becomes key, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already prepared to capture that expanding audience. Security and Transparency In a market rife with hacks and exploits, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has taken security seriously. The protocol completed a CertiK audit, earning a Token Scan Score of 80.00 following manual review and static analysis. This audit confirms that the core smart contracts are well-written and free from critical vulnerabilities. By securing an external audit before token launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates commitment to user protection, a critical factor when traders compare it to any meme-based token. No token, including Dogecoin (DOGE), offered such rigorous verification during its initial bull run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s transparent approach builds trust, encouraging both retail and institutional participants to allocate capital confidently. Stablecoin Innovation Adds Depth Beyond planned lending and staking, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a fully overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain assets already held within the protocol. Traditional stablecoins often depend on centralized reserves or opaque backing mechanisms. Mutuum’s stablecoin will be minted from on-chain collateral, ensuring transparency and algorithmic supply adjustments that maintain stability. This stable asset will provide borrowers with a reliable borrowing option while directing interest payments into the protocol’s treasury. By strengthening the platform’s financial health, the stablecoin creates an additional layer of value for MUTM holders. Users gain access to a transparent stablecoin and benefit from ecosystem growth, which ultimately pushes MUTM’s price higher. Growing Community and Roadmap Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale has reached Phase 5 at $0.03, raising over $10 million and securing 11,800 holders. This level of early adoption parallels leading DeFi projects at similar stages. The roadmap outlines a clear path from presale to platform launch. Phase 1 milestones—presale initiation, marketing campaigns, implementation of AI helpdesk, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway , and the CertiK audit—have already been executed. Phase 2 focuses on core smart contract development, front-end dApp creation, and back-end infrastructure setup. By the time MUTM hits exchanges, the beta version of the lending protocol will be live, allowing holders to start earning interest immediately. This synchronization between token launch and platform delivery is rare. It ensures that holders do not wait months for utility. Conclusion In 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a token grounded in real utility, far removed from Dogecoin (DOGE)’s meme-driven popularity. By offering P2C and P2P lending, passive income through mtToken staking, Layer-2 speed, security via a CertiK audit, and a transparent roadmap with a beta platform launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers a complete ecosystem. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 2021 run provided spectacular short-term gains, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed for long-term upside. The $0.03 presale price is an invitation to participate in a protocol that already has 11,800 holders and $10 million raised. The sustainable growth narrative behind this token positions MUTM to outperform Dogecoin (DOGE)’s entire 2021 run. Traders looking for a reliable, yield-generating alternative recognize that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the token to watch.

These prediction markets turn potential future events into tradable assets, where the price reflects the crowd’s perceived probability of that event occurring. Recently, a specific market on Polymarket tracking the possibility of Trump impeachment before the end of 2025 has garnered significant attention, revealing a notable, though perhaps surprising, probability. What Does Polymarket Predict About Trump Impeachment? According to the trading activity on the decentralized prediction market platform, Polymarket, participants are currently assigning a 10% probability to the event of U.S. President Donald Trump being impeached before December 31, 2025. This isn’t just a poll; it’s a reflection of where people are willing to put their money. As of the latest data, nearly half a million dollars, specifically around $495,837, has been wagered on the outcome of this particular political question. This market operates like any other financial market, but instead of trading stocks or commodities, users trade shares in the outcome of a specific event. If the event happens (Trump is impeached by the deadline), shares resolve at $1. If it doesn’t happen, they resolve at $0. The current price of a ‘Yes’ share in the Trump impeachment market is roughly $0.10, directly correlating to the 10% probability assigned by the market participants. How Do Prediction Markets Like Polymarket Work? Understanding how a prediction market arrives at a 10% probability requires a brief look under the hood. Unlike traditional polling, which surveys opinions, prediction markets aggregate information through trading. When someone believes the chance of impeachment is higher than 10%, they buy ‘Yes’ shares, driving the price up. If they think it’s lower, they sell ‘Yes’ shares (or buy ‘No’ shares), pushing the price down. Key aspects of how these markets function include: Event Definition: Markets are based on clearly defined, verifiable future events. For this market, the event is ‘Donald Trump is impeached before January 1, 2026’. Trading Shares: Users buy and sell ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ shares related to the event occurring. The price of a ‘Yes’ share fluctuates between $0 and $1. Probability Reflection: The current price of a ‘Yes’ share is interpreted as the market’s real-time probability of the event happening. A price of $0.10 means a 10% probability. Market Resolution: Once the event’s deadline passes or the outcome is definitively known, the market is resolved based on objective criteria. Winners’ shares are paid out. Decentralization: Polymarket is built on blockchain technology, aiming for transparency, censorship resistance, and global accessibility, distinguishing it from centralized betting platforms. This mechanism incentivizes participants to trade based on their true beliefs and information, as incorrect predictions result in financial losses. This ‘skin in the game’ is often cited as a reason why prediction markets can sometimes be more accurate forecasters than polls. Is a 10% Chance of Trump Impeachment High or Low? Interpreting the 10% probability assigned by the Polymarket community depends heavily on context. Historically, presidential impeachments are rare events in U.S. history (only three before Trump’s two). Trump himself was impeached twice during his first term, though never removed from office by the Senate. Considering the political landscape heading into 2025, a 10% chance suggests that while not considered likely by the market, the possibility isn’t entirely dismissed. Potential factors that could influence this probability include: The outcome of the 2024 presidential election and subsequent control of the House and Senate. Developments in ongoing legal cases involving Donald Trump. Unforeseen political events or scandals. Shifts in public opinion or party dynamics. The 10% figure indicates that market participants see a non-negligible chance that a confluence of these factors could lead to impeachment proceedings being initiated and completed within the specified timeframe, even if the odds are stacked against it. The Significance of the Wagered Amount on Polymarket The fact that approximately $495,837 has been wagered on this specific crypto prediction market is also noteworthy. While not the largest market ever seen on platforms like Polymarket, it represents a substantial amount of capital being put behind these probabilistic bets. A higher wagered amount generally suggests: Increased interest in the specific event. Greater liquidity, making it easier for larger traders to participate without significantly moving the price. Potentially more diverse information being aggregated, as more participants contribute their capital and beliefs. The nearly half-million dollars reflects a serious level of engagement from the Polymarket user base regarding this political outcome, highlighting the platform’s role not just for speculative trading but also as an indicator of collective financial sentiment on future events. Benefits and Challenges of Decentralized Prediction Markets Decentralized prediction market platforms like Polymarket offer several potential benefits: Information Aggregation: They can synthesize dispersed information into a single probability figure, potentially offering more accurate forecasts than traditional methods. Transparency: Built on public blockchains, transactions and market rules are often transparent. Accessibility: They can be accessible to anyone globally, bypassing traditional financial or betting intermediaries (though regulatory hurdles exist). Alternative Asset Class: They provide a novel way to speculate or hedge against real-world events. However, they also face significant challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal status of prediction markets, especially decentralized ones, is complex and varies globally, leading to potential crackdowns or access restrictions. Liquidity: While popular markets like the Trump impeachment one can gain traction, many smaller markets may suffer from low liquidity, making trading difficult. Resolution Challenges: Defining and verifying event outcomes objectively can sometimes be complex, although platforms strive for clear resolution criteria. User Experience: Interacting with decentralized platforms can still be less user-friendly than traditional websites for some users. Beyond Trump Impeachment: The Scope of Crypto Prediction While the Trump impeachment market is currently attracting headlines, the world of crypto prediction extends far beyond political outcomes. Polymarket and similar platforms host markets on a vast array of topics, including: Future cryptocurrency prices (e.g., Will Bitcoin hit $100k by year-end?). Economic indicators (e.g., Will the Fed raise interest rates?). Scientific discoveries (e.g., Will a specific medical trial succeed?). Pop culture events (e.g., Who will win a major award?). Sports outcomes. This breadth demonstrates the potential for prediction markets to become a general-purpose tool for aggregating beliefs about almost any verifiable future event, offering a different lens through which to view potential outcomes compared to traditional news analysis or polling. What Actionable Insights Can We Draw? For readers interested in either politics or the potential of decentralized technology, the Polymarket Trump impeachment market offers a few takeaways: Market Sentiment Indicator: The 10% probability isn’t a guarantee, but it’s a market-driven indicator of how a specific group of financially motivated individuals perceives the likelihood of a rare political event. It’s one data point among many when analyzing political possibilities. Understanding Prediction Markets: This serves as a practical example of how prediction markets translate collective belief into a quantifiable probability. It highlights their potential as forecasting tools, distinct from opinion polls. Exploring DeFi Use Cases: For those in the crypto space, it showcases a real-world application of decentralized finance technology beyond just trading cryptocurrencies themselves. Participating in such markets involves significant risk and should not be viewed as traditional investing. It is speculative and subject to the unique challenges of the crypto and prediction market spaces. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Information Aggregation The Polymarket prediction market indicating a 10% chance of Trump impeachment by the end of 2025 is more than just a political bet; it’s a live example of how decentralized platforms are attempting to create new ways to aggregate human knowledge and forecast future events. While the 10% figure itself will undoubtedly fluctuate based on real-world developments and trader activity, the existence and use of markets like these highlight a growing trend towards using financial incentives to gauge the likelihood of outcomes, from politics to crypto prediction and beyond. Whether these markets prove consistently more accurate than traditional methods remains a subject of ongoing debate and observation, but their increasing prominence on platforms like Polymarket makes them a fascinating area to watch.

Despite skepticism about crypto, I employ an option collar strategy on iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF to define downside risk and manage profit potential. Active collar adjustments let me lock in gains and raise my exit price, prioritizing risk management over maximizing upside. Collaring IBIT fits my risk-averse style, letting me hold more for longer with peace of mind, even if the asset class is volatile. Let's recap my history with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency ""investments,"" up to the present day, where I currently own the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). This is one of a dozen such vehicles that debut on US stock exchanges on the same day in January 2024. And if the crypto mania hadn't gone far enough by then, that did what famous chef Emeril Lagasse refers to as ""kick it up a notch."" 39 years ago, when I started my Wall Street career, gold was the thing we looked to as an ""alternative currency."" It still is for many. 17 years ago, Bitcoin was first created. That was in part due to what had just occurred in the global financial system. For those not familiar, the US Treasury Secretary was literally on his hands and knees, begging Congress not to let the financial system implode. 12 years ago, I watched as the first Bitcoin-linked ETF launched (Grayscale). I just watched because I am not exactly ""Mr. Hot Trend"" as an investor. Several followed, but they were all a step away from participating in the ""spot"" price of Bitcoin. They owned futures and other derivatives. 17 months ago (almost to the day), the first Bitcoin ETF came to market on a US exchange. Along with 11 others on the same day! Can you say, ""feeding frenzy?"" Over this time, crypto has gone from something only the cool kids (and just the kids for the most part) were in the know about, to everyone's favorite hot commodity. And I do mean commodity. Because, like gold, it is viewed and priced in large part on what people will pay for it. It has the potential for growing usage. And I do believe that the blockchain in general is a growth industry. The question, as always, is what one pays for it. Oh, and I don't have to love or even like an investment to own it. That might sound like blasphemy to some, but I'm a technician, a price analyst. That's my thing, for more than 40 years now. And while I've spent a ton of time on every other type of analysis, I think investing still comes down to what someone will pay for it. Increasingly, that has very little to do with ""fundamentals."" In time, a business has a good chance to be worth what its numbers say. 20 years ago, ""fair value"" in a stock or commodity meant a lot more than it does today. Thanks to the algorithms and indexing's impact on investor behavior. And, the ability for any human to access free or inexpensive data and tools that we career investment folks used to 5-figures for each year. Liking an Investment is Not the Same Thing as Owning It I'm no fan of cryptocurrency. However, I AM a fan of making money with low relative risk! And to dispel the rumors right here and now, I didn't focus on the IBIT ETF because it is the ticker symbol most closely resembling the spelling of my last name (Isbitts). It is the biggest and most liquid spot Bitcoin ETF. And it has a very liquid options market. How big is IBIT? See below. It has grown fast enough to make even covered call ETF darling JEPI look like a boring AUM grower. Data by YCharts And, even when compared to its peers and predecessors in the space, IBIT is the dominant way that investors now seek to access Bitcoin at its spot price, unless they own it directly. Data by YCharts As to that options liquidity, here's an example using Wednesday's close. This is the top 10 ETFs by option volume. We find IBIT at number 7, ahead of the biggest gold ETF ( GLD ). That has a lot to do with IBIT's price being about 1/5 that of GLD. Barchart But the point is that IBIT has a robust options market, in addition to trading nearly $2 billion of ETF dollar volume on an average day. That this is only around 3% of IBIT's AUM indicates that unlike other ""risk on"" investments like leveraged ETFs, there are plenty of longer-term holders, at least at this point in the market cycle. SA Why Collar IBIT (or Any ETF or Stock) Anyway? Here's a prime example of where a collar provides several advantages to me: I can take risks I would not normally take I know from the moment I buy the security, what my downside risk is My upside is technically ""capped"" for a period of time...but last I checked, there's no law against adding more exposure to that stock or ETF if it rises significantly in price. At Sungarden, we call that a ""high class problem!"" I can use my chart work to evaluate the collar position, which is frankly where I think our real edge is on full display. This explains why I had little hesitation when I saw an opportunity for IBIT to appreciate in price over a multi-month period, or perhaps longer. But given my reluctance to embrace the whole digital currency thing as many have, I still see a chance to make money. But only if I could do it ""my way."" That is, with a setup that I frequently use around stocks and ETFs, the option collar. Here's a snapshot of the current trade. My intention is not usually to be this active around a collar, but hey, this is a Bitcoin ETF, and IBIT did rally after my initial purchase in April. Trying to Profit From Bitcoin, Without Much Emotion Here's a quick summary of what's happened so far, to convey the key points about what makes me look at, frankly, any investment with a good-looking chart pattern, with an eye toward high return with pre-defined, modest risk of loss. This was shared with our investing club's subscribers at the point of each move, and these are from one of my actual brokerage accounts. ""Eat what you cook,"" as they say. Our club may be driven by educating already astute investors, but we believe in showing our work, literally. Bought the ETF (300 shares around $50 a share), and placed an option collar around it by buying 3 put options struck at $50, and selling 3 ""covered calls"" (that's the part many here are likely familiar with), at a $60 strike price. That option combination obligated me to sell IBIT if it reached $60 before 11/21 of this year, but also protected me if IBIT fell below $50 a share any time before 8/15 of this year. There's a reason I do it that way: I want to spend as little out of pocket as possible, when possible. Sometimes sell the call and buy the put out to the same expiration date. There are many variables as I see them, and I've been doing these on and off (very much ""on"" in this market) since about 2007. It worked like a charm then, when 2008 hit. And so far, so good, here in 2025. That doesn't mean the collars all make money, or that they even outperform buying and holding the stock. However, they do allow me to sleep better, and provide what I consider to be massive flexibility around my investment process. Personal brokerage account 2. IBIT (and Bitcoin of course) rallied from there, and since I don't ""trust"" this asset class to remain calm as I might others, I swapped out those $50 puts for $55 strike price contracts expiring sooner (6/30). This is better than a ""stop loss order"" to me, since a breakdown in IBIT's price overnight would render a stop loss just before the previous night's close useless. Stop orders used to work fairly well. Now, I think they are investment poison. But that's just me, a guy who despises waking up in the morning, checking the futures, and seeing that he just lost a ton of value. So even though I was less than 3 weeks into what could be a long holding period with IBIT, I made the proactive adjustment. Data by YCharts So at this point, my $60 calls are still in place, but my $55 puts now have essentially locked in a gain on IBIT, at least through June-end. I traded off some time for a higher worst-case scenario. 3. Well, wouldn't you know it, IBIT continued higher, and suddenly by mid-May the $60 call strike was in play. This is a ""high class problem"" as they say, and there's no law against buying more IBIT, call options on IBIT or some other form of increased position. Like I said above, this is a lot more active than I wish to be. But convenience is not my primary objective here. It is profit and risk management. So I swapped the puts again, lifting my worst case to $58 (remember I bought it around $50) and the calls (upper limit) to $75. Note that the ""spread"" between put and call is now 6 months (puts expire in July of this year, calls in January 2026). And that is where things stand at this point, after a busy set of adjustments to what, in my mind, is simply an alternative way to hold 300 shares of IBIT without getting crushed, and moving up my ""get me out"" price along the way. Note that this activity has shaved off a chunk of my upside from holding the ETF so far. And while I'll soon post another article focusing in on that aspect of option collars (my way), keep in mind that there's time left. And there's a good chance that during that time, either the puts will become very valuable (if IBIT crashes well below $58) or the call premium I received will melt away (if IBIT fails to reach $75 by January). Or, in a scenario I can only dream of, though it has happened for me a few times within the scores of these I've done, I might actually have a chance to ""win"" both ways before the respective expiration dates are reached. There's a lot of, shall I say, ""optionality"" with collars? But keep in mind that I am focused primarily on IBIT as a holding. The options just provide the ""guardrails"" that allow me, a very risk-averse investor, to own more than I normally might, for longer than I might, and knowing that if IBIT fell to, say, $30 tomorrow, I can still set it for $58. I'll take that deal any time. IBIT: Current Chart View This is a fairly unremarkable chart to me. And I've been a technician for decades, so I'm always looking for ""something"" I can take a stand on. There's some recent weakness, but the Bitcoin crowd is so fervent, it might not translate into much downside as this year goes on. And the upside to new all-time highs is very much on the table. Because it is always in this part of the market, based on what we've seen so far. Barchart Option Collars: Not for Everyone (But Definitely for Me) Here's the thing, though: when I have collared a stock or ETF, as much as I want to see it go much higher, and as soon as possible, I am far less concerned than if I owned it ""long."" As I see it, the collar allows me to see if I'm ""wrong"" without much punishment. And with the puts shorter term than the calls, if it falls quickly, I have an emergency exit to run out of while the ""house"" is burning. I am as enthusiastic about collaring most of my primary positions as I have ever been. Back in my days as an advisor and mutual fund manager, I used this approach to navigate through 2007-2009. Look it up if you don't know what I mean. IBIT is one of many I own now, and I'm always scouting for more opportunities to take some risk out of taking risk. What Happens Next? Heck if I know. Sure, the marketplace is filled with would-be Nostradamus types, spending views of what ""will"" happen and how confident they are. As Yogi Berra said, predictions are difficult, especially about the future. But I DO know what will prompt my next move. I'll be guided by the chart, which as noted looks toppy here. But IBIT and the many ETFs like it might just have an invisible put option of sorts underneath, which leads to buyers streaming in every time it dips. That was not the case when IBIT fell by more than 30% from December to April recently. But the strong recovery is meaningful to me. Charting crypto is different than charting stocks, I think. But the ""put"" I'm more concerned about is the one I made myself. If IBIT falls or crashes below $58 by July 18, I know I can sell it for $58 and make a nice profit for my troubles. If it flies higher, I would have a third opportunity to lift that put option strike price. Since I will likely be accused by some of ""not committing one way or the other,"" even though the whole idea of collaring ETFs and stocks is to offset what modern markets do to our money, I'll say this: that's a big, fat trading range IBIT is starting to carve out, between $43 and $60. That is plenty of room such that if it were to fall toward the lower boundary and the buyers step in en masse again, I am aware that the IBIT I would have sold for $58 would be collar-able again down in the low to mid-40s. Happy days, that would be. TC2000 My plan is to do this with a select group of ETFs and stocks, about 3–5 ETFs and 5–10 stocks at a time. That's the core of our service, though collaring is really just the most complex form of a wide range of risk management work we do there. All in the name of first avoiding a big loss, then making as much I can. Because adapting to modern markets means putting aside or reducing our reliance on ""old school"" ways of preserving and growing capital. That includes being less in love with what I own, and looking at most investments through the same lens: anything can go up in price, but how much risk of major loss is attached? The collar structure, after a bit of a learning curve (days to weeks, they tell me), is my very favorite way to roll in 2025, and probably for a long time afterward.",IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-06 10:01:31

However, early bullish signals have emerged, suggesting that a potential breakout could be on the horizon. You might also like: Cardi B’s WAP memecoin pump ends in another rug pull … again Looking at the 4-hour chart, PENGU memecoin ‘s price has been forming lower highs and lower lows since mid-May, but the slope of the decline is beginning to contract, forming a descending wedge pattern. Source: TradingView Momentum indicators are also beginning to reflect early signs of strength. The RSI, which had been trending in oversold territory, is curling upward and hinting at bullish divergence. At the same time, the MACD is flattening with the signal and MACD lines converging, which could lead to a bullish crossover on the upcoming candles. Price is also edging towards the 20 EMA, which often flips from resistance to support during trend reversals. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge — currently near the $0.0105 level — with a clear 4-hour candle close and volume expansion, it would serve as a breakout confirmation. The wedge’s height measures roughly $0.0060 (from the top near $0.0150 down to the bottom near $0.0090). Applying this measured move to the potential breakout point around $0.0105 projects an upside target close to $0.0165, which represents 70% from the current price level of $0.0096. If the price fails to hold above $0.0089 — the most recent swing low — the bullish setup would be invalidated. If that happens, sellers could potentially drag the price down toward $0.0075 or even $0.0060, both of which represent key levels. These zones previously acted as rejection and accumulation areas, with $0.0060 serving as the launchpad for a sharp rally in late April.

As of now, the coin is down 7.29%. Dogecoin 24h price performance. Source: Finbold.com The plunge coincides with Musk’s formal exit from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the Trump administration initiative at the core of Musk’s plan to modernize information technology federal efficiency. Musk and Trump have been squabbling for some time now, with the former criticizing the latter’s recent spending bill and its consequences for the electric vehicle ( EV ) sector. Yesterday, Musk even claimed Trump would have lost the election without his backing, prompting Trump to threaten to cancel federal contracts with his companies. Dogecoin price plunges Given that it’s a meme coin, Dogecoin’s value is more reactive to celebrity influence than actual fundamentals . In particular, it is reactive to Musk’s public moves. Recall, for example, that Dogecoin rose 15% in 2022 when Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) started accepting it as a valid payment method. More recently, the coin surged following Trump’s victory in the 2024 elections thanks to Trump’s openly friendly disposition towards Musk. With yesterday’s plunge, Dogecoin dropped from $0.193 to $0.169, the lowest it had been since May 7. Between 16:00-20:00 (12:00–16:00 EST), the trading volume exceeded 1 billion units, which is nearly 5x the average. While the coin has somewhat stabilized since, sitting around $0.175 as of the time of writing, the outlook remains negative due to Musk’s political moves becoming more unpredictable.

A specific point of tension recently emerged concerning the future of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, a critical asset for NASA. Let’s dive into the details of this high-profile disagreement and its unexpected connection to financial markets. The Genesis of the Trump-Musk Tension The relationship between Elon Musk, the driving force behind companies like Tesla and SpaceX, and former U.S. President Donald Trump hasn’t always been smooth. While there were periods of apparent collaboration or mutual interest, underlying disagreements often surfaced. The recent escalation seems to have stemmed from Musk’s decision to step away from Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (dubbed ‘DOGE’ by some, perhaps coincidentally resonating with the crypto community familiar with Dogecoin). Further fueling the fire was Musk’s vocal criticism of a Trump-era tax bill. A key point of contention for Musk was the bill’s impact on electric vehicle purchase subsidies. As the CEO of Tesla, a leading electric vehicle manufacturer, Musk argued that ending these incentives was detrimental to the adoption of sustainable transportation and the growth of the domestic EV industry. Trump’s Response and the Escalation Political disagreements, especially involving figures with large public platforms, can quickly intensify. Following Musk’s criticism and resignation from the advisory council, Donald Trump’s response was swift and public. Trump reportedly vowed to review and potentially cancel government contracts held by Musk’s companies, specifically mentioning those with SpaceX and potentially others related to Tesla or his other ventures. This threat carried significant weight, particularly for SpaceX, which relies heavily on contracts with NASA and the U.S. government for many of its operations, including the development and utilization of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. The Dragon’s Fate: Initial Concerns and Musk’s Hint In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s public statements, speculation mounted regarding the potential consequences for SpaceX. Government contracts are the lifeblood for many aerospace companies, and the threat of their cancellation created uncertainty. Amidst this backdrop of escalating tensions and public pressure, Elon Musk himself initially posted a message on X (formerly Twitter) that was interpreted by many as hinting at the potential decommissioning of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. While the exact wording might have been nuanced, the timing and context led to widespread concern, particularly within the space industry and among those who follow NASA’s activities closely. Why would Musk hint at decommissioning a successful, operational spacecraft? Possible interpretations included: A negotiating tactic to highlight the severity of Trump’s threat. Expressing frustration over the potential political interference in SpaceX’s operations. A warning about the consequences of disrupting critical national space infrastructure. Regardless of the specific intent, the mere suggestion that the Dragon’s future was in question added significant drama to the unfolding feud. The Importance of the SpaceX Dragon To understand the weight of the potential decommissioning hint, it’s crucial to appreciate the role the SpaceX Dragon plays. The Dragon spacecraft is not just another rocket or satellite; it is NASA’s primary vehicle for transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). This capability is vital for maintaining the ISS, conducting scientific research in orbit, and ensuring the U.S. has independent access to space for human spaceflight. Before Dragon, the U.S. relied solely on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crew transport after the retirement of the Space Shuttle program. The success of the Dragon program, developed under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, marked a significant milestone, restoring American capability for crewed spaceflight from American soil. Key aspects of the Dragon’s importance: Crew Transportation: It’s the only currently operational American spacecraft certified by NASA to carry humans to the ISS. Cargo Resupply: A cargo version of Dragon also delivers essential supplies and experiments to the ISS. Reusable Technology: Dragon capsules and their Falcon 9 boosters are largely reusable, reducing the cost of space access. National Security/Independence: Ensures the U.S. isn’t solely dependent on other nations for crew access to the ISS. Threatening the future of such a critical piece of infrastructure naturally caused alarm among space enthusiasts, policymakers, and the public. The Ripple Effect: Tesla Stock and the Crypto Market The public spat between two such high-profile figures had consequences extending beyond just the aerospace industry. Elon Musk’s influence stretches across technology, finance, and even the cryptocurrency world. The escalating tension and Trump’s threat to government contracts contributed to sharp declines in the stock price of Tesla Stock . Investors reacted negatively to the potential for political headwinds impacting one of Musk’s flagship companies, especially one that has previously benefited from government incentives and regulatory environments favorable to electric vehicles. Perhaps more surprisingly to some, the drama also coincided with negative sentiment in the broader Crypto Market . While the connection might not be immediately obvious, several factors can link such events to crypto volatility: Musk’s Influence: Elon Musk has a significant, albeit sometimes unpredictable, influence on the crypto market, particularly on assets like Dogecoin and Bitcoin, through his public statements and social media activity. Negative news surrounding Musk or his companies can sometimes spill over into crypto investor sentiment. Market Correlation: In times of increased geopolitical or economic uncertainty, investors may become risk-averse. Both Tesla Stock and cryptocurrencies are often perceived as riskier assets compared to traditional investments. Therefore, negative news driving down one can sometimes correlate with downturns in the other, as investors move towards safer havens. Headline Risk: Major headlines involving influential figures and potential disruptions can create general market jitters, affecting various asset classes. While it’s difficult to attribute market movements solely to one factor, the timing of the market declines alongside the Trump-Musk feud suggests a correlation driven by investor uncertainty surrounding Musk’s ventures and the broader risk environment. Musk’s Reassurance: Dragon is Safe Amidst the growing rumors, market volatility, and calls for de-escalation, Elon Musk took to his preferred platform, X, to clarify the situation regarding the SpaceX Dragon . In a direct response to the speculation and perhaps to soothe concerns raised by his earlier hint, Musk explicitly stated that the Dragon spacecraft would not be decommissioned. This statement served as a crucial reassurance, confirming that despite the political tensions and threats, the critical NASA crew transportation capability provided by Dragon would remain operational. The message aimed to separate the political dispute from the ongoing, vital work being done by SpaceX for the U.S. space program. This clarification likely helped to stabilize some of the uncertainty surrounding SpaceX’s immediate future and its relationship with NASA, though the broader political feud with Trump might continue to evolve. What Does This Mean Moving Forward? The episode highlights several important points: Political Influence: The potential for political disagreements to impact major companies and even critical national infrastructure like space transport. Market Sensitivity: How quickly financial markets, including Tesla Stock and the Crypto Market , can react to news involving influential figures and perceived risks. Musk’s Platform: The significant impact Elon Musk’s statements, particularly on platforms like X, can have on public perception and market sentiment across diverse sectors. While the immediate crisis regarding the Dragon spacecraft’s future seems averted by Musk’s clarification, the underlying political tensions with Donald Trump could still pose challenges for Musk’s various ventures in the future. Investors in Tesla Stock and participants in the Crypto Market will likely continue to monitor this dynamic relationship closely, given its potential to influence market sentiment. Summary: Navigating Uncertainty The brief but intense public spat between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, sparked by disagreements over policy and leading to threats against government contracts, created significant uncertainty. This tension prompted speculation about the future of the vital SpaceX Dragon spacecraft and contributed to negative movements in both Tesla Stock and the Crypto Market . Elon Musk’s subsequent clear statement confirming that the SpaceX Dragon will not be decommissioned provided a necessary reassurance, particularly for NASA and the space community. However, the incident serves as a potent reminder of how intertwined the worlds of business, politics, and even speculative markets like cryptocurrency have become, with the words and actions of key figures having far-reaching consequences.

The flagship cryptocurrency dipped over 3% before recovering and moving to its current level. Despite the recovery, BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $103,000. The price decline led to almost $1 billion in liquidations across the crypto futures market, dragging the prices of other tokens, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP) lower. Donald Trump and Elon Musk Clash Over Government Spending The crypto market plunged nearly 5% in the past 24 hours, wiping out over $70 billion from its market capitalization as Bitcoin led the decline, followed by Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL). The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $100,421 late on Thursday, sparking liquidations with almost $970 million, according to data from Coinglass. Long liquidations accounted for 90% of total liquidations, while shorts accounted for the remaining 10%. Analysts have pointed out that liquidation figures could be significantly higher, considering APIs face delays in reporting liquidations to third-party platforms. The decline comes amid a spiraling clash between President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The bill narrowly passed the house by a vote of 215-214, aiming to make permanent tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which Trump signed into law. The bill also includes a $4 trillion increase in the US debt ceiling, among several other issues. Musk had condemned the bill in a series of social media posts, calling it the “Big Ugly Spending Bill,” adding it would increase the government deficit by $2.5 trillion and that Trump’s tariffs would likely spark a recession in the second half of 2025. Trump dismissed Musk’s criticisms and alleged it was motivated by the bill eliminating electric vehicles (EV) tax credits. Trump stated, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Facing Immediate Crash Risk Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a cooling phase after a significant rally that saw the price surge to a new all-time high of $111,970. Analysts believe that BTC’s post-rally decline could cause its price to crash to $100,000 or lower. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to $100,000 on Thursday before recovering and moving to current levels. BTC’s pullback is consistent with the market’s behavior after an extended bullish phase. A dip below $100,000 could give traders a fresh opportunity to buy BTC at a discount. Analysts remain optimistic about BTC’s recovery, stating that a correction below $100,000 is crucial in determining the prospect of another rally. If buyers step in to support the price at crucial support levels, BTC could recover and continue its bullish trajectory, potentially rising beyond $115,000. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Investors who bet on Bitcoin took a significant hit over the past 24 hours as the flagship cryptocurrency plunged over 3%, falling to a low of $100,500 before recovering and moving to current levels. The decline comes amid an escalating feud between President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. BTC’s sudden decline caught traders off guard as their positions were liquidated. Musk escalated his ongoing feud with President Trump, taking to X to state that Trump’s tariff plans will create a recession in the second half of the year. Several analysts share the opinion, with Pav Hundal, lead analyst at Swyftx, stating that policymakers may delay monetary easing until they get hard data on the impact of Trump’s tariffs. President Trump, taking aim at Musk, posted on Truth Social that terminating Musk’s government subsidies and contracts would save “billions and billions for the US government.” Musk responded by stating that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately, a statement that he rescinded later. “In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.” Another factor weighing down on BTC is an increasing number of long-term holders locking profits and selling off their holdings. Glassnode stated in a market note, “With long-term holders gradually applying sell pressure, the probability of a short-term correction continues to build, particularly in the absence of a strong upside catalyst to push Bitcoin decisively above [$111,800].” BTC started the previous week in positive territory after posting an increase of 1.16% on Sunday. The price continued to push higher on Monday, rising 0.32%, but was back in the red on Tuesday, falling 0.46% to slip below $109,000 and settling at $108,954. The price declined on Wednesday, falling 1.03% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell 1.51%, dropping below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $105,775. The price plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and move to 105,903. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday and fell 0.44% to $105,435. Price action remained bearish on Wednesday as BTC fell nearly 1% to go below $105,000 and settle at $104,755. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 3%, plunging to a low of $100,421 before settling at $101,615.

The digital asset market just got a seismic shake-up, and it’s not from the usual suspects. This time, it’s Qubetics ($TICS), Render, and Polygon stealing the spotlight. With over millions already raised in its presale, Qubetics is in headlines everywhere. Meanwhile, Render’s real-time rendering network is making creators drool, and Polygon just threw $300,000 into Folks Finance to dominate crosschain lending. These aren’t just updates. They’re strategic leaps. Those who blink might miss the next generation of crypto infrastructure. Qubetics ($TICS), now in its 37th presale stage, isn’t following old patterns—it’s rewriting them. Where legacy networks struggled with developer usability and real-life scalability, Qubetics walks right in with tools like QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, streamlining development with machine-level precision. This momentum, paired with projections of up to 4,350% ROI post-mainnet, suggests $TICS is built not only for today’s digital challenges but for the ones no one else has solved yet. Qubetics ($TICS): Functional Blockchain for Real Problems Qubetics ($TICS) is a performance-driven blockchain project built with real-world application at its core. Its mission? Streamline the development, deployment, and scaling of decentralized tools using optimized environments for coders and technical architects. The heart of this ecosystem lies in QubeQode, an intuitive and intelligent programming interface that reduces time-to-deploy by over 60% compared to traditional smart contract frameworks. Alongside that, Qubetics IDE empowers creators to write, test, debug, and deploy—all in one place—cutting away complexity like a machete through red tape. Qubetics Final Presale Stage: Verified ROI, Real Utility, Limited Time Qubetics has entered the final phase of its public presale, marking the last opportunity for early participants to engage before listing. To date, the project has raised over $17.7 million, distributed more than 515 million $TICS tokens, and attracted over 27,500 holders. The token is currently priced at $0.3370, with the public listing price set at $0.40, offering an immediate and verified 18.71% return on investment. For instance, a $5,000 allocation at the current price yields approximately 14,838 $TICS, which will be valued at $5,935.39 upon listing. Looking beyond listing, the growth potential is substantial. If $TICS reaches $1, the return rises to 196.77%. At $5, it reaches 1,383.85%, and if it climbs to $10 or $15, investors could realize returns of 2,867.7% and 4,351.55%, respectively. These figures are not speculative—they are grounded in precise tokenomics and supported by Qubetics’ growing utility across sectors. From no-code cross-border payment solutions via QubeQode, to on-chain contract auditing through the Qubetics IDE, the ecosystem is already delivering tangible outcomes. This practical integration of blockchain technology is a key reason why Qubetics is increasingly regarded as one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025. With just 10 million $TICS tokens remaining, and no further sale phases planned, the window to enter at the presale rate is closing quickly. As momentum accelerates and availability declines, this final presale stage represents a rare and strategically timed opportunity for investors seeking high-upside exposure to a utility-driven Web3 platform. Render: Creative Economy Supercharged Render is building a GPU-powered decentralized rendering platform that fuels the creator economy—film, metaverse, architecture, and industrial design alike. It transforms idle GPU capacity into an income-generating asset while delivering rendering power to users in record time. With its current live price at $3.94 and 24-hour trading volume exceeding $70 million, Render shows no signs of slowing. Although it dipped slightly by 1.55% today, the long-term signals remain bullish due to expanding utility. A 3D artist developing metaverse environments no longer waits hours to render scenes. Through Render, complex textures and models are processed on-chain in minutes. That efficiency frees up time and maximizes profit potential. Render’s decentralized node economy delivers not only faster results, but also removes the chokehold of centralized rendering services. The shift toward this efficient infrastructure is why Render remains among the best crypto to invest in June 2025, especially for those eyeing the rapidly scaling digital production industries. Polygon: $300K Bet on the Future of Crosschain Lending Polygon is not just sustaining DeFi infrastructure—it’s supercharging it. With its recent $300,000 grant to Folks Finance, Polygon is turning crosschain lending into a secure, unified experience. Folks Finance integrates Polygon’s proof-of-stake consensus with Chainlink’s CCIP and Circle’s CCTP to ensure secure communication across blockchains. By eliminating bridges and synthetic assets, it safeguards users while enabling seamless asset deployment across multiple chains. Here’s the impact: a user on Avalanche can now collateralize assets and borrow on Polygon without converting or bridging. The system remains native, efficient, and secure. With the first $100,000 in POL tokens already deployed, the roadmap is clear. Polygon is aligning itself with infrastructure-first DeFi protocols that aren’t chasing hype—they’re building functionality. In a post-Aave retrenchment environment, this move gives Polygon a leadership edge and secures its ranking as a best crypto to invest in June 2025 for those prioritizing real utility and liquidity. Comparative Outlook: Why These Coins Matter in June 2025 What separates Qubetics ($TICS), Render, and Polygon from the countless other projects out there isn’t noise—it’s delivery. Qubetics solves tangible pain points for blockchain developers, offering a presale project already attracting serious engagement with over 515 million tokens sold. Render addresses a massive need in the digital asset space—speed and decentralization of GPU-based rendering. Polygon, meanwhile, shows foresight by enabling crosschain liquidity with secure and composable architecture, not quick fixes. These aren’t isolated updates—they’re ecosystem shifts. One focuses on developer empowerment, one fuels digital creators, and one locks down DeFi scalability. Whether it’s the precision of QubeQode, the ROI potential in $TICS, the uptime of Render’s nodes, or the seamless lending enabled by Polygon, these projects aren’t asking for attention. They’re earning it. In June 2025, these three projects rank high as the best crypto to invest in June 2025 for community members, early buyers, and strategic thinkers alike. Conclusion: Strategic Moves for the Next Crypto Epoch Qubetics ($TICS), Render, and Polygon are defining new blueprints for blockchain adoption, and these are the best crypto to invest in June 2025. Qubetics is already rewriting how projects are built and deployed. Render gives creatives new power, while Polygon builds trust in DeFi again. These three aren’t chasing headlines—they’re reshaping the architecture of digital value. Whether the interest lies in tools, scaling, or liquidity, each project opens doors that older networks left locked. This June, the question isn’t which project looks promising—it’s which one can afford to be ignored. The presale for Qubetics continues, but not forever. There’s still time to engage—before the mainnet sets a new standard.

On Thursday, after Elon tore into Trump’s latest federal spending bill, Trump hit back hard by threatening to yank government contracts from every one of Elon’s companies. Elon then escalated it. He said Trump never would’ve gotten re-elected if it weren’t for him and added that SpaceX would shut down the Dragon spacecraft immediately if the president cut their funding. Within hours, Tesla’s stock dropped so sharply that $152 billion was wiped from the company’s value, the largest one-day loss Tesla has ever seen. Elon’s personal wealth already dropped $34 billion this week, making his total losses at nearly $200 billion. Trump threatens contracts, Tesla tanks $152 billion Just a few days ago, Elon and Trump were thick as thieves. Elon was given an advisory role in Trump’s administration and even had the president babysitting his kid on Air Force One and inside the Oval. That’s gone now. After the dust settled, Tesla recovered 5% in pre-market hours on Friday, but the loss remains massive. Tesla’s current problems go way beyond this friendship-turned-feud. Sales are weak, Elon is juggling multiple companies at once, and investors are getting nervous. Wall Street has been questioning his ability to lead for months, and this is only making it worse. Tom Hulick, the CEO of Strategy Asset Managers, said Friday on CNBC’s Squawk Box Europe that investors are right to worry when “two people are going at each other’s throats just like Trump and Musk are right now.” Hulick also tried to push for calm, calling the situation a “schoolyard spat” and urging people to focus on the data coming out of Tesla — including earnings, cost-cutting, and infrastructure efforts in the US and overseas. “Whether there’s a spat between Trump and Musk or between two different nations,” he said, “I think people are going to settle down and cooler heads are going to prevail.” But this isn’t just about stock prices. Trump has the power to cancel or delay billions of dollars’ worth of contracts. That includes defense and intelligence deals that don’t even appear on public records. And while Elon once said, “If I cared about subsidies, I would have entered the oil and gas industry,” his empire tells a different story. Government cash fuels Elon’s empire For two decades, Elon’s businesses have been built with help from the US government. Whether it was low-interest loans, tax incentives, or direct federal contracts, he’s collected tens of billions in support. The Washington Post put the number at $38 billion, although that number probably doesn’t include a good chunk of classified deals from defense agencies. That’s a massive amount of taxpayer money propping up companies that Elon claims are self-made. Now, with Trump threatening to turn off the flow, Elon could be looking at a brutal loss in revenue across every one of his companies. Paul Levinson, a communications professor at Fordham University, thinks Elon will survive it. “Musk has ample resources to sustain those losses, reshuffle and rebuild his companies and holdings, and come out ahead and on top,” Levinson said. “Bottom line: if all the Trump government does in its feud with Musk is attack his financial interests, Musk is very likely to not only survive but continue to thrive.” Still, that doesn’t change what’s on the line. This is not a Twitter argument. This is the president of the United States threatening to pull billions in taxpayer-backed deals from the world’s richest man. And the financial bleeding has already begun.",OP-ED|SpaceX|Tesla|USD|xAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-06 11:30:56

The firm will sell 11.76 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD), expecting to bring in an estimated $979.7 million after fees and expenses, according to a press release . The shares, which sit below Strategy’s other preferred offerings STRF and STRK , are set to settle on June 10. Unlike STRF, which has senior status and lower volatility, and STRK, which is convertible and pays 8%, STRD offers the highest yield among Strategy’s capital products while being riskier. It comes with a non-cumulative dividend, meaning missed payments won't accrue, and dividends will only be paid when declared by the board. STRD is designed to appeal to investors seeking high-yield options . The shares are non-callable under normal conditions, with redemption clauses kicking in only under certain tax events or structural shifts in the company, the release reads. Strategy says the proceeds of the offering are going to be used for general corporate purposes, which include the acquisition of additional bitcoin.

This transfer, amounting to 300 BTC – valued at approximately $31 million at the time of the report – was allegedly sent to addresses associated with Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht . This event not only highlights the enduring legacy of darknet markets but also raises serious questions about the movement of illicit funds within the crypto ecosystem. What Happened: The $31M Bitcoin Donation Explained According to reports citing blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the substantial transfer of 300 Bitcoin originated from a wallet believed to be connected to AlphaBay. AlphaBay was one of the largest darknet markets operating after the shutdown of Silk Road, facilitating the trade of illicit goods and services before its own takedown in 2017. The recipient of this large sum is reportedly wallets controlled by or associated with Ross Ulbricht, who is currently serving a life sentence without parole for his role in creating and operating the original Silk Road marketplace. The sheer size of this alleged donation immediately drew attention, prompting investigations into the source and purpose of the funds. Amount: 300 BTC Approximate Value: $31 million (at the time of reporting) Source: Wallet linked to AlphaBay darknet market Recipient: Wallets reportedly associated with Ross Ulbricht Reported By: Cointelegraph, citing Chainalysis The origin of the funds is speculated to be from a major vendor who operated on the AlphaBay platform. This suggests a potential connection between high-level operators within the darknet world, even years after their respective markets have been dismantled by law enforcement. Connecting the Dots: From AlphaBay Darknet to Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht The alleged transfer links two of the most notorious figures/entities in the history of darknet markets. Silk Road, founded by Ross Ulbricht (under the pseudonym ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’), pioneered the use of Bitcoin for anonymous transactions on a large scale, paving the way for subsequent markets like AlphaBay. AlphaBay rose to prominence following Silk Road’s demise, inheriting a user base and operational model. The connection between an AlphaBay-linked wallet and Ross Ulbricht is significant for several reasons: Historical Link: It underscores the intertwined history and potential relationships between operators and vendors across different generations of darknet markets. Financial Flow: It indicates that substantial amounts of cryptocurrency potentially earned from illicit activities on these platforms may still be moving years later. Ulbricht’s Status: It raises questions about why funds would be sent to someone serving a life sentence and what purpose such a large sum could serve under those circumstances. While the exact motivations behind the alleged donation remain unclear, possibilities range from support for Ulbricht’s legal appeals or personal needs to other, potentially more complex or illicit arrangements. The very act of sending such a large amount from a darknet-associated source to a figure like Ulbricht naturally attracts scrutiny from law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms. The Role of Crypto Mixing : Obscuring the Trail A key detail in the report is that the funds were allegedly moved through multiple centralized mixing services, including one known as Jambler. Crypto mixing , also known as coin mixing or tumbling, is a process used to obscure the origin or destination of cryptocurrency funds. Here’s a simplified look at how mixing services work: Imagine you have 1 Bitcoin you want to make harder to trace. You send it to a mixing service. The service pools your Bitcoin with Bitcoin from many other users. After a period, the service sends you back 1 Bitcoin (minus a fee), but it’s a different Bitcoin that came from the pooled funds, not the exact one you sent in. By mixing your funds with those of many others, the direct link between your initial deposit address and your final withdrawal address is broken, making it more difficult for blockchain analysis to follow the trail. Centralized mixers, like Jambler mentioned in the report, are services operated by a single entity. Users send their funds to the mixer’s wallet, and the mixer sends back ‘clean’ coins from its reserves to designated withdrawal addresses. While some users might use mixers for legitimate privacy reasons, they are frequently employed by those seeking to launder money or hide the proceeds of crime, precisely because they break the link to the original source. The alleged use of multiple mixing services in this transfer strongly suggests an intent to obfuscate the transaction trail and hide the connection between the AlphaBay-linked source and the Ulbricht-associated destination. This act itself raises a red flag for potential criminal activity, as legitimate transactions typically do not require such extensive efforts to hide their path. Why Does This Matter? Implications for Crime and Regulation This incident is not just an isolated event; it carries broader implications for the cryptocurrency space and the ongoing battle against financial crime: Perception of Crypto: Events like this reinforce the narrative that cryptocurrency is a tool for criminals, potentially increasing negative public perception and fueling calls for stricter regulation. Regulatory Pressure: Regulators worldwide are already grappling with how to monitor and control cryptocurrency flows. A high-profile case involving a large sum from a darknet market going to a notorious figure via mixing services is likely to intensify calls for greater surveillance and regulation of mixers and potentially self-hosted wallets. Challenge to Law Enforcement: While blockchain is inherently transparent, techniques like mixing present significant challenges to law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms attempting to trace illicit funds. Enduring Darknet Wealth: It highlights that significant wealth generated from darknet activities may still be held and potentially moved within the crypto ecosystem years after markets are shut down. The alleged transfer serves as a stark reminder that the criminal element that was among the early adopters of Bitcoin continues to pose challenges to the ecosystem’s integrity and reputation. Tracking Illicit Funds: Challenges and Progress Tracking funds on the blockchain, especially those that have passed through mixers, is a complex task. While every transaction is recorded on the public ledger, identifying the real-world entities behind addresses is the challenge. Mixers deliberately add noise to the transaction graph. However, blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis, Elliptic, and others have made significant progress in developing tools and techniques to de-mix transactions and follow funds through complex paths. They use sophisticated algorithms, clustering techniques, and data from known entities (like exchanges or seized wallets) to identify patterns and potentially link addresses back to individuals or services. Challenges still exist: Sophistication of Mixers: Mixers are constantly evolving to become more effective at obfuscation. Decentralized Mixing: While centralized mixers can sometimes be compromised or their operators arrested, decentralized mixing methods (like CoinJoin implemented in some wallets) are harder to control. Regulatory Patchwork: Lack of consistent global regulation on mixers and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) makes cross-border tracing difficult. Despite these challenges, the fact that firms like Chainalysis can reportedly trace funds even after passing through mixers demonstrates that obfuscation is not foolproof and that the tools for combating crypto-enabled crime are improving. What Can We Learn? Actionable Insights This alleged Bitcoin donation offers several key takeaways for individuals, businesses, and regulators in the crypto space: For Individuals: Understand the risks associated with darknet markets and illicit activities. Be aware that funds originating from such sources can be tracked, albeit with difficulty. For Businesses (Exchanges, Wallets, etc.): Implement robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. Utilize blockchain analytics tools to monitor transactions for suspicious activity, especially flows involving mixers or addresses linked to known illicit entities. Report suspicious transactions to relevant authorities. For Regulators and Law Enforcement: Continue investing in blockchain analysis capabilities. Develop clearer regulations regarding mixers and privacy-enhancing technologies to prevent their misuse for illicit purposes. Foster international cooperation to track cross-border crypto flows associated with crime. The incident underscores the importance of vigilance and proactive measures within the crypto ecosystem to prevent it from being exploited by criminals seeking to move or launder funds generated from activities on platforms like the AlphaBay darknet . Conclusion The alleged transfer of $31 million in Bitcoin from an AlphaBay-linked wallet to addresses associated with Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht is a significant event that shines a spotlight on the persistent challenges of illicit finance within the cryptocurrency world. The reported use of extensive crypto mixing highlights the efforts criminals take to hide their tracks, while the involvement of figures tied to notorious darknet markets like AlphaBay and Silk Road underscores the long-term impact of these platforms. While blockchain technology offers transparency, sophisticated obfuscation techniques require equally sophisticated analytical tools and robust regulatory frameworks to combat misuse. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that the fight against crypto-enabled crime is ongoing and requires continuous effort from all stakeholders to maintain the integrity and reputation of the digital asset space.

Speaking at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on June 5, Khosrowshahi confirmed that the ridesharing giant is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins as part of its broader fintech strategy. “We’re definitely going to take a look,” Khosrowshahi said during a live interview. “Stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value.” While he acknowledged Bitcoin’s popularity and established presence, he noted that stablecoins offer something more tangible for companies with global financial operations. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to mirror the value of traditional currencies—most commonly the US dollar—by being backed with fiat reserves and short-term treasury instruments. Khosrowshahi emphasized that their utility as a payment vehicle is what draws Uber’s interest. “They are super interesting to us, especially for moving money across borders and reducing international transaction costs,” he said. Uber Joins List of Companies Exploring Stablecoins Uber isn’t alone in considering stablecoins for mainstream financial infrastructure. Earlier this year, Stripe co-founder John Collison also revealed that the payment firm had entered preliminary talks with banks about integrating stablecoins into their systems. Stripe’s interest, like Uber, stems from the potential of these digital currencies to streamline cross-border payments and reduce reliance on outdated banking rails. According to a recent report by Fireblocks, 90% of surveyed institutional players are currently exploring the use of stablecoins in their operations. This includes not only fintech companies but also traditional banks and government institutions. Globally, governments are also exploring stablecoins. In April, Russia’s finance ministry proposed the creation of a government-backed stablecoin, while in Abu Dhabi, three major institutions teamed up to launch a dirham-pegged coin . These moves reflect a growing recognition of stablecoins as tools not just for speculation, but for efficient, regulated financial transactions. Stablecoin Market Sees Rapid Growth The stablecoin market has seen explosive growth over the past year. Citigroup reported that the market cap for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins crossed $230 billion in April 2025—a 54% increase year-over-year. Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC dominate the market, making up roughly 90% of the total capitalization. With annual transaction volumes reaching $27.6 trillion in 2024—outpacing both Visa and Mastercard—stablecoins are fast becoming one of the most important tools in digital finance. For global platforms like Uber, their adoption may soon move from consideration to reality.

This deadline was established in April when the court granted a temporary pause in the appellate proceedings following a joint request from both Ripple and the SEC. Legal observers are closely monitoring this date, as it could signal the resumption of the appeal and cross-appeal process or reveal a change in direction of the case. Bill Morgan, a well-known attorney who has been actively commenting on developments, noted that a response must be filed soon. According to him, either the legal proceedings will move forward with briefing deadlines, or some new procedural development will take place. The count down to the date the SEC must report to the Appeal Court is now 12 days. Something has to happen by then or the Appeal and Cross-appeal continues and a briefing is due from Ripple. pic.twitter.com/pxImvvJxGG — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 4, 2025 Uncertainty Around a Possible Resolution The looming deadline has reignited speculation about whether a final resolution between Ripple and the SEC might be near. However, opinions within the legal community remain divided. One complicating factor is the involvement of Justin Keener, who is not a party to the case but has submitted filings in connection with it. Some view Keener’s actions as an attempt to influence the outcome or introduce unrelated legal arguments, adding complexity to an already intricate situation. According to a Bloomberg report , Attorney Andrew Balthazor, a partner at Holland & Knight, expressed skepticism about the possibility of a near-term resolution. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He pointed out that both parties have had ample time to submit updates or documentation, yet no substantive filings have been made since the court granted the pause. For Balthazor, this delay implies that unresolved issues may still be preventing a clear path forward. In contrast, Keri Axel of Waymaker LLP takes a more optimistic view. While she acknowledges the lack of momentum, she interprets the pause as a possible opportunity for constructive dialogue between the parties and believes they will resolve the case. All Eyes Are On the SEC The SEC’s enforcement actions in the crypto space have faced criticism for lacking clarity and consistency . Many see this case, which has been ongoing for years, as a test of the agency’s approach to digital assets. Its end would cement XRP’s legal clarity and the SEC’s new pro-crypto stance. As June 16 approaches, all eyes will be on the SEC, as the end of the lawsuit would also eliminate uncertainty and allow hesitant institutions to embrace XRP and partner with Ripple to advance global financial systems.

In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Bryson says he’s not forecasting a recession at this time, but it wouldn’t take much more negative economic data to change that outlook. “We don’t have the economy going into recession. I would say we’re skating pretty close to one. It wouldn’t take another big shock to potentially push the economy into a recession if things are weakening later.” He expects next year to have greater economic growth than in 2025, which is facing a slowdown from the impacts of Trump’s tariffs. “2026 is going to be a lot better year than 2025. 2025 is, for us, more about the negative effects of tariffs. 2026 is more about some modest stimulus coming from the fiscal side, monetary ease and some deregulation.” Bryson also predicts that in about one year, the Fed will have lowered the current rate of 425-450 basis points to about 100 basis points to stimulate the economy. “A year from now, I still think rates are probably going to be about 100 basis points… If the unemployment rate does start to come up later this year, which we think it will, as tariffs slow the economy down, then we think the Fed pivots and then starts to cut rates.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

However, Bitcoins continue to flow from older wallets into newer cohorts, as long-term holders realize profits. Bitcoin (BTC) continues with its sideways price action, on a mix of buying and selling. The leading coin is in an accumulation range, yet it has struggled to break into a new price range despite ongoing coin scarcity. Currently, BTC has absorbed most of the short-term distribution and profit-taking, and is back in the accumulation range, according to Glassnode. However, older whales are still active, while the rotation to new wallets is taking time. If accumulation is rising, why is $BTC still declining Because while distribution has slowed and accumulation is returning, it hasn’t been enough to offset the pressure from profit-taking by older holders. 🧵👇 https://t.co/hc4TVHxSIs pic.twitter.com/R4jFT0dVvC — glassnode (@glassnode) June 6, 2025 Large BTC holders are responsible for relative stability Until recently, most of the large BTC holders were trending toward coin distribution before switching to overall accumulation . Whale holders are closely watched, as they absorb the known sources of accessible BTC, including exchange reserves, newly mined coins, and reserves on OTC markets. The recent shift of ownership is seen as the main factor behind the relatively ‘boring’ price action, mostly driven by large-scale holders. Currently, every BTC sold finds a buyer, but wallet cohorts of over 12 months may be willing to sell and lock in their sizeable profits. Previous on-chain observations suggest prices above $90,000 per BTC are in the provenance of whales and institutions , with retail remaining a relatively small factor. The trend of distribution from the largest wallets to mid-range wallets with 100 to 1,000 BTC continues. Based on the Rainbow chart, Bitcoin is even more affordable, with a strong buy indicator , with the potential for accumulation at even higher prices. The distribution to wallets also remains less transparent after the inflow of institutions. Some continue to hold through Coinbase Custody, while other large holders control multiple wallets with smaller amounts of BTC. Derivative traders switch to fearful sentiment Demand from institutions works independently of derivative markets. Trading BTC on paper retains its different price mechanisms, driven by leveraged long and short positions. While spot traders and whales are buying up BTC, derivative traders are showing fearful behavior, shifting from extreme greed in May back into the fear range . According to CryptoQuant, the recent cycle still shows strong rallies , which are then tempered by a downward move. The shift may be a sign of big leveraged players trying to cool the market and retain relatively stable and high price levels to extend institutional adoption. In the coming days, derivative traders set up a new range for Bitcoin between $100,000 and $105,000. Any price moves may lead to liquidations of the most numerous positions around those price levels. BTC derivative traders are still limited by the new range of liquidity, this time between $100,000 and $105,000. | Source: Coinglass Derivative traders also partially rely on long-term whales, ETFs and corporate buyers for a deep support level. Even with the most recent acquisitions, some of the institutional buyers have an average acquisition price as low as $67,000. Miners have produced coins at breakeven and can also afford to hold their reserves at over 1.9M coins. Corporate holders as a whole bought up 3.39M coins, with more acquisitions announced almost daily, suggesting a long-term confidence and a relatively low risk of capitulation.

SEC Lawsuit: Why June 16 Is Such an Important Date?,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-why-june-16-is-such-an-important-date/,"TL;DR Ripple and the SEC face a key deadline as the lawsuit drags on without resolution. The battle’s outcome is unlikely to cause any substantial volatility for XRP as the price now hinges on potential ETF approvals and Ripple’s business expansions. Ripple and the SEC Remain Silent It has been almost three months since Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, dropped the bomb, stating that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would dismiss its case against the company. Despite the numerous developments that have occurred since then, however, the lawsuit has yet to reach its official conclusion. Earlier this week, the American attorney Fred Rispoli noted that “the status update in the 2nd Circuit looms large,” and Ripple and the SEC have not moved forward with the necessary refiling. Recall that the two sides previously agreed that the company would pay a $50 million penalty for violating certain laws (instead of the previously ruled $125 million), which would mark the end of the legal battle. However, Judge Analisa Torres denied the motion, asserting that the parties failed to file it properly under Rule 60. Rispoli said the deadline for that is June 16, expecting the entities to abide by the rules by then. In case they don’t, the lawyer believes the magistrates could restart the briefing process and push it for another 60 days. He described Torres’ ruling as “clear” and claimed that Ripple and the SEC “need to beg for forgiveness.” “Ripple will say whatever to get it done, but how much public groveling is the SEC willing to do? And how much groveling will be authorized? We have 12 days to find out,” Rispoli concluded. It is worth noting that the attorney provided the update on June 4, with no major progress on the Ripple v. SEC front since then. Other industry participants who think the following days could be crucial for the case are Bill Morgan and the X user Levi. The former argued that something has to happen by June 16 , or the appeal and cross-appeal will continue. For his part, Levi predicted that the date would mark the lawsuit’s official end . Possible Impact for XRP? The developments surrounding the case were among the main factors triggering substantial volatility for Ripple’s native token over the past several years. Since Garlinghouse’s announcement in March, though, the lawsuit has been largely priced into XRP’s valuation. Looking ahead, future price movements for the asset may depend on elements such as the approval of XRP ETFs or Ripple’s further advancement and possible collaborations. Nearly a dozen well-known companies have announced their intentions to introduce the first spot XRP exchange-traded fund in the USA, with Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton being among the examples. Such a product will give investors an additional option to gain exposure to the asset, with many analysts viewing the potential launch as a catalyst for a price rally. According to Polymarket , the odds of approval before the end of 2025 stand at approximately 94%. Speaking of collaborations, it is worth mentioning that in April, Ripple acquired the prime broker Hidden Road for a whopping $1.25 billion. There was also rising speculation that the company was willing to purchase the stablecoin issuer Circle for more than $10 billion, but Garlinghouse recently rejected the rumors. Meanwhile, XRP currently trades at around $2.15, representing a 12% decline over the past two weeks. The post Ripple v.

Authorities in China have reportedly uncovered multiple cases of money laundering activity exploiting the platform’s unique features. This development highlights the ongoing challenges regulators face in monitoring decentralized finance and raises questions about the methods used to obscure illicit funds within the crypto ecosystem. What’s Happening with Hyperliquid and China? According to Mirror Tang, founder of blockchain security firm Salus, Chinese authorities have been actively investigating illicit financial flows within the crypto space. Since March, their efforts have led to the detection of at least three distinct money laundering cases specifically linked to the Hyperliquid platform. This indicates a focused effort by Chinese law enforcement to track and dismantle operations using digital assets for illegal purposes, even on platforms designed for decentralized trading. The scale and nature of these cases are still being fully assessed, but the initial reports point to sophisticated techniques. The fact that authorities have publicly linked these activities to a specific DEX like Hyperliquid suggests they have identified a pattern or vulnerability being exploited. For users and observers of the China crypto landscape, this serves as a stark reminder that despite restrictions on trading, monitoring and enforcement remain high priorities for Beijing. How Was Hyperliquid Exploited for Money Laundering? The core of the alleged scheme appears to revolve around exploiting Hyperliquid ‘s trading mechanics, particularly its high-leverage perpetual contracts and liquidation mechanism. The reported method involves a coordinated strategy: Using Illicit Funds: Bad actors initiate the process with funds derived from illegal activities. Taking Positions on Hyperliquid: Significant positions are opened on Hyperliquid, often with high leverage. Taking Offsetting Positions on CEXs: Simultaneously, opposite positions are taken on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Intentionally Triggering Liquidation: The position on Hyperliquid is deliberately moved towards liquidation. Given Hyperliquid’s high leverage options, relatively small price movements can trigger large liquidations. Profiting on the CEX Side: As the Hyperliquid position is liquidated, the offsetting position on the CEX becomes profitable, effectively ‘washing’ the funds by generating seemingly legitimate trading profits on a regulated or semi-regulated platform. This method is complex because it requires simultaneous execution across different platforms and relies on manipulating outcomes on the DEX side. It leverages the transparency (or perceived lack thereof) of a DEX like Hyperliquid while cashing out on a CEX, where funds might be easier to off-ramp into traditional finance or other assets after passing through KYC/AML checks associated with the profitable trade. Is James Wynn Connected to the Hyperliquid Cases? Adding another layer of intrigue to the investigation is the mention of James Wynn . The report notes that the trading patterns observed in these alleged money laundering schemes bear a striking resemblance to the known trading activities of James Wynn, a prominent trader and whale on the Hyperliquid platform. It’s crucial to emphasize that the information available publicly, based on Mirror Tang’s statement, only points to a *resemblance* in trading patterns. It does not constitute proof of James Wynn’s direct involvement or guilt in these specific money laundering cases. The fact that authorities or observers noted this similarity suggests that the method employed might be distinctive or characteristic of certain high-volume trading strategies seen on Hyperliquid. Whether this resemblance is coincidental, indicative of a copycat scheme, or points to a more direct link remains unclear based on the current information. The mention of James Wynn , however, immediately draws attention from the crypto trading community familiar with his presence and activity on the platform. Why is China Cracking Down on Crypto Money Laundering? China has maintained a strict stance against cryptocurrencies for several years, citing concerns about financial stability, capital flight, and the potential for illicit activities. The detection of money laundering cases involving platforms like Hyperliquid reinforces the government’s narrative and justifies its ongoing enforcement efforts. For the China crypto scene, which largely operates underground or offshore, this serves as a reminder that authorities possess increasing capabilities to track cross-border flows and activities, even those attempting to use decentralized platforms for obfuscation. Beijing’s motivation stems from several factors: Capital Controls: Preventing large sums of money from leaving the country, undermining the stability of the yuan. Financial Risk: Mitigating risks associated with speculative trading and unregulated financial activities. Combating Crime: Disrupting funding sources and transfer methods for drug trafficking, fraud, corruption, and other illegal enterprises. The focus on a DEX indicates that Chinese authorities are expanding their surveillance and enforcement capabilities beyond centralized exchanges, adapting to the evolving methods used by criminals in the digital asset space. What Challenges Do DEXs Like Hyperliquid Face? Decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid offer significant advantages, including user control over funds, reduced counterparty risk, and often, access to innovative trading products like high-leverage perpetuals. However, their decentralized nature also presents unique challenges, particularly regarding regulatory compliance and preventing illicit use. The reported money laundering cases highlight these difficulties: Lack of Central Authority: Unlike CEXs, there is no single entity to implement traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures at the point of access. Pseudonymity: While transactions are on a public blockchain, linking wallet addresses to real-world identities is challenging without off-chain information. Complex Transaction Patterns: Schemes like the one described, involving multiple platforms and rapid, high-leverage trades, can be difficult to trace and identify as illicit in real-time. For a DEX operating in this environment, reputation is key. Incidents linked to money laundering, even if the platform itself is not complicit, can attract unwanted regulatory attention and erode user trust. Developers and the community around DEXs are increasingly exploring solutions, such as integrating analytics tools to monitor suspicious activity or collaborating with blockchain intelligence firms, but the inherent design of decentralization presents ongoing hurdles. Broader Implications for the Crypto Market The detection of these cases in China, and the specific method employed, carries implications beyond just Hyperliquid . It signals that: Regulators globally are becoming more sophisticated in tracking illicit flows across various crypto platforms, including DEXs. Criminals are continuously evolving their methods to bypass existing AML measures. Platforms offering high-leverage and complex derivatives may face increased scrutiny due to their potential misuse in such schemes. The perceived anonymity of DEXs is not absolute, and blockchain analysis tools are becoming more powerful. This situation underscores the ongoing tension between the principles of decentralization and the demands for regulatory compliance and financial crime prevention. As the crypto market matures, finding effective ways to address these challenges will be crucial for mainstream adoption and regulatory acceptance. Conclusion The report from China regarding the detection of money laundering cases involving Hyperliquid is a significant development. It highlights the creative, albeit illicit, methods criminals employ to exploit the features of decentralized platforms, specifically targeting the high-leverage liquidation mechanism. The mention of trading patterns similar to those of whale James Wynn adds a layer of public interest and speculation, though it’s vital to distinguish suspicion from proven fact. This incident serves as a potent reminder that the fight against money laundering in the digital asset space is far from over and is continuously adapting to technological advancements. For the China crypto community and the broader global market, it underscores the persistent regulatory risks and the need for platforms, whether centralized or decentralized, to contribute to combating financial crime. As authorities enhance their surveillance capabilities, the pressure on all crypto platforms to identify and prevent illicit activity will only grow.

In two separate but thematically linked developments, the Department of Justice moved to seize $7.74 million linked to North Korean IT operatives using false identities to infiltrate crypto firms, while AML platform Global Ledger reported that over $15 million in reserves tied to the sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex remains active. US DOJ Moves to Seize $7.74M in Crypto Earned by North Korean IT Workers Using Fake Identities The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has initiated civil forfeiture proceedings to seize over $7.74 million in cryptocurrency assets allegedly obtained by North Korean IT operatives who infiltrated the global blockchain industry using false identities. The seized assets—held across multiple self-custody wallets and Binance accounts—include Bitcoin (BTC), stablecoins like USDC and USDT, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains. The move follows a broader indictment from April 2023 against Sim Hyon Sop, a China-based financier accused of laundering funds for the North Korean government. In a statement released on June 5, the DOJ confirmed that the assets had initially been frozen during that 2023 action but were now subject to permanent seizure due to their connection to sanctioned North Korean entities. According to the DOJ’s civil complaint filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., the scheme involved North Korean IT professionals obtaining remote work contracts with blockchain and cryptocurrency firms, primarily in Western markets. These operatives used forged or stolen identification documents to masquerade as legitimate freelancers and developers, often working for months undetected. Once paid, the IT workers allegedly converted their salaries into stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT), and used advanced laundering tactics to obfuscate the origin of the funds. These included “chain-hopping,” moving assets across multiple blockchain networks, and converting funds into NFTs, an increasingly common tactic in illicit crypto transactions. The ultimate goal, according to the DOJ, was to funnel the laundered proceeds back to the North Korean regime through Sim and another sanctioned operative, Kim Sang Man, who has been previously blacklisted by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for his role in facilitating illicit financing. DOJ and National Security Leaders Sound the Alarm The Department of Justice has increasingly prioritized countering cyber and financial crimes tied to nation-state actors, particularly those from North Korea, Iran, and Russia. This case adds another layer of complexity, showing that cyber-enabled threats now extend into labor markets through freelance and remote job networks. The case is the latest in a series of revelations detailing North Korea’s strategic pivot to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology as an alternative financing channel amid crippling international sanctions. In April, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group released a report showing that North Korean hacking and infiltration activities have expanded to blockchain companies outside the US, with a growing focus on firms in Europe. The report cited increased regulatory enforcement in the United States as the reason for this geographic shift. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT previously reported in August 2024 that some North Korean-linked developers had embedded themselves in legitimate projects, earning up to $500,000 per month. Many of these developers were allegedly operating under Western aliases and providing smart contract development, auditing, and DeFi services to unsuspecting clients. Growing Industry Awareness, but Gaps Remain In response to the rising threat, the DOJ, the Department of State, and the US Treasury issued a joint advisory in 2022 warning tech firms—especially in the cryptocurrency sector—about the infiltration risk posed by North Korean IT workers. The advisory recommended enhanced KYC (Know Your Customer) and background verification for remote workers, emphasizing that blockchain companies are prime targets due to their often decentralized hiring practices and frequent use of anonymous work platforms. Despite these warnings, enforcement remains difficult. Many of the North Korean operatives reportedly use sophisticated anonymization tools, hire third-party intermediaries to pass job interviews, and use AI-generated documentation to build credible online personas. $15 Million in Garantex Reserves Still Active, AML Firm Warns of Sanctions Weakness Meanwhile, according to a new report published by Global Ledger, dormant crypto wallets associated with Garantex have resumed activity in recent months. The company’s Ethereum wallet, once inactive, began accumulating Ether (ETH) on March 6, and later funneled $2.3 million worth of the token through Tornado Cash—an Ethereum-based mixer sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 for enabling illicit finance. That same Ethereum wallet still holds approximately $6.1 million in ETH, which remains unmoved for now. In parallel, Bitcoin (BTC) reserves connected to Garantex also show suspicious movement. At least 2.2 BTC was bridged over to the TRON network and partially transferred to another platform, Grinex, according to Global Ledger’s on-chain analysis. Garantex ETH flows (Source: Global Ledger ) Lex Fisun, CEO and co-founder of Global Ledger, described the case as a wake-up call for regulators and a glaring example of how sanction enforcement continues to fall short in the decentralized financial ecosystem. “The Garantex case undermines the illusion of control that many still cling to,” Fisun said in an interview. “$15 million moving freely through obscure chains and mixers isn’t a failure of law — it’s a failure of sanction enforcement.” Fisun’s criticism shows the core dilemma faced by governments and regulatory bodies attempting to police blockchain networks, where assets can often be rapidly shuffled, bridged across chains, or disguised through privacy-enhancing tools like mixers or synthetic swaps. Tether’s Role and Garantex's Shutdown The renewed attention on Garantex began on March 6, when Tether Ltd., issuer of the stablecoin USDT, froze $27 million worth of tokens held in the exchange’s wallets. The same day, Garantex abruptly halted its operations, accusing Tether of waging “war against the Russian crypto market.” At the time, Garantex claimed its frozen wallets contained more than 2.5 billion rubles—approximately equivalent to the frozen $27 million USDt. While this action represented one of the most aggressive enforcement steps taken by a stablecoin issuer, it also prompted backlash from Russia and sparked a broader debate about the geopolitics of financial infrastructure in the digital age. Garantex has faced mounting legal scrutiny since being sanctioned by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in April 2022. OFAC accused the exchange of willfully disregarding Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols and facilitating illicit transactions, including those linked to ransomware and darknet markets. The European Union followed suit, adding Garantex to its own sanctions list on Feb. 24, 2025—coinciding with the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Adding to the legal firestorm, Garantex’s founder, Aleksej Bešciokov, was arrested on March 12 while vacationing with his family in India. The US has reportedly filed multiple conspiracy charges against him, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, and is seeking his extradition. If extradited, Bešciokov could become the highest-profile crypto executive from Russia to stand trial in the US for sanctions violations. Russia Eyes Stablecoin Alternatives In response to Tether’s clampdown, Russian officials are ramping up efforts to reduce reliance on foreign-controlled stablecoins. On April 17, Russian finance ministry official Osman Kabaloev remarked that recent developments had revealed the geopolitical risk of stablecoins like USDT. “We do not impose restrictions on the use of stablecoins within the experimental legal regime,” Kabaloev told state-owned media outlet TASS. “But recent developments have shown that this instrument can pose risks for us.” Just a week later, on April 24, Russia’s Ministry of Finance and Central Bank announced joint plans to launch a new digital asset exchange, one that would cater to what they call “super-qualified” investors. While details remain sparse, the move indicates Moscow’s desire to build financial infrastructure less susceptible to foreign control. The ongoing Garantex affair illustrates the growing limitations of traditional sanctions in the digital asset space. While financial blacklists and token freezes can offer short-term wins, crypto’s decentralized architecture allows for creative circumvention. Techniques like chain-hopping, privacy coin utilization, and bridging to obscure blockchains such as TRON continue to present massive enforcement challenges. Global Ledger’s findings serve as a stark reminder that sanctioning an exchange is not the same as neutralizing its reserves. Without real-time surveillance, stronger cross-jurisdictional collaboration, and technological enforcement tools, illicit funds may continue slipping through the cracks. The case also places new pressure on major players in the crypto infrastructure space—from centralized exchanges to stablecoin issuers—to adopt more aggressive compliance frameworks and enhance transparency when it comes to enforcement cooperation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 11:52:08

The dispute erupted today as CZ shared private reporter inquiries on his X account, vehemently denying any substantive ties to Sky He or his project, LuckyFuture, while ridiculing the basis of the New York Times’ questions. “FUD in the Making” According to Zhao, the full NY Times inquiry explicitly asked : “Does Tianying He have any personal or family connection with CZ or He Ye? And does Tianying He’s company, LuckyFuture, have any connection with Binance?” The reporter noted that Sky He features a photo with Zhao on his X profile, interacts with him online, and occasionally refers to him as “大表哥” (dà biǎogé), translated as “big cousin.” CZ framed these questions as baseless and built on negative assumptions due to a lack of evidence, pointedly asking: “How desperate do you have to be to make up the story above? Or are you being paid to smear?” The ex-Binance CEO sarcastically invited his followers to “see FUD in the making,” before systematically dismantling the implied connections. He clarified that he only followed Sky after seeing the Trump dinner attendee’s post featuring a BNB Chain logo from May 2024, stressing that he hadn’t known him before then. Furthermore, CZ stated that he only became aware of Sky’s project, LuckyFuture, after he himself made a public post about perpetual decentralized exchanges , prompting Sky to reach out. The 48-year-old also denied ever discussing Trump or U.S. matters with Sky. He explained that the “big cousin” reference was nothing more than a common term of respect and informal closeness within the vast Chinese-speaking crypto community, not a literal familial claim, humorously noting he took “600 selfies in one day in Token Dubai alone,” with many in those communities using the nickname. A Pattern of Combating “Negative” Reporting This latest pushback comes just weeks after Zhao went toe-to-toe with the Wall Street Journal over claims that he acted as a “fixer” for Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) in arranging overseas government meetings. Before that, the same outlet published a story alleging the crypto entrepreneur had held talks with representatives of the Trump family over the possibility of their investing in Binance.US. The WSJ report linked this to his pursuit of a presidential pardon following a guilty plea for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, which saw him imprisoned for four months and barred from managing Binance. Following those reports, CZ confirmed on May 8, 2025, that he had formally applied for clemency from President Trump through his legal team, citing the head of state’s pardon of BitMEX founders (who also pleaded guilty to Bank Secrecy Act violations) as precedent.

Recent activity surrounding projects potentially linked to prominent figures has sparked conversations and, at times, confusion within the Crypto Market . This was precisely the case involving the Trump family’s announced DeFi Project , World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and the popular TRUMP memecoin . Are WLFI and TRUMP Memecoin Connected? Getting the Facts Straight Confusion often arises in the crypto space, especially when projects share similar names or associations. Recently, speculation emerged regarding a potential link between the upcoming DeFi Project known as World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and the widely discussed TRUMP memecoin . Addressing this directly, Ogle, an advisor associated with the Trump family’s WLFI initiative, took to social media platform X to provide a definitive clarification. His message was clear and concise: WLFI and the TRUMP memecoin are two entirely separate and distinct projects . This distinction is vital for market transparency and understanding. While both might be associated with the ‘Trump’ name in the public consciousness, their underlying purposes, technology, and teams are presented as independent. Addressing Insider Trading Allegations : A Firm Denial Part of the reason for Ogle’s clarification stemmed from more serious concerns – specifically, allegations of Insider Trading Allegations . Reports or rumors had surfaced suggesting that Ogle might have potentially benefited from non-public information, possibly related to the TRUMP memecoin , following a recent dinner event. Ogle vehemently denied these accusations. He stated unequivocally that he did not want this matter to become a source of further controversy. His public statement on X directly addressed the claims, asserting their complete falsehood. He emphasized that he has never obtained any insider information and would never engage in transactions based on such privileged data. Maintaining integrity is crucial for advisors in the crypto space, particularly when associated with high-profile individuals or projects. Understanding the Two Projects: WLFI vs. TRUMP Memecoin To further underscore the separation, let’s briefly look at what is publicly understood about each project: World Liberty Financial (WLFI): Positioned as a DeFi Project associated with the Trump family. While details are still emerging, it is expected to focus on decentralized finance applications, potentially involving traditional financial concepts brought onto the blockchain. The emphasis appears to be on building a platform with specific utility. TRUMP Memecoin (MAGA Coin – TRUMP): This is a memecoin, primarily driven by community sentiment, social media trends, and speculation. Its value is largely tied to its popularity, association with political figures, and market hype rather than inherent utility within a decentralized application or financial system. The fundamental difference lies in their stated goals and mechanisms. WLFI aims to be a functional DeFi platform, while the TRUMP memecoin operates within the speculative and culturally driven realm of memecoins. Why is This Clarification Important for the Crypto Market ? The advisor’s statement holds significance for several reasons: Investor Clarity: It helps potential participants understand that investing in one project does not mean they are involved in the other. This prevents misallocation of funds based on false assumptions. Market Integrity: By directly addressing and denying Insider Trading Allegations , it reinforces the need for ethical conduct and transparency in the crypto space. Allegations of insider trading can severely damage confidence in a project and the broader market. Project Reputation: For the WLFI DeFi Project , maintaining a clear distance from the volatile and often unpredictable world of memecoins can be crucial for establishing credibility as a serious financial technology endeavor. Avoiding Confusion: The association of a political name with multiple distinct crypto assets can be confusing. Clear communication helps differentiate them. For anyone navigating the Crypto Market , especially around politically adjacent tokens or projects, exercising caution and conducting thorough research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) is always advisable. Do not rely solely on name association. What Does This Mean for Investors and Enthusiasts? Ogle’s clarification serves as a reminder of the importance of verifying information in the fast-paced crypto world. For those interested in the WLFI DeFi Project , it signals that its development is separate from the speculative movements of the TRUMP memecoin . For holders or traders of the TRUMP memecoin , it confirms that its performance is not tied to the progress or challenges of the WLFI initiative. The swift denial of Insider Trading Allegations also highlights the sensitivity around market manipulation concerns in crypto. As the market matures, regulators and participants alike are paying closer attention to fair practices. In conclusion, the advisor’s statement effectively separates the two projects, aiming to dispel confusion and address serious allegations head-on. It underscores the need for clear communication and due diligence in the ever-evolving Crypto Market .

On Thursday, the government in Moscow scrapped or postponed measures to curb electricity consumption by Bitcoin miners in places from the Finnish border to beyond Lake Baikal, pointing to an expected decrease in tax and energy revenues as the main reason for the U-turn. Russian authorities take a step back on crypto mining ban Russia’s central government has decided to refrain from introducing restrictions on cryptocurrency mining to more regions, pausing the planned expansion of a ban that has already affected about a dozen subjects of the Federation. The change in course was adopted at a meeting of the government commission on the development of the electric power industry, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak and announced in a post in the cabinet’s Telegram channel on June 5. According to the press release, participants reviewed requests from authorities in several Russian regions seeking authorization to stop mining operations that have been often blamed by local officials for electricity shortages and blackouts. Meeting of the commission on the development of the electric power industry. Source: Russian government The commission declined to ban the activities of crypto miners in the Republic of Khakassia, citing the lack of adequate projections about the deficit of electricity and generation capacity in the region. It also highlighted decreasing tax revenues and profits from distribution. Proposals to curb mining submitted by the heads of the regional governments in the Russian Republic of Karelia, bordering Finland in the northwest, and Penza Oblast, around 600 km southeast of Moscow, were withdrawn during the meeting. Furthermore, the feds decided to postpone for two months the consideration of requests for year-round bans on coin minting in Zabaykalsky Krai, a region in Russia’s Far East also known as Transbaikal, and the neighboring Republic of Buryatia. The Russian government said it’s “taking into account the need to assess lost income in the electric grid complex” and to elaborate a mechanism for redistributing the power freed by the miners “in favor of socially significant consumers in energy-deficient regions.” Russia seeks to relocate miners to energy-rich parts of the country Despite its reluctance to allow the free circulation of Bitcoin and the like in its economy, the Russian Federation has been somewhat lenient in its attitude towards cryptocurrencies lately. For example, at the end of May, the Bank of Russia authorized investments in crypto derivatives . Mining became the first major crypto-related activity to be granted full regulatory recognition after it was legalized last year. Miners can now legally mint digital coins as long as they register with the Federal Tax Service ( FNS ) and pay taxes . But the constant expansion of crypto mining operations, both in industrial-scale Bitcoin farms and in private basements and garages, has caused headaches for authorities in some corners of the country such as Irkutsk Oblast, which attracts miners with low electricity rates. The Russian government is now considering how to entice mining firms to move to regions with surplus energy and idling infrastructure, including by offering them fuel it’s unable to sell to Europe due to Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine. During its meeting, the power industry commission recommended: “The Ministry of Energy and the Federal Antimonopoly Service, together with energy companies, must also work out economic incentives for attracting mining loads to regions with surplus in terms of electricity and capacity.” Nearly a dozen Russian regions have been placed under a permanent mining ban until mid-March 2031 after some of them initially introduced only seasonal restrictions during periods of peak electricity consumption in cold winter months. The affected areas include southern Irkutsk, the Russian republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, and Chechnya as well as the occupied parts of the Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

The raise enables global backers and accredited U.S. investors (this is big, more later) to participate in what the team calls “the next infrastructure layer for DeFi”. As the DeFi sector has grown, so too has the divide between the very blockchains that make up the over $110 billion that’s invested in the space. Innovations unfortunately don’t happen on one chain alone, and with more coming online every year, each solving a different issue in its own unique way, our new crypto frontier full of energy and hope is being segmented into branded silos. These silos aren’t interconnected, they are becoming barriers and hurdles for users and builders alike. The GVNR protocol was built to address this growing issue, not through another wrapped asset standard or custodial bridge, but through a fundamentally different model. The Infrastructure At the beating digital heart of GVNR lies a general message-passing protocol designed to let any user, smart contract, or AI agent control assets across multiple chains. This sounds complex, but in short, their model allows actors (human or AI) to perform tasks like swaps, payments, and governance actions natively, without relying on external bridge infrastructure that can introduce security vulnerabilities. Instead, commands are executed through a permissionless, intent-based system. When we think about making crypto easier for the masses, this is exactly what is needed. We don’t know how secure messages are sent on our phones in milliseconds to our friends around the other side of the world, and this infrastructure starts to push that same envelope forward. The idea of seamless, secure governance of assets without the need for developer-level hoop jumping. To achieve this, GVNR has partnered with several leading infrastructure providers: Lit Protocol provides secure multi-party computation (MPC) technology, ensuring private key material remains hidden, even from node operators. POKT Network and Grove bring decentralised RPC access to over 40 chains, allowing GVNR to read and write data across networks reliably. Bancor Carbon DeFi DEX supports programmable liquidity and MEV resistance, reinforcing GVNR’s focus on sustainable on-chain economics. Ecosystem Ready Unlike many early-stage protocols and projects, GVNR isn’t launching on fantasy whitepapers that promise the world, then delivering undercooked digital garbage. Several core products are already live, and GVNR does appear to be doing everything in their power to show the world exactly what they are about before even seeking out this raise. This build-first approach has led to a first suite of products that is live, not a concept to imagine, but tangible products that are ready and waiting to be used: JUSTSWAP: A bridge-free cross-chain DEX that enables permissionless swaps with slippage protection and predictable execution. JUSTPAY: An embedded payment protocol allowing users to pay with any token on any chain, even when the merchant or recipient requires a different one. GVNR Portfolio: A multi-chain portfolio manager with a sleek UI, letting users view, manage, and track the top 100 assets per chain in one place. Roadmap: The Butler: An AI agent that acts on behalf of the user, executing transactions, monitoring portfolios, and handling cross-chain operations via natural language commands. Roadmap: BTCFI Bitcoin Backed DeFi Loans: An over collateralised DeFi loan platform where loans are based on non-custodial bitcoin. Each of these is designed to plug into the GVNR protocol, with the native $GVNR token at the center. Tokenomics and Utility Much like GVNR's approach to building their token, $GVNR also aims to solve problems and play roles across the protocol. From usage in fee abstraction to governance, it’s the fuel that drives the ecosystem forward, not just something to buy and hodl - it’s critical in the workings of the whole ecosystem. From launch, over 36% of the token’s fixed 20 million supply will be in circulation. For this type of product offering, that percentage is higher than we’ve come to expect recently and a welcome break from the low float high FDV model from 2024. Something that really stood out, and a central piece of the tokenomics model, is “The Furnace,” GVNR’s deflationary engine. This system uses protocol revenue to agnostically buy $GVNR on the open market and burn it, gradually reducing the 20m supply and aligning value with long-term holders. According to the project, this mechanism will scale over time burning from 25% up to 95% of protocol fees. A Regulated Path The sale is structured in three tiers, with early access granted to users who joined GVNR’s whitelist in advance. Unfortunately, the whitelist is now closed, but there are still more options available to latecomers before the token gets released into the wild. While global participants can take part, the use of Reg D enables legally compliant participation from U.S. accredited investors, a significant step forward from previous years. More information on how to participate, including registration and KYC guidance, can be found in GVNR’s official Republic deal page and supporting documentation. Why It Matters In a landscape where many protocols talk about cross-chain coordination, few have shipped working products with security, composability, and decentralisation at their core. GVNR has emerged as a serious contender, not just for its tech, but for its ability to navigate regulation, ship real products, and attract key partners. With DeFi entering its next phase, one shaped by AI, RWAs, and interchain liquidity, GVNR’s approach to unified control and programmable governance could prove essential.

A total of 31,000 BTC options are expiring. The Put/Call ratio of these options is at 0.71, meaning there are fewer put options than call options. The “maximum loss” point for BTC is $105,000, which represents the price range where option investors face the most losses. The total theoretical value of these BTC options expiring is calculated as $3.18 billion. At the same time, 241,000 ETH options are expiring. On the Ethereum side, the Put/Call ratio is 0.63, and the maximum loss point is $2,575. The total value of ETH options is $590 million. GreeksLive made the following assessment of the general situation in the market: “The market has been volatile for most of the week. The sharp decline in Tesla shares last night led to a significant pullback in the cryptocurrency market along with U.S. stocks. This came after the tension between Trump and Elon Musk became public.” Related News: How Many Bitcoins Have Been Lost Forever? Latest Data Revealed, Here's the True Maximum BTC Supply The company also noted that options delivered this week accounted for around 10% of total positions, a recovery from the decline in recent weeks. Block purchases also increased, with trading activity rising across the market. Finally, GreeksLive argued that institutional investors do not expect a sudden rise for major cryptocurrencies in the near term, but instead a more moderate and long-term bullish scenario comes to the fore. *This is not investment advice.

45598058,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70076,1749211660,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says XRP Fractal Showing $25 Minimum. Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-fractal-showing-25-minimum-heres-the-timeline/,"In a bold projection that has reignited excitement across the XRP community, crypto analyst XRP CAPTAIN has identified a striking fractal pattern suggesting that XRP is on track to hit a minimum of $25 by the end of July 2025. The forecast, shared via a recent X post, builds on historical price behavior and technical structures that align with previous major rallies in XRP’s price history. As the market digests the implications of this analysis, it’s becoming clear that momentum and sentiment around XRP are once again on the rise, driven by both technical conviction and growing institutional interest. XRP CAPTAIN’s $25 Fractal Projection According to XRP CAPTAIN, the current structure of XRP’s price movement closely mirrors an earlier fractal that preceded one of its most explosive rallies. The analyst notes that the repeating pattern has already hit several key checkpoints, suggesting the fractal is not just speculative but unfolding in real-time. #XRP Fractal Showing 25$ Minimum Before July End pic.twitter.com/VV7qUxzoea — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) June 5, 2025 If the pattern continues to hold, XRP is expected to surge toward the $25 price level as a minimum target by the end of July 2025—a claim that, while ambitious, has gained significant traction within the community. XRP CAPTAIN’s analysis emphasizes the importance of fractals in forecasting large breakout movements. Fractals in technical analysis refer to recurring geometric price patterns that reflect similar market psychology across timeframes. When these patterns repeat with accuracy, they can offer powerful predictive signals. In this case, XRP CAPTAIN argues that the current setup is a textbook example, echoing the pre-rally consolidation phases observed in previous XRP bull cycles. Reinforcement From Other Analysts XRP CAPTAIN is not alone in forecasting a dramatic upswing in XRP’s valuation. Another influential voice, Remi, recently predicted that XRP could soar between $25 and $75 , as reported by Timestabloid, further validating the optimism shared by XRP CAPTAIN. While Remi’s projection spans a broader range, both analysts converge on the $25 benchmark as a critical inflection point, marking it as a conservative floor rather than a ceiling for what could be a parabolic price move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Remi’s analysis reportedly takes into account the growing convergence between Ripple’s expanding enterprise adoption, regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions, and macroeconomic conditions that are increasingly favorable for digital assets. Together, these forecasts suggest that the $25 level is not just a speculative moonshot but a plausible waypoint in XRP’s broader upward trajectory. Market Conditions and Catalysts Beyond the technical setup, the macro and fundamental environment appears ripe for a significant XRP breakout. Ripple, the fintech firm closely associated with XRP, has been expanding its footprint in cross-border payments. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, is a development is designed to enhance liquidity and drive new utility to the XRP Ledger, strengthening the network’s fundamentals and potentially attracting more institutional capital. Moreover, the legal landscape surrounding XRP has become increasingly favorable. Market confidence in the asset has grown considerably. Ripple’s ongoing efforts to bring regulatory clarity and expand compliance-driven partnerships further support the bullish case.

Why Did Japan Revise Its Payment Services Law? The revision is a direct response to the rising bankruptcy risks among foreign crypto exchanges . When such platforms collapse, the crypto assets held by Japanese investors are often at risk of outflows or loss . In 2024, a major crypto exchange in Japan was hacked, leading to a Bitcoin outflow worth over $305 million . The incident raised serious concerns about the security of customer funds and highlighted the need for stricter regulations . Key Highlights of Japan’s Revised Crypto Law Stronger Investor Protection: The new law mandates that crypto exchanges operating in Japan must hold investor assets domestically , shielding them from foreign exchange bankruptcies. Flexible Business Model: A new intermediary framework will allow smoother collaboration between crypto exchanges and users , even for in-app crypto asset use in games. Trust-Type Stablecoins Update: Issuers can now manage up to 50% of their stablecoin issuance in low-risk assets , creating room for innovation while maintaining safety. Stringent Registration Requirements: All crypto-related entities must now register under the revised PSA , with strict AML and CFT compliance rules in place. What’s Next? The law passed both the Lower House in May and the Upper House on June 6 . It will be enforced within a year . Japan is also introducing a new category for businesses that facilitate interaction between exchanges and users , encouraging innovation in crypto asset services while tightening oversight.

On June 6, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed lifting its ban on cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs), allowing UK retail investors to buy these products on recognized investment exchanges for the first time. The move marks a major step toward regulated crypto exposure for the public. While UK investors still won’t get access to spot Bitcoin ETFs like in the US, ETNs provide a way to trade debt instruments that track digital asset prices, without holding the underlying crypto. Safeguards will still apply. Products must meet the UK’s financial promotion rules, be listed on regulated exchanges, and include clear risk disclosures. Incentives and aggressive promotions will remain restricted. ETNs: What investors need to know ETNs are unsecured debt notes that mirror the price of assets like Bitcoin , but carry issuer risk and don’t grant ownership of the actual crypto. In practice, the experience will feel like trading an ETF, complete with a ticker and intraday liquidity, but without direct title to coins. Retail investors will now be able to buy the same sterling-denominated ETNs that professional investors already trade on the London Stock Exchange , including products from 21Shares, WisdomTree, Invesco, and ByteTree (such as the bitcoin-and-gold BOLD ETN). ByteTree founder Charlie Morris welcomed the move: “ “I am thrilled by the recent announcement that the FCA has lifted the ban on UK retail investors trading in crypto ETFs.” I am thrilled by the recent announcement that the FCA has lifted the ban on UK retail investors trading in crypto ETFs.

Recently, a substantial ENA deposit has sent ripples through the community, involving a prominent Web3 investment firm and a leading global exchange. What Happened? A Major ENA Deposit Uncovered According to data shared by the on-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens on X, a wallet address linked to Mirana Ventures initiated a significant transaction. Approximately 20 minutes before the data was reported, this wallet transferred a staggering 72.17 million ENA tokens to the Binance Exchange . At the time of the transaction, the value of this massive ENA deposit was estimated to be around $21.45 million. Such large movements are routinely tracked by on-chain sleuths, as they can potentially signal upcoming market activity, such as selling pressure or strategic repositioning by major holders. Who is Mirana Ventures and Why Does Their Move Matter? Mirana Ventures is known as the venture arm of Bybit and BitDAO (now Mantle). As a Web3 investment firm, they are active participants in the blockchain ecosystem, backing various projects and holding significant token positions. Their involvement in the crypto space means their actions, particularly large token transfers, are closely watched by investors and traders seeking insights into potential market trends. Firms like Mirana Ventures often acquire tokens through early investment rounds, partnerships, or participation in ecosystem growth. When they move large quantities of tokens to exchanges like Binance, it raises questions about their intentions and could influence market sentiment for the specific asset. Understanding Ethena ENA: The Asset in Motion The token involved in this large transfer is Ethena ENA , the governance and utility token of the Ethena protocol. Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, offering a crypto-native solution for money known as USDe. USDe aims to be a stablecoin that is censorship-resistant, stable, and scalable, backed by delta-hedged Ethereum collateral. The Ethena ENA token plays a role within this ecosystem, primarily for governance decisions related to the protocol’s development and parameters. Holders may also participate in yield-generating opportunities or receive incentives within the Ethena framework. Given its relatively recent launch and unique stablecoin model, Ethena ENA has garnered significant attention, making large transfers like the one from Mirana Ventures particularly noteworthy. The Significance of Binance Exchange in Large Transfers The destination of the ENA deposit is equally important: Binance Exchange . As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance offers unparalleled liquidity for a wide range of digital assets, including ENA. For large holders like Mirana Ventures , transferring tokens to Binance provides several potential advantages: Liquidity: Access to deep order books allows for executing large trades with minimal price impact. Trading Options: Facilitates potential selling, trading pairs, or participation in exchange-specific programs. Custody: For some strategies, holding assets on a major exchange might be preferred for ease of access or integration with trading tools. A large influx of tokens onto an exchange often raises concerns about potential selling pressure, as it increases the supply available for trading. However, it’s crucial to remember that depositing tokens doesn’t automatically mean they will be sold immediately. There could be other strategic reasons. Leveraging On-chain Analytics for Market Insights How do we get this information? This is where On-chain Analytics platforms come into play. Blockchain networks are public ledgers, meaning every transaction is recorded and verifiable. Platforms like Onchain Lens analyze this public data to identify interesting patterns, large transfers, wallet activities of known entities, and other metrics that can provide transparency into market movements. The ability to track large ENA deposit transactions, identify the source (like a wallet linked to Mirana Ventures ), the destination ( Binance Exchange ), and the amount provides invaluable insights that were previously impossible in traditional finance. On-chain Analytics empowers market participants with data to make more informed decisions, though interpreting the *intent* behind a transaction still requires careful consideration and context. Potential Reasons and Market Implications of the ENA Deposit While the exact motivation behind Mirana Ventures’ decision to deposit 72.17 million Ethena ENA into Binance Exchange is not explicitly stated, based on typical market behavior and On-chain Analytics , several possibilities emerge: Potential Reason Possible Implication Taking Profits: Selling a portion of their holdings after price appreciation. Increased selling pressure on ENA, potentially leading to a price decrease in the short term. Strategic Trading: Preparing to engage in active trading, market making, or arbitrage. Could increase liquidity and trading volume on Binance; less direct selling pressure if offset by buying strategies. Distribution: Preparing tokens for distribution events (e.g., unlocks, transfers to other parties). Depends on the nature of the distribution; could precede sales or transfers to partners/users. Risk Management: Adjusting portfolio exposure based on market outlook or internal strategy. Reflects Mirana’s view on ENA’s current valuation or future prospects; signals potential change in their long-term holding strategy. The primary concern for many market observers following a large ENA deposit like this is the potential for increased selling pressure. A deposit of $21.45 million worth of ENA is substantial and could absorb significant buying volume if liquidated. However, it’s equally possible that these tokens are intended for market-making activities or other strategic purposes that don’t involve immediate, large-scale selling. What Can Investors and Traders Learn from This? This event highlights the importance of monitoring On-chain Analytics for insights into large holder activity. While not a definitive buy or sell signal, a large ENA deposit to an exchange by a known entity like Mirana Ventures serves as a prompt for market participants to: Monitor ENA Price Action: Watch how the price of ENA reacts on Binance Exchange and other platforms in the hours and days following the deposit. Observe Trading Volume: Look for increased trading volume accompanying any price movements. Consider Market Context: Evaluate the deposit within the broader market conditions and recent news surrounding Ethena. Avoid Panic: Recognize that deposits are just one piece of the puzzle; analyze other factors before making trading decisions. This transparency offered by On-chain Analytics is a key benefit of public blockchains, allowing a level of insight into large financial flows that is unprecedented in traditional markets. Understanding how to interpret this data is an actionable insight for anyone serious about navigating the crypto landscape. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on ENA’s Path The deposit of 72.17 million Ethena ENA tokens, valued at $21.45 million, by Mirana Ventures into Binance Exchange is a significant event tracked through On-chain Analytics . While the precise intentions behind this massive ENA deposit remain unconfirmed, it signals potential activity from a major holder. Whether this leads to increased selling pressure, strategic trading, or other maneuvers will unfold on the exchange. This event underscores the value of following On-chain Analytics to gain early insights into the movements of influential market participants. As the market processes this large transfer, monitoring ENA’s performance on Binance Exchange will be crucial for understanding the short-term impact.

Pepe (PEPE) is currently trading between $0.000010139 and $0.00001429. Over the past week, its price has decreased by approximately 13.6%. However, over the past month, the coin has seen a gain of nearly 35%. In the last six months, the price has dropped by about 42%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 53.56. This suggests that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The RSI indicates a neutral position, but there may be slight upward momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000167816. If the price breaks above this point, it could rise further. The nearest support is at $0.0000084736. If the price falls below this support, it may decline more. Given the recent monthly increase of about 35%, there is potential for growth. If the coin rises to the resistance level, it would represent an increase of around 18% from the current upper price. If it falls to the support level, it would be a decrease of about 40% from the current lower price. Based on these figures, the coin may experience volatility but also offers potential for gains. Conclusion While PEPE and other meme coins have captured attention, their short-term potential appears limited. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a powerful new player, leveraging true artificial intelligence for maximum profits.

Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, revealed a special Bitcoin equity financing plan with a total scale of $5.4 billion to be achieved through the issuance of 555 million mobile exercise warrants. Metaplanet’s previous equity financing plan, dubbed the 210 Million Plan, raised 93.3 billion yen ($650 million) in just 60 trading days, achieving a BTC yield of 189% and a stock price jump of more than three times. The recent plan to issue 555 million moving strike warrants is the biggest acquisition in the Japanese stock market. Metaplanet currently ranks first in Asia and eighth worldwide in Bitcoin holdings of 8,888, valued at $919,657,358. Metaplanet relies on a balanced financing plan to fuel growth Metaplanet has relied on a balanced financing plan between stock and debt issuance since the beginning of the year. The company issued 21 million shares in five installments under a strategy called a 210 Million Plan. It acquired 12.8 million shares in the 14th and 17th series, contributing to more than 35 billion yen, about 42% of the planned stock issuance. The company has already completed early repayment of several installments, including the 9th series due in September, using the proceeds of stock issuance to pay the full 2 billion yen in bond value. Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin — again! 🚀 This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our Bitcoin strategy. Our new target: 210,000 BTC by 2027. Details here: https://t.co/ahL27o9QBg pic.twitter.com/njYybVq1uu — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 6, 2025 The “Japanese MicroStrategy” stock price went up by 21% on Tuesday to an all-time high of 1,423 JPY following the company’s recent purchase of 1,088 BTC. The company stock has risen by 255% since the beginning of the year, attracting more investors. Since last month, the company’s stock has increased 181%, outperforming major Japanese companies. Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, has publicly shown on-chain verification of the company’s assets, building confidence among investors by providing proof of reserve for its Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy , criticized proof of reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, saying it poses a security risk. Strategy bought 705 BTC for $75 million, but the stock increased by only 1 % on Monday. Analysts believe Metaplanet’s transparency has given them a competitive advantage by attracting investor confidence. Metaplanet targets 210,000 BTC accumulation in 2 years The 555 Million Plan, as described by Metaplanet, followed the 210 Million Plan, which targets 30,000 BTC holdings from the previous 10,000 BTC in 2025. The company plans to hold 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and increase it to 210,000 BTC in 2027 to become a major player in the Bitcoin game. Metaplanet’s decision could trigger the Bitcoin market to surge as more institutional investors move to BTC to save their assets against inflation and potential growth in value. Bitcoin is trading at $103,794.60 today, up 2.15% after the announcement. 144 companies have adopted a Bitcoin treasury, with 114 of them being publicly traded companies. Gerry O’Shea, Head of Global Markets at Hashdex, revealed that Trump Media, GameStop, K33, and Paris Saint-Germain have recently adopted the Bitcoin Strategy to advance their Bitcoin treasuries. Strategy remains the biggest holder, accumulating 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. The Japanese company revealed it achieved a BTC yield of 225.4% from the beginning of this year, signaling a high shareholder value. BTC yield assesses the effectiveness of the Bitcoin acquisition strategy in driving shareholder value. The company revealed that they share the Strategy belief that Bitcoin-backed securities form the link between the old financial world and the new. It added that the issuance of perpetual duration securities backed by Bitcoin in the U.S. marks a critical point in the global shift of capital markets. According to the company, Bitcoin is dematerializing $300 trillion of 20th-century analog store of value assets.

In April and May of 2025 alone, it pulled in a hefty $14M. Given its high demand, Kling’s on track to hitting a whopping $100M in sales by February. This is proof that demand for AI-generated video content is exploding – a boon for AI crypto projects like SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) . Kling Makes Pro-Quality AI Video Creation Affordable Since its June 2024 launch, Kling AI has rolled out over 20 updates . The changes were aimed at enhancing core model performance, refining image clarity, and introducing innovative features for video creators. By using the AI tool’s ‘inspiration credits,’ anyone, from solo creators to major brands, can tap into Kling’s powerful video creation capabilities. The model is extremely straightforward: Want sharper, high definition videos? Spend more credits. Want to save on budget? Lower the tool’s parameters. It’s super cost-effective, too. For just one dollar, you get 66 credits. Top-quality videos cost approximately 100 credits, whereas simpler versions cost just 20. By using Kling AI, creators now enjoy the freedom to scale their content based on budget, quality, and turnaround times. Tencent Holdings & Alibaba Capitalize on AI Video Hype The AI video space is heating up with growing competition. Hunyuan Video, launched by Tencent Holdings in December 2024, delivers high-quality cinematic video generation with advanced features. These features include dynamic camera movement, lifelike reflections, and seamless transitions between realistic and animated picture styles. Alibaba is also in on the trend, having released Wan 2.1 in February 2025 – a proprietary suite of open-source AI models. The models are designed for high-quality video generation based on text and image inputs. It’s also gearing up for a major upgrade, Wan 2.1-VACE, which will expand its functionality with advanced tools for reference-to-video generation and video-to-video editing. Let’s not forget OpenAI. The company is now developing Sora, a new tool for automated video generation. And then there’s Runway AI’s $3B valuation . Each of these developments signals a promising future for the SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , which goes a step further. This new crypto project delivers a full-suite of AI powered tools – not just video creation, but also online content management. SUBBD Leverages AI & Crypto to Reshape Creator Workflows $SUBBD powers a next-gen content creation platform that streamlines creators’ workflows and boosts community engagement through AI and Web3 technology. The digital content creation industry is booming, predicted to grow at a CAGR of 9.59% and reach $39.3B by 2032. Yet, despite the growth, creators still face serious challenges: High management and platform fees; Strict content policies on major platforms; Fragmented AI tools requiring multiple subscriptions; Outdated or slow payment systems. Thankfully, this is where the SUBBD ecosystem comes in, offering a seamless experience for AI-assisted content creation, editing, and monetization. The project achieves this through various AI tools, including a video generator, custom voice creator, and automatic live-streams. Meanwhile, fans get direct access to their favorite creators, and can enjoy personalized ecosystem fees and exclusive content – without having to rely on intermediaries. Influencers also benefit significantly thanks to a personal AI assistant. This tool is programmed to manage interactions and content schedules. Beyond content and engagement optimization, the personal assistant is an all-in-one tool that also boosts earnings by slashing third-party fees. Buying $SUBBD also ensures subscription discounts, staking rewards at a 20% APY, and XP multipliers for the platform’s raffles, games, and events. SUBBD to Soar as AI Video Craze Blows Up Kuaishou’s Kling AI is on track to reach $100M in sales. This, coupled with the success of similar providers, like Hunyuan Video, Wan 2.1, Sora, and Runway, demonstrates just how quickly AI-driven video content is scaling. As demand for streamlined, AI-powered content creation continues to rise, SUBBD stands out with its crypto-AI platform that unlocks additional monetization opportunities for creators (including automated live streams and token rewards). To get involved, all you need to do is buy $SUBBD on presale for as little as $0.0556. The presale has raised over $600M so far, and the price is going to increase again in two days. High-earning creators moving to the platform could further push the coin to $0.438 this year – a 687% gain, based on the current price.

While Dogecoin experiences a dip, an AI-driven meme coin stirs excitement with its potential for unprecedented growth. Unveiling the innovative Codename:Pepe crypto, which leverages true artificial intelligence to generate impressive profits, the scene is set for its rise amidst the chaotic world of meme coins. This emerging project seeks to dethrone fake AI agents, setting itself apart with tangible benefits. Codename:Pepe crypto draws inspiration from the famed PEPE coin, aiming for massive upward movement. Community support and strategic planning are key to its success. As the mission begins, early engagement could mean significant rewards for those joining this intriguing venture. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, two of the most prominent trends today. Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use ""AI"" as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility, while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform. According to its developers, the project’s AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum. Provide Actionable Trading Insights: Generates AI-backed forecasts, risk assessments, and early buy/sell signals to maximize trading efficiency. Optimize Auto-Trading Strategies: Uses real-time data to adjust automated trading strategies, ensuring adaptability in fast-moving market conditions. The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market.

The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Will Dogecoin Surge or Slide? Price Hangs in the Balance Dogecoin's price is on everyone's mind as it fluctuates between $0.18 and $0.22. A monthly rise of 14.81% hints at recovery, but a weekly drop of 13.00% raises concerns. Will Dogecoin surge ahead or continue to slide? The next hurdle is the resistance at $0.25. Breaking this barrier could propel the coin higher. On the downside, support lies at $0.1567. If the price dips below this, further declines may follow. With an RSI of 53.34, the market sentiment is neutral. Dogecoin has lost 54.17% over the past six months, highlighting a significant downtrend. Despite this, recent gains suggest potential for a rebound. Overcoming the $0.25 resistance could mark the start of a new upward trend. The data shows Dogecoin's future is uncertain. A breakout above resistance might lead to gains exceeding 10%. Conversely, dropping below support could result in more losses. The neutral RSI signals that the market could move in either direction.

Whale James Wynn had long positions worth $16.14 million liquidated, closing all running positions. Despite the downturn, on June 6th, Bitcoin showed a 3% rise, as trade talks between the U.S. and China are set to resume. The crypto market crash gained steam overnight as its top crypto, “Bitcoin price,” fell 5.2% to a low of $100,345. This fall was seen due to the liquidation of leveraged trades, geopolitics, and the Elon Musk-Donald Trump feud. Keep reading, as this article will shed light on the main reasons for the overnight crash and whether the bull run in BTC is over or not. Aggregated Reasons For Yesterday’s Bitcoin Price Decline The primary reason for the decline was Trump signing a new executive order, which has fueled volatility in major financial instruments, and that has affected BTC’s sentiment too. His EO this time has throwed lightning on steel and aluminium tariffs, which have jumped by 50%, to promote American in-house factories’ production to scale up. Similarly, arguments with China have once again started to heat up, and no resolution has been worked out between China and the US yet. As a result of these global pessimistic factors, the crypto market went into bearish mode last night, the growing uncertainty is creating delays in major technological advancements, too. The result of the bearish mode caused liquidations of 215,593 traders in the past 24 hours, and the total liquidations come in at $967.63 million, per Coinglass. It said the largest single liquidation order happened on Bitmex – XBTUSD, valued at $10.00 million. Meanwhile, a popular whale, James Wynn, had long positions worth $16.14 million liquidated. As a result, he had to close all his running long positions, as reported by Lookonchain. Joining the bearish facts, the fallout between Trump and his ex-best buddy, Elon Musk, is also adding bearish pressure on the market. This feud is caused by “big, beautiful bill”, Musk asked that it end EV subsidies and advance debt on the country. This combination of factors is having a strong impact on the crypto market, as Donald Trump and Elon Musk are known among the top crypto advocates for the crypto space, and the feud between them is affecting investors ‘ sentiment. Should We Be Concerned About Bitcoin Price? After the catastrophic last night for top crypto and altcoins, June 6th has shown a 3% rise to $103,976, also the recent 12-hour Rekt shows rising short liquidation compared to longs. This sudden optimism happened as the long-disputed and most argued trade talks between the US and China are set to restart , which has turned yesterday’s bearish situation, and kept the price of BTC above the previous month’s support zone. As per price action, it appears on the daily chart that this daily move took market liquidity by hitting several stop losses, and this could be a trigger point for an upcoming move northwards. Therefore, if things go south and pressure grows, then by June end the price could go as low as $92917. However, if things go north then this time $130K mark is the target for June-end.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 12:24:43

This small but important increase happened while the country dealt with rising tariffs and warnings of slower growth. The total for April was revised lower to 147,000, but May still showed employers haven’t completely hit the brakes yet. The unemployment rate stuck to 4.2%, showing no change from April. And wages saw a bump. Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% in May, bringing the 12-month gain to 3.9%. Both numbers came in slightly above expectations, which were set at 0.3% for the month and 3.7% over the year. Even with a cautious business mood, workers saw their paychecks grow faster than most economists had projected. Health care adds jobs, federal government cuts them Health care added the most jobs last month with a jump of 62,000, way above its average of 44,000 over the past 12 months. Leisure and hospitality brought in 48,000 new positions, while social assistance picked up 16,000. Together, these three industries accounted for most of the hiring in May, while other parts of the economy stayed flat. But the federal government lost 22,000 jobs. This decline was tied directly to job cuts pushed by President Donald Trump and handled by the Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk. The latest data shows the impact of their staffing policies is finally hitting official employment numbers. This drop made the public sector one of the few areas to shrink during May. As the numbers came out, currency markets quickly reacted. The yen dropped 0.35%, moving to 144.12 per dollar. The Swiss franc also edged down to 0.82, while sterling slipped 0.18%, resting at around $1.35 after hitting its strongest level in over three years. Even though the pound dipped, it’s still up 0.6% for the week. Currency moves follow jobs report and global chatter The dollar index nudged up to 98.9 after the report, but it’s still down 0.5% over the week. The euro, which had climbed after the European Central Bank made hawkish comments, slipped back 0.18% to about $1.1423. Expectations around interest rate cuts are changing again. Traders are still eyeing a 25 basis-point cut by the end of the year, though some now believe more cuts could happen. Mark Wall, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said, “It is still too early to judge the impact of the trade war, and the path of the trade war is in any case still inherently unpredictable.” He expects a total of 50 basis points worth of cuts from the ECB. Meanwhile, Germany’s problems are piling up. New data showed that exports and industrial output both dropped more than expected in April. That’s a sign that the EU’s biggest economy is under pressure as global demand weakens and trade talks remain uncertain. By Thursday evening, most currencies had rallied against the dollar. This came right after Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call that lasted over an hour. Their conversation gave traders some hope that progress could be made on trade. But by the time the May jobs data landed Friday, most of those gains had already faded. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Table of Contents Elon Musk vs Trump saga turns ugly Elon Musk Epstein accusation dragged the feud into dangerous territory Why is crypto down right after Musk’s Epstein files remark? Crypto market prepares for uncertainty Elon Musk vs Trump saga turns ugly Tensions between tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump has escalated into a public and increasingly personal dispute with clear political and financial dimensions. Musk, who briefly served in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has emerged as a vocal critic of the president’s signature tax and spending package, the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Shortly after resigning from his role, Musk publicly condemned the proposal on X, calling it “a disgusting abomination ” and accusing Republican lawmakers of fiscal dishonesty. In a direct message aimed at supporters of the bill, he wrote, “You know you did wrong. You know it.” Since then, the dispute has turned chaotic. Statements from both sides have grown more pointed, and the widening rift between Musk and Trump is beginning to shape conversations in financial markets, particularly in crypto, where both figures carry notable influence. What are the facts behind this fallout? How are Trump-linked crypto assets reacting? And what can this political rift mean for the digital asset space going forward? Let’s find out. Elon Musk Epstein accusation dragged the feud into dangerous territory On June 5, Musk reignited his criticism of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” by resurfacing an old 2012 tweet from Trump’s now-defunct Twitter account. In the post, Trump had warned about rising U.S. deficits, a stance Musk used to highlight what he sees as a contradiction with the bill’s current spending-heavy approach. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1930652448726925524 Trump responded hours later during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. When asked by reporters, the president defended the bill and accused Musk of changing his stance only after leaving the administration. Trump claimed Musk had been deeply involved in the legislation and voiced no objections while serving in government. “He knew every aspect of this bill, better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left,” Trump said. “He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn’t said bad things about me personally, but I’m sure that’ll be next. But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.” The president continued, framing Musk’s criticism as part of a recurring pattern. “People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile,” he said. “I don’t know what it is. It’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it… They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour’s gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile.” Musk rejected the claims immediately. “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night,” he wrote on X, distancing himself from the bill’s development. False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 He followed with a sharply worded post: “Without me, Republicans would’ve lost,” shifting the tone from policy disagreement to personal conflict. Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Trump responded with two posts on Truth Social. In the first, he wrote , “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” In the second, he added , “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Musk replied by calling the claims “such an obvious lie” and then escalated the exchange. After some time, Musk accused Trump of appearing in sealed Epstein-related documents and implied that this connection was behind the documents’ delay in public release. Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 He followed by reposting a 1990s video clip showing Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at a social event, signaling a shift in the feud toward more personal and damaging allegations. Trump did not directly respond to the Epstein accusation. Instead, he returned focus to the legislation later in the day. “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever… If this Bill doesn’t pass… 68% Tax Increase… I didn’t create this mess, I’m here to FIX IT,” he wrote on Truth Social. The White House issued a short statement through the press secretary, calling Musk’s remarks “unfortunate” and reaffirming the president’s commitment to passing the bill. Musk continued to press the issue. He announced on X that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately, citing the administration’s threats to cancel government contracts. In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 As the conflict deepened, investor Bill Ackman stepped in with a public appeal. “We need you both on the same side,” he wrote, urging cooperation for the country’s benefit. Musk acknowledged the message. “You’re not wrong,” he replied. I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart. — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) June 5, 2025 When another user suggested both sides cool down, Musk responded, “Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon,” pulling back from his earlier statement and signaling a temporary pause in the escalation. Why is crypto down right after Musk’s Epstein files remark? The fallout between Elon Musk and President Trump, intensified by threats of canceled contracts and escalating political retaliation, created immediate uncertainty across financial markets. Investors responded quickly as the tone of the conflict sharpened. The most pronounced impact was seen in the tech sector. Tesla shares fell more than 15% in a single trading session, marking the company’s steepest decline since 2020. The drop reflected growing concern that Musk’s worsening ties with the administration could jeopardize federal support tied to electric vehicle infrastructure, tax credits, or regulatory treatment. That caution spread to crypto markets. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which had been trading above $105,000 on June 5, briefly fell below $101,000 amid the height of the news cycle. As of June 6, BTC had recovered slightly, trading around $103,800. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum ( ETH ) has dropped by approximately 7%, while Solana ( SOL ) declined by 3%. Ripple ( XRP ) and Binance Coin ( BNB ) posted losses ranging between 2.5% and 3%. However, tokens associated with Trump experienced sharper volatility. The Official Trump ( TRUMP ) token, launched in January as part of the former president’s direct engagement with the crypto space, lost nearly 10% in 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading around $9.80 and ranked among the three worst-performing tokens of the day. Meanwhile, Trump’s family office moved to distance itself from a separate crypto initiative using the Trump name. WLFI’s legal team issued a cease-and-desist letter to a group that had launched a “Trump” wallet on Magic Eden. The wallet, tied to an entity called “Fight Fight Fight,” was accused of unauthorized brand use. Eric Trump posted a public statement clarifying that the family had no affiliation with the wallet project and suggested that their official crypto wallet remained under development. Trump’s presence in the crypto space has been unusually direct for a sitting president. In January, the TRUMP token reached a $9 billion market cap within hours of its launch, temporarily surpassing several meme coins including PEPE. That rally was short-lived. The token has since dropped around 85% from its peak. A similar trajectory followed Melania Trump’s token, Official Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), which saw strong early demand before declining by 96% following a wave of profit-taking and reduced trading activity. Crypto market prepares for uncertainty If the conflict between Musk and Trump continues to escalate, it may start to test real economic boundaries. Both men operate at the intersection of influence and power, one through the U.S. government, the other through high-impact private companies. Any prolonged conflict between them would likely have serious consequences for the economy, public policy, and investor confidence. Trump has already hinted at the possibility of ending federal subsidies and contracts connected to Musk’s businesses. If that materializes, the fallout could be substantial. SpaceX is a central player in the U.S. space strategy, working with both NASA and the Pentagon. Pulling back contracts from SpaceX could slow satellite deployments and delay critical space missions. Similarly, if Tesla’s access to electric vehicle tax credits is revoked, the impact could ripple through clean energy adoption and the broader automotive market. The market reaction to such moves would not be isolated. Tesla is deeply embedded in major equity indices and often moves in sync with broader tech sentiment. Any sharp decline in Tesla’s valuation could weigh heavily on technology stocks, potentially dragging down indexes and exchange-traded funds that have large Tesla exposure. That kind of shift tends to spill into crypto markets as well. Over the past several years, Bitcoin and other digital assets have shown high correlation with tech stocks. When tech leads a sell-off, crypto often follows. There is also the Trump-specific angle. Since early 2025, the president has openly embraced crypto. He has described himself as the “crypto president” and floated ideas such as a national Bitcoin reserve and friendlier regulatory policies. Trump’s stance has helped shape retail enthusiasm and provided a layer of political legitimacy to the crypto sector. If political volatility leads to uncertainty around Trump’s policy consistency or long-term position, the market could respond with a fresh wave of risk aversion or sell-offs. For now, the worst-case scenarios remain hypothetical, but the signals are worth watching. If the conflict continues to escalate, the financial system may be forced to absorb not just economic shocks, but the consequences of two powerful players locked in a very public and personal standoff.",Feature|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|United States,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-06 13:27:18

Liquid collectives may hold the key to an exponential rise. Discover which digital assets are poised for significant growth and why they could reshape market dynamics. Dive into the analysis and uncover future opportunities. Ethereum Price Analyse Source: tradingview Ethereum’s price is bouncing between $2410 and $2729.90. It faces tough resistance at $2920, making it hard for bulls to push higher. The last month's change of over 36% hints at potential, but recent weeks show a dip of around 5%, indicating struggles. Bears might have a slight edge now as the RSI stands below 50, signaling weak buying interest. A break above $2920 could see Ethereum eyeing the next level at $3240.06. The current momentum suggests it's a challenge, but if it happens, that’s about a 20% rise from the lower end of the current range. Considering Ethereum’s staking trend and the broader market sentiment, Ethereum has strong potential to break the key $2920 resistance by year-end. Should bullish momentum strengthen with increased participation from liquid collectives, Ethereum could target a higher range of around $3500 to $4000, marking substantial gains for investors watching the trend closely. Investors should watch closely as trends shift quickly in the crypto space. Conclusion The continued uptrend in Ethereum staking, driven by growing interest in liquid collectives, presents a compelling case for potential price increases. Despite recent bearish pressures and market volatility, Ethereum remains positioned for a possible breakthrough above key resistance levels, which could lead to a significant upward move by year-end. Investors should keep an eye on market dynamics and liquid staking innovations, as these factors could drive Ethereum toward a parabolic price rise, reshaping the crypto market as we approach the close of the year.

CRCL jumped 170% on its first trading day and climbed another 16% in the pre-market session. This surge pushed its market capitalization above $20 billion, roughly a third of USD Coin’s ( USDC ) market cap. The rally was fueled by strong retail and institutional demand for shares in the second-largest stablecoin issuer. Notably, BlackRock acquired a 10% stake in the company, while Ark Invest invested $150 million. Investors and analysts believe stablecoins will be the next big thing in finance. In a recent study, Citi estimated that the industry will be worth over $1.6 trillion by 2030, up from the current $250 billion. Circle will be a major player in the sector because of its scale today. Unlike Tether, Circle has ensured that it complies with some major laws. For example, it complies with Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA, regulations, while Tether does not. Tether is likely not compliant with the United States’ GENIUS Act . Circle is also developing additional infrastructure. For example, it is working to disrupt Swift, the messaging solution that powers over $150 trillion a year. It is doing this through the Circle Payments Network, which links financial institutions and helps them process funds within seconds.

USYC is a tokenized money market fund with over $378 million in assets. Investors also favor Circle for its asset-light and high-margin business model. Its strategy involves taking customer deposits and investing them in liquid assets like Treasuries. In its case, over 90% of its funds are in the Circle Reserve Fund, which BlackRock manages. Is Circle stock a good buy today? Circle is a strong company in a growing industry, and its stock will likely rise in the long term. However, it also faces some short-term risks. The biggest risk is that the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates this year, driving down its returns. Further, the stablecoin industry is becoming highly competitive. In addition to Tether, companies like Ripple and PayPal have launched their stablecoins. Big U.S. banks are considering launching their coins, while Santander is in an advanced stage of doing the same. The short-term risk is that Circle stock may dive in the next few days as the post-listing hype fades. For example, Webull stock recently jumped from $25 to $80 shortly after its IPO and has now crashed to $10. Webull stock surged after IPO and then crashed | Source: TradingView Similarly, CoreWeave stock initially soared from $35 to $64 and then dropped to $34 shortly after the IPO. It has since recovered to $135. Therefore, it is likely that Circle stock will pull back as the hype fades and then it can restart a more sustained and reasonable uptrend.

45600842,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25363,1749216515,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,AMA con AETHIR – Organizado por Bitfinex & BitFreedomGus,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/ama-con-aethir-organizado-por-bitfinex-bitfreedomgus/,"Aethir está liderando el camino en infraestructura física descentralizada (DePIN), transformando la forma en que el mundo accede al poder de cómputo con GPU. A medida que la demanda por infraestructura de alto rendimiento sigue aumentando —especialmente en IA y videojuegos— la misión de Aethir es hacer que la computación en la nube sea más democrática, accesible y sin fronteras. El 23 de mayo de 2025, Bitfinex organizó una sesión de Pregúntame lo que sea (AMA) con Mark Rydon, Co-Fundador y CSO de Aethir, acompañado por nuestro anfitrión BitFreedomGus. La conversación abordó la infraestructura física descentralizada (DePIN), el futuro de la computación en la nube con GPU, las soluciones de Aethir para IA y videojuegos, y su reciente listado de tokens en Bitfinex. Fue una charla interesante y enriquecedora—puedes leer la transcripción completa a continuación. Sesión 1: Introducción y Visión Bitfinex: Hola a todos, ¡bienvenidos! Es un gusto tenerlos en otra sesión AMA. Soy su anfitrión, BitFreedomGus, y hoy estamos conversando con el Sr. Mark Rydon, Co-Fundador y CSO de Aethir. Aethir está creando una nueva forma de acceder al poder de cómputo para inteligencia artificial y videojuegos, usando una red descentralizada. ¡Sr. Mark Rydon, gracias por estar con nosotros! Mark Rydon (Aether): ¡Gracias por invitarme! Bitfinex: ¡Gracias, Mark! Para comenzar, ¿puedes contarnos un poco sobre ti y tu trabajo en Aethir? Mark Rydon (Aether): ¡Claro! Soy el Co-Fundador y Director de Estrategia en Aethir: una red descentralizada de computación en la nube fundada en 2022 para hacer que las GPUs de alto rendimiento sean más accesibles, asequibles y escalables para desarrolladores en IA, LLMs y juegos en la nube. Empecé mi carrera en infraestructura, pero siempre estuve enfocado en blockchain y los crecientes desafíos de acceso al cómputo para empresas tecnológicas. Desde que fundamos Aethir con mi socio Daniel Wang, pasamos de ser una startup de cinco personas a una organización global con más de 150 empleados y una de las redes descentralizadas más grandes del mundo, respaldada por NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Animoca Brands y muchos más. Bitfinex: Un crecimiento increíble en la empresa. Aethir surgió por la gran demanda de GPUs para IA y videojuegos. ¿Cuál fue la idea principal o el problema que querían resolver? Mark Rydon (Aether): Buena pregunta. La industria global de computación en la nube con GPU está muy centralizada. Los recursos de cómputo están concentrados en centros de datos regionales controlados por grandes proveedores de nube, que cobran tarifas altas y muchas veces ofrecen servicios ineficientes y con alta latencia. Los proveedores centralizados tienen tasas bajas de uso de GPU, a menudo por debajo del 30%, lo que lleva a altos costos de mantenimiento y, en consecuencia, precios más altos para los clientes. La misión de Aethir es ofrecer una alternativa descentralizada para empresas de IA y videojuegos a gran escala. Queremos acercar el cómputo a los clientes distribuyendo las GPUs por todo el mundo. Nuestros contenedores de GPU están descentralizados en 95 países, lo que nos permite ofrecer servicios de computación en la nube con baja latencia, seguros, escalables y a precios accesibles, sin importar la ubicación. Nuestro objetivo a largo plazo es una computación en la nube universal: un futuro donde el acceso a computación de alta calidad esté disponible para todos, no solo para grandes corporaciones. ¡No queremos que las GPUs estén solo para las cinco grandes empresas! Queremos que todos puedan tener acceso. Bitfinex: Super bien. Las pequeñas empresas o desarrolladores independientes también pueden beneficiarse, sin duda. ¿Cuál es el principal objetivo de Aethir hoy? ¿Y cómo ves que el proyecto ayudará a la comunidad Web3 en el futuro? Mark Rydon (Aether): ¡Gran pregunta! Aethir ha creado la única plataforma descentralizada de nivel empresarial de GPU como servicio en el mercado. Ya tenemos un ecosistema con más de 120 socios y clientes en los sectores de IA, videojuegos y Web3, que usan nuestra red de GPU para desarrollar y lanzar innovaciones de vanguardia en sus áreas. Nuestro objetivo es seguir expandiendo la red hasta que la computación en la nube descentralizada esté disponible universalmente para todo tipo de empresas, desde startups hasta grandes corporaciones. Estamos muy comprometidos con apoyar al ecosistema emergente de startups Web3 enfocadas en IA. Por eso lanzamos AI Unbundled , una alianza en toda la industria con líderes del sector, dedicada a ayudar a los desarrolladores más innovadores con la infraestructura necesaria para crear tecnologías que cambien vidas. Sesión 2: Tecnología e Infraestructura Bitfinex: Aethir usa un modelo llamado DePIN para ofrecer GPUs, en términos simples, ¿cómo ayuda esto a que el acceso a GPUs potentes sea más fácil y barato para todos, en comparación con los servicios tradicionales en la nube? Mark Rydon (Aether): DePIN = Red de Infraestructura Física Descentralizada DePIN significa redes descentralizadas de infraestructura física, lo que representa un enfoque distribuido en lugar de la arquitectura tradicional y centralizada de los grandes proveedores de infraestructura tecnológica. La infraestructura descentralizada permite que Aethir reúna el poder de cómputo de GPU de diferentes fuentes y dirija el procesamiento a nuestros clientes desde las GPUs más cercanas físicamente disponibles en la red. De esta forma, garantizamos la menor latencia posible para los clientes y maximizamos el uso de las GPUs. Al maximizar el uso, reducimos los costos operativos y podemos ofrecer precios insuperables. Como obtenemos GPUs de una gran red descentralizada de proveedores de computación en la nube (Cloud Hosts), no necesitamos mantener enormes y costosos centros de datos, y nuestra infraestructura es más escalable. Podemos asignar rápidamente más GPUs a nuestros clientes sin bloqueos en la cadena de suministro, porque simplemente usamos más recursos de nuestra red de Cloud Hosts. Bitfinex: ¿Entonces el poder de cómputo proviene de varias GPUs que están separadas geográficamente y más cerca del cliente? ¿Es correcto? Mark Rydon (Aether): ¡Sí! En muchos casos, esa es justamente la ventaja que ofrecemos. En otros casos, la ventaja puede ser el costo, si el cliente no tiene una exigencia específica sobre la ubicación de las GPUs. Tenemos soluciones para cualquiera que busque GPUs de nivel empresarial para IA o videojuegos. Bitfinex: Sabemos que Aethir tiene soluciones para IA (Earth) y para videojuegos (Atmosphere). ¿Puedes explicar brevemente qué hace cada una y cómo ayudan a desarrolladores y jugadores? Mark Rydon (Aether): Buena pregunta — esto muestra todo lo que ofrecemos en videojuegos e inteligencia artificial. Primero hablemos de IA: Aethir Earth está enfocado en apoyar a empresas de inteligencia artificial de todos los tamaños. Ofrece una amplia gama de GPUs de alto rendimiento diseñadas para tareas avanzadas de IA como inferencia, entrenamiento de modelos de lenguaje grandes, IA generativa y entrenamiento de agentes de IA. El servicio usa nuestra red global de GPUs premium para IA, incluyendo modelos como NVIDIA H100, H200, y más recientemente, GB200, además de otras GPUs avanzadas. Aethir Earth se adapta completamente a las necesidades de cada cliente. Tratamos de conocer bien a cada uno para ofrecer el mejor servicio posible en sus proyectos. Aethir Earth ofrece la infraestructura de GPU que necesitan todos los tipos de innovaciones en IA que buscan cómputo escalable, confiable y a precios accesibles. Ahora sobre videojuegos: Aethir Atmosphere , por otro lado, es nuestro servicio de GPU pensado para empresas del sector gaming. Ofrece computación en la nube de alto nivel para proyectos que necesitan mucha potencia gráfica, tanto en juegos Web2 como Web3. Permite que cualquier jugador juegue cualquier juego en cualquier dispositivo. Aethir Atmosphere puede apoyar plataformas de juegos en la nube y estudios que quieren nuevas formas de distribuir sus juegos directamente a los jugadores. Con Atmosphere, ofrecemos soluciones de juego por streaming (Instant Play), ideales para estudios y publishers que buscan formas innovadoras de adquirir y retener usuarios. Gracias a esta mecánica de Instant Play, los desarrolladores pueden evitar las tiendas de apps tradicionales y llegar directamente a los jugadores en la web, sin pagar comisiones a las grandes plataformas. Sesión 3: Token, Ecosistema y Soporte al Desarrollador Bitfinex: Hablemos más sobre el $ATH. El token $ATH es importante para el proyecto. Además de pagar a los proveedores de GPU, ¿cómo ayuda este token a los usuarios y al crecimiento de Aethir? Mark Rydon (Aether): ¿Dijiste All Time High? ¡ATH! En el centro del stack DePIN de Aethir está nuestro token ATH, que tiene un papel clave en las operaciones diarias de nuestra red de GPUs. ATH es el núcleo económico del ecosistema Aethir, conectando todos los elementos de nuestra red y unificándolos en una potente red descentralizada de computación en la nube con GPUs para clientes empresariales. Desde el lanzamiento de ATH durante nuestra salida de mainnet y evento de generación de tokens en junio de 2024, hemos añadido muchas funciones nuevas al token, que lo convierten en mucho más que una simple criptomoneda. Nuestra red de GPUs es monitoreada por más de 91,000 nodos de verificación (Checker Nodes) propiedad de la comunidad. Ellos se encargan de asegurar que nuestros 428,000 contenedores de GPU ofrezcan servicios de alta calidad a todos los clientes en todo momento. Los Checker Nodes reciben recompensas diarias en ATH por su rol en el ecosistema de Aethir. Lo mismo ocurre con quienes hacen staking. Todo el poder de cómputo en el ecosistema de Aethir está respaldado por staking en ATH, lo que significa que quienes hacen staking contribuyen a la estabilidad y funcionamiento diario de la red. Los Cloud Hosts, que son nuestros proveedores de potencia de GPU, también ganan recompensas en ATH por ofrecer computación en la nube descentralizada a nuestros clientes empresariales. Lo mismo pasa con los operadores de Aethir Edge. Todos los participantes en el ecosistema de Aethir se benefician directamente de las diferentes funciones del token ATH. Bitfinex: Muy bien. ¿Cómo planea Aethir atraer a más desarrolladores para crear aplicaciones (dApps) en su red? ¿Qué tipo de apoyo o incentivos ofrecen? Mark Rydon (Aether): Anunciamos nuestro Fondo de Ecosistema de $100 millones hace unos meses — ¡y eso llamó muchísimo la atención de los desarrolladores! Fue aún más popular de lo que yo esperaba, lo cual fue genial de ver. Aethir se especializa en proveer la potencia de GPU que necesitan todo tipo de aplicaciones en redes blockchain. No estamos limitados a una sola red. En cambio, nuestra infraestructura es versátil y puede apoyar a desarrolladores en muchas blockchains diferentes. Nuestro Fondo de Ecosistema de $100 millones fue creado para apoyar a innovadores en IA y videojuegos, ofreciéndoles acceso a nuestra infraestructura DePIN de cómputo en la nube. Estamos muy entusiasmados con los agentes de IA y con la conexión entre activos del mundo real (RWA) e inteligencia artificial. Hasta ahora, ya hemos apoyado a más de 25 proyectos de agentes de IA con subvenciones de cómputo de nuestro fondo, y recientemente anunciamos el Sexto Grupo de proyectos seleccionados, incluyendo propuestas innovadoras de RWA. Aethir está aquí para apoyar desde el primer día a proyectos prometedores con el cómputo de GPU que necesitan. Nuestras subvenciones del fondo demuestran nuestro compromiso con los sectores de IA, videojuegos y Web3, ayudando a los desarrolladores a construir sin limitaciones como la falta de acceso a computación premium con GPU. Sesión 4: Alianzas, Expansión y Planes Futuros Bitfinex: Como exprofesor de educación técnica, puedo decir que hay muchos jóvenes desarrolladores en América Latina buscando conocimientos para crecer en Web3. Estos incentivos ayudan a construir el futuro del ecosistema. ¡Gracias por tu aporte! Hablemos ahora de nuestra colaboración. La inclusión en Bitfinex fue un paso importante. ¿Qué significa esta asociación para el crecimiento de Aethir y para hacer el proyecto más conocido? Mark Rydon (Aether): ¡Gracias! Tienes toda la razón — cuantos más recursos podamos brindar a los desarrolladores en todo el mundo, ¡mejor para todos! La inclusión del token ATH en Bitfinex es muy importante para nosotros, ya que se trata de un exchange global de criptomonedas de gran renombre, lo cual apoya nuestra misión de hacer el token ATH accesible en todo el mundo. Este listado acerca el token ATH a más usuarios, facilitando su acceso global y expandiendo nuestro ecosistema. Queremos que ATH esté disponible en todas partes del mundo, y ser listados en Bitfinex es un GRAN paso en esa dirección. Bitfinex: Increíble. Hablemos del futuro. Pensando en lo que viene, ¿cuáles son las actualizaciones más importantes que la comunidad puede esperar de Aethir? ¿Cómo ayudarán estos planes a que más personas usen la red? Mark Rydon (Aether): Me encanta pensar y hablar del futuro. ¡Acabamos de hacer este gran anuncio! https://aethir.com/blog-posts/aethirs-eigenlayer-ath-vault-is-here-stake-ath-and-mint-eath-to-maximize-rewards Pueden revisarlo después. Pero tenemos MUCHAS cosas planeadas. Se acerca nuestro aniversario del evento de generación de tokens (TGE), el 12 de junio, y estamos preparando actualizaciones y lanzamientos muy emocionantes para celebrarlo. Recientemente anunciamos un bono de staking exclusivo de 10 semanas para los miembros de nuestra comunidad, que les permitirá ganar el triple de recompensas en ATH como parte de la celebración del aniversario del TGE. Aethir siempre busca introducir nuevas funciones de producto que mejoren la experiencia del usuario y fortalezcan nuestro ecosistema DePIN. A través de nuestro Fondo de Ecosistema y la alianza AI Unbundled, estamos incorporando a nuestra red a desarrolladores innovadores en Web3, IA y videojuegos, brindándoles los recursos de cómputo con GPU que necesitan para sus proyectos. En los próximos meses, presentaremos más servicios para el ecosistema y nuevas alianzas, consolidando a Aethir como líder global en infraestructura DePIN con GPU. Bitfinex: ¡Animamos a toda la comunidad a revisar el anuncio! Vimos que Aethir ofrece acceso a tecnología avanzada de NVIDIA (GB200). ¿Qué significa esto para el futuro de Aethir en inteligencia artificial? Mark Rydon (Aether): ¡Muchas gracias! Para que lo sepan — ¡los GB200 son las nuevas GPUs de Nvidia! Súper potentes, y nadie más en Web3 las tiene, ¡solo nosotros! La industria de la IA es altamente competitiva y está evolucionando rápidamente. Cada día se lanzan nuevos proyectos innovadores, y todos necesitan acceso confiable y económico a recursos de cómputo con GPU para escalar. Los trabajos de IA requieren muchísimo poder de cómputo, y solo las GPUs de alto rendimiento pueden manejar eficientemente los casos de uso más avanzados. Por eso en Aethir seguimos incorporando nuevos proveedores de GPU Cloud Hosts, enfocándonos en los chips de IA más potentes de NVIDIA, como los GB200. Pero a diferencia de los proveedores centralizados, nuestra nube descentralizada ofrece estas GPUs de alto rendimiento a precios mucho más bajos, permitiendo que startups de IA y empresas más pequeñas puedan acceder a computación premium a costos accesibles. Creemos que estas poderosas GPUs no deben estar solo al alcance de las empresas más ricas. Para realmente fomentar la innovación en IA, el cómputo debe ser accesible para todo tipo de empresas — y eso es precisamente lo que Aethir está ofreciendo para el futuro del desarrollo en IA. Bitfinex: ¿GPUs exclusivas de Aethir por ahora? ¡Eso es enorme! Mark Rydon (Aether): ¡Siempre tenemos la mejor infraestructura! Bitfinex: Aethir anunció recientemente soporte de cómputo y alianzas con varios proyectos de activos del mundo real (RWA). ¿Podrías contarnos por qué? Mark Rydon (Aether): ¡Nos encantan los RWA! El sector RWA ha crecido mucho en el último año, mostrando cómo la utilidad del mundo real está ganando terreno tanto en Web3 como en el mundo financiero tradicional (TradFi). Proyectos como Plume y GAIB están liderando casos de uso innovadores en RWA, como la tokenización de activos de GPU, y creando nuevas categorías como RWAfi, la intersección entre RWA, DeFi e IA. Algunos analistas estiman que el valor total de activos tokenizados en RWA alcanzará los 500 mil millones de dólares para finales de 2025, y que podría llegar hasta los 30 billones para 2030. Aethir ya ha establecido alianzas con algunos de los proyectos más innovadores en este espacio. Con iniciativas como RWAI junto a Plume, y el piloto de tokenización de GPUs en BNB Chain con GAIB, Aethir está posicionándose a la vanguardia de la innovación en RWA. Estamos ampliando el soporte de nuestro ecosistema —desde agentes de IA hasta el desarrollo de RWA— usando el poder de la computación en la nube descentralizada. Creemos que este sector jugará un papel clave en el futuro del desarrollo de IA. Sesión 5: Participación de la Comunidad y Reflexiones Finales Bitfinex: Por cuestiones de tiempo, incluimos solo una pregunta del público. Recibimos tres en total, pero esta nos pareció especialmente interesante. ¿Te molestaría responderla? Además, si te enviamos las otras preguntas más adelante, ¿podrías responderlas para incluirlas en nuestro blog? Esta pregunta es de @EdsonRMiguel : Soy un entusiasta local de LLM. Con la escasez global de GPU —impulsada primero por el auge de la minería cripto y ahora por la creciente demanda de empresas de IA— ¿cómo crees que Aethir impactará esta situación? ¿Cómo puede la infraestructura descentralizada que están construyendo ayudar a democratizar el acceso al poder computacional y hacer estos recursos más accesibles para quienes desarrollamos soluciones de IA, como yo? Mark Rydon (Aether): Excelente pregunta, Edson — y va directo al corazón de lo que estamos construyendo con Aethir. Estamos viviendo una gran escasez de GPUs, impulsada primero por la minería cripto y ahora acelerada por el crecimiento exponencial de la IA. Los grandes proveedores centralizados se han quedado con la mayor parte del poder computacional, haciendo casi imposible para desarrolladores independientes, startups y entusiastas como tú acceder a recursos confiables y económicos. Ese es el obstáculo clave — y eso es justamente lo que Aethir quiere resolver. Aethir cambia el modelo. No somos dueños de las GPUs — las reunimos desde centros de datos de nivel empresarial en todo el mundo y las unificamos en una red descentralizada de cómputo con GPU. Esto significa que, en lugar de depender de unos pocos jugadores en Silicon Valley o Ashburn, estás utilizando una red global de infraestructura distribuida. Es más rápido, más barato y más accesible que nunca. Bitfinex: Esto demuestra que Aethir puede ser una solución frente a una nueva escasez de GPUs, especialmente con la enorme demanda computacional necesaria para impulsar soluciones de IA. Para terminar, ¿cuál es la visión final de Aethir? ¿Qué marca esperan dejar en el mundo de la computación descentralizada al hacer la tecnología más accesible? Mark Rydon (Aether): Sin duda — ¡las GPUs solo se volverán más importantes para la economía global, no menos! Como mencioné antes, la meta final de Aethir es el cómputo en la nube universal. Es un futuro donde cualquier desarrollador puede acceder a potencia de GPU de alto rendimiento sin barreras de entrada como altos costos, restricciones geopolíticas o problemas en la cadena de suministro. La infraestructura de computación en la nube de Aethir apuesta por la descentralización total, en el verdadero espíritu de Web3, permitiendo que cualquier persona pueda convertirse en Cloud Host dentro de nuestra red DePIN y apoyar la evolución global de la IA. El acceso a cómputo confiable y escalable es cada vez más importante en un mundo impulsado por la IA, donde todas las industrias están empezando a usar soluciones basadas en inteligencia artificial en sus operaciones diarias. Bitfinex: Sr. Mark Rydon, muchas gracias por esta conversación tan clara e interesante sobre Aethir. ¡Fue genial entender mejor su visión y planes!

Among the altcoins, those showing the strongest correlation with Bitcoin, have largely outperformed others, further confirming BTC’s “king” status within the crypto market. Now, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , a new BTC-themed meme coin - with cutting-edge Layer-2 utility - is creating significant speculative frenzy in its presale, having already raised over $500k in short order. Crypto influencers and prominent analysts are already taking note, with many viewing it as the next 100x crypto. Bitcoin Hyper’s Value Proposition – Why This New BTC Layer-2 Is Going Viral? Bitcoin has already established itself as an excellent store of value, as well as one of the top-performing investments in the global financial markets. However, it is still far from realizing one of Satoshi Nakamoto ’s core visions - a viable electronic cash system. Take, for instance, the historic moment when Donald Trump became the first US President to do a Bitcoin transaction in September last year. Trump used the Strike app to settle his tab at the PubKey bar in New York, which works on the Lightning Protocol, the top BTC Layer-2 scaling solution. And yet, the moment was awkward as a few-dollar transaction took 45 seconds to settle. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump tried paying with #Bitcoin at a New York bar, and the transaction still hasn't settled yet due to massive liquidity issues.It took over 45 seconds for them to awkwardly smile and pretend the transaction was settled. Bitcoin is not fast or cost-effective pic.twitter.com/8KDcqdH3uP — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 18, 2024 Thankfully, the US President did not attempt to complete the transaction through Bitcoin’s mainnet. As per Blockchain.com , the average confirmation time for a BTC transaction was ~914 minutes on 18th September, or 15 hours and 14 minutes. Today, on 5th June, the Bitcoin mainnet appears to be working optimally and therefore, has an average confirmation time of 21 minutes. There is an evident demand for additional cutting-edge Layer-2 solutions, which explains why Bitcoin Hyper is seeing a warm reception in the first few days of its presale. As per the project’s whitepaper , “Bitcoin Hyper is designed to break through Bitcoin’s core limitations: slow transactions, high fees, and the lack of programmability.” It’s no surprise that the HYPER presale is attracting strong early demand. If the Bitcoin Hyper project delivers on its mission, it could emerge as the next billion-dollar crypto asset, much like other top-performing Layer-2 coins. Under The Hood: Bitcoin Hyper’s Cutting-Edge Technology Bitcoin Hyper aims to bring the performance and scalability of modern blockchains to the Bitcoin ecosystem, without compromising its decentralized nature or cryptographic security. In this regard, it is integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to its Layer-2 scaling solution, the same core engine which has made Solana one of the most popular blockchains on the market. As per the whitepaper, “By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper enables lightning-fast, low-latency execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications. This brings the performance and developer experience of Solana to the Bitcoin ecosystem—something previously impossible on native Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, like most stable and secure Layer-2s, it uses the Bitcoin mainnet for transaction settlement and security. The developer team is creating a Canonical Bridge - a non-custodial bridge that is tasked to manage Bitcoin Hyper’s interaction with the mainnet. Users lock their BTC via the bridge, receiving equivalent tokens on the Layer 2 network. These tokens can then be utilized across the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem and are redeemable back into native BTC whenever desired. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Relay Program, an SVM smart contract, verifies BTC block headers and transaction proofs. It aggregates and compresses transactions on Layer 2, using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to verify their validity. The Layer 2 state is regularly published to Bitcoin’s main chain, ensuring both security and alignment with Layer 1. Thanks to this hybrid approach, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast wrapped BTC payments, DeFi functionalities (swaps, lending, staking), NFT and gaming dApps, and supports Rust-based smart contracts via SDK and API. It also offers web and mobile access through an intuitive dashboard and wallet integrations. Is HYPER The Next 100x Crypto? There is a strong demand for BTC-correlated altcoins, as these tend to outperform others during a bull run. Considering that HYPER is new and has a small market cap, it could deliver outsized returns following its launch. Unsurprisingly, analysts and crypto influencers like Yellow Trader are beginning to take notice and are viewing it as one of the best new products on the market. Others are calling it the next 100x crypto as well. Besides the project’s Layer-2 scaling solution, HYPER has excellent fundamentals, which include community-centric tokenomics, transparent smart contract audits , and full issuer address and contact information. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper whitepaper for more information. Meanwhile, early HYPER buyers can also earn passive income through the project’s staking protocol, which is currently offering a reward rate of over 1300% per annum. However, the staking rewards are designed to decrease as more tokens are staked into the pool. In addition, the HYPE price itself will increase after the completion of each presale stage, both mechanisms designed to reward early buyers. Bitcoin Hyper is currently in its early presale stages and is likely available at a bargain. However, its strong demand means that the stages will sell out rather quickly, with sidelined investors leaving considerable money on the table. Interested buyers can visit the project’s presale and buy HYPE with just a few clicks using the OTC widget, either through a bank card or by swapping cryptos. Investors can also connect to the project’s X and Telegram accounts for more info. Visit Bitcoin Hyper Presale Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

He blamed greed and public pressure, admitting his trades became emotional and reckless. Despite the loss, Wynn continues promoting trading platforms and meme coins. James Wynn, a high-profile crypto trader recently liquidated for over $16 million on Hyperliquid, has broken his silence with a tweet about his dramatic rise and fall in the high-stakes world of crypto trading. In an introspective account, Wynn described how he turned $3 million into $100 million in just one month, only to lose it all within a week. His story has ignited discussion about the dangers of leveraged trading and the intense psychological toll of having your trades watched by the public. Wynn: From PEPE Fame to High-Leverage Bitcoin Bets Before his recent notoriety, Wynn was mostly known in niche crypto circles for calling the PEPE meme coin early, reportedly netting eight figures.

Investors, however, should be wary, as tokens of this type are highly volatile and offer no real utility. The Winner Following the Conflict US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who were quite close during the former’s presidential campaign and even after his return to the White House, clashed in recent days. The feud escalated into a public exchange of sharp insults and accusations, and it seems to have erupted over disagreements concerning Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill. “ The legislative proposal introduced by the president aims to implement significant changes across various sectors, including tax policy, healthcare, and national security. Musk, though, described it as a “disgusting abomination “ and claimed it would harm America’s financial stability. The conflict between the two men had a negative impact on the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin (BTC) briefly plunging below $101,000 while Ethereum (ETH) lost the support level of $2,500. As it usually happens, though, some crypto enthusiasts took advantage of the chaos and launched a meme coin called KILL BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL (KBBB) on the Solana-based platform pump .fun . The asset’s logo resembles a satirical image of Elon Musk dressed in a yellow tracksuit and holding a sword in his right hand. KBBB’s price defied the ongoing market trend, experiencing a staggering 370% rally over a 24-hour period , while its market capitalization surged above $45 million. KBBB Price, Source: CoinGecko On the contrary, meme coins related to the American president, including Official Trump (TRUMP), Super Trump (STRUMP), MAGA (TRUMP), and others, have headed south following the confrontation. Beware of Such Tokens While KBBB’s price surge is undoubtedly impressive, investors looking to engage with it (or with similar meme coins) should keep several key points in mind. These tokens typically have no real utility or use cases and are driven purely by hype. They’re notorious for their enhanced volatility, and it wouldn’t be surprising if KBBB’s valuation drops sharply following the next twist in the Trump-Musk saga or when speculators lose interest when a new one emerges. There’s a golden rule of investing: always conduct thorough research before diving in, and invest only what you’re prepared to lose.

Metaplanet Launches Historic ¥770.9 Billion Bitcoin-Focused Stock Market Rally, Targets 1% of Total BTC Supply by 2027 The capital will be raised through the issuance of 555 million shares through rolling strike warrants, a financial instrument rarely seen in the Japanese market. Notably, Metaplanet became the first company in Japan to issue such warrants at a higher premium than the current market price, signaling strong confidence in its long-term Bitcoin strategy. This ambitious increase is also in line with Metaplanet’s newly announced goals: to acquire 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. If these goals are met, the company will be able to control 1% of Bitcoin’s total final supply, capped at 21 million coins. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin purchasing plan follows a growing global trend for public companies to add digital assets to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation and to diversify reserves. Metaplanet’s move also positions Japan more prominently on the global Bitcoin investment map amid growing institutional interest in digital assets in Asia. Further details regarding the warrant structure and acquisition roadmap are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

UK regulators are taking steps to boost growth in the country’s crypto industry. On Friday, June 6, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority proposed lifting a ban on crypto exchange-traded notes for retail customers. However, these notes will have to be issued by FCA-approved exchanges. You might also like: UK’s Farage push Trump-like crypto policy to make Britain a ‘crypto powerhouse’ David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, explained that the agency wants to promote the UK crypto industry while also ensuring investor protections. “This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK’s crypto industry. We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money,” David Geale, FCA. To balance risks, the rules on financial promotion will still apply. This means that institutions will have to provide investors with information about the risks involved with these assets. The FCA also explained that its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors will remain in place. UK’s FCA moves to clarify rules on crypto The latest lift on the ETN trading ban for retail traders is part of a broader push to balance investor protection with innovation. On May 2, the FCA proposed banning retail investors from buying crypto assets with debt. Due to the volatility of crypto assets, debt-financed buying could expose investors to significant financial risk, the regulator argued. Unlike crypto exchange-traded funds, which are backed by the underlying asset, ETNs are unsecured debt notes tied to a specific index. This means they are higher-risk assets than ETFs, as they also expose traders to counterparty risk related to the issuer’s solvency.

Donald Trump Jr. publicly denied any connection and teased an official Trump-backed crypto wallet. The controversy happened amid the increasing political tension over Trump’s crypto involvement. During a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Representative Maxine Waters warned that Trump’s digital asset ventures could undermine investor protections and exploit proposed legislation like the CLARITY Act. At the same time, the president’s recent meme coin fundraiser dinner raised $148 million, which further blurred lines between politics and crypto. Meanwhile, Trump’s feud with Elon Musk caused wider market jitters, and triggered $278 million in outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The spat also flipped market sentiment from “Greed” to “Fear.” WLFI Issues Cease-and-Desist Over Trump Wallet World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform backed by US President Donald Trump and his family, issued a cease-and-desist letter to Fight Fight Fight LLC, the creators of the TRUMP meme coin and operators of Gettrumpmemes.com. The legal action started after the announcement of a new Trump-branded crypto wallet, which WLFI claims was developed without the Trump Organization’s involvement. Magic Eden and the meme coin team recently promoted a waitlist for the wallet, which attracted immediate backlash from Trump’s inner circle. Donald Trump Jr., who serves as WLFI’s “Web3 ambassador,” publicly denied any affiliation with the wallet project and teased the official launch of a Trump-approved wallet in the near future. According to Bloomberg, the cease-and-desist notice is not yet publicly available, but sources familiar with the matter confirmed its existence. Despite the legal warning, the original promotional posts on X from Magic Eden and Gettrumpmemes are still live. However, the associated website, TrumpWallet.com, has gone offline. WLFI raised over $550 million through token sales as of March, and is already under scrutiny for its USD1 stablecoin. The token made headlines in May when an Abu Dhabi-based firm revealed plans to use USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance . The Trump family holds equity in WLFI and benefits financially through a company linked to the president that collects transaction fees. The political ramifications of Trump’s crypto ventures are intensifying. Some Democratic lawmakers accused the president of using his office to enrich himself through his digital asset businesses. These allegations could complicate efforts to pass key legislation in Congress, including bills that would regulate payment stablecoins and establish a market structure for digital assets. Lawmakers Clash Over Trump and Crypto Rules Lawmakers in the US House Financial Services Committee seem increasingly divided over how to regulate digital assets, and this could be due to the fact that President Donald Trump’s crypto affiliations are casting a shadow over bipartisan efforts. During a June 4 hearing , Representative Maxine Waters voiced her sharp concerns over Trump’s involvement in the crypto industry, and warned that the proposed Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act could be exploited by the president to further his financial interests. Waters pointed to Trump’s recent dinner with top meme coin holders, and warned that the bill could allow him to funnel Americans’ funds into his own digital wallet. The dinner itself attracted $148 million in contributions. By describing the CLARITY Act as rushed and dangerously permissive, Waters criticized its lack of protections for investors and absence of penalties for bad actors. The bill was introduced on May 29 with Republican support and three Democratic co-sponsors. Its main goal is to define clear jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC, but it also ignited partisan debate over its implications. Waters and other Democrats called for a closer examination of Trump’s crypto ties, particularly those connected to his family-backed platform, World Liberty Financial. On the other hand, Committee Chair French Hill defended the bill’s intent by arguing that the current lack of federal oversight for digital assets is stifling innovation and creating confusion for investors. Still, none of the expert witnesses—including former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, former SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman, and Uniswap Labs' legal chief Katherine Minarik—touched on Trump’s involvement in their opening remarks. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, however, directly addressed the issue by saying Trump’s crypto dealings cast a “taint” on the entire industry and pose national security concerns. He questioned whether the president’s actions were aligned with national interests or personal gain. Waters’ bill Waters already introduced a separate bill aiming to bar the president, vice president, and members of Congress from participating in crypto ventures. That legislation came on the same day as Trump’s meme coin dinner, during which the president spoke from a podium bearing the presidential seal—despite claims it was a personal event. Overall, as both the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act continue to move through Congress, Democrats are still very hesitant to support any bill that fails to address the growing concerns over Trump’s influence on the digital asset space. Trump-Musk Feud Triggers Bitcoin ETF Outflows Just how much influence Trump and his actions have on the crypto market is becoming more and more clear. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States experienced a sharp downturn as market sentiment soured after a very public fallout between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) After briefly recovering on June 3 and 4, US spot Bitcoin ETFs suffered outflows totaling $278 million on June 5. This is according to data from Farside Investors . The shift coincided with the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index flipping from “Greed” to “Fear” on June 6, which proves that there is growing investor anxiety over the high-profile feud. The falling sentiment extended beyond the crypto market, with Tesla shares dropping 14% and Trump Media shares falling 8%. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) Bitcoin ETFs were under some pressure after cumulative outflows of $1.2 billion from May 29 to June 2, despite the short-lived recovery earlier in the week. On June 5, no US Bitcoin ETF recorded inflows, with ARK Invest’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF leading the outflows at $102 million. Globally, Bitcoin exchange-traded products saw $8 million in outflows over the past week. In contrast, Ether ETFs continued to show resilience. On June 5, US spot Ether ETFs brought in $11.3 million in inflows, extending a 14-day streak. Although, this was still a sharp decline from the previous two days, which saw inflows of $56.9 million and $109.4 million, respectively. Ethereum ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) Ether ETPs have drawn investor interest thanks to improving Ethereum network fundamentals and strength in ETH futures markets. In fact, BlackRock even purchased $50 million worth of ETH on June 3.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 13:33:32

This steep decline raises questions about the future of the original meme coin. Could this be the end for Dogecoin, or will other coins step up to the plate? The article explores which cryptocurrencies might be poised for a surge. Dogecoin Price Struggles: Bears Hold the Upper Hand Source: tradingview Dogecoin's price is in a tight spot, fluctuating between about $0.18 and $0.22. Bulls seem weak, as bears lead with a recent 17% drop over the past week. Currently, Dogecoin is below its 100-day average, signaling more seller control. The Relative Strength Index is under 50, hinting at less buying momentum. Immediate resistance lies at around $0.25, and if this is broken, it might climb by roughly 35% to the next hurdle, nearly $0.30. However, if bears push harder, Dogecoin could fall to close support at about $0.16, risking a dip of around 27% to the second support level near $0.11. It's a cautious time for investors. Conclusion The recent 22% drop in Dogecoin following the Trump-Musk dispute has significantly impacted investor confidence, positioning DOGE in a challenging market scenario. Despite current bearish pressures and weakened bullish momentum, Dogecoin still retains potential to rebound if it successfully surpasses the critical resistance at $0.25. However, investors should remain cautious, as further downside toward the $0.16 and potentially $0.11 support levels remains a real possibility. The future of the original meme coin hinges on broader market sentiment and the community's resilience amid turbulent events. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This bounce from oversold territory reflects early buying interest, yet technical structure suggests the trend remains vulnerable. Traders are watching closely to see whether DOGE price action can break back into the previous range or if the rebound will face resistance from supply layers near $0.1860 and above. What’s Happening With DOGE’s Price? After dropping from its May peak near $0.2450, DOGE price recently found support at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level near $0.1719. The daily structure remains bearish with consecutive lower highs and a failed attempt to sustain above the triangle breakout level from late May. DOGE’s price had been consolidating between $0.1790 and $0.1980 before bears took control and drove the coin lower into a historical demand region between $0.1660 and $0.1720. DOGE price forecast (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, a recovery is underway following a V-shaped bounce from the $0.1662 support.

This marks a dramatic breakdown in their relationship and could significantly impact government dealings with Musk’s companies, including SpaceX and Starlink . Trump’s criticism followed Musk’s disapproval of the president’s proposed tax bill, which Musk claimed was bad for the U.S. economy and full of “disgusting pork.” Trump accused Musk of turning against him only after losing influence in government and losing favorable EV policies. In a post on Truth Social, Trump threatened to slash Musk’s federal funding, saying it would be the easiest way to cut spending. Musk responded on X, suggesting Trump should be impeached, warning his trade policies might cause a recession, and even bringing up the president’s alleged links to Jeffrey Epstein. Musk also hinted at forming a new political party and distancing himself from Republicans. Tesla shares dropped nearly 14% , wiping over $150 billion in value — the largest single-day loss in the company’s history. Musk blamed the tax bill for favoring oil and gas industries while cutting support for clean energy, a core business area for Tesla. Trump’s frustration appears tied to Musk’s growing independence and political power. Despite donating over $250 million to Trump’s re-election, Musk now regrets his support, saying Trump wouldn’t have won without him. “Such ingratitude,” Musk wrote. The fallout has already affected NASA, with Trump pulling the nomination of Jared Isaacman, a Musk ally, to lead the agency. Several people from Musk’s team have also started exiting roles tied to the administration, including those working in Musk’s budget-cutting program “Doge.” The feud could reshape U.S. political and business alliances , with Musk’s influence extending far beyond the current administration.

Professionals Are Using This Utility Coin Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/more-dump-before-rally-professionals-are-using-this-utility-coin-instead/,"Traders are thinking differently since the SHIB price trades below important levels. Smart money is moving to Unilabs Finance while analysts suggest Shiba Inu coin may show a future rebound. With its practical use and outstanding presale, this rising star is attracting professional interest more and more. Many are wondering whether this is the last dip before a breakout or if SHIB is fading permanently as prices hover close to 0.000012. SHIB Price Dips but Shows Potential Bounce Potential This year the SHIB price has been declining steadily, regularly trading less than $0.00002. Though unable to sustain this surge, the Shiba Inu coin traded above the $0.000017 level in early May. Right now, the SHIB price shows a bearish phase and is about $0.000012. The study projects the Shiba Inu coin to value $0.0000161 in 2025. One should expect a more obvious price change for next year. The SHIB price might climb to $0.000030 and have a possible peak at $0.000036. This longer-term estimate shows positive momentum for the Shiba Inu coin, which market expansion, token burns, or enhanced ecosystem value could propel. Unilabs Finance appeals to investors despite the good forecasts for the Shiba Inu coin because of its utility-oriented qualities. Shiba Inu Coin Scam Concerns Drive Traders Away On Layer 2 blockchain Shibarium, Shiba Inu runs on transactions faster, cheaper, more efficient for consumers, so strengthening the SHIB network. Users have lately been complaining, meanwhile, about frauds on the Shibarium blockchain. The increasing worry adds to the pressure on the SHIB price, which has already been on a continuous drop. This is consistent with a larger trend observed in the memecoin domain, whereby quick hype and expansion can draw negative actors. Therefore, even if they still get great returns, market players are looking for safer and more dependable alternative projects than the Shiba Inu coin. Unilabs Finance satisfies this demand since it guarantees actual value with instruments to search the market for legal digital assets with great development capacity. Experts Are Turning to Unilabs for Real Returns and Utility Following the recent drop in SHIB price, traders are looking more and more for the next cryptocurrency to purchase. Many are turning to projects with actual application, and thanks to Unilabs’ pragmatic tools and growth-oriented approach, experts are pointing to it.

At $0.0062 right now, investors can purchase the UNIL token at a low entry point before its next projected rise to $0.0074. Conclusion The uncertainty about the future of the Shiba Inu coin has investors second-guessing even if the SHIB price might still stage a comeback. With its AI tools, Unilabs is, on the other hand, redefining the DeFi scene. Unilabs Finance offers a rare chance for investors looking for notable returns to create long-term wealth.

On the news Bitcoin has spiked nearly $3,000 so far on Friday. With such a big influx of liquidity and more to come, could this provide the boost that sends Bitcoin into its next upward stage of the bull market? Treasury buyback cancels out Trump/Musk spat Today’s announcement by the U.S. Treasury that it had bought $10 billion of its debt was enough to spike the crypto market back to the upside. Only yesterday, $BTC had fallen as low as $100,500 on the back of the enormous spat between President Trump and Elon Musk . The highly public war of words between these two iconic world figures was hugely detrimental to the US on the world stage and markets fell accordingly. Less than a day later, early on Friday morning, the $10 billion U.S. Treasury buyback had the complete opposite effect on markets and Bitcoin shot back up into safer territory. Treasury buybacks can generally have the impact of helping to weaken the dollar by increasing liquidity in financial markets. In addition, it may reduce pressure on bond yields which can also lead to a more favourable environment for Bitcoin. $BTC bounces from bottom of descending channel Source: TradingView In the short-term time frame it can be seen how quickly the $BTC price bounced back from the 5.15% fall from top to bottom experienced on Thursday. The descending channel is doing its job, and the lower trendline acted as support for the price even though a wick down took the price very near to the $100,000 horizontal level. Having reached the $104,000 resistance level the price surge has come to a halt. It now remains to be seen if the bulls can continue the upward surge, breaking through the horizontal resistance and the top of the descending channel, or whether the bears will be able to put a stop to the upward movement. The touch of the $104,300 horizontal resistance may even be a confirmation of the breakdown past this level. Positives build on weekly time frame Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $BTC is looking very positive. If the price can hold the horizontal support formed by the candle tops in December 2024, and the recent price action, this can become the base for the next upward surge. Towards the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI does have the indicators angled down, but if price does start to move up this can change. At the very bottom of the chart, the Hash Ribbons indicator has just produced a very bullish blue signal. These are generally emitted at the bottom of large upward price impulses.

As adoption grows, one company has opted to pay its staff in crypto, specifically XRP, and is publicly testing the boundaries of this model. Edoardo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a vocal advocate for XRP, recently posted on X that every member of his company is paid in XRP. He also noted that if they held onto their earnings, it would be up over 500%, referencing the asset’s massive surge that began in November 2024. Everyone at my business, Alpha Lions Academy, gets paid in XRP, from designers to editors to marketers. Since adopting $XRP , their money is up 500%, if they didn’t sell. Fiat could never. Take the XRP, or find another job. Would you work for $XRP ? — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 5, 2025 Community Reactions and Practical Concerns Responses to the post included a mix of admiration and curiosity. One user highlighted a relevant offering from Uphold, noting that the exchange now provides a USD interest account where users earn 4% back in XRP if they direct deposit paychecks of $250 to $5,000. Another commenter commended the company’s approach, asking whether volatility had encouraged more financial literacy within the team. However, one commenter raised the concern about daily spending. While XRP’s adoption in global finance is increasing through major bank partnerships , its influence in day-to-day payments is still limited. The commenter asked how Farina’s employees could hold their assets while covering basic expenses, as most bills can’t be paid with crypto. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another commenter reiterated this stance, noting that he would gladly get paid using XRP but would have to sell the tokens to cover daily expenses. Farina has consistently advised investors not to sell their XRP , but the viability of long-term crypto holding as compensation also depends heavily on both the currency’s performance and employees’ financial situations. Those who can cover their expenses without selling are in a better position, as they can accumulate XRP and benefit from price growth. For others, the asset needs widespread adoption and integration, allowing them to easily cover expenses while holding their crypto, as XRP tends to move without giving late investors time to prepare. Increasing Crypto Adoption in Business The Alpha Lions Academy model mentioned debates around cryptocurrency as a practical medium of exchange rather than just an investment asset. While crypto wages have become more common in freelance and blockchain-specific industries, a full team paid in XRP remains uncommon. This approach may serve as a test case for whether digital assets can serve as stable compensation tools. Farina has always stood behind XRP , and his approach to staff salaries proves that he is confident in the digital asset’s future.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 500 points higher at the open as investors also weighed the cooling of the public spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1.1% to touch 6,000, while the Nasdaq Composite edged 1.3% higher. Wall Street was in an upbeat mood following the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics report . According to details in the release, the U.S. economy showed resilience with an additional 139,000 nonfarm payrolls in May. This was more than the 126,000 jobs economists had forecast. It follows April’s numbers, which showed 147,000 new nonfarm payrolls, while the U.S. unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%. “The economy, despite all of this craziness that we’re getting every day, is still growing,” Stephanie Link,Hightower Advisors chief investment strategist, told CNBC.

Notably, Tesla shares, which tanked sharply amid the spat, inched higher in premarket trading. Musk had on Thursday called for Trump’s impeachment as criticism and opposition to the president’s tax bill spilled into threats and counter-threats.

Trump pointed out that the European Central Bank has cut interest rates 10 times this year and described the FED's failure to take any action as an “economic disaster.” “Interest rates are being lowered in Europe all the time, but there is still no change in our country. Despite this, our country is doing well, but if interest rates were lowered by one point, it would create a rocket fuel effect on our economy,” said Trump, adding that if the FED lowered interest rates, debts could be converted into cheaper debts in both the short and long term.

If it returns, it can be countered with a rate hike. It's that simple.” Arguing that current interest rate policies impose a huge cost on the country, Trump stated that borrowing costs should be much lower. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reported that Trump told Powell that by not cutting interest rates, the US was putting itself at an economic disadvantage against China and other countries. In a previous statement from the FED, it was reported that Powell conveyed to Trump that monetary policy should be guided by economic data, not political pressures. Trump, who has frequently criticized Powell since taking office, has drawn attention with the nicknames he has given her and his harsh statements. *This is not investment advice.

STRD sits below STRF and STRK in seniority, increasing risk but also enhancing the creditworthiness and market appeal of senior preferreds. This capital stack innovation will allow MSTR to raise funds at lower costs, maximizing Bitcoin accumulation while minimizing dilution for common shareholders. Saylor's financial engineering is a masterclass in leveraging capital structure to optimize Bitcoin exposure and shareholder value. A Recap If you’ve been keeping up with my recent takes on Strategy 'MicroStrategy' ( MSTR ), you know that I find Michael Saylor's financial engineering empire a great vehicle for levered exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I published my latest analysis on the stock just a few days ago, explaining why the common stock's lagging in recent days compared to Bitcoin was no cause for concern, and that Strategy's investment case remained robust. Well, here I am again covering Strategy, as the Bitcoin treasury giant pulled another huge move. On Monday, Strategy announced its third preferred stock set to trade under the ticker STRD. Spoiler alert: It's a big move in its capital-raising stack, and frankly, a genius move by Saylor and Co. Note that I have previously covered ( STRK ) and ( STRF ) here and here , and have been over why I believe they are set to become highly accretive tools for Strategy. However, I am going to give a quick recap here as well, just so we can easily compare them with STRD, as well as the implications relative to the two other preferreds. A Capital Stack for Every Investor: STRD’s Role in the Mix Now here comes the third preferred, STRD, aimed to serve a whole other class of investors. So far, the stack looks like this: At the base is MSTR’s common stock. This is the riskiest play. It offers leveraged Bitcoin exposure with no dividends but the potential for massive gains if Bitcoin skyrockets and Strategy's multi-vehicle acquisition engine strategy pays off. STRK sits a step higher. It blends an 8% yield with the convertibility option and should be appealing to those who want a steady income but also a chance to ride MSTR’s equity upside. STRF, with its 10% yield and senior position, targets risk-averse investors. These could be institutions or those seeking a competitive yield that is, at the same time, overcollateralized. It is designed to trade like a high-quality security with lower volatility while offering the best risk/reward mix in the fixed-income market. And now, we have the third one, STRD. It has a 10% dividend, a perpetual duration, and is positioned as the high-yield, ""junky"" play in MSTR’s lineup. Obviously, it sits below STRF and STRK in seniority, meaning it’s riskier and more exposed to potential losses if MSTR’s Bitcoin bet goes south. But that risk comes with a reward (i.e., the juicy 10% yield for investors willing to take a chance). STRD's Position Relative To The Capital Structure (STRD Investor Presentation) Now here's the thing. STRD’s dividends are non-cumulative and discretionary, paid quarterly in cash only if the board declares them, adding another layer of risk. So, STRD is for the yield chasers, investors who are comfortable with a more speculative position in MSTR’s capital structure but want a higher return for that risk. Strategy is effectively fine-tuning its financial engineering to capture every possible dollar from the market to buy more Bitcoin. STRD vs. STRF: Saylor’s Genius in Elevating the Capital Stack But wait a second! STRD sounds a lot like STRF. Both offer a 10% dividend at par, both are perpetual, and neither is convertible. So why would anyone buy STRD, which is junior to STRF in the capital structure, over the more senior STRF? This is where Saylor’s genius shines through, and financial engineering becomes art. The introduction of STRD has nothing really to do with adding another high-yield option. It’s a strategic play to elevate STRF’s status as a higher-quality security. I can already read the comments about how this is another tool in Strategy's unsustainable approach, but I don't see it this way. It actually makes total sense. Here is how it works: By issuing STRD, which sits below STRF and STRK, MSTR is effectively increasing the creditworthiness of its senior preferreds. The BTC acquired through STRD issuance bolsters the collateral backing STRF and STRK, making them more attractive to conservative investors. Am I crazy? Probably not. The market is already pricing this exact setup. STRF, being a perpetual (long-maturity instrument) and overcollateralized, is already trading above par. With STRD in the mixture, STRF’s perceived safety goes up, thus pushing its price even higher. STRK/STRF Performance Since Launch (STRD Investor Presentation) As STRF trades above par, its effective yield drops. Today, the effective yield stands at 9.6%, and I wouldn't be surprised if we saw it move toward 4-5% if demand surges in a low-rate environment. This creates a vacuum for STRD to step in as the true high-yield play, offering 10% for investors willing to take on more risk. Investors chasing STRF’s now-lower but more secure yield will bid its price up, while STRD becomes the go-to for those seeking higher returns with a ""junky"" profile. This setup essentially allows MSTR to issue more STRF in the future at a premium—above par—on a much lower financing ratio. For example, if STRF trades at a 4-5% yield, MSTR can raise capital at a fraction of the cost compared to issuing common stock or even STRK. Even if BTC were to appreciate at a CAGR well below its historical levels, MSTR would still unlock tons of value from such low financing costs. The fact that STRD trades above par at all is also accretive for MSTR’s common shareholders, as it minimizes dilution while maximizing BTC per dollar raised. Speaking of dilution, Saylor’s surprising move last week to issue zero MSTR shares, and funding that week's total BTC buys exclusively through raising $427 million through STRK and STRF, signals a gradual, long-term shift toward prioritizing preferreds for financing. The fact that the mNAV got compressed below 2x lately shows that management pays attention and wants to protect the common stock's premium. Last Week's Capital Raises (SEC filings) The Bigger Picture: Saylor’s Financial Engineering Look, I know that many don't believe in Saylor's financial engineering. I mean, if you don't understand Bitcoin, you probably are even further disgusted by what Strategy is doing. Still, I urge you to see how Strategy's engineering is nothing short of brilliant. By layering STRD below STRF and STRK, Strategy is not only diversifying its capital-raising options but also optimizing the entire stack for leverage. STRD “adds intelligent leverage on MSTR,” enhancing the value of the senior preferreds while giving MSTR more room to raise capital efficiently. STRD is designed to help MSTR acquire billions in BTC while maintaining flexibility across its capital structure. The more BTC Strategy acquires, the stronger its collateral base becomes, which supports the issuance of more preferred stock at better terms, in turn funding additional Bitcoin purchases. It’s a flywheel fine-tuned, and STRD seems to be the latest cog in the primary BTC accumulation machine.",STRK|STRF|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-06 14:00:17

Yet, the drama that unfolded between the US President and one of his closest allies managed to impact the crypto markets as well. But before we go into the details of the quickly escalating spectacle between the two, let’s rewind the clock slightly to the events that transpired since last Friday. Bitcoin’s price was quite calm at that point, as after the few rejections at around $110,000 in the previous week, it had found a solid spot close to $104,000. It sat there for about 72 hours and started to gain traction as the new week began. However, it couldn’t go any higher than $106,500, where it was stopped on a few occasions. Even yesterday, after the European Central Bank announced an eighth interest rate cut, dropping the metric to a two-year low of 2%, BTC managed to climb only to $106,000. It faced immediate selling pressure at that point and slumped to a multi-week low of $100,400. Of course, the blame for this substantial correction was put on the aforementioned drama between Musk and the POTUS. Both men used their respective social media platforms to fire shots at one another. Some of the most notable include Musk saying Trump was in the Epstein files, while the President threatened to halt the former’s government contracts. More recently, Trump denied rumors that he plans to hash it out over a phone call, and other reports even emerged claiming that he plans to sell his Tesla EV. Despite this ongoing saga, BTC managed to recover some ground and now trades around $104,000. This represents a 1.7% decline on a weekly scale, but it’s minimal compared to the substantial losses experienced by DOGE (-12.5%), SIU (-8.5%), LINK (-8.5%), and AVAX (-10%).

Although BTC’s price is yet to react, the amount of bitcoins heading out of exchanges and going into self-custodial devices continues to impress. In a single day alone, over 22,500 BTC were moved from trading platforms, which reduces the selling pressure. On-Chain Data Signals ‘Buy the Dip’ as Bitcoin Hashrate Hits New Highs . Bitcoin’s price tumbled, as mentioned above, this week to a June low of under $100,500. However, an important on-chain metric, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicator, flashed a “buy the dip” signal. ECB Cuts Interest Rates Again: How Did Bitcoin React? While the US Federal Reserve continues to leave the local interest rates unchanged in 2025, the European counterparty went in the opposite direction. The ECB lowered the rates in the Eurozone to 2% – the lowest in over two years, and BTC jumped initially before going down a notch. Robinhood Cements Crypto Ambitions with $200M Bitstamp Takeover . Robinhood solidified its presence in the European crypto market by acquiring the world’s oldest still functioning digital asset exchange, Bitstamp. The deal, announced earlier this week, was for $200 million. Bitcoin Sees Intense Surge in Realized Profits Following Ascent to $111K: Glassnode . With BTC falling further away from its latest all-time high registered a couple of weeks ago on Bitcoin Pizza Day, reports have emerged now claiming that the most probable reason behind this is that profit-taking has gone through the roof after the price surge. Strategy Announces Proposed IPO of STRD Stock to Buy More Bitcoin . The world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin, who made a relatively modest acquisition this week, announced IPO plans for 2.5 million shares ($100 per stock) to raise more capital for further BTC purchases. Later on, the company raised its target from $250 million to $1 billion.

HSBC expects AI to increase demand for US tech and infrastructure Despite challenges in the wider economy, HSBC became more positive about US stocks after large technology companies reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter. The firm expects huge investments in memory chips, processing power, and data infrastructure as more companies adopt artificial intelligence. The systems need much more computing capacity and storage to function effectively. The bank highlighted several companies that will benefit most from this AI initiative. These include semiconductor manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD, and Micron. These firms produce the advanced chips necessary to run AI applications efficiently. Other beneficiaries include cloud computing and storage providers offering AI data processing and storage. Networking and data center companies stand to benefit by building and maintaining the necessary infrastructure. Additionally, enterprise software developers focused on creating AI applications and tools are likely to see growth. HSBC’s Global Chief Investment Officer, Willem Sels, said this growing trend is a broad and lasting change in how technology and business operate. He added that it would create new investment opportunities over a longer period. Willem also said that more investors are now interested in US equities after seeing the S&P 500 index in the US stock market rise more than 19% from a drop in April. HSBC trusts Asian markets to balance risks from the West HSBC is also interested in the Asian market and has invested in China, India, and Singapore because they have strong local demand for technology that protects their economies from the effects of global trade disputes and political tensions. In China, the government supports companies working on AI projects by creating policies that encourage innovation, and HSBC expects these efforts to boost the country’s economy in the future. Meanwhile, India’s improvements in internet access and government reforms encourage the country’s young and growing population to quickly adapt to digital services and technology, which makes it easier to start and run businesses. Singapore’s political stability and well-regulated financial system have attracted investors during times of crisis in the global economy. This is because the country is also a center for banking, trade, and finance in Asia, proving it can maintain its economic growth. HSBC’s investment strategy involves focusing on US stocks to take advantage of the fast growth caused by AI technologies while trusting the steady and resilient growth potential of important Asian markets like China, India, and Singapore, or the “barbell” approach. If one part of the world is in crisis, the investments that HSBC has made in the other sections will be able to handle the heat and allow the bank to provide more stable returns for investors over time.

The tech giants see stablecoins as a way to cut transaction costs and streamline international payments. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offering a bridge between crypto infrastructure and traditional finance. In 2024, they facilitated more than $27.6 trillion in transactions — more than Visa and Mastercard combined — according to a report from the World Economic Forum . Stablecoins have been a fast-growing area of interest for traditional finance and that appears to be exploding even further following stablecoin issuer Circle's (CRCL) gangbuster IPO on Thursday, Shares more than doubled from an already-raised offering price and they're higher by another 40% today. According to Fortune, Apple has reportedly been in talks with crypto companies since January to explore incorporating stablecoins into Apple Pay and its wider payments infrastructure. Meanwhile, X is in discussions with Stripe to potentially enable stablecoin-based transactions. Airbnb is exploring stablecoins as a way to reduce the cut it pays to card networks like Visa and Mastercard. One crypto executive told Fortune the home-rental giant has been in talks with Worldpay since the beginning of 2025. Political shifts, primarily U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to office — has made adopting crypto less risky in the U.S. corporate landscape. Some analysts predict the stablecoin market could hit $2 trillion by 2028 . One key tailwind: the expected passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill that would establish regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers and potentially encourage more mainstream adoption in the United States.

This pilot, rolled out in cooperation with leading local exchange Bitcoin Romania (BTR/Tradesilvania), is the beginning of the extensive rollout to cities including Alexandria, Piatra Neamț, Botoșani, and Nădlac, with a view to bridging the digital divide and increasing financial inclusion across the nation. The procedure was as simple as making a withdrawal from an old-fashioned ATM for most Romanians. ”I paid my mobile phone bill and saw the new machine,” said Andrei, 31, from Tulcea. ”I've heard of Bitcoin, but never paid with it. I spent my first 0.001 BTC today — just to see how it works.” The network, powered by the backend of Bitcoin Romania, allows one to buy or sell Bitcoin with cash, read a wallet QR code, and make transactions in minutes. The ATM is accessibility-focused, with Romanian language interface and step-by-step instructions, ID verification for higher amounts to comply with local KYC/AML laws. The partnership is strategic for both sides. Poșta Română with its large coverage and reputable public image is taking its service bouquet into the digital age to woo new clients and increase digital maturity. For Bitcoin Romania, the collaboration means rapid expansion into underserved regions and a chance to reach new demographics. “We’re bringing crypto to the people, not just the cities,” said Constantin Rotariu, co-founder of Bitcoin Romania. “This is about access, education, and building trust in digital finance.” Fees for the new ATM are competitive in European terms — typically between 4% and 7% per transaction, the same or slightly lower than the EU-wide average for Bitcoin ATMs. While exchanges online are still cheaper, convenience and cash availability are worth the premium for users, especially for those with limited easy access to online banking. “I’d rather pay a bit more and know my transaction is instant and secure,” said Maria, a retiree who used the ATM to send Bitcoin to her grandson in Germany. Romania’s move comes as crypto adoption accelerates in Eastern Europe, with the region seeing $499 billion in crypto inflows over the past year and a growing appetite for decentralized finance. Over 600,000 Romanians now hold investments in cryptocurrency, and the country is aligning with the EU's MiCA framework, paving the way for larger-scale public-sector involvement. The postal pilot is considered a blue print for other EU countries, a tangible, trustworthy point of entry to digital assets for city and countryside. Among social media, the launch has created buzz and curiosity. The rollout of Romania’s first postal Bitcoin ATM quickly sparked excitement and curiosity both online and in Tulcea itself. Locals snapped photos and shared their first impressions, with many praising the ATM’s clear instructions and the helpfulness of post office staff. On X, @BTC_Europe summed up the mood: “Romania’s post office just installed a Bitcoin ATM. This is how you bring crypto to the masses!” Across Facebook and Telegram, users discussed the convenience of handling crypto in a trusted public setting, seeing it as a sign that digital assets are finally reaching everyday Romanians.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 15:25:00

With the trend of companies incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries gaining steam, K Wave Media doesn’t want to be left out because it plans to be the “Metaplanet of Korea.” Choi Pyeungho, the KVM board chairman, welcomed this move, and stated , “K Wave Media’s bold adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset is a visionary move that signals the growing convergence between digital media and decentralized finance. We are proud to support K Wave’s mission to lead Web3 integration in the content space and believe this strategy will create strong, long-term value for its shareholders.” This strategic move has paid off since the entertainment company’s stock surged by 143%, illustrating heightened market optimism. By holding Bitcoin as a primary corporate reserve asset, K Wave Media sees this as a stepping stone towards heightened innovation and forward-thinking asset management. Ted Kim, the co-interim CEO of K Wave Media, believes that adding Bitcoin on the balance sheet not only strengthens the company’s commitment to decentralization, agility, and forward-looking value creation, but also reimagines the future of media. This is because Bitcoin is more than a store of value—it’s a catalyst for innovation, independence, and global scalability. Meanwhile, French footballing giant Paris Saint-Germain recently unveiled its Bitcoin treasury before the Champions League Final , which it ultimately won against Inter Milan of Italy. Why is the Demand for a Bitcoin Treasury Going Through the Roof? In an era of accelerating inflation, currency devaluation, and global economic uncertainty, companies are rethinking their cash management strategies. Enter the Bitcoin treasury: a revolutionary approach that is reshaping corporate finance. Traditionally, companies have held large amounts of cash and cash equivalents on their balance sheets, typically in fiat currencies like the US dollar. However, as central banks print more money and real interest rates remain historically low or even negative, these holdings often lose value over time. To combat this erosion, forward-thinking companies are now turning to Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Bitcoin offers several advantages that make it an attractive addition to corporate treasuries. First, its fixed supply — capped at 21 million coins — ensures scarcity, which protects against inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed at will, Bitcoin’s issuance schedule is transparent and predictable. This built-in scarcity has fueled its rise as a digital store of value akin to digital gold. Second, Bitcoin is highly liquid and globally transferable, making it easy to buy, sell, or move across borders, even during times of financial stress. Its decentralized nature means it is not subject to any single government’s monetary policy or capital controls — a major plus for companies operating internationally. Third, Bitcoin’s historical performance has outpaced most traditional asset classes. While its volatility is higher than that of fiat currencies or bonds, its long-term returns have often made it a compelling hedge against currency debasement and an effective diversification tool. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have led the charge, converting portions of their cash reserves into Bitcoin. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has argued that Bitcoin is “digital property” superior to cash, while Tesla’s 2021 Bitcoin purchase showcased how even large, mainstream companies are willing to embrace this new paradigm. MicroStrategy recently unveiled a $42 billion Bitcoin acquisition strategy , meant to boost its equity-issuance plan. Conclusion As the corporate treasury BTC gains steam, K Wave Media sees it as an innovation that will enhance its media prowess. While Bitcoin treasuries are not without risks — including regulatory scrutiny and price volatility — they represent a forward-looking strategy that aligns with the digital transformation of finance. As more companies realize the potential of Bitcoin to protect against inflation and preserve purchasing power, Bitcoin treasuries might become an increasingly mainstream component of corporate finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-06 15:25:05

He shared this on X, renewing a prediction he first made in 2018 when he set his sights on reaching that mark by 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Back then, the crypto market took a sharp downturn in 2022—thanks in part to FTX’s collapse—and the timeline slipped. Still, Draper believes today’s drivers are strong enough to push prices higher. He even suggested that the US dollar might vanish in a decade as Bitcoin takes its place. Tim Draper’s Bold Timeline According to Draper, the $250,000 target isn’t just wishful thinking. In 2018, he said Bitcoin would reach that level by 2022. It didn’t happen—2022 saw many digital assets tumble in value. This year, though, he repeated his forecast after seeing a “recent surge” in the crypto. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: → General optimism… pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 He also claimed Bitcoin could become “infinite against the dollar,” arguing that in 10 years the US dollar wouldn’t exist. His confident tone suggests he’s sticking with the same numbers—$250,000 by December 31, 2025. Political And Regulatory Drivers Based on reports, Draper points to politics as a big catalyst. He highlighted moves by US President Donald Trump, who is working on new trade deals. One sign of this push is the Media & Technology Group’s filing on June 5, 2025, for a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. That application is headed to the NYSE Arca, with Crypto.com lined up as custodian, and it aims to bring more mainstream money into Bitcoin. On the regulatory front, the US Senate voted 66–32 on May 19 to advance the GENIUS Act, which would set rules for stablecoins. Plus, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 is under debate. It has bipartisan support and is meant to spell out clear rules for crypto. Financial Institutions And Adoption Draper also sees banks and big companies stepping in. He mentioned that JP Morgan plans to let its clients buy Bitcoin and use spot-BTC ETFs—like BlackRock’s IBIT—as collateral. That shift could open doors to a flood of institutional cash. Meanwhile, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads the pack, holding over 580,000 BTC. At current prices, that stash is worth about $61 billion. These moves, Draper argues, point to people treating Bitcoin more like gold than a risky token.

He talked about Web3 apps built on Bitcoin and said “Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum.” Right now, Lightning Network handles many Bitcoin transactions, making payments faster and cheaper.

XRP is now down by 2% in a week and by 12% in a fortnight, although the altcoin does hold on to a 300% increase in the last 12 months. This is a very healthy gain, and things may soon get even better for XRP in the medium- and long-term, with Chinese firm Webus officially filing with the SEC yesterday to establish a digital asset reserve. Previous releases from the company have revealed that this reserve will accumulate $300 million in XRP, something which, in addition to Ripple’s increasingly strong fundamentals, provides for a very strong long-term XRP price prediction. XRP Price Prediction: Chinese Company Files to Buy $300M XRP – $100 XRP Incoming? Webus is an AI-focused transportation company, yet in the past few weeks it has pivoted towards crypto, announcing at the end of May that it would be exploring the use of XRP as a strategic reserve and as a means of facilitating cross-border payments. The $300M XRP Treasury Play: Why Webus International May Have Just Triggered a Corporate Liquidity Revolution A little-known Chinese AI mobility company just filed with the SEC to build a $300M XRP treasury. It’s not just bold — it could be the start of a global on-chain… pic.twitter.com/t9CYkwN75u — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 4, 2025 Some crypto traders are now suggesting that Webus could be the first of many international firms to turn to XRP as a reserve asset and a means of cross-border payment. If this prediction is in any way accurate, it could be massive for the XRP price going forward. But today, the market hasn’t really responded to such a possibility, instead reacted negatively to yesterday’s spat between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. As we can see from XRP’s chart, the altcoin remains very much on a downwards curve, with its indicators suggesting that we may feel more pain over the weekend. After being hugely elevated since November, it now looks as though the coin’s 30-day average (orange) will soon drop below the 200-day (green). Source: TradingView This would amount to a death cross, signalling further losses as XRP retreats from medium-term highs. However, as we’ve written before, XRP had struggled so much prior to November of last year that the 30-day – and the XRP price – may not fall that much. Indeed, the coin’s relative strength index (purple) tells a different story, in that it has been below 50 more or less continuously since February. As such, XRP may actually still be in an oversold position, implying that a rebound could come soon. It could reach $2.50 by the end of this month, before hitting $3 shortly after. Diversification with New High-Potential Altcoins Yet it’s possible that XRP will need the Ripple-SEC to arrive at a final settlement before it can really take off, in which case, many traders may prefer to invest in alternatives. For those looking for quicker, market-beating gains, one possible strategy is to invest in presales, since these can result in rallies once the corresponding tokens list for the first time. One of the newest and most interesting presale coins is Snorter (SNORT), a Solana- and Ethereum-based token that launched its ICO a couple of weeks ago. Went outside. Touched grass. Immediately hated it. Back to the chaos. pic.twitter.com/XgGz1f7cCE — Snorter (@SnorterToken) May 19, 2025 Despite being very new, it has now raised in excess of $400,000, while its official X account has already amassed over 10,000 followers. This is an encouraging sign for the future, with investors excited about Snorter because of its plans to launch an advanced trading bot. As a trading bot, Snorter will be able to make sniping trades, swooping in on coins just as they’re about to take off. It will also come with various other features, including limit orders, atomic swaps (with MEV protection), copy trading, and rugpull and honeypot warnings. And because traders will need SNORT to pay for Snorter’s features, the coin could attract some serious demand. Investors can join its sale at the Snorter website , where it currently costs $0.0943. This will rise again tomorrow, so anyone wanting to lock in the lowest possible price – and biggest possible gains – should act quickly.

Avalanche’s token, AVAX AVAX, was among those hit, dropping to as low as $18.48 from $20.14. It has since rise 6% to $19.65 to reclaim nearly 58% of the losses while forming a promising ascending channel pattern with resistance at $19.76, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The token has lost 1% over 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 , an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap except for stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins, has dropped 0.85%. Recent trading sessions show decisive buying pressure, with notable volume spikes coinciding with price surges that briefly pushed AVAX to a local high of $19.76. Market analysis points to the consistent formation of higher lows over the past 14 hours as evidence of strengthening bullish momentum, with the $20.00 psychological level now within reach if current trajectory holds. Technical Analysis • AVAX experienced a sharp 8.14% decline from $20.14 to $18.48, with peak selling pressure when volume surged to 3.65 million. • Strong support established at $18.48, with price subsequently climbing steadily to $19.65, reclaiming 57.8% of losses. • An ascending channel pattern has formed with resistance at $19.76. • Notable high-volume support emerged at $18.48-$18.88. • Consistent higher lows over the past 14 hours indicate strengthening bullish momentum. • In the last hour, AVAX continued recovery with a 1.01% gain from $19.49 to $19.69. • Volume spikes occurred (45,299 and 64,948 units), coinciding with price surges to a local high of $19.76. • Current price action shows strengthening bullish sentiment with support levels around $19.53-$19.55.

The latest decline has managed to push this meme coin’s year-to-date losses to 41.5% again. Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have surged by nearly 78% as the sell-off intensified yesterday afternoon. On-chain data indicates that a significant amount of tokens are held by investors are held by investors with a cost basis ranging from $0.000012 to $0.000013. Hence, this may be a heavily defended price zone where trading volumes may skyrocket. This favors a bullish Shiba Inu price forecast in the near term as bulls will do their best to keep their positions afloat and in green territory to avoid a long squeeze. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can the #ShibArmy Keep the Price Above $0.00001200? The #ShibArmy, the community that backs this meme coin, is one of the strongest in the crypto space. Its social media accounts are followed by millions and more than 1.5 million accounts hold $SHIB at press time. In addition, the project recently launched the ShibaDAO – a decentralized governance entity that has effectively surrendered the project’s reins to the community. If the army closes ranks at this point, they could manage to keep the price up through a concerted effort. The daily chart shows that SHIB broke its trend line support in the past few days and has also dropped below its short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs). The price has found support at $0.00001200 for now and rose strongly during the Asian session as bulls seem determined to hold their ground at this level. SHIB could be pushed to retest its former trend line support from below. If it rejects it, we could draft a Shiba Inu price prediction of $0.00001050 as this is the nearest area where the token has found support after a bearish breakout below $0.00001200. This meme coin’s upside potential seems capped at the moment. However, Bitcoin’s path to new all-time highs has been paved lately. One meme coin stands to gain if BTC rises to $125,000 in the next few weeks. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is the name of one of the hottest crypto presales of the year . Its innovative rewards system tied to the performance of the top crypto has attracted nearly $7 million from investors already. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Hands Out Rewards Every Time Bitcoin Hits a Price Milestone BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is a fun and innovative way to profit from Bitcoin’s rally to new heights. The reward mechanism is quite simple. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, a new reward will be unlocked for every additional $25,000 that BTC adds to its price. The first milestone is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. Next up, once the price rises to $150,000, token holders will receive a direct Bitcoin airdrop. To buy this meme coin and start generating passive income once Bitcoin reaches new milestones, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

We’re proposing to lift the ban on offering crypto exchange traded notes (cETNs), to retail investors. Consumers would be informed of risks in the same way as when buying cryptoassets directly. https://t.co/myKza5dp9a #cryptoassets #CryptoETNs #CryptoRegulation #FCAGrowth pic.twitter.com/UbOXbhW2oc — Financial Conduct Authority (@TheFCA) June 6, 2025 If the plan goes ahead, retail investors in the UK would once again be able to buy crypto ETNs—something they haven’t been allowed to do since the 2021 ban . The FCA has put the change out for comment as part of a broader look at how to encourage digital-finance innovation while still protecting consumers. ETNs tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether could then list on FCA-approved markets such as the London Stock Exchange, giving everyday investors the same access professionals already enjoy. A Shift From Past Caution to Measured Access When the FCA originally introduced the ban on crypto derivatives and ETNs for retail investors in 2021, it did so on the grounds of consumer protection. At the time, the regulator warned that cryptoassets were “ill-suited for retail consumers,” citing concerns about high volatility, market manipulation, and a lack of reliable valuation. However, in its latest statement, the FCA acknowledges that the market has evolved. “This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK’s crypto industry,” said David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.” The proposed changes would apply only to crypto ETNs traded on FCA-approved investment exchanges. The broader ban on crypto derivatives, such as options and futures, for retail customers will remain in place. Safeguards and Rules for Retail Access Should the FCA lift the ban, the sale of crypto ETNs to retail investors would still be subject to strict conditions. Only products listed on a recognised investment exchange (RIE) would be permitted, and all firms offering them would need to comply with financial promotion rules. The rules seek to ensure investors grasp the risks. They call for plain-language disclosures and ban gimmicky incentives or misleading ads, much like the safeguards that already cover direct crypto purchases. Crypto ETNs function as bank-issued debt notes that track digital-asset prices, letting investors follow the market without holding the coins themselves. They’re already traded in the EU and the US, where demand for regulated crypto products keeps rising. Boosting the UK’s Crypto Ambitions The FCA’s proposal supports the UK government’s broader ambition to become a global hub for cryptoasset technology and innovation. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly stated his commitment to fostering a more competitive regulatory environment for digital finance in the UK. Industry leaders have welcomed the FCA’s willingness to revisit earlier restrictions. “This is a step in the right direction for UK crypto policy,” said one digital asset fund manager. “It gives investors more choice and shows the FCA is willing to adapt to a changing market.” The consultation period will remain open until later this year, with a final decision expected in early 2026. If approved, crypto ETNs could return to the UK retail market soon after, opening new regulated investment pathways for everyday investors seeking exposure to digital assets.

More so, the MACD line has begun to flatten, leaving room for trend reversal into a bullish crossover above the signal line—a potential early bull signal. Immediate resistance at $0.68 will be critical. Surpassing it would continue the falling wedge and fuel a move toward its $1.40 technical target—an upside of 110% from current levels. Failure to break resistance would put pressure on a key support zone at $0.60. A drop below that level could force another wedge retest—losing it would invalidate the structure entirely. In this case, the next key support lies 22% below current prices at $0.50. The Solana Ecosystem Could Soon Take the Spotlight Those who jumped to Cardano over alternative Layer-1s may be forced to reconsider as the Solana ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. The narrative has shifted with the arrival of Solaxy ($SOLX) , Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution. Solana has long lacked this capability, limiting its DeFi and cross-chain use case—until now. By processing transactions off-chain and finalizing them on Solana, Solaxy significantly reduces congestion and lowers transaction costs, while offering seamless interoperability across both blockchains. With almost $45 million in its ongoing presale , investors are already rallying behind the project. When demand for altcoins returns, it could be the one to reap fresh Solana ecosystem liquidity. There are just under 10 days before this phase ends, unlocking the untapped demand of exchanges. You can keep up with Solaxy on X and Telegram , or join the presale on the Solaxy website .

It buttressed Bitcoin’s exceptionalities in a recent Coin Report publication, shared in a Friday tweet . The $6 trillion asset manager discussed the facts, strengths, and weaknesses of the pioneering cryptocurrency, including its potential use case.Bitcoin As a Store of ValueFidelity branded Bitcoin as a potential store of value, a term used to classify assets that retain their purchasing power over time. Interestingly, this distinct quality is rare not just in the digital asset industry but in the global financial market, placing Bitcoin on an exclusive list.Bitcoin has continued to grow over the years, outperforming even the best asset classes globally. Notably, BTC has outpaced even gold, an asset considered the best store of value over the past five years. The leading cryptocurrency has increased by 951% within this timeframe compared to gold’s moderate 57% uptick.Meanwhile, Fidelity buttressed that Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value places it on a superior caliber than other cryptocurrencies. While others, like its closest competitor, Ethereum, have put in strong performances, none has done so on the same level and with the same conviction as the native token of the first fully decentralized electronic payment system.There Is Only One BitcoinFurthermore, the asset manager highlighted Bitcoin’s unique strengths of scarcity, decentralization, and security. For instance, there will only be 21 million of the asset that will ever exist, a demonstration of its finite nature.This limited cap, in addition to Bitcoin’s well-structured issuance rate, drives its value, establishing its role as an emerging store of value and aspiring monetary good. Meanwhile, with demand reaching insane levels, watchers have asserted that we will soon be out of Bitcoin to buy.Bitcoin is also decentralized, spurred by its proof-of-work consensus mechanism. With no singular or central control, the network achieves consensus through a voting process, thereby eliminating the need for intermediaries.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly difficult to attack or compromise. The growing number of nodes, miners, and the asset’s price have made it practically and cost-wise impossible for a single individual to control up to 51% of computing power. Bitcoin Hashrate and Price Rally Establishes Security Bitcoin Hashrate and Price Rally Establish Security Remarkably, this places Bitcoin on track to solve the blockchain trilemma, with its scalability drawdown being the only missing piece. For one, the Bitcoin network ranks as one of the slowest in the sector, with its decentralized nature playing a significant role in this regard. It can process just three to seven transactions per second compared to new chains like Solana, which has a TPS of 4,000.Essentially, Fidelity holds Bitcoin in high regard, projecting that its value will continue to rise in line with its growing utility and scarcity. While it did not predict the asset’s price trajectory, there are predictions that it would rally to $200,000 this year and $1.5 million in the next five years.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-06 15:40:21

Lightchain AI ends presale after raising $21m, launching Bonus Round at $0.007 amid surging demand and market traction. Lightchain AI has completed its full presale, making waves in the market and surprising many speculators. With all 15 stages successfully closed, the Bonus Round is now live at a fixed price of $0.007, bringing the total funds raised to nearly $21 million. This isn’t just buzz — it’s evidence of strong demand and precise execution. While projects like Aptos wait for renewed momentum, Lightchain AI is gaining real traction across wallets, dashboards, and developer communities. Its growth isn’t driven by temporary hype but by robust infrastructure and a presale strategy that has drawn the attention of serious early adopters. You might also like: Lightchain AI surpasses presale goals as whales shift focus from under perming assets Aptos faces community fatigue while searching for renewed engagement Aptos is seeing signs of community weariness setting in as it battles for engagement despite its initial promise. Although technically solid, the platform is not to be trusted: what everyone really wants is more transparency and more active development cycles. Unlike rollouts generating hype, Aptos has not been fully implemented to bring the kind of core component synergy that delights builders — think full integration across its validation layer, storage, and smart contract systems. Cross-chain infrastructure is not well utilized, which restricts the project’s expansion outside its native environment. Delays and ambiguity regarding access to public repositories have also left developers wary. Without public and transparent visibility into development progress and a more robust builder ecosystem, Aptos risks becoming irrelevant in a market that increasingly values openness and execution. Lightchain AI completes all 15 presale phases with surging speculative interest Lightchain AI has completed all 15 presale phases, raising over $21 million and entering its Bonus Round with surging speculative interest from both retail and institutional players. This excitement is fueled not only by strong presale performance but by Lightchain’s tangible ecosystem rollout. The platform’s interoperability features enable seamless integration with other blockchain networks, supporting cross-chain collaboration and data exchange. A $150,000 grant pool is already live, attracting developers to build dApps, tools, and infrastructure on top of the AI-enhanced Layer 1.

At the time of writing, XRP is priced at $2.18, having dropped 0.84% in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap While some traders hoped the altcoin had reached a bottom, its short-term momentum remains weak. However, a surge in accumulation by XRP whales—who collectively acquired nearly 900 million tokens worth approximately $1.9 billion—could help anchor the price above $2.00. This tug-of-war between whale accumulation and long-term holder (LTH) selling could define XRP’s near-term trajectory. Whether the coin stabilises or slides further will depend on the strength of the support zone now forming near $2.18. XRP whale activity hits $1.9 billion in two days In just 48 hours, addresses holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP absorbed 900 million tokens, data shows. At current market prices, this represents a capital inflow of $1.9 billion into XRP by a small group of large holders. This level of activity is significant because whale purchases are often seen as a sign of institutional or informed investor confidence in future price movement. Blockchain analysts have flagged this behaviour as a possible attempt to stabilise the token above the $2.00 psychological threshold. Historically, such coordinated buying tends to provide short-term price floors, even if broader market sentiment remains mixed. Despite this positive accumulation trend, XRP is not out of the woods. The ongoing downtrend since mid-May has yet to be reversed. If buying pressure continues at this scale, it could help offset the concurrent selling from long-term investors. Long-term holders begin cautious selling On-chain metrics show that XRP’s Liveliness indicator—a measure tracking whether long-held coins are being spent—has risen slightly. This suggests that some long-term holders (LTH) are selling into the recent price weakness. Though the selling appears modest so far, it reflects a dip in conviction among investors who previously held XRP through earlier volatility. Historically, when LTHs sell during a downturn, it can lead to further price erosion, especially if not countered by new demand. However, the limited scale of this selling means its effect may be muted for now. If whales maintain their aggressive accumulation pattern, they could absorb this supply without triggering additional losses. The next key price levels to watch are $2.02 and $1.94. If XRP fails to maintain the $2.18 level, a slide to $2.02 is likely. A further break below that could pull the token to $1.94, which would mark a full invalidation of the current support zone and signal continued bearish pressure. XRP must hold $2.12 or risk slipping to $1.94 Technical analysts note that XRP must hold the $2.18 level to attempt a breakout from its current downtrend. The next upside resistance sits at $2.27. A strong bounce from current levels, especially if supported by whale demand, could help XRP flip the trend and regain upward momentum. This would also help re-establish bullish sentiment, which has been dampened by the prolonged decline. However, the altcoin remains at a critical juncture. Should market conditions deteriorate or LTH selling intensify, whale activity alone may not be enough to prevent a further drop. The next few trading sessions will be decisive in determining whether XRP can build a recovery or extend its correction deeper into the $1 range.

Aave launched “Umbrella,” a new risk-management system to replace its Safety Module. AAVE price dropped ~5% to ~$250, testing critical Bollinger Band support near $255. According to on-chain tracker Lookonchain, two high-profile whales collectively purchased 29,739 AAVE tokens worth approximately $7.5 million on June 6. One wallet (0x372c) reportedly borrowed $5 million in USDC to pick up 19,608 AAVE. This move brought its total holdings to a staggering 280,673 AAVE, valued at $69.44 million. Meanwhile, another wallet (0xeBb4) borrowed $2.5 million in Aave’s native stablecoin, GHO, to buy 10,131 AAVE. That whale’s total holdings now stand at 120,513 AAVE, worth about $29.8 million. These large, leveraged purchases , which use loans from decentralized stablecoins, suggest that these institutional-level or highly confident players are positioning themselves for a medium- to long-term bullish run on AAVE.

ADA Price dropped by more than 7% this week. Many analysts question a $100 billion run this year. A 400% jump seems hard. That’s why big investors, or “whales,” are looking elsewhere for better gains. They turn to Unilabs Finance , which offers AI-driven tools. Unilabs is managing over $30 million in assets. Whales are looking for new opportunities, and the ADA price is moving between $0.86 and $0.62. The Cardano market cap may remain low in 2025. However, Unilabs Finance provides a clear road to potential 2x gains. ADA Price Prediction: Will Cardano Market Cap Hit $100B? ADA prices have steadily fallen during the last week. It keeps falling after small rises. It dropped by more than 7% in seven days. For most of the month, the token traded between $0.86 and $0.62. The $0.66 level serves as strong support. The ADA price dropped by $0.66 three times in one week. Even with the drop, some experts think a bounce could come soon. If ADA stays above $0.66, it might rise again. Some trading tools are showing buy signals. Right now, ADA is at $0.69. But reaching a $100 billion market cap this year seems unlikely. Most experts only see a 2x or 3x gain. Source : TradingView Cardano market cap jump seems unlikely, so whales are moving to Unilabs. It allows investors to buy UNIL at a $0.0062 presale price. Why Whales Are Moving to UNIL at $0.0062 Big investors are now shifting funds away from ADA price swings. They join Unilabs to find better profit opportunities. Unilabs provides four AI-driven funds: The AI Fund focuses on projects involving artificial intelligence. The BTC Fund owns Bitcoin and other layer-one tokens. The RWA Fund invests in tokenized real-world assets with regular payments. The Mining Fund derives revenue from cryptocurrency mining. It adjusts automatically using smart AI tools. It minimizes human mistakes and improves performance. So far, Unilabs has raised $2 million in USDT. Each UNIL token now sells for $0.0062. The next price is $0.0074. Early buyers get staking rewards and profit sharing. A live dashboard shows fund results in real-time. Many investors like this clear, simple setup. Finding Top Opportunities to Invest In With AI Market Pulse Unilabs Finance uses AI Market Pulse to identify top investment opportunities. This technology scans on-chain and off-chain data continuously. It identifies token trends before they boom Users gain clear insights into price movements and volume increases. AI Market Pulse also monitors social sentiment and whale behavior. It looks at the community’s thoughts towards a particular project and how big investors are looking at it. The system refreshes with new data every few minutes. Traders that follow these signs can get in early on profitable projects. It also indicates hazardous tokens to avoid. AI Market Pulse powers all four Unilabs funds. It helps make better trades and boosts returns. Final Words It’s unlikely that Cardano will reach a $100 billion market cap this year. ADA doesn’t have the push it needs. Whales know this and are switching to Unilabs. Unilabs’ AI-driven funds and transparent profit sharing have earned significant investor trust. Early investors are buying at $0.0062 per $UNIL before the next price of $0.0074. If you’re tired of ADA’s ups and downs, Unilabs Finance may be your better option. Act now before the presale ends.

Currently, the Tron price is attempting to surpass the current weekly high of $0.2775. If the Tron price crosses it, the crypto could rise above the $0.28 region. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Tron coin price has rallied by 0.1% on the weekly timeframe and 10.1% on the monthly level. The Tron price continues to show strength amid the ongoing market correction. Data from CryptoQuant also shows Tron’s 50-SMA and 100-SMA active addresses have hit a new all-time high of over 2.4 million. This massive increase favors buying pressure, supporting a Tron price surge. Going forward, Altwolf forecasts the price of Tron could surge to $0.32 if it follows its current ascending channel. Lennaert Snyder, another market commentator, thinks the Tron price may go as high as $1.20 in the coming months. Unilabs Finance, the AI-based DeFi project gaining momentum The upcoming project, Unilabs Finance, is looking to take investment in the crypto space to a new level. The platform merges AI with crypto investment strategies, creating smart, adaptive portfolios. As the global DeFi market is expected to reach $232 billion by 2030, Unilabs is leading the charge as the next big thing in the DeFi space. What sets Unilabs apart is its AI-driven investment funds, which automate exposure to high-growth sectors like BTC, AI tokens, and real-world assets (RWAs), making portfolio management seamless for users. With real yield potential, AI-powered fund strategies, and a strong community push, Unilabs is a smart bet on the future of AI-integrated investment. Unilabs is currently in the cryptocurrency ICO phase, and its UNIL coin is trading at $0.0062. Thanks to a large influx of buyers, the project has raised over $2.3 million. Unilabs Finance has seen faster traction than ADA’s early ICO phase, offering utility, 122% APY staking rewards, and governance rights. Analysts predict that if adoption trends continue, UNIL could reach $0.10 by the end of 2025, driven by rising user demand, platform growth, and limited token supply. Why the new DeFi crypto is gaining investors’ attention While the Ethereum and Tron prices aim for ambitious price targets, Unilabs offers a rare opportunity for early adopters seeking exponential returns. Its AI-powered ecosystem, presale structure, and access to curated investment funds create a unique value proposition. As market attention intensifies, Unilabs could become the surprise giant of 2025. Getting in early might just be the smartest move in the DeFi market right now.

Heavy selling by large holders and recent market turmoil have dimmed the memecoin’s outlook. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor attention with its innovative DeFi lending model. Currently in phase 5 of its presale, MUTM tokens sell at $0.03, offering a 100% return at the $0.06 launch price.

As Dogecoin falters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a top crypto to buy now, promising robust utility and growth. Dogecoin’s downward spiral Dogecoin is grappling with intense selling pressure. A recent 11% price drop pushed it to $0.204, the lowest since early May. Large holders dumped 60 million tokens, worth $12 million, in just two days. This sell-off aligns with a broader crypto market dip, erasing $700 million in value. Technical indicators confirm the bearish trend, with the 20-day EMA crossing below the 200-day EMA. Trading volume spiked 50%, signaling strong sell-off momentum. If this continues, Dogecoin could test the $0.10 support level. Investors are now questioning whether Dogecoin can recover, prompting many to explore alternative crypto investments like Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, but the real draw is the guaranteed 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Analysts predict MUTM could soar to $3 post-launch, offering a staggering 9,900% return. A $100,000 giveaway for presale participants adds extra incentive.

This move, disclosed in a recent S-3 filing, marks another significant step for the company, which recently concluded a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal. The filing reveals plans to issue up to 84.6 million shares of common stock. However, the offering will not take effect until the SEC grants approval.Bitcoin Treasury Deal and Future AcquisitionsTrump Media’s decision to file for additional securities follows its recent involvement in acquiring Bitcoin. Last week, the company announced a Bitcoin treasury deal valued at $2.3 billion. This move aims to strengthen Trump Media’s capital position, as well as support its future expansion. Notably, the company had previously denied reports suggesting it would raise a larger $3 billion fund for Bitcoin investments. Despite this, the current filing indicates the company’s intention to continue acquiring the cryptocurrency. With this, it positions itself alongside other firms like Strategy , which have adopted similar Bitcoin acquisition strategies.Meanwhile, Trump Media’s growing interest in Bitcoin signals a broader trend among companies exploring ways to integrate the digital currency into their portfolios. Companies such as Marathon Digital and Metaplanet have also engaged in Bitcoin acquisitions.Interestingly, new entrants have emerged. Specifically, KULR Technology entered the scene in December 2024 with $21 million worth of Bitcoin. Acurx Pharmaceuticals and Hoth Therapeutics also announced plans to acquire BTC this year. In addition, gold mining firm Bluebird recently became the latest entrant.Expansion Plans and Capital Markets AccessDevin Nunes, the CEO and President of Trump Media, emphasized the company's focus on securing capital for rapid growth. He mentioned that the capital raised through these initiatives would provide the flexibility needed to acquire valuable assets and increase the company's customer base. This, in turn, is expected to enable Trump Media to tap into capital markets when most advantageous. Nunes highlighted that the company's goal is to ensure financial independence while accelerating its growth trajectory, which is increasingly dependent on acquiring digital assets like Bitcoin.Furthermore, Trump Media's involvement in crypto extends beyond just holding Bitcoin. The company is also exploring the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which could expand its presence in the crypto market. This is in line with other companies offering similar financial products related to Bitcoin.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-06 15:57:32

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) aims to entrench itself as a crucial part of this digitization with useful solutions that have real-world utility. One of the projects in the DeFi space that aims to lead this revolution is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Recently, the project announced it had passed a Certik audit. Let us examine why that matters. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Certik Audit Risk control is essential to the success of the Defi industry, which does not enjoy the same level of centralized regulation as the legacy financial system. To assure participants that a DeFi protocol is safe and secure, the Certik audit is an essential tool. Certik’s audit services are held in high regard in the DeFi world. They are often used to distinguish between safe and unsafe projects. A Certik audit signals that the Mutuum Finance protocol can protect funds on its smart contracts. With the potential to attract billions of dollars’ worth of liquidity, the Mutuum Finance team has left nothing to chance. Besides the Certik audit, the team has also established a lucrative bug bounty program. This program is designed to encourage experts to examine the code on a regular basis and report any vulnerabilities when they identify them. In addition, the team plans to conduct its own regular surveillance of the protocol to ensure that all deposits are always safe. Protection From Low-Value Assets In the crypto world, assets are not built the same. Some crypto assets have low liquidity and are prone to volatile price movements. To protect the long-term stability of the ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will vet such assets, and they will not be allowed on the protocol. By vetting the assets that join the protocol, this will also control the complexity of the protocol’s code. The reason for this is that the more assets a protocol supports, the more complex it becomes, which increases the gas fees for everyone. Vetting assets will essentially keep costs low, giving Mutuum Finance a competitive advantage in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance also plans to take other measures to control layer costs. That will include cutting back on the calldata, which is one of the biggest sources of transaction costs in DeFi. For instance, since the protocol will support a limited number of assets, it can use a unique compact identifier of 16 bits instead of the full 160-bit address. How Users Can Earn On Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is primarily a lending protocol where lenders deposit assets and earn passive income on those assets. The interest rate they earn on their assets is determined by a pool’s utilization rate. Mutuum Finance users can also participate as borrowers via over-collateralization. The third option is to participate as liquidators. When participating as liquidators, they will purchase debt that falls below a set level of collateralization at a discount. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a decentralized stablecoin that can be collateralized using multi-asset positions. Traditionally, stablecoins have been backed by single asset vaults where each collateral is in a separate position. The value of the stablecoin will be pegged to the USD and will be maintained through arbitrage. The arbitrage process will also provide an avenue for earning. Unlike other stablecoins, the Mutuum Finance stablecoin will be minted as a loan, which means that holders will pay interest on it. Additionally, holders will have to overcollateralize their positions. That could potentially make it one of the most sought-after decentralized stablecoins. The result is that it could lead to a massive boost in liquidity for the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Is A Roaring Success The ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been quite successful so far. It has raised over $10 million from over 11,700 investors so far. The presale, which is in phase 5, has a token price of $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. Surprisingly, the pace of the presale has shot up recently, with over 25% of the phase 5 tokens having been sold less than a week after it launched. A major catalyst for this is the Certik audit. Additionally, market opportunities are drying up elsewhere. 2025 has been an exciting year for crypto investors, and the excitement is set to go high as MUTM tokens take over the crypto space. Purchasing your presale tokens at the current price of $0.03 is one of the best crypto investment decisions you could make in 2025.

FCA said the proposed change would allow individual consumers to access crypto ETNs, provided the products are listed on FCA-recognized exchanges. The regulator revealed that the move aims to support the growth of the UK’s crypto industry. The agency also acknowledged that its promotion rules will still apply. The restriction has existed since 2021 and previously limited access to professional investors only. FCA’s proposal aims to support crypto in the UK 🇬🇧 The FCA will lift the ban on Bitcoin and crypto ETNs for retail investors in the UK! pic.twitter.com/WGXPqTx0Y8 — Jordan Walker (@JayW132) June 6, 2025 The FCA began prohibiting the selling, marketing, and distribution of crypto derivatives and crypto ETNs to retail customers in 2019. The regulator updated its position in March 2024 to allow RIEs to list crypto asset-backed ETNs for professional investors only – restricted to entities such as investment firms and credit institutions. It also added stringent controls to ensure orderly trading and investor protection. Ian Taylor, board advisor at CryptoUK, noted that the UK had been an outlier on ETNs till its recent lift on the ban. He hopes the move will improve consumer protections and promised to continue making the case for lifting the ban on retail investors from accessing highly regulated derivative products. Diego Ballon Ossio, partner at British law firm Clifford Chance, argued that the agency’s initiative is aligned with the UK’s ambition to position itself as a sophisticated jurisdiction in the crypto sector. He also noted that the move will unlock exposure to crypto assets for retail investors and signal that the UK is embracing digital assets. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.” -David Geale, Executive Director of Payments and Digital Assets at FCA. The UK Treasury acknowledged that crypto exchanges will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms under the proposed rules, with transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience requirements. The regulator also maintained that its rules aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value, irrespective of the value of the backing asset. FCA also urged customers to ensure they know how backing assets are managed. The agency is also working on a new version of its crypto regulatory framework. FCA requested public feedback on proposed stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody regulations last week. Geale said the regulator supports innovation while ensuring market integrity and trust. FCA also noted that the deadline for feedback is July 31, and it will publish the final rules in 2026 Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden noted that the Bank of England will publish a complimentary consultation paper later this year for stablecoins that expect to operate at a systemic scale. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves also suggested plans for a comprehensive regulatory regime to make the country a leader in the crypto space. UK wants to become a global crypto hub Data revealed that the UK is leading the world in increasing cryptocurrency ownership among its population in 2025, surpassing economies such as the U.S. Jamie Jefferson, senior associate at law firm Ashurst, mentioned that the FCA’s latest proposals are a bold step toward making the UK a hub for responsible crypto innovation. Another UK law firm, Wiggin, suggested that the UK is applying the full weight of securities regulation to digital assets rather than opting for a light-touch regime similar to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ). The government agency also introduced new requirements for companies providing crypto custody to ensure they are secured and can be easily accessed at any time. The proposal also seeks to reduce the likelihood and impact of firm failures across regulated companies offering stablecoin issuance and digital asset custody. The Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden argued during the UK House of Commons debate that as finance evolves, so must the rules to ensure transparency in elections. Member of Parliament Sarah Olney highlighted concerns over political parties accepting crypto donations. Olney stressed the need to ensure that donations that do not come from an identifiable source must be returned. Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, had previously announced that the party accepts cryptocurrency contributions from eligible donors.

This means there is ample money to be made by investing in and backing AI cloud computing. But most AI cloud computing providers like AWS and CoreWeave are walled gardens, owned by large corporations or big capitalists. For the ordinary man, the entry barrier is so high, it is impossible to enter. Exabits RWA approach means that each token will offer fractional ownership of actual computing resources that are not only easily accessible, but liquid too. Using blockchain will bring transparency, allowing clear and unobstructed verification of computing resource use. But in the end, it all boils down to one thing: owning assets that give exposure to GPU power in an industry that is set to appreciate in value over time. No speculation, no hype. Just tokens representing a strong business that is growing and swelling. Why Exabits Is A Class Apart Look at any AI cloud computing firm, and you will find claims of using high-end GPU processors. This holds true for Exabits also, with advanced processors like NVIDIA GB200 and H200. But there is more to Exabits than just raw processing power. The team behind Exabits has been able to tweak GPUs to pull every ounce of processing power possible. Extensive hardware testing has led to a 99% uptime, far more than its competitors. Exabits even has its own dedicated data centers, unlike resellers who buy GPU power, repackage it as their own, and sell it. When Exabits says it is “The backbone of AI Infrastructure”, it really means what it says. It is the Layer Zero, the foundation on which AI cloud computing stands. Fractional Ownership: You Grow With Exabits When it comes to AI cloud computing, Exabits is not just another service provider. It is “the provider”. A growing list of clients, including globally recognized firms, goes to show Exabits’ quality of services. Projected annual revenue from enterprise clients is 12 million for this year , but this may jump significantly in the coming years. With strong financials, top backers like Hack VC, Portal Ventures, and Protocol Labs, increasing revenue, and an expanding client base, Exabits has a solid business with real services. Meld that with its RWA strategy, the Exabits token can be the key to unlocking democratic AI cloud computing ownership. With a planned airdrop for the Exabits token in session, interested individuals can complete the set tasks early on and qualify for free tokens.

Speaking at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on June 5, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is currently in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins as a potential payment method, calling the technology “super interesting.” The exec highlighted stablecoins for their practical utility in global business operations. While Uber has signaled crypto curiosity in the past, stating as early as 2021 that it was open to accepting digital assets, the current focus appears to be more pragmatic, zeroing in on real-world use cases that could improve the company’s operational efficiency. This shift comes at a time when regulatory clarity is taking shape, particularly in the US, where the bipartisan GENIUS Act aims to establish a clear legal framework for payment stablecoins. The act coincides with similar moves in Europe under MiCA and emerging regulations across Asia. This growing regulatory certainty has prompted traditional financial institutions such as Citigroup and Wells Fargo to explore stablecoin initiatives. In April, Mastercard also launched a stablecoin payment system, partnering with OKX and Nuvei to enable consumers to spend and merchants to accept stablecoins globally. The initiative reflects growing regulatory clarity and includes integration with major crypto platforms like MetaMask, Kraken, and Binance for seamless, end-to-end transactions. Other companies, including Stripe, have also revealed ongoing talks with banks to leverage stablecoin rails for commerce. For Uber, a platform that operates across more than 70 countries and 15,000 cities, stablecoins could offer a cost-efficient solution to settle driver payments, handle customer transactions, and bypass traditional currency exchange complexities. Whether Uber moves beyond its exploratory phase remains to be seen.

The shares were bought for $373.4 million and distributed across Ark’s Innovation, Next Generation Internet, and Fintech Innovation funds. This occurred shortly after Circle was listed on the New York Stock Exchange . Circle’s First Day on the Stock Market Draws Attention On June 5, Circle began trading under the symbol CRCL on the NYSE. Its share price jumped from $31 to a high of $96, closing at $83.23. The strong start shows investors are confident in the company and its future. Before its recent successful IPO this year, it had tried to go public two times before. The first time was through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021. However, the company faced delays in completing the SEC qualification process, which resulted in the postponement of its public listing . The company tried again in 2024 with a confidential filing. Concerns about market conditions, especially due to trade tensions under President Trump, raised doubts earlier this year. Nevertheless, the stablecoin issuer finally completed its initial public offering in June. Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO, described this development as a sign that the world is ready to move toward a new financial system built on the internet. Ark Invest’s Strong Belief in Circle Ark Invest quickly acted on Circle’s debut by purchasing many shares across three of its most well-known funds. The size of this investment shows that Ark sees real value in Circle’s role in the digital finance world. Circle shares are now among the top holdings in Ark’s funds. However, Ark has a rule that no single company can make up more than 10% of a fund. This approach helps keep the funds balanced and lowers risk. This is important since Circle’s stock is still new and moving. Notably, Ark has done this with companies like Coinbase and eToro when these firms were newly made public. This pattern shows Ark’s plan to support new and innovative companies as they start trading publicly. Ark Adjusts Portfolio to Back Circle Ark made other moves on the same day it bought Circle shares as part of its portfolio management. The investment company sold some of its spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) from the Next Generation Internet fund, worth about $17.1 million. Even with this sale, Ark’s Bitcoin ETF remains its fund’s top holding. The firm also sold shares in Coinbase, Robinhood, and Block, founded by Jack Dorsey. Interestingly, the Robinhood sale came shortly after Ark bought $10 million worth of its shares in early May. These trades show that Ark is carefully adjusting its holdings to make space for new investments while keeping its funds in line with its rules.

On the one hand, we had Circle, long a leading crypto company, hurtling to IPO and making bank. Its shares were priced at $110 at press time (up from $31 Wednesday), leading many to expect a summer and fall of crypto-themed IPOs. On the other, we saw HyperLiquid trader James Wynn go from having a $100 million BTC position one day to a massive loss the next. (Kids, beware the big, bad leverage monster). Most of the market portents looked good, though. Crypto money-raising season was in full swing.

MicroStrategy, the software intelligence company that has become synonymous with institutional Bitcoin investment, is making headlines again. The company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has just finalized the pricing of a significant stock offering aimed squarely at boosting its already massive Bitcoin holdings. This move underscores their unwavering commitment to their unique Corporate Bitcoin strategy. MicroStrategy’s Latest Financial Maneuver: The STRD Stock Offering In a significant development for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency market, MicroStrategy announced the pricing of its public offering of STRD preferred stock. According to a press release on their official website, the offering is valued at a substantial $979.7 million. The shares of STRD preferred stock were priced at $85 per share. This financial maneuver is not just about raising capital; it’s strategically aligned with MicroStrategy’s core business direction – accumulating Bitcoin. The press release explicitly states that the net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes, which notably includes the acquisition of additional Bitcoin. This continuous pursuit of Bitcoin distinguishes MicroStrategy from most other publicly traded companies. Key Details of the STRD Stock Offering: Total Offering Value: $979.7 million Price Per Share: $85 Stock Type: STRD Preferred Stock Dividend: 10% annually, non-cumulative Primary Use of Proceeds: General corporate purposes, including further Bitcoin Investment The non-cumulative nature of the dividend means that if the company doesn’t pay a dividend in a given year, that dividend obligation doesn’t carry over to future years. The 10% annual rate offers a fixed return to investors in this preferred stock, providing a different risk/reward profile compared to the company’s common stock or direct Bitcoin exposure. Why MicroStrategy Bets Big on Bitcoin? MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has pioneered the strategy of holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Their rationale is rooted in the belief that Bitcoin serves as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies, which they see as susceptible to inflation and devaluation. They view Bitcoin as a long-term investment that can protect and grow shareholder value in a macroeconomic environment they perceive as uncertain. Their approach is not without its critics, given the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. However, MicroStrategy has consistently doubled down on this strategy, using various methods – including debt offerings, stock sales, and convertible notes – to fund their MicroStrategy Bitcoin acquisitions. Benefits of MicroStrategy’s Strategy (from their perspective): Inflation Hedge: Positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation. Store of Value: Believing Bitcoin is a digital form of gold, a reliable long-term store of value. Shareholder Value: Aiming to enhance shareholder returns through potential Bitcoin price appreciation. Market Differentiation: Setting the company apart in the tech sector with a unique treasury strategy. What Does This STRD Stock Offering Mean for Bitcoin and Investors? This significant capital raise by MicroStrategy, explicitly earmarked for potential Bitcoin purchases, is generally viewed positively by the Bitcoin community. It represents continued institutional demand for the cryptocurrency, absorbing supply from the market. Given MicroStrategy’s track record as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, any substantial purchase could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, particularly in the short term. For investors, the offering of STRD Stock provides another way to gain exposure to MicroStrategy and indirectly to Bitcoin, albeit through a preferred stock structure with fixed dividends rather than direct equity appreciation tied solely to the company’s operational performance or Bitcoin price swings. This move also highlights the evolving landscape of corporate finance, where companies are exploring unconventional assets like Bitcoin for treasury management. While MicroStrategy remains the most prominent example, its continued large-scale acquisitions could inspire other corporations to consider similar strategies, further driving Corporate Bitcoin adoption. Challenges and Considerations While the strategy has seen periods of significant success coinciding with Bitcoin bull runs, it also exposes MicroStrategy to the cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility. Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price directly impact the company’s balance sheet and can influence its stock price, creating a unique risk profile for MicroStrategy Stock . Furthermore, raising nearly a billion dollars through a stock offering adds to the company’s capital structure. The long-term success of this particular offering, and MicroStrategy’s overall strategy, depends heavily on the future performance of Bitcoin and the company’s ability to manage its growing balance sheet and debt obligations. Actionable Insights for the Reader For those interested in this development, here are a few points to consider: Monitor MicroStrategy’s Filings: Keep an eye on SEC filings (like Form 8-K) for official confirmation of Bitcoin purchases made with the proceeds. Observe Bitcoin Price Action: While not the sole driver, MicroStrategy’s purchases can influence short-term market dynamics. Evaluate Your Own Strategy: MicroStrategy’s approach is aggressive. Consider if direct Bitcoin investment, investing in MSTR common stock, or potentially the STRD preferred stock aligns with your own risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Informed on Corporate Adoption: MicroStrategy’s actions are a bellwether for broader corporate interest in Bitcoin. Follow news on other companies exploring similar paths. In Conclusion: A Bold Bet Continues MicroStrategy’s decision to price a nearly billion-dollar STRD preferred stock offering to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions is a clear reaffirmation of their commitment to their unique treasury strategy. As the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, their actions send a strong signal to the market about continued institutional interest and belief in the long-term value of the cryptocurrency. This move provides capital for more Bitcoin Investment and offers investors another structured way to participate in the MicroStrategy story. While risks associated with Bitcoin volatility remain, MicroStrategy is forging ahead, betting big on a future where digital assets play a central role in corporate finance.

Qubetics, ARB, and XRP Could Be the Top Cryptos to Invest in for Short Term",https://thecoinrise.com/rising-momentum-qubetics-arb-and-xrp-could-be-the-top-cryptos-to-invest-in-for-short-term/,"Developers, traders, and blockchain analysts are constantly on the hunt for assets with solid fundamentals, compelling use cases, and short-term upside potential. With promising ecosystems and continuous development, three blockchain projects have recently stood out: Qubetics , Arbitrum (ARB), and Ripple (XRP). They are converging on one critical factor that sets them apart—rising real-world adoption paired with technological innovation. Whether it’s Qubetics tackling blockchain interoperability, Arbitrum accelerating Ethereum scalability, or XRP making waves in institutional finance, these platforms may be the top cryptos to invest in for short-term gains . Qubetics: Powering the Web3 Interoperability Revolution At the core of Qubetics lies a single ambition—true interoperability. This blockchain project isn’t just building another network; it’s engineering a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies disparate systems across the blockchain ecosystem. With seamless integration across Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, including compatibility with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and newer DApp ecosystems, Qubetics provides the infrastructure required for frictionless cross-chain communication. This level of interoperability isn’t a theoretical concept. Qubetics will enable real-time asset transfers, data communication, and token functionality across multiple networks. For developers, it eliminates the silos that have traditionally fragmented the blockchain space. For users, it paves the way for broader DApp utility and seamless cross-platform access. More than a technological proposition, this evolution enhances blockchain composability—the ability to combine decentralized applications and protocols in novel ways. This could be the catalyst developers and enterprises have been waiting for, and it’s a key reason Qubetics is being recognized as a top crypto to invest in for short-term positioning. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Numbers Behind the Momentum Momentum around Qubetics isn’t merely speculative. Its crypto presale metrics paint a picture of accelerating traction: In Stage 37, tokens are going for $0.3370, and the project has already pulled in more than $17.7 million in funding. With over 27,500 holders on board and 515 million $TICS tokens snapped up, it’s a strong signal that the community sees serious potential in what Qubetics is building. This solid financial backing reflects growing community support and increasing developer interest. Growth Projection: What Happens If You Enter Now? Qubetics is closing in on its final presale phase, with just 10 million $TICS tokens left at $0.3370. With the listing projected at $0.40, buyers now could lock in nearly 20% gains. After slashing total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion and boosting community allocation to 38.55%, Qubetics is building scarcity and putting control in the hands of users. Demand’s heating up, and momentum suggests a breakout is coming. The window is narrow—this is the last shot before launch. A $3,000 allocation today would get you approximately 8,902 $TICS tokens. At listing, they’d be worth $3,560.80, representing a gain of $560.80. Here’s what that bag could yield if certain price targets are achieved: At $1: $3,000 / $0.3370 = ~8,902 tokens → Value = $8,902 → 196% ROI At $5: 8,902 tokens × $5 = $44,510 → 1,383% ROI At $6: Value = $53,412 → 1,679% ROI At $10: Value = $89,020 → 2,866% ROI At $15: Value = $133,530 → 4,349% ROI These scenarios, while optimistic, are modeled on the assumption of continued adoption and successful mainnet execution. As always, price performance depends on broader market conditions, regulatory developments, and ecosystem adoption. Arbitrum: Scaling Ethereum Without Sacrificing Security Arbitrum has rapidly become one of the most used L2 networks, driving significant on-chain activity. Its developer-friendly design and low fees have attracted hundreds of decentralized applications. Recent data from L2Beat shows that Arbitrum consistently leads in Total Value Locked (TVL) among all Layer 2 platforms. What makes Arbitrum especially attractive as a top crypto to invest in for short-term gains is its expanding ecosystem. The launch of Arbitrum Stylus—enabling support for programming languages like Rust and C++—marks a critical step in bringing traditional Web2 developers into the fold. The protocol has also initiated DAO governance, allowing ARB token holders to influence network upgrades and fund ecosystem growth through the Arbitrum Foundation’s treasury. Ripple (XRP): Institutional Finance and Legal Clarity Fuel a New Wave While XRP has long been a mainstay in discussions around digital payments, its trajectory in 2025 has taken on renewed significance. The resolution of key legal challenges in the United States has breathed new life into the project. Ripple Labs’ partial victory in its legal battle with the SEC has added a layer of regulatory clarity that few other crypto assets currently enjoy. This legal momentum is timely. The industry is watching for the potential approval of XRP-based ETFs or broader inclusion in institutional portfolios. Such developments could have short-term impacts on price momentum and long-term implications for adoption. Beyond legal wins, XRP continues to offer a compelling use case: near-instant cross-border payments with minimal fees. With liquidity corridors opening in Asia and Latin America, XRP’s role in the evolving digital asset economy appears far from over. These short-term developments solidify its existence as a top crypto to invest in for short-term positioning. Conclusion: Top Cryptos to Invest in for Short-Term Gains Each of the three tokens discussed brings a unique catalyst that positions it as a top crypto to invest in for short-term gains. Qubetics is redefining interoperability through an aggregated Web3 chain architecture. Arbitrum continues to scale Ethereum without sacrificing security or developer usability. Lastly, XRP benefits from newfound legal clarity and deepening institutional use cases. These strengths, when combined with measurable traction, community activity, and real-world application, provide solid grounds for considering them among the best positioned for short-term performance. Whether building the infrastructure of tomorrow or enabling seamless payments today, these projects remain critical to blockchain’s ongoing evolution. As always, market participation carries risks—volatility, regulatory shifts, and technological hurdles remain ever-present. Engaging with these assets requires due diligence and a clear understanding of the broader market landscape.

The recent announcement regarding Otonomi funding is no exception. Otonomi, a company at the forefront of applying blockchain technology to the often-complex world of freight insurance, has successfully closed a substantial funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in their innovative approach. What is Otonomi and Why is Blockchain Insurance Gaining Traction? Otonomi is building a blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize freight insurance. Traditionally, freight insurance claims can be a lengthy and cumbersome process, often involving significant paperwork, manual verification, and potential disputes. This is where the need for a more efficient, transparent, and automated system becomes clear. The integration of blockchain technology offers a compelling solution. Blockchain insurance leverages the core principles of distributed ledgers: immutability, transparency, and automation through smart contracts. For freight insurance, this means: Increased Transparency: All parties involved (shipper, carrier, insurer, broker) can potentially view the same real-time data regarding cargo movement and status. Enhanced Trust: The tamper-proof nature of the blockchain ensures data integrity. Automation: Smart contracts can automatically trigger payouts based on predefined, verifiable events (like a delay beyond a certain threshold). This move towards blockchain in insurance, particularly in niche areas like freight, represents a significant step forward for the broader insurtech landscape. How Does Otonomi’s Parametric Insurance Work? A key component of Otonomi’s offering is Parametric insurance . Unlike traditional indemnity insurance, which pays out based on the actual loss incurred (requiring extensive claims adjustment), parametric insurance pays out a predetermined amount based on the occurrence of a specific, measurable event. In Otonomi’s case, their focus is on parametric cargo delay insurance. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Define the Trigger: The policy is set up with a clear, objective trigger event. For cargo delay, this might be ‘arrival exceeding scheduled time by X hours’ or ‘deviation from planned route exceeding Y miles’. Use External Data: Otonomi’s platform likely integrates with external data sources (oracles) that provide real-time, verifiable information about the cargo’s location and timing (e.g., GPS data, port timestamps). Automated Payout: When the external data confirms that the predefined trigger event has occurred, a smart contract automatically initiates the payout to the policyholder. This process dramatically reduces the time and effort involved in filing and processing claims, moving from potentially weeks or months down to days, or even hours, once the trigger is met and verified on the blockchain. The Significance of the Otonomi Funding Round The news that Otonomi has secured $3.4 million in funding is a strong indicator of investor confidence in their technology and business model. This round was led by ATX Ventures, a firm known for investing in promising technology companies. The participation of other notable investors, including GSR Ventures and Greenlight Re Innovations, further validates Otonomi’s potential within both the tech and insurance sectors. ATX Ventures leading the round suggests they see significant scalability and market potential in Otonomi’s solution for the freight industry. The involvement of Greenlight Re Innovations, the venture arm of a reinsurance company, is particularly noteworthy, indicating that established players in the insurance world are actively exploring and investing in blockchain-based solutions like Otonomi’s. This level of investment provides Otonomi with the necessary capital to accelerate its development and market penetration efforts. Fueling Growth: How the Funding Will Be Used According to reports, the primary use of the newly acquired funds will be to expand Otonomi’s platform. This expansion could encompass several key areas vital for growth in the freight insurance market: Technology Development: Further enhancing the blockchain platform, improving smart contract capabilities, integrating with more data sources, and developing user interfaces. Product Expansion: Potentially adding more types of parametric triggers or expanding coverage beyond just delay to other verifiable events impacting freight. Market Reach: Investing in sales and marketing efforts to onboard more freight forwarders, shippers, and insurance partners onto the platform. Team Growth: Hiring talent across engineering, sales, operations, and support to manage the scaling business. Expanding the platform is crucial for Otonomi to handle increased volume, offer more sophisticated products, and integrate seamlessly with the complex logistics and insurance ecosystems. The Broader Impact: What This Means for Insurtech Funding and Adoption Otonomi’s successful funding round contributes to a growing trend of Insurtech funding , specifically within innovative areas like blockchain and parametric models. This investment landscape reflects a broader recognition that the insurance industry is ripe for technological disruption. Here’s why this is important: Validation for Blockchain: It demonstrates that investors see tangible, commercial applications for blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies, particularly in enterprise solutions that require trust and automation. Push for Efficiency: The demand for faster, more transparent, and less dispute-prone insurance processes is driving investment towards solutions like Otonomi’s. Industry Collaboration: The involvement of traditional insurance/reinsurance players in the funding round highlights a willingness within the established industry to collaborate with and invest in disruptive startups. This funding round is not just a win for Otonomi; it’s a positive signal for the entire insurtech sector, particularly those leveraging emerging technologies to solve real-world problems in traditional markets like freight logistics. Benefits of Otonomi’s Approach Otonomi’s blockchain-based parametric freight insurance offers compelling benefits for various stakeholders: For Shippers & Freight Forwarders: Faster claims payouts, greater certainty on policy terms and triggers, reduced administrative burden. For Insurers & Brokers: Reduced claims processing costs, minimized fraud risk due to verifiable data, ability to offer innovative products. For the Ecosystem: Increased transparency across the supply chain, fostering greater trust and efficiency. Potential Challenges Ahead Despite the promising funding and technology, Otonomi, like any innovator, will face challenges. These could include: Industry Adoption: Encouraging a traditionally conservative industry to fully embrace new technology and change established workflows. Regulatory Landscape: Navigating varying insurance regulations across different jurisdictions. Data Integration: Ensuring reliable and secure integration with diverse external data sources. Education: Helping potential clients and partners understand the nuances of blockchain and parametric insurance. Overcoming these hurdles will be key to Otonomi’s long-term success and widespread adoption. In Conclusion: A Bright Horizon for Blockchain in Freight Insurance The successful Otonomi funding round marks a significant milestone for the company and for the broader application of blockchain technology in the insurance sector. By focusing on parametric cargo delay insurance, Otonomi is addressing a specific pain point in the complex world of freight logistics with a solution that promises speed, transparency, and efficiency. Backed by notable investors, Otonomi is now well-positioned to expand its platform, enhance its technology, and increase its footprint in the market. This development is a positive indicator for the future of blockchain insurance and reinforces the potential of Insurtech funding to drive innovation in traditional industries. As Otonomi grows, it will be fascinating to watch how their success influences the adoption of similar technologies across the freight insurance landscape and beyond, potentially setting a new standard for claims processing in the digital age.

He pointed out that distributing free money to the public was ultimately unsustainable. Americans probably will not get a universal basic income as long as President Donald Trump’s AI czar has a say. However, UBI has edged its way into the national dialogue in recent months. Tech executives Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg voiced support for UBI in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Democratic candidate during the 2020 presidential campaign, Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur, proclaimed that his administration would provide a universal basic income of $1K a month for every adult if elected, a policy he called “The Freedom Dividend.” However, Joe Biden (then the vice president) said there was a better way forward than some guaranteed government check with no strings attached. Sacks says AI’s future is a ‘Rorschach test’ and people see what they want Very weird, and telling, tweet: Sacks says that the future of AI is a Rorschach test, and describes what he thinks the left sees, but then says nothing about what he, or other RWers, think an AI-dominated society should look like. pic.twitter.com/WsPbW0pqLD — James Surowiecki (@JamesSurowiecki) June 5, 2025 According to Sacks, the future of AI had become a Rorschach test where everyone saw what they wanted. He added that the Left envisioned a post-economic order in which people stopped working and instead received government benefits, putting millions of American citizens on welfare. Sacks previously said the political consensus in the U.S. was that able-bodied people who could find a job should work. He, however, added that moving off that consensus to indulge the elite ideology of UBI was not helpful in the long run. Yang emphasized that a government-backed UBI program was necessary to support American workers threatened by automation and inequality. However, many dismissed Yang’s predictions as a pipe dream at best and fear-mongering at worst, and his candidacy quickly faded. Republicans in Arizona also voted to ban basic income programs in the state last year, and similar opposition efforts have gained popularity in Iowa, Texas, and South Dakota. Lawmakers in several states argued that although AI could perform some roles, the checks increased reliance on the government and discouraged recipients from working. “AI should empower American workers to achieve more, not become an excuse for permanent handouts. The only “post-economic order” we need is one where Washington stops looting productivity through red tape and misguided priorities.” -DOGEai Klarna’s CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, believes that although investing in the quality of human support was the way for his company’s future, he expected to reduce his workforce by at least 500 employees in the coming year when Klarna’s technology improved enough. He also predicted he could downsize even faster as AI tools improve, very likely within 12 months. Munyikwa confirms that companies are hiring fewer people for AI-doable tasks Revelio Labs economist Zanele Munyikwa observed that the share of AI-doable tasks in online job postings had declined by 19% in the past three years because companies were hiring fewer people in roles that AI could do. She also found that there had been a decline in job openings across the board, with the hiring downturn being steeper for high-exposure roles (31%) than for low-exposure roles (25%). A 2023 study also revealed that freelance writing jobs dropped by 2% on Upwork, and monthly earnings declined by 5.2% after the introduction of ChatGPT. The researchers also found that generative AI reduced the overall demand for knowledge workers in the short term. However, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said AI will create very valuable jobs. He pointed out that today’s children will grow up “AI natives” in the way the previous generation did with the internet. Hassabis also acknowledged that he would experiment with new AI tools and systems to see the best way to utilize them. The fintech company Klarna boasted last year that its investment in AI had enabled it to freeze human hiring, adding that an AI assistant was doing the equivalent work of 700 full-time agents. However, it has changed its tune in recent months and has started hiring human agents again, acknowledging that its AI-driven cost-cutting push led to lower quality.

Crypto is no longer on the fringes of the financial world. On Friday, June 6, Binance Research released its weekly report , emphasizing that crypto is becoming increasingly integrated with traditional finance. Still, it noted that crypto was among the hardest-hit market segments last week, largely due to political turmoil. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) entered negative territory this week, weighed down by the public split between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Their public arguments have significant implications for crypto, as Musk has been a major advocate for the industry. Weekly and YTD performance of major crypto and traditional assets | Source: Binance Research As a result, Bitcoin fell to a weekly low of $101,500, while Ethereum dropped to $2,388. Still, despite the temporary price shock, the long-term outlook for both assets remains positive. Notably, over the week ending June 2, there was a significant decrease in BTC and ETH held on exchanges.

JP Morgan announced that it would accept crypto ETF holdings as collateral for loans. The bank will also factor these funds into assessments of clients’ net worth. On the regulatory front, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued new guidance on proof-of-stake networks. According to the SEC under the Trump administration, staking is no longer considered a securities activity. This is significant for companies looking to launch Solana (SOL) and Ethereum staking ETFs. Finally, Circle went public on June 5 in a strong showing , with its stock gaining 120% on its first day of trading.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising new crypto coin in presale, is quickly drawing comparisons to Ethereum (ETH), thanks to its innovative DeFi ecosystem and scalable solutions. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first launched in presale, MUTM will officially go live at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). While ETH remains a cornerstone of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and real-world adoption, MUTM aims to carve out its own niche as a more accessible, high-growth alternative for investors exploring what crypto to buy today. As the market looks for the next big cryptocurrency, MUTM’s blend of affordability and technological promise positions it as a must-watch contender in 2025. Presale Picks Up Speed: Mutuum Finance Takes the Lead Mutuum Finance continues to gather momentum as Phase 4 of its presale has sold out ahead of schedule. In Phase 5 currently, tokens are set at $0.03, giving investors a 16.67% return right off the bat once the price increases in the next round. The presale has already raised over $10 million and attracted more than 11,700 investors. With demand on the rise and sound fundamentals, most are hoping for even greater returns after launch, as MUTM makes a case for itself as among the top altcoins to invest in 2025. Innovative Buy-and-Distribute Model Drives Long-Term Growth Unlike traditional speculative token models, Mutuum Finance is different for relying on a Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. It regularly buys MUTM tokens on the open market and rewards stakers with them which keeps tokens out of circulation, encourages long-term investing and helps maintain a healthy growth of the token price. People are encouraged to participate and keep the demand high through the mechanism. Early Investors Reward With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. From the investors 10 will be chosen to share $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for cheering the project in the beginning. Stablecoin Launch & Certik Audit Build Investor Trust Mutuum Finance is releasing a dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Compared to unbacked algorithmic stablecoins, Mutuum’s stablecoin is properly collateralized, so it maintains a constant price and user trust. The smart contracts of the platform have been extensively audited by Certik, a name as renowned in blockchain security as it gets. This finished audit further strengthens the platform’s preference for transparency, security, and long-term sustainability. The Buy-and-Distribute system, robust security of its coin and recognized audit credentials all make Mutuum Finance an interesting combination of progress, proven safety and active community involvement. For bold investors, it allows them to support a DeFi project as it is starting out in the field. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead in blockchain innovation, emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are capturing the spotlight with similar long-term potential—at a fraction of the cost. With over $10 million raised, 11,700+ investors, and a presale price of $0.03, MUTM is already up 200% since launch and set to deliver a 100% ROI when it lists at $0.06. Its audited smart contracts, stablecoin launch, and unique Buy-and-Distribute mechanism make it more than just hype—it’s a well-structured DeFi ecosystem. If you’re looking for the next high-upside altcoin, now’s the time to join the presale and be early to a project aiming to follow Ethereum’s success path.

The FCA made it clear in a June 6 press release that retail investors would be able to access crypto ETNs if they are traded on an investment exchange that is approved by the FCA. This is a major policy shift since ETNs have not been accessible to retail consumers since 2021 due to risk perceptions. FCA’s payment and digital assets executive director David Geale said the move reflects a balanced approach: “Lifting the prohibition would allow people to make up their own minds whether such a high-risk investment is best for them, with a chance to lose all their possessions.” In Alignment with the UK’s Broader Crypto Goals Regulatory experts see the step as being in line with the UK’s strategic objectives in the crypto sector. Clifford Chance partner Diego Ballon Ossio called it a sign that the UK is set to “position itself as a sophisticated jurisdiction in the crypto space.” He pointed out that lifting the retail ban on ETNs could offer fresh avenues for investor access and indicate that the UK is becoming more crypto-friendly. Regulatory Momentum Dominates This comes following the FCA’s rapid acceleration of its crypto-regulatory push. In May, the regulator issued a call for public comments on fresh stablecoin and crypto custody service rules. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves pledged further recently to offer a “comprehensive regulatory regime” to allow the country to be at the forefront of digital asset innovation. According to reports, the UK is witnessing a sharp growth in crypto holdings, even surpassing adoption rates in the US. Crypto Donations Galvanize Political Row There was another row on June 5, in which UK parliamentarians expressed dismay at the growing application of crypto to political donations. Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden stressed that fresh guidelines were required that offer transparency in election expenditure. MP Sarah Olney criticized parties accepting crypto, warning of potential loopholes in donation transparency. Her comments followed Nigel Farage’s June 4 announcement that Reform UK would accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from eligible donors. “We are the first political party in Britain to accept donations in Bitcoin,” said Farage. “We’re catching up with America.” Conclusion The FCA’s proposal to reintroduce crypto ETNs to retail investors can reshape the UK’s digital asset landscape, demonstrating enhanced interest and regulatory recognition of crypto’s mass appeal.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-06 17:33:00

Despite declining volume, the bullish structure remains intact—raising the odds of a potential rally toward $0.30. Cookie ( COOKIE ) is trading at a decisive technical level that could determine its next major move. What was once firm resistance has now flipped into support, providing a potential foundation for bullish continuation. This zone aligns with both the 200 moving average and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, making it a critical test of market strength. Key technical points: Support Flip: Previous resistance has now flipped to support, showing early signs of validation. Technical Confluence: The 200 moving average and the 0.618 Fibonacci level align with this support zone. Bullish Market Structure: Cookie maintains a series of higher highs and higher lows. Volume Decline: The recent pullback came on decreasing volume, indicating a potential correction rather than trend reversal. Upside Target: A successful reversal could see price reach high time frame resistance at $0.30. CookieUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Price action on Cookie is now testing a former resistance zone that had repeatedly capped upward moves. Following the latest pullback, this area has turned into support, creating a compelling case for a bullish retest. The fact that it coincides with both the 200 MA and the 0.618 Fibonacci level adds significant technical weight. You might also like: Top 3 reasons why the crypto market is down today Importantly, the overall trend remains bullish. Despite recent corrective movement, Cookie has maintained its pattern of higher highs and higher lows. The pullback itself occurred on declining volume, behavior that often characterizes healthy retracements within broader uptrends. This suggests the current move is more likely a pause than a breakdown. For the bullish scenario to unfold, a rise in volume will be crucial. Volume confirmation would indicate renewed demand and could serve as the catalyst for a breakout. The next major target sits at $0.30, a high time frame resistance level that may act as a magnet if momentum builds. What to expect in the coming price action If Cookie holds this key support and volume begins to rise, it sets the stage for a push toward $0.30.

It also dropped despite welcoming a popular game to its platform and a surge in Guild of Guardians NFT sales. Immutable ( IMX ) fell to $0.495 on Friday, down 36% from its May peak and 86% from its high last year. The sharp decline has dragged its market capitalization from $4.6 billion in September to $958 million. The decline came even after developers announced that Legends of Elumia had migrated to the Immutable network from Ronin. This is notable, as Legends is a fast-growing title acquired by Triumph Games in April and boasts thousands of monthly active players. Legends of Elumia is now available on PC and Mobile.

Data indicates that Guild of Guardians Heroes generated $8.89 million in sales, a 61% increase from the same period last week. Guild of Guardians Avatars sales rose by 64% to $4.2 million. In total, Immutable processed $13.7 million in NFT sales this week, up 69% from the previous period.

It will release 24.52 million tokens, valued at over $12.7 million. Fortunately for investors, IMX unlocks will conclude in October, transitioning the token into a deflationary asset. Immutable price technical analysis IMX price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the IMX price peaked at $0.8100 in May as most cryptocurrencies rallied. It then pulled back to $0.50, its lowest point since May 8. IMX has since dropped below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while both lines of the MACD have crossed below the zero line. The Relative Strength Index has also tilted downward and is approaching oversold territory. Given these signals, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target key support at $0.3458, its year-to-date low. A drop to this level would complete a double-bottom pattern, which could signal a rebound back to the neckline at $0.8100. However, a decisive move below that support would invalidate the bullish setup.

U.S. stock indices rebounded on Friday, June 6, following stronger-than-expected jobs data. The Dow Jones rose 300 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.75%. At the same time, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 0.97%, with major indices buoyed by encouraging figures on U.S. employment. According to Friday’s report, U.S. employers added 139,000 new jobs , lower than the revised April figure of 147,000 but still ahead of expectations. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at a relatively low 4.2%. Overall, the report signaled that the U.S. job market remains resilient despite ongoing concerns over the trade war. Nonfarm payrolls data is a key metric for the Federal Reserve, which maintains a dual mandate of supporting employment and keeping inflation low. The stronger-than-expected figures are likely to keep the Fed cautious about cutting interest rates, as inflation remains a concern. Following the positive news on the job market, U.S. President Donald Trump once again launched an attack on the Fed. Trump urged Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. “Go for a full point, Rocket Fuel!” Trump stated on social media.

According to The Guardian, the data center is expected to house 15 enormous server halls and, at full capacity, is projected to produce vast amounts of carbon emissions, igniting debates on the environmental costs of the UK’s AI aspirations. Is the UK chasing AI supremacy over green goals? Plans submitted last month for the complex, located roughly nine miles east of Scunthorpe, estimate electricity use of around 3.7 billion kilowatt-hours annually, generating up to 857,254 tons of carbon emissions if powered by today’s National Grid mix. For perspective, that’s five times the carbon output of Birmingham Airport, take-offs and landings included. A public consultation on the scheme closes in three weeks. Organizers acknowledge the extreme heat produced by so many high-performance computers and have proposed glasshouses to capture and reuse the waste warmth, in theory growing over 10 tons of tomatoes a day. Yet building enough renewable generation on-site has been dismissed as impractical. Biomass would demand 100 lorry deliveries of wood chips daily; wind turbines would number 10,000 if each stood just 20 meters tall, and solar panels would need an area five times the size of the Glastonbury Festival grounds. The backers, Elsham Tech Park Ltd, say they will “endeavor to purchase green power where possible” and hope that by the center’s anticipated opening in 2029, cleaner energy on the grid will cut actual emissions below today’s forecast. A government spokesperson has underlined the need to meet AI’s power demands responsibly, pointing to advanced modular nuclear reactors as a “particularly important” solution, and promised planning reforms to accelerate nuclear builds nationwide. Industry giants are already wrestling with these tensions. Microsoft admitted this week that despite a 2019 pledge to hit net-zero carbon by 2030, its overall emissions have climbed by 23%, driven largely by AI expansion. Meta has just agreed to a 20-year power purchase deal with an Illinois nuclear station, while Amazon and Google are exploring their own nuclear ventures to secure low-carbon electricity for ever-hungry AI servers. Experts want new data centers to trigger an equivalent rollout of renewables Research paints an even starker picture of the sector as a whole. The Öko-Institut in Germany projects that by 2030, carbon emissions from AI data centers will be six times higher than in 2023. Greenpeace argues that every new data center must trigger an equivalent rollout of renewables to prevent the carbon footprint of our digital lives from spiraling out of control. Yet many experts believe AI itself could bolster the transition to a zero-carbon economy, optimizing power networks, accelerating materials discovery for clean technologies, or driving efficiencies across industry. Martha Dark, co-executive director of London-based non-profit Foxglove, warns that Britain’s two big government objectives, fueling AI growth and hitting net zero by 2050, are now on a collision course. “The prime minister has hailed generative AI data centers as miracle beans for our economy while also promising to purge toxic pollution and reach carbon neutrality,” she said. “It’s decision time: does the government want a growth plan that truly benefits Britain, or one that best serves the interests of Amazon, Google and Meta?” – Dark. Local officials are keen to see the investment. Robert Waltham , leader of North Lincolnshire Council, stresses that data centers bring high-value jobs, Elsham Tech Park Ltd expects to employ around 900 people and can underpin crucial social services. His council is already piloting AI chatbots to help elderly residents manage their medications, helping them live independently for longer. For its part, the developer highlights Elsham’s position amid the UK’s most advanced “clean energy cluster,” with access to a third of the nation’s offshore wind capacity and two-thirds of licensed carbon capture and storage sites. Still, the debate over whether to prioritize rapid AI expansion or carbon reduction will only intensify as ministers press ahead with plans to fast-track both data centers and new nuclear capacity. In the coming weeks, the public consultation will reveal whether local voices side with the promise of high-paying tech jobs or with those who demand a greener path.

UMA ( UMA ) surged to a high of $1.440, gaining over 40% from its weekly low. The rally pushed its market capitalization above $112 million. The token jumped after Polymarket, a popular prediction market platform, announced a partnership with Elon Musk’s X. Polymarket will serve as the official prediction market partner for the social media giant. The partnership is significant for UMA because it serves as the oracle provider for Polymarket. UMA’s optimistic oracle offers a decentralized and trustless mechanism for resolving market outcomes on the platform. . @UMAprotocol secures @Polymarket Just wanted to let yall know https://t.co/Ds5ZphAzkd — Kanishk Khurana (⛺️,🔮) (@KanishkKhurana_) June 6, 2025 Polymarket likely selected UMA for its robust feature set, including the ability to process diverse data types such as natural language questions. It also has a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism, further enhancing its reliability. You might also like: Cookie crypto price crumbling?

The platform is one of the largest players in social media, with between 240 million and 300 million active users and more than 650 million monthly users overall. As such, there is a likelihood that X will boost the number of Polymarket users, which will in turn lead to more fees for UMA. UMA’s oracle makes money by taking a small fee for all outcomes it resolves. It also takes a cut in cases of dispute resolution. It has handled 1,075 disputes on Polymarket over time.

XRP , Stellar , and TRON are in the spotlight as investors assess their resilience. After a period of declines, there is a sense of anticipation around their potential for recovery. This article delves into the current state of these digital assets and explores the signs that may point to a rebound. Upbeat XRP Outlook Amid Recent Downturn XRP experienced a decline of about 1.3% in the past month and a sharper drop of roughly 18.5% over the last six months. This performance indicates a period of uneven pressure with gradual weaknesses accumulating over time. The shorter timeframe reflects a less severe pullback compared to the more significant decline observed over the half-year period, suggesting that market sentiment has been shifting slowly. The numbers reveal a coin that has faced persistent downward pressure while maintaining a smaller setback recently. XRP currently trades between approximately $1.95 and $2.53, with key support near $1.72 and a secondary safety net around $1.15. Resistance appears at about $2.88, with additional pushback around $3.45. Technical indicators suggest low momentum, with an RSI of around 40, indicating that bears have some control in the market. There is no clearly defined trend, prompting traders to consider positions within the established range and monitor for breakouts above resistance or declines below support for potential trading opportunities. Stellar Price Action Shows Challenges Amid Market Correction Stellar has faced a modest decline of about 1% over the past month and a steeper drop of nearly 48% in the last six months. A recent one-week decline of around 7% adds to the persistent downward pressure, highlighting the coin’s struggle amid broader market weakness. These figures reflect a period of significant adjustment where renewed selling pressure has eroded investor confidence over time. XLM currently trades between $0.23 and $0.32, with immediate resistance around $0.37 and support near $0.20. A second resistance around $0.45 and a second support at $0.12 provide a larger framework for potential price swings. Momentum indicators show a slight bearish bias, with the RSI at 38.26 near oversold territory and no clear buying surge. Overall, sellers are currently leading the market, and traders should consider short-term strategies, closely monitoring the $0.20 support level for signs of further decline. TRON (TRX) Trading Outlook: Recent Gains Amid Medium-Term Pressure TRON recorded a 12.53% increase in price over the last month and a modest gain of 0.754% in the past week, despite a decline of approximately 13.36% over six months. Recent short-term strength contrasts with this longer-term trend, which indicates pressure likely due to cautious investor sentiment. The price action reveals a brief resurgence amid ongoing challenges, highlighting TRON's volatility with differing signals across short and medium-term periods. Current trading ranges from $0.2448 to $0.2843, with support at $0.2242 and resistance at $0.3031. The market is testing these key levels, with bears and bulls showing mixed momentum. The momentum indicator remains slightly negative, and the RSI is around 58, indicating no clear advantage. Traders might consider a breakout strategy; moving above $0.3031 could lead to bullish momentum, while a drop below support could present short opportunities. Caution is needed, especially with second resistance at $0.3425 and secondary support at $0.1848. Conclusion XRP , Stellar (XLM) , and TRON (TRX) have shown resilience in the recent market sell-off. These altcoins are poised for potential gains as they recover from the downside. Investors are advised to keep a close watch on their performance. Historically, these coins have bounced back strongly after bearish phases. Their individual strengths and use cases contribute to their recovery potential.

From mid-2023 through mid-2024 this crypto-forward zone saw nearly $415 billion in crypto inflows, representing a 42.5% year-over-year increase . At this rate, LATAM ranks as the world’s second-fastest-growing market. Within Latin America, four countries rank among the world’s top 20 for crypto adoption, Brazil notably placing ninth. The country pairs strong user engagement with a regulatory environment that remains broadly constructive. While it’s often overshadowed by El Salvador – the world’s first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender – Brazil distinguishes itself through a more measured, infrastructure-driven approach. Its focus on fintech collaboration, institutional readiness, and regulatory progress positions it as a long-term leader in crypto integration. Lawmakers recently introduced a bill ( PL 957/2025 ) to allow up to 50% of wages to be paid in Bitcoin with the rest in the country’s native reais. This would make Brazil one of the first countries to officially accommodate crypto payrolls. The central bank has signaled a more open stance toward stablecoin usage by reconsidering a prior ban that limits transfers of stablecoins to self-custody wallets. Mercado Bitcoin, Brazil’s largest crypto exchange, has inked major partnerships: it is Ripple’s first Brazilian client for a blockchain-based payment solution, and it just announced a deal to tokenize $40 million of Brazilian assets on the Plume Network. Even traditional banks are catching up. Brazil’s BTG Pactual has launched blockchain investing tools, and a pilot digital-real/CBDC program has pushed banks like Itaú into crypto services. But with all this momentum, why is Brazil, along with much of Latin America, still lacking consistent, in-depth media coverage of these shifts? As recently highlighted by Outset PR , the region’s crypto media landscape is thinning at the very moment it’s needed most. Outset PR report: Media isn’t keeping pace The media ecosystem communicating these developments is shrinking, despite a thriving crypto economy. Outset PR’s Q1 2025 media-audit report reveals a sharp disconnect: despite clear signs of strong user interest, Latin America’s crypto news outlets aren't performing well. In the first quarter, only a handful of crypto sites managed growth while 73% of active crypto media lost traffic. January’s Bitcoin rally brought a short-term boost in crypto coverage on mainstream finance outlets, but niche crypto news sites and blogs suffered as market momentum shifted. By February, only 12 crypto outlets saw traffic growth, while the majority lost visibility due to market downturns and early algorithmic shifts. Google’s March core update then shuffled rankings further. Only about half of the 55 monitored outlets recaptured traffic by March. Outset PR tracked a steep and uneven recovery, with many outlets failing to regain January traffic levels. Six sites dominate a shrinking ecosystem In practical terms, Outset PR highlights that Latin American crypto media are highly concentrated and exclusive. There are just six top publishers that accounted for around 69% of all visits to crypto-focused outlets in Q1. Despite such a large market share concentrated across a small handful of players, none of these niche sites averaged more than 1 million monthly visits. The rest of the field is fragmented: many crypto outlets in the region struggle to reach even 10,000 visits per month, with the lowest tier capturing just 8% of total traffic. Several previously recognized sites, such as bitcoinmexico.net and latamblockchain.com, are now defunct, dormant, or largely irrelevant, according to the report. Mainstream media overshadows crypto-native press Adoption is surging, but discoverability isn’t. In Brazil, most web users learn about crypto from large general-media brands (Ámbito Financiero, InfoMoney, iProfesional, El Diario, Valor Econômico, etc.) rather than pure-crypto outlets. These legacy outlets cover crypto on occasion and often gear content to market hype. Their editorial focus can spike PR impressions during bull runs, but they offer no guarantee of engaged crypto readers or evergreen visibility. Outset PR’s data suggest that relying on broad “LATAM” press packages without context can backfire. Budgets get spent on clicks that vanish once Google’s algorithm changes or interest drops. Strategy must evolve with the market For crypto brands in Brazil and Latin America, the takeaway is clear: do not equate adoption with media reach. Campaigns must target the right mix of outlets – the few niche sites that actually have crypto-savvy audiences, plus mainstream portals at critical moments, such as around big regulatory or price news. And they must continuously update their playbook: Outset PR stresses using real traffic and search analytics—not just clippings or old rankings. In short, while Brazil’s crypto narrative is vibrant on the ground, PR teams need data-driven media strategies to ensure the message doesn’t get lost in a crowded and volatile landscape. The region’s next challenge for the industry isn’t building a viable crypto ecosystem, it’s being seen. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ripple’s Past Success vs Ruvi’s Future Ripple’s blockchain has revolutionized cross border payments with its speed and scalability. Recent SEC clarity has solidified its position as a regulated crypto, attracting institutional interest. But here’s the thing: Ripple’s massive market cap means there’s limited room for the exponential gains we saw in its early days. Ruvi is in its early stage . By getting in on Ruvi’s presale you’re basically buying into the beginning of what could be the next XRP like success story. With its AI driven features and blockchain efficiencies Ruvi is going to disrupt the industry in ways Ripple can no longer. Where Ruvi Stands Out: Presale Bonuses A key difference? Ruvi’s presale bonus structure designed to reward early adopters big time. By getting in now you’ll increase your holdings before it hits the public market. Here’s how it works: $300-$700 investment: Gets a 20% bonus $750-$1400 investment: Adds a 40% bonus $1500-$2900 investment: Scores a 60% bonus $3000-$7400 investment: Gets an 80% bonus Above $7500 investment: You’ll double your tokens with a 100% bonus This bonus structure is insane, putting Ruvi in a league of its own compared to big boys like Ripple.

33767162,[object Object],1749232805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Futures Rattled By Political Shock – $324M Liquidated In A Day,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-futures-rattled-by-political-shock-324m-liquidated-in-a-day/,"Bitcoin has experienced a sharp pullback as the crypto market reacted to rising political tensions between Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump. The unexpected clash began when Musk openly criticized the administration’s proposed “Big Beautiful Bill” on X, calling it damaging to innovation and digital freedom. In response, Trump fired back with comments that fueled speculation and uncertainty across financial markets. This sudden confrontation between two of the most influential voices in finance and tech quickly spilled into the crypto space. Within hours of the exchange, Bitcoin dropped over 5%, breaking below short-term support levels and sparking volatility across major altcoins. According to CryptoQuant data, the futures market reacted violently, with over $324 million in long positions liquidated in a single session, marking one of the largest liquidation events in 2025. Traders were caught off guard as directional sentiment flipped rapidly, reflecting growing unease. Now, the market faces increased short-term risk as participants digest the political fallout and its potential implications for regulation, taxation, and broader economic sentiment. While Bitcoin remains above the $100K mark, confidence has taken a hit, and the coming days may determine whether this was a temporary shakeout or the start of a deeper correction . Political Tensions Spark Volatility And Liquidations Bitcoin stands at a pivotal moment as it hovers below its all-time high of $112,000. The broader market is watching closely, anticipating either a breakout into price discovery or a deeper retracement if momentum fades. Bulls maintain control above the $100,000 level, but the recent surge in volatility has highlighted growing risks. Macroeconomic headwinds—particularly rising US Treasury yields and global uncertainty—have kept markets on edge. Now, political friction is adding fuel to the fire. The latest source of instability came from an explosive clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Their public disagreement over the controversial “Big Beautiful Bill,” criticized by Musk on X, spooked investors across the board. According to top analyst Axel Adler, this conflict triggered one of the sharpest reactions in the crypto derivatives market this year. Bitcoin futures saw over $324 million in long-position liquidations within hours, marking a significant shift in short-term sentiment. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim momentum above the $110K region, traders may begin eyeing downside targets. Adler points to $97,500 as the nearest support level, aligning with the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price. A drop below that level could accelerate the decline and shift momentum in favor of bears. However, if BTC holds its current ground and sentiment recovers, the foundations remain intact for a strong continuation into new highs. Bitcoin Holds Key Support As Bulls Defend $103,600 Level Bitcoin is showing resilience after a sharp retrace from the $112K all-time high, bouncing off the $103,600 support level, marked by strong historical relevance and alignment with the 34-day EMA. As seen in the chart, BTC tapped this zone with a low of $101,159 before quickly reclaiming higher ground, currently trading near $103,743. The bounce has formed a potential higher low within the broader uptrend, signaling that bulls are not yet giving up control. However, the failed breakout above $109,300 highlights resistance pressure, and BTC needs to decisively flip that level into support to confirm a bullish continuation. Volume on the latest candle suggests buyers are stepping in, but the lack of a strong surge indicates market caution. The 50-day SMA (green) remains upward sloping, offering medium-term support, while the 100-day and 200-day SMAs are still trending below, reinforcing the bullish bias unless the price drops below $100K. For now, $103,600 is the level to watch. A breakdown below that could open the door to further declines toward the $98K-$100K range. A sustained push above $106K, on the other hand, would likely invite bullish momentum and retest the $109K barrier.

45608931,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=767016,1749232819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45608931.jpeg,Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/bloodbath-incoming-dogecoin-must-hold-this-level/,"Dogecoin’s daily time-frame has reached a critical point that leaves virtually no margin for error. Price settled last night at $0.17551, clinging to a slender cushion just above the confluence of two of the chart’s most important guide rails: the former down-trend resistance that runs from late February and the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2024’s late advance to $0.48440. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone The structural landscape is defined by a six-month descending channel that has corralled every impulse since Dogecoin topped at $0.48440 on 8 December. The median of that channel—slicing through the field at roughly $0.1800—functioned as durable support until Thursday, when an 11% slide in sympathy with Bitcoin split it cleanly. A failure-retest of a channel mid-line is seldom trivial; until DOGE can reclaim $0.1800 on a closing basis, the chart message remains one of trend continuity. Beneath the market, the black trendline that first rejected rallies on 26 March, 26 April and 2 May reclaimed centre-stage after price vaulted it on 8 May, ran to the channel ceiling at $0.2540, and was twice rebuffed—the first rejection on 11 May, the second on 23 May. The trendline is now retested as support where it intersects the 0.786 Fib at $0.16700, producing a high-stakes cross-point. Related Reading: Dogecoin Needs $0.40 Breakout To Salvage Bull Case, Says Analyst If that level fractures, the only historical scaffolding is the multi-year ascending trendline (drawn from May 2021’s all-time high) that merges with a proven demand band spanning $0.14500 to $0.13500. That rectangle arrested the early-April shake-out and would represent the bulls’ final trench; surrendering it would invalidate the long-term series of higher lows and almost certainly inaugurate a broader bear phase with potential gravitational pull back to the January pivot at $0.12990. Oscillators and overlays do little to contradict the bearish drift. The fourteen-day Relative Strength Index sits at 34.70, hovering just above oversold territory but still tracking below its own moving average at 45.22, underscoring persistent negative momentum. Price Targets Overhead, resistance layers are stacked like dominoes. Immediate priority for the bulls is a daily close back above the channel midline at $0.1800; failing that, any attempt at recovery is suspect. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The next ceiling is the compressing exponential moving average cluster: the 20-day EMA at $0.20120, the 50-day at $0.20091, the 100-day at $0.20677 and the 200-day at $0.21550. With all four averages declining and bunched inside a three-cent band, they act as a single reinforced lid near the psychological $0.20 handle. Clearing that barricade would deliver price to the channel’s upper rail, now descending through $0.22. A weekly close outside that boundary would finally neutralise the half-year downtrend and force shorts to cover into the next Fibonacci checkpoints derived from the November high: the 61.8 percent retracement at $0.23484, the 50 percent at $0.28249, the 38.2 percent at $0.33014 and the 23.6 percent at $0.38910. Until then, however, the blunt arithmetic favours the bears. A floor at $0.16700 backed by a multi-touch trendline is slim protection when sentiment is fragile and macro flows are unhelpful. If that shelf cracks, the market’s inertia points toward $0.14500–$0.13500, Dogecoin’s last defensible plateau. Should that red demand zone capitulate, the technical map turns blank down to the January base at $0.12990 and, beyond that into deep bearish territory, especially the August 2024 low at $0.08.

In its recent Coin Report , the company explained how the BTC’s design, scarcity, and decentralized nature set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. Fidelity claims Bitcoin’s scarcity and asset design appeal to investors In their report, Fidelity analysts argued that Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins contributes to its scarcity and thus distinguishes it from other digital assets. Most tokens don’t necessarily have limits on their supply or mechanisms to change up circulation over time, making BTC stand out. Fidelity also believes that Bitcoin’s stable supply and inflation resistance make it especially valuable in today’s uncertain economic environment. It argued that the asset’s design makes it operate like sound money in ways no other digital asset can and makes it a haven for investors fearing fiscal instability. Moreover, its digital design and stable purchasing power allow for global transactions without relying on intermediaries. Its neutrality and censorship resistance further enhance its utility, allowing adoption across all levels—from individuals to banks and governments—as both a currency and a store of wealth. Timmer encourages investors to buy both Bitcoin and gold for their SoV portfolios In May, Fidelity Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer also claimed BTC could be the leading store of value. He then analyzed the Sharpe ratios of both assets and pointed to convergence, hinting that the two assets were becoming increasingly similar in risk-adjusted performance. From 2018 to May 2025, weekly performance data reveals that Bitcoin has steadily closed in on gold, with Bitcoin posting a relative return of $15.95 compared to gold’s $22.48. Considering the data, Timmer even suggested maintaining a 4:1 Gold-to-Bitcoin ratio for long-term SoV portfolios. He commented, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!” The director, however, urged investors to buy both Bitcoin and gold, saying he sees them as different players on a team. he also acknowledgedBTC is a “modern-day invention aspiring to be hard money in an easy money era.” Despite the growing narrative, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds experienced their first quarterly decline in Q1 2025 since their debut in 2024. According to CoinShares, institutional investors’ exposure to Bitcoin dwindled by over 23% to $21.2 billion in Q1 2025 from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024. Nevertheless, gold ETFs drew in more capital. On May 30, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the leading Bitcoin ETF, even saw a huge reversal, with over $430 million in outflows after 31 days of consecutive inflows. Fidelity advances crypto ambitions with stablecoin launch Recent reports indicate that Fidelity Investments is gearing up to launch its stablecoin, marking a significant step in the $6 trillion asset manager’s growing involvement in digital assets as the US moves closer to establishing its first comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the Boston-based firm is in the final phases of testing the token, which will function as a cash equivalent in crypto markets. Fidelity’s digital assets division will manage the stablecoin. Fidelity’s planned launch is part of its expansion into the nascent market for tokenized versions of US Treasuries, having been involved in digital assets for more than a decade. It recently filed to launch a digital version of a US money market fund at the end of May, directly competing with traditional asset manager rivals BlackRock and Franklin Templeton.

The demand, which has reignited speculation about a major shift in U.S. monetary policy, is sending ripples through the financial markets, with crypto markets, particularly XRP, positioned to reap the greatest benefits. As shared by prominent crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, the implications of such a rate cut could set the stage for a massive bull run that propels XRP to unprecedented heights. Trump’s Aggressive Rate Cut Call: A Catalyst for Market Liquidity Trump’s demand for a 100-basis-point cut comes at a time when the U.S. economy is showing signs of cooling but remains stubbornly affected by lingering inflation. Although the Federal Reserve has remained cautious in its monetary approach, Trump’s statement adds pressure for a more aggressive pivot. A full-point rate cut would mark a significant reversal from the Fed’s current stance, potentially ushering in a new era of monetary easing. BREAKING: Trump urges the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by a full point! Prepare for a major bull run! #XRP pic.twitter.com/wSode7uq5G — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 6, 2025 In the traditional financial system, lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, inject liquidity into the economy, and typically weaken the U.S. dollar. This environment tends to favor risk-on assets—stocks, commodities, and most notably, cryptocurrencies. For digital assets like XRP, which already operate within a high-volatility, high-opportunity market, increased liquidity and investor appetite could serve as rocket fuel. XRP’s Unique Position in the Crypto Ecosystem Unlike many crypto assets, XRP isn’t simply riding the speculative wave, it has real-world utility and a growing ecosystem behind it. Designed for fast, low-cost cross-border payments, XRP is at the heart of Ripple’s strategy to modernize global financial infrastructure. In a low-interest-rate environment, institutional investors often seek alternative assets to generate yield and capitalize on emerging technologies. XRP, with its enterprise use cases and increasing regulatory clarity, becomes an attractive candidate. Should Trump’s call influence the Fed’s trajectory, the influx of capital into high-utility assets like XRP could be immense. How Monetary Easing Fuels Crypto Bull Markets Historically, crypto bull markets have followed periods of loose monetary policy. The 2020-2021 bull run, which saw Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP hit new all-time highs, was largely fueled by aggressive rate cuts and quantitative easing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the cost of capital decreased and the money supply ballooned, investors turned to cryptocurrencies as both a hedge against inflation and a speculative vehicle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Should the Fed comply with Trump’s request, or even partially adopt a more dovish tone, the stage would be set for a repeat performance. Lower yields on U.S. Treasury securities would push institutional money into alternative investments. Retail investors, emboldened by lower borrowing costs and renewed risk appetite, could also flood back into crypto markets. XRP, given its suppressed price and growing institutional relevance, would likely outperform in such a scenario. XRP’s Strategic Positioning XRP’s strategic positioning is crucial here. Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions, central banks , and payment providers across the globe suggest that XRP is not merely a speculative asset but a tool for financial transformation. Should macroeconomic conditions tilt in favor of growth and liquidity, especially driven by a dovish Fed, XRP’s combination of low price, high utility, and improved legal standing makes it one of the top candidates for explosive growth.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 790,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is now likely on the verge of breaking through the resistance level at $105,800. “Bitcoin is about to break back higher, as we’ve taken all the liquidity and it’s quickly being absorbed. These levels should usually be the end of the correction.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X He also says that Bitcoin is exhibiting market strength after retesting the $100,739 level. “To be honest, after the recent correction on Bitcoin, this is what you’d want to see. A strong bounce back upwards, ETH also climbing back. Good times are ahead.” Bitcoin is trading for $105,023 at time of writing. Next up, the analyst says he remains bullish on layer-1 blockchain Sui ( SUI ), despite the recent major security breach of the Cetus Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui network. The analyst says one reason to be bullish on SUI is that the network’s total value locked (TVL) is recovering after its decline triggered by the Cetus hack. The TVL is the amount of capital deposited within a protocol’s smart contracts and is often used to gauge the health of a crypto ecosystem. “SUI has continued to show strength. Despite the recent exploit on Cetus, the TVL on SUI is still $1.8 billion and constantly growing. It has run back with 20% since the recent drop. Such a strong signal and such a strong ecosystem.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading for $3.18 at time of writing, up 1.4% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst says that the cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole ( W ) is showing bullish divergence on the weekly chart. A bullish divergence, which suggests price will start to increase, occurs when the price of assets records lower lows while indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator indicator, are witnessing higher lows. “W remains to be one of my portfolio altcoins. They are bringing Dogecoin to Solana as well, as they bridge the memecoin towards the other chain. Secondly, they are the exclusive partner of BlackRock’s BUIDL and more partners. Massive bullish divergence.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Wormhole is trading for $0.07355 at time of writing, down 2.8% in the last 24 hours.

Each has unique strengths, gearing up for a potential bounce-back. The coming weeks could reveal which one is set to lead the charge. Analyzing the factors that could drive their performance might offer insights into which coin is primed for robust growth. BNB Price Behavior and Current Market Dynamics BNB has shown a modest rebound over the one-month period with a price increase of 6.12%. Over the past six months, it experienced a decline of 14.75%, revealing challenges amid persistent market volatility. A one-week drop of 5.21% further reflects short-term pressure. The performance highlights fluctuations where short-term gains could not offset the longer-term downturn. Price movements suggest mixed investor sentiment, as improvements in the one-month span were met by broader declines over the half-year period, indicating intermittent recovery paired with ongoing challenges. BNB now trades between approximately $595.97 and $709.27, with a notable resistance at $760.13 and support around $533.53. A secondary resistance is marked at about $873.43, while additional support is near $420.23, guiding near-term trading decisions. Current indicators reveal mixed signals. The Awesome Oscillator hints at some upward impulse, yet the Momentum Indicator and RSI reading underscore caution. Bulls have been active but face hurdles to break through resistance, while bears exert pressure on prices. Traders might consider long positions on a convincing break above $760.13, targeting $873.43, or short strategies near $533.53 with further risk at $420.23. Upbeat XRP Outlook Amid Recent Downturn XRP experienced a decline of about 1.3% in the past month and a sharper drop of roughly 18.5% over the last six months. This performance indicates a period of uneven pressure with gradual weaknesses accumulating over time. The shorter timeframe reflects a less severe pullback compared to the more significant decline observed over the half-year period, suggesting that market sentiment has been shifting slowly. The numbers reveal a coin that has faced persistent downward pressure while maintaining a smaller setback recently. XRP currently trades between approximately $1.95 and $2.53, with key support near $1.72 and a secondary safety net around $1.15. Resistance appears at about $2.88, with additional pushback around $3.45. Technical indicators suggest low momentum, with an RSI of around 40, indicating that bears have some control in the market. There is no clearly defined trend, prompting traders to consider positions within the established range and monitor for breakouts above resistance or declines below support for potential trading opportunities. Conclusion BNB and XRP both have strong potential to recover and excel when the market turns around. BNB benefits from its close ties to the Binance ecosystem, while XRP aims to bolster its position through ongoing legal resolutions and strategic partnerships. Both assets have unique strengths that could make them shine in a market recovery, but BNB’s robust support from Binance and XRP’s legal clarity efforts are key factors to watch. Ultimately, individual investment strategies and market conditions will determine which one outperforms. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
