43189151,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148387,1744326628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: Amazon CEO’s Bold Vision Demands Massive AI Investment Now!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/amazon-ceo-ai-investment-call/,"In a powerful message echoing across the tech world, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is urging businesses to embrace a bold strategy: dive headfirst into AI investment . Forget dipping your toes in – Jassy believes now is the time for companies to invest “aggressively” in Artificial Intelligence to unlock substantial financial rewards in the years ahead. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors watching the tech landscape, this call to action signifies a potentially massive shift in resource allocation, with implications far beyond just Amazon’s bottom line. Why is Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Pushing for Aggressive AI Investment? Jassy’s annual letter to Amazon shareholders, released this Thursday, wasn’t just a routine update. It was a rallying cry for AI investment . He emphasized that keeping pace with the breakneck speed of AI innovation and meeting the surging customer demand for AI-powered products necessitates “substantial capital.” Amazon itself, he stated, must commit significant resources now to ensure strong returns on its AI investment in the future. This isn’t just about keeping up; it’s about leading the charge in the AI revolution. This urgent plea follows Amazon’s February announcement during its fourth-quarter earnings call, revealing plans for a staggering $100 billion+ in capital expenditures for 2025. The “vast majority” of this colossal sum is earmarked for bolstering AWS AI infrastructure capabilities, as Jassy clarified at the time. He doubled down on his conviction in the shareholder letter, declaring, “We continue to believe AI is a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention of everything we know.” The demand, he noted, is unprecedented, and aggressive AI investment is crucial to serve customers, shareholders, and the business effectively. The Cost of Leading the AI Revolution: Investing in AI Infrastructure Where is all this money going? Jassy pinpointed data centers and chips as the primary drivers of current AI investment expenses. He acknowledged that the upfront costs are significant, but stressed that this infrastructure will yield long-term benefits and become more cost-effective over time. He elaborated on the cost dynamics within AWS, stating, “In AWS, the faster demand grows, the more data centers, chips, and hardware we need to procure (and AI chips are much more expensive than CPU chips). We spend this capital upfront, even though these assets are useful for many years.” This highlights the long-term vision behind Amazon’s AI infrastructure build-out – a strategic move to establish a dominant position in the burgeoning AI market. To illustrate the anticipated decrease in AI infrastructure costs, Jassy highlighted Amazon’s own Trainium2 chips. He asserted that these chips deliver a remarkable 30%-40% improvement in price-performance compared to currently available GPU-powered computing instances. The release of Trainium2 in late 2024 signals Amazon’s commitment to driving down the cost of AI and making it more accessible. Shifting Focus: From AI Training to Inference and Generative AI Jassy further explained that the economic landscape of AI investment is poised to evolve. As training costs for AI models decrease, the focus will increasingly shift towards inference – the process of actually deploying and using AI models. He emphasized Amazon’s urgency in making inference more affordable for customers. Several factors will contribute to this shift: More Price-Performant Chips: Like Trainium2, advancements in chip technology will directly reduce inference costs. Model Distillation: Creating smaller, more efficient models that retain performance. Prompt Caching: Optimizing AI model responses by storing and reusing frequently requested information. Computing Infrastructure Improvements: General advancements in data center technology and efficiency. Model Architecture Enhancements: Developing more streamlined and resource-efficient AI models. Amazon’s commitment to generative AI is also evident. Jassy revealed that Amazon is actively developing over 1,000 generative AI applications. This significant undertaking underscores the company’s belief in the transformative potential of generative AI across various industries and applications. The Explosive Growth of Amazon AI: A Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity The numbers speak volumes. Jassy proudly announced that Amazon’s AI revenue is experiencing “triple-digit” year-over-year growth, translating to a “multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate.” This explosive growth trajectory validates Amazon’s aggressive AI investment strategy and signals the immense market opportunity in the AI sector. For investors in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, this is a clear indicator of where future growth and innovation are concentrated. Bitcoin World has reached out to Amazon for further comment on this significant push into Cloud AI and generative AI technologies. Key Takeaways for Crypto and Tech Investors: AI is the Next Frontier: Amazon’s massive AI investment signals a fundamental shift towards AI as the next major technological revolution. Infrastructure is King: Investing in AI infrastructure , including data centers and specialized chips, is paramount for companies seeking to lead in the AI era. Generative AI is Booming: The rapid growth of generative AI applications presents immense opportunities for innovation and investment. Cloud AI Dominance: Amazon’s focus on AWS Cloud AI reinforces the cloud’s central role in delivering AI solutions to businesses. Long-Term Vision Required: AI investment is a long-term game. Companies need to be prepared for significant upfront costs to reap future rewards. Andy Jassy’s shareholder letter is more than just corporate communication; it’s a strategic roadmap for the future of tech. His forceful endorsement of aggressive AI investment should serve as a wake-up call for businesses across all sectors. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, companies that fail to prioritize AI investment risk being left behind in this transformative era. The message is clear: the AI revolution is here, and it demands bold action and substantial resources.

Speculation now surrounds whether other digital assets like SOL might follow a similar trend. This article reviews the current indicators and evaluates if SOL could realistically see notable growth in the present cautious market environment. Ondo Altcoin: Steady Monthly Growth and Key Level Signals Ondo recorded a strong monthly gain of 9.37% and a six-month rise of 20.75%, with a one-week surge close to 9.18%. Price action remained within a range of $0.60 to $1.10, reflecting gradual but solid accumulation over time. Trends over these periods have shown organic gains and steady investor interest without drastic fluctuations, indicating a phase of healthy market activity. Current prices face a resistance at $1.42 while support holds near $0.41. Indicator readings, including an RSI of 51.27 and a modest momentum of 0.077, point to a balanced market with neither bulls nor bears in full control. The absence of a clear trend creates opportunities for traders to buy near support and sell at resistance, with careful monitoring for any breakout. Solana: Resistance Levels and Current Price Dynamics Solana experienced a decline of approximately 1.87% in the past month, with a more significant drop of around 20% over the last six months. The price fluctuated between roughly 98 and 166 dollars, reflecting short-term corrections alongside ongoing downward pressure. Over this extended period, the coin has struggled to regain upward momentum, facing persistent challenges against rising prices. Currently, Solana trades within a range of $98 to $166, facing immediate resistance near $207 and a stronger barrier around $274. Support is established near $71. Indicators show bears are in control, with negative oscillators and an RSI at 43.5. The lack of a clear trend suggests focusing on range-bound trading strategies within these key levels. Conclusion The recent performance of ONDO suggests growing interest and strong momentum in the market. Investors are now closely watching SOL . If current trends continue, SOL may follow in ONDO's footsteps, potentially seeing increased activity and price action. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

SEI’s sharp 65% price drop has some community members sweating, even as technical indicators hint at an oversold setup. Meanwhile, XRP is caught in a tug-of-war with macroeconomics, where whispers of an emergency Fed rate cut might flip the game for altcoins. But while those two deal with volatility, another name is quietly building something big— Qubetics ($TICS). And the timing couldn’t be more interesting for anyone scanning the market for the best crypto investment in 2025. Enter Qubetics—a project that’s not promising moonshots but offering something a lot more grounded: real-world use. While other tokens play the hype game, Qubetics is flipping the script by solving a key problem most cryptos haven’t cracked—real-world asset tokenization. This isn’t just some theoretical blockchain talk either. Qubetics is building a marketplace where physical and digital assets—from real estate to rare collectibles—can be converted into tradable tokens. That’s a game-changer for communities, businesses, and everyday folks looking for more than just speculative coin flips. And what’s wild? This might just be the early stage of the best crypto investment the market has seen this year. Qubetics: Where Real Assets Meet Web3 Utility Qubetics isn’t just another coin—it’s a full-blown infrastructure play. At its core is a tokenized asset marketplace, where the everyday and extraordinary collide. Picture a small business owner in Texas wanting to raise funds without diving into debt—Qubetics lets them tokenize parts of their commercial property and offer it to early buyers globally. Or imagine an art curator in Brooklyn unlocking liquidity by fractionalizing a six-figure piece of digital art. Qubetics makes that happen—securely, fast, and with real-world impact. And it’s not just for solo users. Enterprises, startups, and real estate groups can tap into the Qubetics ecosystem to unlock cash flow from frozen assets. The platform isn’t confined to a single chain either—it acts as a web3 aggregator, bridging multiple top blockchains for faster, broader asset exposure. That blend of security, cross-chain flexibility, and real-world utility makes Qubetics a standout pick for anyone watching closely for the best crypto investment of this cycle.\ Qubetics Presale: Your Early Access to the Best Crypto Investment The Qubetics presale is heating up—and it’s not hype, it’s all about smart timing and real numbers. The current stage—29th—is priced at $0.1573 per $TICS. In just under 29 weeks, Qubetics has locked in over $15.9 million from the community, selling more than 507 million tokens to over 24,500 active holders. Each stage runs just seven days, ending every Sunday at midnight, and the price jumps by 10% immediately after. That time crunch is fueling serious demand. Now let’s talk ROI. Based on the data, an early adopter throwing in $100 at the current rate gets roughly 636 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that turns into $636—an ROI of 535.65%. If it hits $5, it climbs to 3,078.26%. The bigger projections? $TICS reaching $10 would mean $6,256.47 in value—over 6,000% growth—and $15 per token takes that same $100 to $9,434.71. Whether you’re a casual community member or a serious crypto researcher, these stats prove why the Qubetics presale is being talked about as the best crypto investment right now. SEI Price Plunge Signals Oversold Setup, But Recovery Looks Uncertain SEI’s been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Its price has plunged a staggering 65% so far in 2025, making it one of the worst-performing altcoins this year. A big factor behind the nosedive is fading demand across the board. Right now, SEI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 26.96—a number that screams “oversold” and usually hints at a bounce. But here’s the kicker: the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) isn’t playing along, signaling ongoing bearish momentum. On top of that, SEI is trading below the Ichimoku Cloud, which historically signals resistance and more downside pressure ahead. So while there’s a glimmer of technical hope, the broader outlook suggests SEI could stay under water for a bit longer. And let’s not sugarcoat it—the indicators aren’t offering much relief for short-term gains. For community members hoping for a turnaround, it’s not just about watching charts anymore—it’s about waiting out deeper macro shifts or developer announcements that might jolt sentiment. But as of now, the data leans bearish, and any recovery could be slow and hard-won. In this kind of climate, SEI feels more like a “watch and wait” than a “dive in and buy” scenario. XRP Could Get a Boost if the Fed Makes a Big Move While SEI fights to stay afloat, XRP is being pulled into a bigger economic story. Right now, XRP’s price sits at $1.79, reflecting an 8.9% slide amid rising global tensions—especially after China slapped an 84% tariff on U.S. goods. But here’s the twist: speculation is rising fast that the U.S. Federal Reserve might slash interest rates in an emergency move. If that happens, altcoins like XRP could be the biggest winners. That’s because lower rates usually push more people toward riskier assets, and historically, XRP tends to benefit when liquidity floods back into the market. Forecasts from Polymarket and Kalshi—two major prediction markets—show a jump in confidence that the Fed will act soon. For XRP holders, that could mean a new rally if the central bank does pull the trigger. But until then, XRP’s fate remains closely tied to broader macro signals, not just internal ecosystem moves. It’s not all doom and gloom—it’s more like a waiting game where the prize could be worth it, if timing lines up. One Word: Timing. Qubetics, XRP, and SEI Each Have a Different Clock Here’s the truth—SEI might be oversold, but that doesn’t mean it’s ready to bounce. XRP has macro tailwinds but still needs the Fed to make a move. Meanwhile, Qubetics is carving out a lane of its own, solving actual problems through its tokenized asset marketplace and drawing millions into its structured presale. For those looking for the best crypto investment, now is the time to join this best crypto presale while SEI and XRP ride the uncertainty wave. Qubetics offers the clearest path to calculated, high-upside exposure. It’s not about hype—it’s about real applications and smart timing. So whether you’re tracking news or chasing the next breakout, now might be your chance to join this best crypto presale before the rest of the market catches on. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other crypto projects? Qubetics turns real-world assets like real estate and art into tradable tokens, creating utility beyond price speculation. How much can someone earn by joining the Qubetics presale now? At the current price, ROI ranges from over 500% to more than 9,000% depending on future $TICS value. Why is Qubetics being called the best crypto investment in 2025? It solves real-world problems, connects multiple chains, and its presale structure rewards early adopters, making it a strong contender for the best crypto investment.

That narrowly focused IRS rule, approved in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration, has been formally struck down, according to Representative Mike Carey, an Ohio Republican who backed the effort. And the agency is prevented from pursuing anything like it, according to the Congressional Review Act power used by lawmakers to get rid of the tax regulation. Though the issue was relatively limited, its completion marks the first time a pro-crypto effort has cleared the U.S. Congress. Both the Senate and House of Representatives agreed to reverse the IRS action with strong bipartisan showings, further underlining the crypto sector's strength in this Congress. That could bode well for the industry's chances with other more wide-ranging matters, including legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers and to set market rules for crypto transactions. Trump's signature on the DeFi tax resolution puts that concern for DeFi in the rearview. The next crypto priority in Congress has been stablecoin legislation. Similar bills have passed relevant committees in both the House and Senate and are awaiting floor votes in each chamber. Approvals would start a process to meld the two efforts into one compromise version. The president has called for a bill to arrive on his desk by August, and the lawmakers behind the legislation have said such a timeline is still possible.",Policy|Top Stories|Breaking News|Internal Revenue Service|Donald Trump|U.S. Congress|DeFi,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-10 23:17:21

The often-unpredictable world of cryptocurrency has delivered another jolt. Just when you thought things were settling down, a massive Ethereum whale, slumbering for three long years, has suddenly sprung to life and executed a significant ETH sell-off . This isn’t just pocket change we’re talking about; it’s a whopping $11.8 million worth of Ether that has just entered the market. Let’s dive deep into what this means and why it’s sending ripples through the crypto market . Why is a Dormant Ethereum Whale’s Activity a Big Deal? In the crypto world, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their movements can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of their holdings. A dormant wallet , especially one belonging to a whale, is like a sleeping giant. When it suddenly becomes active after a long period of inactivity, it immediately grabs attention. Here’s why this particular event is noteworthy: Market Impact: Large sell orders, especially from whales, can create downward pressure on prices. When a whale dumps millions of dollars worth of ETH, it can trigger a chain reaction, potentially leading to further sell-offs as other investors react. Market Sentiment Indicator: Whale movements are often seen as indicators of market sentiment. A sudden sell-off by a long-term holder might suggest a change in their outlook on Ethereum’s future prospects. Liquidity Implications: Selling such a large amount of ETH can test the market’s liquidity, especially if executed rapidly. It can reveal the depth of buy orders at various price levels. Speculation and Uncertainty: Dormant wallet activations breed speculation. Why now? What’s the motive? This uncertainty can add volatility to the market. Decoding the $11.8M ETH Sell-Off: What We Know According to the on-chain analytics firm LookOnChain, this particular Ethereum whale wallet, which had been inactive for three years, decided it was time to make a move. Let’s break down the key details of this substantial transaction: Metric Details Amount of ETH Sold 7,974 ETH Value of ETH Sold $11.8 million Selling Price per ETH $1,479 Wallet Inactivity Period 3 years Remaining ETH in Wallet 30,606 ETH Value of Remaining ETH $45.7 million (approximately) Source of Information LookOnChain (via X) The whale executed this massive ETH sell-off over a relatively short period of two hours, indicating a decisive move. Selling at $1,479 per ETH, while potentially below recent peaks, still represents a significant profit for someone who likely acquired ETH years ago, possibly at much lower prices. The fact that the wallet still holds a substantial 30,606 ETH suggests this might be a partial profit-taking move rather than a complete exit from Ethereum. Analyzing the Blockchain Transaction: Tracing the Whale’s Move The beauty of blockchain technology is its transparency. We can actually track these large transactions and gain insights into the whale’s activity. By examining the transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, we can potentially see: Destination of Funds: Where did the sold ETH go? Was it moved to exchanges, other wallets, or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms? Tracking the flow of funds can provide clues about the whale’s intentions. Transaction Patterns: Are there multiple smaller transactions or a few large ones? The pattern of transactions can indicate whether the whale is trying to minimize market impact or is in a hurry to sell. Wallet History: Looking back at the wallet’s transaction history might reveal previous buying or selling patterns, offering context to this recent activity. Tools like Etherscan and other blockchain explorers allow anyone to delve into these details and become a crypto detective of sorts! Potential Reasons Behind the Whale’s Sudden Activity Why would a dormant wallet suddenly wake up and execute such a large crypto sell-off after three years? There could be several reasons, ranging from personal financial needs to strategic market maneuvers: Profit Taking: After years of holding, the whale might see the current price levels as an attractive opportunity to realize substantial profits. Market Concerns: The whale might have concerns about the current state of the crypto market, macroeconomic factors, or Ethereum specifically, prompting them to reduce their holdings. Portfolio Rebalancing: This could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy, shifting funds to other asset classes or cryptocurrencies. Personal Circumstances: Life events or financial obligations could necessitate the liquidation of crypto assets. Strategic Market Move: In more speculative scenarios, some might suggest whales intentionally create sell pressure to trigger price dips, potentially to buy back in at lower levels or to manipulate the market for other trading strategies. It’s important to remember that without direct insight into the whale’s intentions, any explanation remains speculative. However, analyzing on-chain data and market context can help us make informed deductions. Impact on the Crypto Market and What to Watch For While a single whale’s ETH sell-off might not trigger a catastrophic market crash, it’s certainly a noteworthy event, especially in the currently sensitive crypto market environment. Here’s what to keep an eye on: Price Action: Monitor Ethereum’s price movement in the coming hours and days. Did the sell-off trigger a significant price dip? Is there a recovery? Trading Volume: Increased trading volume around this event could indicate heightened market activity and volatility. Whale Activity: Are other large holders showing similar selling behavior? A cluster of whale sell-offs could signal a broader shift in sentiment. Market Sentiment: Gauge the overall market sentiment. Are investors becoming more cautious or fearful in response to this and other market events? Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Investors Learn? This event serves as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep track of on-chain data and whale movements. Services like LookOnChain and Nansen provide valuable insights into these activities. Manage Risk: Diversification and risk management are crucial in crypto. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and be prepared for market volatility. Understand Market Dynamics: Whale activity is just one factor influencing the market. Stay informed about broader economic trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the crypto space. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term price fluctuations are common, maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments, especially if you believe in the underlying technology and potential. Conclusion: The Whale Has Spoken – What’s Next for Ethereum? The sudden awakening of a dormant Ethereum whale and the subsequent $11.8 million ETH sell-off has injected a dose of intrigue and volatility into the crypto market. While the exact reasons behind this move remain a mystery, it underscores the significant influence that large holders can wield. As we move forward, keeping a close watch on market reactions, further whale activity, and broader market trends will be crucial. The crypto narrative is ever-evolving, and events like these are pivotal chapters in its ongoing story. Will this be a minor ripple or the start of a bigger wave? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the crypto seas remain fascinatingly unpredictable.

The pre-launch phase introduces several changes, including to the token pricing mechanism. The price of the HINU token increases every two days until it sells out under the new pricing mechanism. The Pre-Launch Phase The pre-launch phase will empower the community and ensure early backers can benefit from favorable pricing. The phase began when markets were being battered by uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs. However, the markets have recovered, with Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens posting strong rallies. The Husky Inu team recently announced several updates, revealing the official launch dates of the HINU token and the Earn App. According to the team, the pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy, rewarding early adopters and project supporters while maintaining growth and transparency. With the pre-launch phase underway, the HINU token’s price will increase every two days, following a compounded growth model until the tokens are sold or reach their presale target. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends once all the HINU tokens are sold out. HINU Token Price Increases To understand how the price increase works, we must understand how the new pricing mechanism works. The mechanism is explained below.

Per Gazeta.ru , ETE wrote to Mishustin to ask him to “develop a regulatory framework for settlements with foreign suppliers in digital currencies, including cryptocurrency.” ETE said it wanted the government to “make changes to the Russian Civil and Tax Codes.

(Source: 24 MIR TV/Screenshot) The company noted that in 2024, business sector interest “in making [crypto] payments abroad increased by 40%.” The firm suggested that while Russian companies are “allowed to make international payments in cryptocurrency,” the process “carries risks for businesses due to the lack of a regulatory framework.” It added that crypto payments help domestic firms “solve problems with foreign payments.” Ex-Russian politician found guilty in UK sanctions and money-laundering trial https://t.co/5cFy5hwdFQ — Financial Times (@FT) April 10, 2025 Sanctions Driving Russian Trade Firms to Tokens Russian companies are believed to have started using crypto as a payment tool shortly after the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022. The US, the EU, and the UK have since imposed sanctions on Russian trading companies and banks, which they have also disconnected from the SWIFT network. Officially, Russian trade firms must use the Central Bank’s sandbox program to conduct cross-border trade in crypto. However, scores of companies are widely thought to be trading outside the sandbox, apparently with Moscow’s unspoken blessing. This has led to uncertainty in the sector, however. Many companies are still reluctant to use crypto, as tokens are still largely unregulated in Russia.

ETE noted that “sanctions against Russian financial institutions hinder settlements with foreign suppliers.” It claimed that payments between firms in Russia and China often face delays, ranging “from five days to several months.” Similar situations are also frequent in trade deals between Russia and Kazakhstan, the company added. ETE said that the length of the delays “extends with each new sanctions package.” Russia-Kazakhstan payments take “at least two to three weeks” to complete, “depending on the payment code, the recipient bank, and accompanying documents,” the firm said. ETE explained: “The situation today is complicated by the inclusion of not only large Chinese banks in America’s [sanctions regime scrutiny], but also municipal institutions. The slightest suspicion of a payer’s connection with Russia will lead to the credit institution refusing to credit the payment to the recipient’s bank account and returning it. This process can take anything from two or three weeks to several months.” The firm remarked that Russian law stipulates that crypto “cannot be used to pay for goods, since the ruble remains the [sole] official currency.” The investment firm VanEck this week claimed it had seen evidence that Russia and China are using Bitcoin (BTC) to settle energy trade payments .

The financial winds are shifting, and it’s sending ripples through the cryptocurrency market. We’re seeing a significant surge in traditional finance that could spell volatility for digital assets. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield has just hit 4.855%, a notable jump that’s making investors rethink their strategies. What does this mean for your Bitcoin and crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into this developing situation and unpack what it signifies for the future of digital gold and beyond. What’s Driving the Treasury Yield Surge? Before we delve into the implications for Bitcoin , let’s understand what’s fueling this rise in Treasury yields. A Treasury yield is essentially the return an investor receives for holding U.S. government debt. When yields rise, it generally indicates a few key things: Economic Outlook: Rising yields can suggest expectations of stronger economic growth and potentially higher inflation in the future. Federal Reserve Policy: Actions and signals from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates significantly influence Treasury yields. Investor Sentiment: Changes in investor confidence and risk appetite play a crucial role. Currently, the increase points towards a growing risk-off sentiment . In simple terms, when investors anticipate higher returns from safer assets like U.S. Treasuries, they might become less inclined to invest in riskier assets. This is where cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, come into the picture. The Bitcoin Connection: Why Treasury Yields Matter for Crypto You might be wondering, “Why should I care about Treasury yields when I’m focused on Bitcoin and crypto?” The answer lies in how investors perceive risk and allocate capital. Here’s the crux of the matter: Opportunity Cost: As Treasury yields climb, they offer a more attractive, low-risk return compared to the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies. This increases the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin and other digital assets. Risk-Off Trade: A rising Treasury yield often coincides with a broader “risk-off” trade in financial markets. Investors tend to move away from riskier assets like equities and cryptocurrencies and towards safer havens like government bonds. Dollar Strength: Higher yields can strengthen the U.S. dollar, which historically has had an inverse relationship with Bitcoin. A stronger dollar can sometimes put downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. To illustrate this point, consider the following table which simplifies the typical investor behavior during periods of rising Treasury yields: Asset Class Investor Behavior During Rising Treasury Yields Impact U.S. Treasuries Increased demand due to higher returns and lower risk Price may stabilize or slightly increase; Yields remain high Bitcoin & Cryptocurrencies Decreased demand as investors seek safer returns Potential price correction or stagnation Equities (Stocks) Reduced demand due to increased attractiveness of bonds Potential market downturn or reduced growth Real Estate May face pressure due to rising borrowing costs Potential slowdown in market activity Decoding Risk-Off Sentiment: What Does It Mean for Your Investments? The current rise in Treasury yields is largely attributed to growing risk-off sentiment in the market. But what exactly does this mean? Risk-off sentiment emerges when investors become more cautious and apprehensive about the economic outlook or potential market instability. This can be triggered by various factors, including: Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events and political instability can fuel risk aversion. Economic Data: Disappointing economic indicators or fears of recession can increase risk-off sentiment. Inflation Concerns: Persistent high inflation can lead investors to seek safer assets. When risk-off sentiment prevails, investors typically flock to assets perceived as safe havens. Historically, these have included: Government Bonds: U.S. Treasuries are a prime example. Gold: Often seen as a store of value during economic uncertainty. Cash: Holding cash becomes more attractive when risk is elevated. In contrast, assets like cryptocurrencies, which are still considered relatively new and volatile, tend to underperform during periods of risk aversion. This is because they are viewed as higher-risk investments, and investors prefer to reduce their exposure to such assets when uncertainty increases. Navigating Investment Risk in a High-Yield Environment So, what should crypto investors do in light of rising Treasury yields and growing investment risk aversion? Here are some actionable insights: Portfolio Review: Assess your current crypto portfolio and consider your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with potential short-term volatility? Diversification: Ensure your investment portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes. Don’t put all your eggs in the crypto basket. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic indicators, Federal Reserve announcements, and market sentiment shifts. News outlets like CNBC are crucial for staying updated. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider employing a DCA strategy, especially if you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and crypto. This involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market cycles are natural. While rising Treasury yields might create short-term headwinds for crypto, the long-term fundamentals of blockchain technology and digital assets remain compelling for many. Future Outlook: Will Market Sentiment Shift? Predicting the future of financial markets is never an exact science, but understanding the interplay of factors like Treasury yields, market sentiment , and global economic conditions is crucial. Whether the current risk-off sentiment will persist or shift depends on a multitude of variables. Keep an eye on: Inflation Data: Will inflation continue to be elevated, or will it start to cool down? Central Bank Actions: How will the Federal Reserve and other central banks respond to inflation and economic growth? Geopolitical Landscape: Will geopolitical tensions escalate or de-escalate? Technological Advancements: Continued innovation and adoption within the crypto space could bolster long-term prospects, despite short-term market fluctuations. Conclusion: Staying Vigilant in the Crypto Space The rise in the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield to 4.855% is more than just a number; it’s a signal of changing tides in the financial world. For crypto investors, it serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of traditional and digital finance. While risk-off sentiment and higher yields can create short-term challenges for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, understanding these dynamics empowers you to make informed decisions and navigate the ever-evolving landscape with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and remember that in the world of crypto, knowledge is your most powerful asset.

With the new act signed into law, Nigeria has positioned itself as the digital finance leader in Africa. Regulatory Clarity After Years of Uncertainty and Tension In a landmark legal shift, Nigerian lawmakers have finally recognised cryptocurrencies as securities. Nigeria’s President, Bola Tinubu, recently added digital assets to the Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 2024, which repeals the Investments and Securities Act No. 29 of 2007. According to Forbes Africa and local Nigerian news agency Business Day reports , Nigeria’s new capital markets law officially classifies crypto and other virtual assets as securities for the first time. The landmark legislation is expected to provide greater transparency and increased investments. The legislation is welcomed after Nigeria faced years of regulatory uncertainty and tension between its government and the burgeoning crypto sector. On February 1, 2021, supported by concerns over money laundering, terrorism financing, and lack of consumer protection, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a directive prohibiting financial institutions from facilitating crypto transactions. The outright ban evoked public outrage, especially among the country’s tech-savvy youth, who have increasingly turned to crypto as an alternative store of value amid high inflation, economic instability and uncertainty. Despite the prohibitive ban from the government, Nigeria emerged as the largest cryptocurrency market in Africa by market volume as citizens, spurred by necessity, kept finding creative ways to bypass government restrictions through peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. The persistent demands and growing global adoption rate of digital assets forced the government to reconsider its position, culminating in the enactment of ISA 2024. Relaxing Crypto Bans In December 2022, the Nigerian Central Bank (CBN) published strict guidelines for banks and financial institutions opening crypto accounts. The guidelines were issued after the CBN lifted the ban on banks’ operation accounts for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). At the time, the CNB recognized the need to revise its 2021 policy, stating: “However current trends globally have shown that there is need to regulate the activities of virtual assets service providers (VASPs), which include cryptocurrencies and crypto assets.” Just days after the CBN issued a comprehensive ban on banks engaging with crypto, the CBN revised its restrictions on banks facilitating crypto transactions. After a nearly two-year comprehensive ban on banks’ involvement with digital currencies, the CBN relaxed its restrictions by allowing crypto firms to open bank accounts with Nigerian banks. Nigeria boast one of the highest rates of crypto adoption and forced the CBN to revise its stance toward digital assets. Bringing Cryptocurrencies Under the Purview of the SEC According to Forbes’ reporting, “the new law provides long-awaited regulatory clarity, bringing Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), Digital Asset Operators (DAOPs), and Digital Asset Exchanges under the direct oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).” Nigerian financial analyst Olumide Adesina spoke to Forbes Africa, highlighting the importance of this legislation, stating: “The regulation brings clarity and affirms the input of digital assets in the Nigerian capital market.” Adesina adds: “The law would likely attract huge players in the global industry to engage directly by setting up a physical presence with Africa’s biggest crypto market. Finally, it will also widen tokenization usage built on traditional assets and intensify interest among the younger populace.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The recovery was aided by technical support near Bitcoin’s 365-day moving average at approximately $76.1K. Despite this technical rebound, overall investor sentiment remains weak. Looking ahead, Bitcoin may face resistance around $84K and $96K, suggesting that any rally is still vulnerable to reversal if bullish conditions do not continue to improve. An April 10 CryptoQuant Report showed that crypto markets experienced renewed volatility this week as the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause by President Trump temporarily alleviated escalating trade tensions, while overall bullish sentiment remains subdued. Early in the week, the uncertainty driven by retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and the EU pushed Bitcoin into a sharp sell-off, dropping its price from approximately $84K to a five-month low near $74K. Digital Assets Sensitive to International Policy Shifts This decline was a direct response to the escalating trade war, underlining the sensitivity of the digital asset market to international policy shifts. Following the initial plunge, prices rebounded shortly after on April 9. President Trump’s tariff pause announcement, which applies a universal 10% tariff on all countries except China—where tariffs were increased to 125%—played an important role in restoring investor confidence and recovering much of the lost value. Global markets responded sharply after @POTUS announced a major escalation in his trade stance toward China. #Tariffs #Trump https://t.co/GDJxWUZDdg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 9, 2025 Technical analysis shows that Bitcoin’s price bounce was supported by its 365-day moving average (MA) , which currently stands at around $76.1K. Past observations in August 2024, July 2021, and December 2021 further confirm that a sustained drop below the 365-day MA could signal the commencement of a prolonged bear market. Market Sentiment Remains Notably Pessimistic, Says CryptoQuant While Bitcoin found temporary stability above this average, caution persists among traders regarding its long-term implications. Despite the technical rebound, market sentiment remains notably pessimistic. According to CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index, Bitcoin currently registers a reading of 10, its lowest since November 2022. This depressed score reflects an overall cautious investor outlook and indicates a low probability of an enduring rally, suggesting that the recent recovery might be more of a short-term correction than the onset of a bullish trend. CryptoQuant reports should this score continue to linger below the 40 mark, market conditions could resemble those seen in previous bearish cycles. Looking ahead, if Bitcoin’s upward trajectory sustains, it may encounter resistance at near-term price levels of around $84K and subsequently at the $96K zone. These resistance levels have historically served as markers within this trading cycle, potentially acting as barriers should the present rally fail to translate into a sustained shift in market sentiment. Overall, while the tariff pause has provided a temporary breather, the market remains cautious, eagerly awaiting more robust bullish signals.

With Bitcoin and Ethereum stealing the spotlight, these 10 lesser-known or underappreciated coins could deliver up to 50x returns by year-end. Leading the charge are XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE, but the full list offers a mix of hidden gems and established names with massive upside. Here’s why these are the best cryptos to buy in 2025 for outsized gains. 1. XRP (Ripple) Current Price: ~$2.12 2025 Target: $106 (50x) Potential ROI: 5,000% XRP is an old-timer with new energy. After settlement with the SEC it is trading for $2.12, with analysts targeting $10–$15 as a conservative target. A parabolic 50x rise toward $106 could happen if ETF approval does hit and institutional adoption continues expanding. It maintains a formidable choice for cross-border payments at 1,500 transactions per second speed. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (Presale) Current Price: $0.0002804 Listing Price: $0.007 2025 Target: $0.014 (50x from listing) Potential ROI: 4,900% (from current presale) The Presale Star For 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE. Having already secured $5.7M and more than 10,000 holders, it’s going to launch at $0.007 — a 2,397% increase from its current price of $0.0002804. Traders are predicting a huge price increase to $0.014 by the end of the year, a whopping 50x from its listing price, both due to its DeFi lending model and hype as the classic best altcoin with 100x potential. 3. SHIBA INU (SHIB) Current Price: ~$0.00002 2025 Target: $0.001 Potential ROI: 4,900% While SHIB never became a moonshot, its massive community — along with token-burning efforts — keeps it ever in play. While a 50x rally to $0.001 is some way to go, it remains a top meme coin to keep a close eye on if meme coin mania returns. 4. Solana (SOL) Current Price: ~$119 2025 Target: $5,950 Potential ROI: 4,900% With Solana’s high throughput chain and institutional support, $450+ is conservative. This would take a 50x from the moonshot to $5,950, but it is a serious contender as it boasts strong fundamentals of its own. 5. Pepecoin (PEPE) Current Price: ~$0.0000014 2025 Target: $0.00007 Potential ROI: 4,900% PEPE is a meme coin that lives and dies by meme coin volatility. The price of $0.00007 would represent a 50x rise from $0.000014 and speculation is as high as prices of $0.00007 in 2025 assuming that the community hype and momentum build from in the crypto market. 6. Cardano (ADA) Current Price: ~$0.80 2025 Target: $40 Potential ROI: 4,900% The ecosystem for smart contracts on Cardano is expanding. $0.951 may be a base prediction, but a 50x leap to $40 is possible with some breakthroughs in adoption. 7. Hedera (HBAR) Current Price: ~$0.10 2025 Target: $5 Potential ROI: 4,900 At $0.10, HBAR’s enterprise-grade blockchain is undervalued. A $5 price is a steep climb 50x, but not impossible with broader corporate adoption. 8. Chainlink (LINK) Current Price: ~$13 2025 Target: $650 Potential ROI: 4,900% Chainlink’s privacy oracle network is vital for DeFi. A huge bull run would be required for the price to 50x to $650, but it has utility that could bear big upside. 9. Stellar (XLM) Current Price: ~$0.12 2025 Target: $6 Potential ROI: 4,900% XLM’s focus on cheap, fast payments mirrors XRP. A 50x leap to $6 could materialize with global remittance growth. 10. Kaspa (KAS) Current Price: ~$0.18 2025 Target: $9 Potential ROI: 4,900% Kaspa’s innovative blockDAG tech is flying under the radar. A 50x surge to $9 is within reach if adoption accelerates. Final Thoughts OVER +2532% ROI – ACT NOW – PRESALE SELLING OUT That’s why XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE top this list. XRP delivers calm with big opportunity, MAGACOIN FINANCE still in presale under $0.0003 is the ultimate low-bore shot to be in crypto under $1 with upside. SHIB, SOL, and PEPE are meme and tech-friendly, while ADA, HBAR, LINK, XLM, and KAS are underrated gems. In 2025, you could be enjoying your 50x all thanks to presale prices like MAGACOIN FINANCE—act quickly as we know presales never last!

In a new YouTube video , Cowen tells his 891,000 subscribers that ETH’s recent price points look like a 10x reflection of what it tracked six years ago. “Ethereum’s going through the same structure that it went through in 2019, but the reason why the cycle feels so different is because it has taken place over a much longer period of time. But there’s a reason why it’s taking place over a much longer period of time, and the reason is that quantitative tightening has lasted a lot longer. Remember last cycle, QT ended in the pre-halving year. We’re now not that far from being halfway through the post-halving year and QT still hasn’t ended, but it probably will within the next few months.” Quantitative tightening (QT) is when central banks shrink their budgets to reduce the amount of money circulation in the economy as a means of countering inflation. Cowen says a document summarizing a Federal Open Market Committee meeting in January suggests the U.S. Federal Reserve might end QT by mid-2025. Ethereum is trading at $1,652 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 12% in the past 24 hours. ?

43191000,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-to-ship-10000-miners-by-2025-while-fartcoin-defies-bear-market-doge-dips-to-monthly-low/,1744329644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/43191000.jpeg,"BlockDAG To Ship 10,000+ Miners By 2025 While Fartcoin Defies Bear Market & DOGE Dips To Monthly Low",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-to-ship-10000-miners-by-2025-while-fartcoin-defies-bear-market-doge-dips-to-monthly-low/,"In a market dominated by volatility, three distinct crypto narratives are emerging. Fartcoin, a meme token on Solana, has defied the broader downtrend with a 135% YTD gain and strong on-chain signals like reduced exchange balances and resilient whale holdings. Dogecoin, despite falling 20% in 24 hours, is perched at a crucial support level, with technicals hinting at a possible rebound. But while both coins stir short-term speculation, BlockDAG is quietly rewriting what early-stage execution looks like. With over 10,000 X-Series miners ready to deploy and a $212M+ presale already 2,380% up, BDAG isn’t waiting for market sentiment—it’s building its own demand engine. Real utility, hardware integration, and strategic exchange listings put it in a category beyond hype. In a crowd of maybes, BlockDAG looks like the first crypto of 2025 that’s walking the talk. Fartcoin Defies Market Crash—Is a 160% Rally to $1.22 Coming Soon? Fartcoin is showing strength as markets tumble, rising 35% from its monthly low to trade at $0.4755. While major coins like Bitcoin and Solana declined, Fartcoin has jumped 135% from its year-to-date low. On-chain data suggests growing investor confidence. Exchange balances have dropped 3.62% in a week, and 2 million FART coins have moved to self-custody—signaling reduced sell pressure. With over 113,000 holders staying firm and top profit wallets holding their positions, bullish sentiment remains intact. Technically, the chart shows a forming cup and handle pattern, a signal that could drive the price to $1.22—around 160% above current levels. However, a drop below $0.355 would cancel the bullish case and open room for a fall to $0.20. For now, Fartcoin stands out in a weak market, and all eyes are on whether it can break out. Dogecoin Falls to $0.13—Is a Major Rebound Just Around the Corner? Dogecoin dropped over 20% in the past 24 hours, sliding to $0.1300 as the crypto market reels from broader sell-offs. Still, analysts say this level is critical. If DOGE holds here, it could mark the base for a future rally. Momentum indicators like the MACD and RSI are showing early signs of recovery, with RSI bouncing back above 50 and MACD flipping bullish. Short-term resistance lies at $0.1400–$0.1450, while a dip below $0.1350 could trigger further losses. DOGE’s performance is closely tied to Bitcoin, which means its next move depends heavily on overall market sentiment. Traders are watching for stability and volume to confirm any bounce. For buyers eyeing a discount entry, this could be a key setup—if DOGE holds the line, it may signal the start of a sharp reversal. BlockDAG to Ship 10,000 Miners—Is This Your Last Chance to Mine BDAG Before It Explodes? BlockDAG is gearing up for a major milestone with nearly 10,000 X-Series miners—X30 and X100—ready for global shipment ahead of its mainnet launch. This marks a key step in expanding the project’s infrastructure and community access. The X30 is tailored for home users, quietly mining up to 600 BDAG daily with low power use. For high-volume mining, the X100 delivers up to 2,000 BDAG per day, making it an ideal choice for serious miners looking to maximize returns. With BDAG currently priced at just $0.0248 and a $1 target forecasted for 2025, miners could see returns as high as 3,900%. So far, BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $212.5 million, with 19+ billion BDAG coins sold across 27 batches. Since launching at $0.001, BDAG has surged 2,380%, and prices continue climbing with each new batch. As exchange listings approach and hardware rolls out, this could be the most strategic moment to enter. For anyone asking what the best crypto to mine in 2025 is, BlockDAG’s fast-paced delivery, real utility, and bullish projections make it a front-runner worth serious attention. Takeaway Dogecoin may still ride the meme wave, and Fartcoin could surprise with short-term gains, but neither has matched BlockDAG’s combination of infrastructure, tokenomics, and user growth. While Doge awaits momentum and Fartcoin relies on market sentiment, BlockDAG is deploying hardware, running a live testnet, and preparing for CEX listings—transforming itself from presale hype into operational reality. With miners earning up to 2,000 BDAG daily and prices at just $0.0248, the opportunity window is narrowing. Should BDAG hit its projected $1 target, early miners and buyers could realize gains of nearly 4,000%. This isn’t just a speculative swing—it’s a coordinated roadmap supported by product delivery and ecosystem incentives. For anyone eyeing serious upside in 2025, BlockDAG offers more than a token—it offers a head start in a network already gaining traction. In the race ahead, BDAG may not just keep up—it could lead.

43190766,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=708670,1744329650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43190766.jpeg,Perpetual futures may soon hit U.S. markets as Trump-era crypto shift gains steam,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/perpetual-futures-may-soon-hit-u-s-markets/,"Perpetual futures contracts—a mainstay of offshore digital asset exchanges—may finally become accessible to U.S.-based traders under regulated platforms. Industry experts say that a regulatory shift under President Donald Trump’s administration is clearing the way for these high-risk instruments to be available in the U.S. market for the first time. Perpetual futures , also known as “perps,” enable investors to bet on cryptocurrency’s price without having the underlying assets. These contracts don’t expire like traditional futures and are settled every eight hours, which allows them to track spot prices closely. They also provide traders with an option to leverage position up to 100 times—an alluring option to risk-on retail investors. In global terms, perps control cryptocurrency trading volume, frequently comprising the greater portion of the action on exchanges like Binance, where daily volumes can surpass $70 billion, vastly outdoing spot market activity. Yet, due to their prevalence, regulators ban these instruments from U.S. retail investors. That may soon change. On March 28, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced the withdrawal of two long-standing staff advisories, widely speculated as a further alignment of the regulatory treatment of crypto-derivatives and traditional financial products. Separately, Coinbase Derivatives, part of crypto giant Coinbase Global Inc., has said it is working to bring perpetual-style futures contracts to the U.S. in what would be a first-of-its-kind offering in that country. Trump’s policies speed up regulatory easing Regions say that President Trump’s administration has brought a clear break from the hard-line posture of its predecessors. In recent months, officials have dismissed several lawsuits against crypto companies, hosted a White House summit on digital assets, and even trained national token reserves. Trump has also expressed support for stablecoins, allowing for a more permissive approach toward the wider digital asset framework. Legal experts say an upcoming change is in sight. The clear direction of travel was toward the U.S. permitting crypto-based derivatives, so in his view, it was only a matter of time, said Gabe Rosenberg, partner at law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Having been introduced by BitMEX in 2016, perpetual futures have long been a favorite instrument for offshore investors and those wanting exposure to crypto without holding the digital assets themselves. They also provide improved hedging capabilities, as traders are not required to roll over contracts regularly. Adam McCarthy, an analyst at Kaiko, said that the perps market has been the heart of crypto speculation and pricing for almost a decade. U.S.-based crypto platforms are gearing up for a derivatives rush with the opening of the regulatory door. It is also in advanced discussions to acquire the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, one of the largest in the world, in a deal that would value the company at between $4 billion and $5 billion. Kraken, a competing exchange, indicated its ambitions in the futures space when it recently announced its $1.5 billion acquisition of retail trading outfit NinjaTrader. Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, noted that perpetual futures represent a simple and accessible mechanism for users to speculate with leverage. He pointed to the thrills of meme stocks, zero-day options, and weekly expiries as near-definitive evidence of the appetite for U.S. retail investment risk moving upward on an upward trajectory. Institutional players are also closely observing. The instruments could represent a “great unlock” for larger firms, as they would fit with existing risk and operational frameworks, said Jason Urban, global head of trading at Galaxy Digital. Retail investors challenge regulatory barriers as demand grows There are questions about how U.S. regulators will deal with perps and the risks that are part and parcel of using them, especially with a retail audience. They said any approval framework should include leverage caps, position limits, and other risk controls. While institutional entities can legally swap crypto on registered exchanges, retail remains heavily restricted, Rosenberg tweeted. The main problem, he added, is the lack of clear legislation over what’s eligible for margin and the long-term regulatory certainty. In addition, perps are competing for investor attention with other U.S.-regulated crypto products, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and CME futures. ETFs provide a passive way to get crypto exposure but don’t provide the leverage and immediacy of perpetual futures. Finally, leveraged ETFs afford daily balancing/rebalancing and transaction fees, which will eat into returns over time. Newhouse noted the active trader as the main target market in this case (passive investors already have sufficient coverage in the ETF), adding that real-time market exposure seekers would find perps more cost-effective and efficient. Although some Americans already access perps through VPNs and offshore accounts, the real opportunity lies in attracting new flows through regulated domestic platforms. As regulatory signals get more positive and market infrastructure develops frenzied, it’s only a matter of time before American investors are given legal access to the core of the global crypto derivatives market.

In a Thursday letter to Blanche, six Senate Democrats — Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) — blasted his decision to cut the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) as “giv[ing] a free pass to cryptocurrency money launderers.” The Senators called Blanche’s directive that DOJ staff no longer pursue cases against crypto exchanges, mixers or offline wallets “for the acts of their end users” or bring criminal charges for regulatory violations in cases involving crypto, including violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), “nonsensical.” “By abdicating DOJ’s responsibility to enforce federal criminal law when violations involve digital assets, you are suggesting that virtual currency exchanges, mixers, and other entities dealing in digital assets need not fulfill their [anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism] obligations, creating a systemic vulnerability in the digital assets sector,” the lawmakers wrote. “Drug traffickers, terrorists, fraudsters, and adversaries will exploit this vulnerability on a large scale.” In his memo to DOJ staff on Monday evening, Blanche cited U.S. President Donald Trump’s January executive order on crypto, which promised to bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry, as the reason for his decision. “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator,” Blanche wrote, adding that the agency will “no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that have the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets while President Trump's actual regulators do this work outside the punitive criminal justice framework.” Instead, Blanche urged DOJ staff to focus their enforcement efforts on prosecuting criminals who use “victimize digital asset investors” or those who use crypto in the furtherance of other criminal schemes, like organized crime, gang financing, and terrorism. Read more: DOJ Axes Crypto Unit As Trump’s Regulatory Pullback Continues For the Senate Democrats, however, Blanche’s claim doesn’t quite cut the mustard. “You claim in your memo that DOJ will continue to prosecute those who use cryptocurrencies to perpetrate crimes. But allowing the entities that enable these crimes — such as cryptocurrency kiosk operators — to operate outside the federal regulatory framework without fear of prosecution will only result in more Americans being exploited,” the lawmakers wrote. The lawmakers urged Blanche to reconsider his decision to dismantle NCET, calling it a “critical resource for state and local law enforcement who often lack the technical knowledge and skill to investigate cryptocurrency related crimes.” New York Attorney General Letitia James raised similar concerns in her own letter to Congress on Thursday, urging lawmakers to pass federal legislation to regulate the crypto markets. Though her letter itself made no mention of Blanche’s memo or the shuttering of NCET, a press release from her office highlighted that her letter “comes after the [DOJ] announced the dismantling of federal criminal cryptocurrency fraud enforcement, making a robust regulatory framework all the more critical.”",Policy|Sen.

The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance shared the guidance for issuers urging clear disclosures for business description, risk factors, and financial statements. SEC Drops Fresh Guidance For Issuers Of Crypto Asset Securities The US SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance has released disclosure requirements for securities in crypto-asset markets. According to the press release , the Division notes that disclosure requirements are mere guidance for issuers designed to smoothen the curve for market participants. Under the requirements, the US SEC urges securities issuers to describe their businesses in clear language. Per the guidance, the issuers should disclose information on revenue generation, timelines for network development, procedures for validating transactions, and network governance procedures. Furthermore, the US SEC makes a case for specifying risk factors relating to the issuer’s business operations. Other risk disclosures will relate to the security, its volatility, liquidity, and supply. The Division specifies a “materially complete description” of the securities with issuers urged to spell out the rights of holders. Per the guidance, information around the technical specifications revolving around the crypto asset divisibility and smart contract functionalities. The Division’s guidance comes on the heels of the US Senate confirming Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. According to the division, the guidance will serve as a stopgap for issuers pending proper regulations by the Crypto Task Force. Securities Watchdog Provides Securities Clarity For Cryptocurrencies The Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Pierce, is spearheading the push for disclosure requirements for securities issuers. However, Pierce declared support for the new guidance by the Division of Corporation Finance. “We’re not saying your crypto assets are securities, but if they are (and we’re working on clarifying that) or your company is involved in the cryptocurrencies, here’s some disclosure guidance,” said Pierce on X. The disclosure guidance extends to financial statements, exhibits, and details of significant employees. The US SEC has rolled out an avalanche of securities clarifications since the start of the year. Last week, the SEC clarified that dollar-backed 1:1 stablecoins are not securities since they are used primarily for payments. Previously, the US SEC exempted proof-of-work mining from securities obligations. In a remarkable development, the SEC clarified that securities regulations do not apply to memecoins.

Imagine a world where your AI chatbot remembers your past conversations, making interactions feel incredibly personal and efficient. That future is closer than ever as OpenAI rolls out a groundbreaking ChatGPT memory feature . This update promises to transform how we interact with AI, offering a more tailored and relevant experience. Let’s dive into what this personalized AI means for you and the future of conversational technology. Unveiling the Revolutionary ChatGPT Memory Feature OpenAI has just dropped a game-changer: ChatGPT memory feature , designed to make your conversations with the AI chatbot feel more natural and context-aware. Forget repeating details in every new chat – ChatGPT can now reference your previous interactions to provide more relevant and personalized responses. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental shift towards creating a truly conversational and intuitive AI chatbot experience. Here’s a breakdown of what this exciting update brings: Contextual Conversations: ChatGPT will now consider your past chats when responding, eliminating the need to re-explain context repeatedly. Personalized Responses: Expect answers tailored to your specific needs and preferences based on your conversation history. This moves beyond generic responses towards truly personalized AI interactions. Enhanced Features: The memory feature enhances text, voice, and even image generation within ChatGPT, providing a more cohesive and integrated experience. User Control: Worried about privacy? OpenAI provides robust controls. You can disable the memory feature, manage specific saved memories, or use Temporary Chats for conversations you don’t want stored. How Does the ChatGPT Memory Feature Work? The core idea is simple yet powerful: ChatGPT learns from your conversations, just like you would in a human interaction. Instead of treating each chat as a fresh start, ChatGPT now retains context from prior discussions. This allows for a smoother, more efficient, and ultimately more human-like dialogue. Think of it as building a rapport with your AI chatbot over time. Let’s illustrate with an example: Without Memory: User: “I’m interested in learning about Bitcoin mining. Can you explain it?” ChatGPT: “Bitcoin mining is the process… [explains Bitcoin mining]” User (in a new chat): “What are the energy consumption concerns related to Bitcoin?” ChatGPT: “Bitcoin mining does consume a significant amount of energy… [explains energy concerns]” With Memory: User: “I’m interested in learning about Bitcoin mining. Can you explain it?” ChatGPT: “Bitcoin mining is the process… [explains Bitcoin mining]” User (in a new chat): “What are the energy consumption concerns related to Bitcoin?” ChatGPT: “Building on our previous conversation about Bitcoin mining, you’re right to be concerned about energy consumption… [explains energy concerns, referencing the prior topic]” See the difference? With the ChatGPT memory feature , the second interaction is more fluid and connected to the first. This subtle shift drastically improves the user experience, making ChatGPT feel less like a tool and more like a helpful assistant. Who Gets to Experience Personalized AI First? Initially, the ChatGPT memory feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus subscribers. However, there’s a geographical caveat. Users in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland will have to wait a bit longer due to pending regulatory reviews. OpenAI has assured these regions that they are working towards compliance and aim to bring the feature to them eventually. For free ChatGPT users, there’s no immediate news. OpenAI is currently focused on the paid tiers, but hopefully, this powerful personalized AI feature will become widely accessible in the future. Privacy and Control: Addressing Concerns Understandably, some users might be wary of an AI chatbot storing their conversation history. OpenAI has proactively addressed these privacy concerns by providing users with significant control over the ChatGPT memory feature . Here’s how you can manage your ChatGPT memory: Opt-Out: You can completely disable the memory feature in ChatGPT’s settings. Manage Memories: You can view and delete specific saved memories, giving you granular control over what ChatGPT retains. Temporary Chats: For sensitive or private conversations, use the Temporary Chat option. These chats are not stored and won’t contribute to ChatGPT’s memory. Inquire About Memory: You can even ask ChatGPT directly, “What do you remember about me?” to see what information it has stored. These controls are crucial for building trust and ensuring users feel comfortable with this new level of conversational AI personalization. ChatGPT Memory vs. Google Gemini Memory: A Quick Comparison It’s worth noting that Google Gemini also introduced a similar memory feature earlier this year. While both aim to enhance user experience through contextual awareness, there might be subtle differences in implementation and capabilities. Both updates signal a broader industry trend towards more sophisticated and user-centric AI chatbot interactions. Feature OpenAI ChatGPT Memory Google Gemini Memory Availability (Initial Rollout) ChatGPT Pro/Plus users (excluding some European regions) Gemini users (specific tiers and regions may vary) User Control Opt-out, manage specific memories, temporary chats Likely similar controls, details may vary Integration Text, voice, and image generation Likely multi-modal as well Purpose Personalize conversations, improve context relevance Personalize conversations, improve context relevance The Future of Conversational AI is Here OpenAI’s update to include a ChatGPT memory feature is more than just a minor improvement; it’s a significant leap forward in the evolution of conversational AI . By enabling ChatGPT to remember past interactions, OpenAI is paving the way for more intuitive, efficient, and genuinely helpful AI assistants. This move towards personalized AI promises to reshape how we interact with technology, making AI less transactional and more conversational. As AI chatbot technology continues to advance, features like memory will become increasingly crucial for creating truly seamless and user-friendly experiences.

Though the company did not admit to any findings, the firm agreed to pay the fine and keep NYDFS’s preferred independent monitor for a year. In addition, Block had already faced fines and settlements in a similar vein, including a $55 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and an $80 million settlement with other state regulators. Block reaches an agreement with the New York Department of Financial Services to settle the dispute Just recently, the New York Department of Financial Services imposed a $ 40 million fine on Block following an investigation that revealed Block had neglected to monitor and promptly report suspicious transactions and failed to perform sufficient due diligence on its clients, the agency said in a consent order. Additionally, it was alleged that Block neglected to screen and monitor high-risk Bitcoin transactions. The department discovered violations of laws about consumer protection. Concerning this, in a statement, Block said, “Following our recent settlement with our other state money transmission regulators, we have now agreed with the final remaining state money transmission regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services, to resolve the matter principally related to Cash App’s past compliance program.” According to the reports from sources Based in Oakland, California, Block has consented to pay the fine and retain the independent monitor that NYDFS had preferred for a year, even though they disagree with all of the findings stated in the order. Block’s inability to keep up with its rapid user growth has resulted in multiple fines The current penalty follows a previous $80 million settlement in January 2025 with 48 U.S. state regulators over similar violations. In that case, regulators found that Block’s services could be exploited for money laundering and terrorism financing due to insufficient compliance measures .​ In a different case, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Block to pay up to $120 million in compensation to consumers who were harmed in January and $55 million in civil money penalties for failing to address fraud on the Cash App platform adequately. In a February filing, the company said it was still negotiating with NYDFS on matters similar to the settlement offer it had received a month earlier. To address this, the order highlighted that Block’s incapacity to keep up with the rapid user growth it experienced was the root cause of its alleged shortcomings. Since then, the firm has shifted its focus from prioritizing user growth to offering banking services to its established base. Furthermore, in a statement, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris mentioned that to safeguard customers and the financial system’s integrity, all financial institutions, whether traditional financial services firms or new cryptocurrency platforms, were supposed to adhere to the set guidelines strictly.

The country’s residents, ranked lowest amongst 30 in terms of life satisfaction in a recent survey, could be given between ¥30,000 and ¥50,000. Anyone who really knows politics knows that countries do not act, individuals do. And the individuals ruling both Japan and the US in the guise of “government,” seem to agree that fiscal recklessness at the expense of the populace is A-OK. Japan’s LDP has just floated the idea of revving up the money printer to toss a few bread crumbs to struggling Japanese residents, in light of Donald Trump’s (currently “paused”) tariff trade war on the country’s businesses. “We have conveyed our concern and strongly asked (the United States) to review the tariff measures at various levels,” chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi was quoted by local media as saying at a Thursday press conference. The money giveaway idea is also in answer to ongoing inflation in Japan, sources “familiar with the matter” reportedly said Wednesday (JST). While Japan’s prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has said Trump’s 24% tariffs are “regrettable” in spite of the current 90-day pause, some residents view this concern as insincere. The PM loves dumping money into the U.S., and unmitigated spending when it comes to Japan’s defense budget. Ishiba has recently vowed to pour a staggering one trillion yen into U.S. initiatives, and to boost military spending in Japan, and military alliance with the United States government. So what would the cash handouts look like? Well, between about ¥30,000 and ¥50,000 yen, or $200-$350 USD at current exchange rates. Not exactly a big help to people who cannot even afford rice anymore, and a reckless endeavor considering the current weakness of the yen, and the already loose money printing machine. Critically leading up to the current economic weakness was the mass creation of cash from thin air during the so-called “coronavirus pandemic,” as well. The cash handout plan reportedly emerged after Hayashi asked LDP policy maker Itsunori Onodera to come up with some options to support the economy. Komeito, the LDP’s junior coalition partner, suggested Thursday that tax cuts would be a more effective measure, with the helicopter money as a mere stop-gap. Amid all the economic woes, Japan’s residents have notably come in last place in a survey on happiness with quality of life, conducted across 30 countries. According to the survey , “the most common reason [Japan residents are unhappy] was their ‘economic situation,’ cited by 64%.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Speaking at a recent Cabinet meeting, Trump articulated that these changes would be ‘costly and problematic,’ signaling a potentially turbulent period ahead for international trade and financial markets. For those invested in or closely monitoring the cryptocurrency space, such pronouncements are crucial. Why? Because broader economic policies, especially those concerning trade and tariffs, can have cascading effects on market sentiment, investor behavior, and ultimately, the landscape of digital assets. Decoding Trump’s Tariff Policy Stance: What’s the Fuss About? Donald Trump’s approach to tariff policy has always been assertive, often prioritizing what he perceives as American interests first. His recent statements are a continuation of this stance, emphasizing a willingness to disrupt established trade norms. But what exactly did he say, and what are the possible implications? ‘Costly and Problematic’: Trump didn’t mince words, labeling the impending changes as potentially detrimental. This suggests he acknowledges the short-term pain that could accompany these policy shifts. ‘No One Else Had Taken It On’: This statement underscores Trump’s self-proclaimed role as a disruptor of the status quo. He frames his tariff policies as necessary actions that previous administrations were unwilling to undertake. ‘Difficult Transition, Positive End Result’: Here lies a glimmer of optimism, albeit couched in the acknowledgment of near-term difficulties. Trump believes that while the transition will be challenging, the ultimate outcome of his tariff policy changes will be beneficial. These points, as reported by Walter Bloomberg’s economic news account on X, paint a picture of a leader doubling down on his trade strategies, despite potential economic headwinds. But what does this mean for the average investor, and more specifically, for those in the crypto market? The Economic Impact of Trump Tariffs: Beyond the Headlines To truly understand the potential ramifications, we need to delve deeper into the economic impact of tariff policies. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are designed to protect domestic industries by making imported products more expensive. However, the reality is far more complex and often involves unintended consequences. Potential Positive Impacts (According to Proponents): Boosting Domestic Industries: Tariffs can make domestically produced goods more competitive, potentially leading to increased production and job creation within the country imposing the tariffs. National Security: In certain sectors deemed critical for national security, tariffs can reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, strengthening domestic capabilities. Negotiating Leverage: Tariffs can be used as a tool in trade negotiations, pressuring other countries to reduce their own trade barriers or address other trade-related concerns. Potential Negative Impacts (The Concerns): Increased Consumer Prices: Tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday products. This can lead to inflation and reduce purchasing power. Retaliatory Tariffs: Imposing tariffs often invites retaliatory measures from other countries, leading to trade wars where multiple countries impose tariffs on each other’s goods. This can severely disrupt global trade flows and harm businesses on all sides. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, forcing businesses to find alternative, potentially less efficient, and more costly sources for inputs. Reduced Economic Growth: Trade wars and increased costs due to tariffs can dampen economic growth, both domestically and globally. Uncertainty surrounding trade policy can also deter investment. The economic impact of these policies is a highly debated topic, with economists holding diverse views on the net effect. The complexity arises from the interconnectedness of the global economy, where actions in one area can have far-reaching and often unpredictable consequences. Trade Policy Under Scrutiny: Navigating the Shifting Sands Trade policy is not static; it’s a dynamic field constantly evolving in response to geopolitical events, economic shifts, and political ideologies. Trump’s remarks indicate a potential for further significant changes in U.S. trade policy , which could have profound implications for the global economic order. Consider these key aspects of current trade policy discussions: Aspect Description Potential Impact Protectionism vs. Free Trade The ongoing debate between policies that prioritize domestic industries (protectionism through tariffs, quotas, etc.) and those that advocate for open markets and reduced trade barriers (free trade). Direction of trade policy significantly impacts global trade flows, economic growth, and market sentiment. A shift towards protectionism could increase market volatility. Geopolitical Tensions Trade policy is increasingly intertwined with geopolitical considerations, used as a tool to exert influence or address national security concerns. Geopolitical tensions can lead to unpredictable trade policy changes, creating uncertainty and potentially impacting specific industries and markets. Supply Chain Resilience Recent global events have highlighted the vulnerability of global supply chains, leading to discussions about diversification and regionalization of production. Trade policy can be used to incentivize or disincentivize certain supply chain configurations, potentially reshaping global manufacturing and logistics networks. Technological Advancements New technologies like automation and e-commerce are transforming trade patterns and raising new questions for trade policy regarding digital trade, data flows, and intellectual property. Adapting trade policy to the digital age is crucial for fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition in the evolving global economy. Navigating this complex landscape requires businesses and investors to stay informed, adaptable, and prepared for potential shifts in trade policy that could reshape the global economic environment. Market Volatility on the Horizon? The Crypto Connection The cryptocurrency market, while often perceived as detached from traditional finance, is not immune to broader economic trends. In fact, events like potential shifts in tariff policy and the resulting market volatility can indirectly influence the crypto space in several ways: How Tariffs and Economic Uncertainty Can Impact Crypto: Safe Haven Asset Narrative: In times of economic uncertainty and traditional market volatility , some investors may turn to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, viewing them as ‘safe haven’ assets, similar to gold. Increased demand could drive up prices. Inflationary Pressures: If tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and inflation, as many economists predict, this could further strengthen the narrative of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, potentially attracting more investment. Risk-Off Sentiment: Conversely, significant market volatility in traditional markets, triggered by trade policy uncertainties, could lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Investors might reduce exposure to perceived riskier assets in favor of safer havens like government bonds or cash. Global Economic Slowdown: If Trump’s tariff policy changes contribute to a global economic slowdown, this could negatively impact all markets, including crypto. Reduced economic activity and business investment could dampen overall market sentiment. Currency Fluctuations: Trade policy shifts can influence currency exchange rates. Significant fluctuations in major currencies could indirectly impact the value of cryptocurrencies, particularly in trading pairs involving those currencies. Therefore, while the direct link between tariff policy and crypto prices might not always be immediately apparent, the broader economic impact and resulting market volatility create a complex web of influences that crypto investors need to be aware of. Actionable Insights: Staying Ahead in a Tariff-Sensitive World Given the potential for significant changes in tariff policy and the ensuing market volatility , what steps can investors and businesses take to navigate this uncertain environment? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor news and analysis related to trade policy , economic indicators, and market developments. Reliable sources like economic news outlets and financial analysis platforms are crucial. Diversify Investments: Diversification across asset classes, including a mix of traditional and alternative investments like crypto, can help mitigate risk in volatile market conditions. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. For crypto investors, this might include setting stop-loss orders, diversifying crypto holdings, and understanding the risks associated with different cryptocurrencies. Scenario Planning: Develop contingency plans for different economic scenarios. Consider how your investments and business might be affected by various trade policy outcomes and adjust your strategies accordingly. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial advisors and economic experts to gain deeper insights and personalized guidance on navigating the complexities of trade policy and market volatility . Conclusion: Navigating the Tariff Tightrope Donald Trump’s recent remarks serve as a stark reminder that tariff policy remains a potent and potentially disruptive force in the global economy. While the long-term outcomes of these policy shifts are uncertain, the immediate implications point towards potential market volatility and significant economic impact . For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding these broader economic trends is crucial. The crypto market, while innovative and often operating outside traditional financial norms, is still interconnected with the global economic landscape. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and acknowledging the potential for both challenges and opportunities, investors can navigate the complexities of a world increasingly shaped by evolving trade policy and its wide-reaching consequences.

Co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin has defined the company’s strategy for years. However, that strategy now faces a challenge after a recent SEC filing hinted at the possibility of MicroStrategy being forced to liquidate some of its Bitcoin holdings under financial pressure and the recent Bitcoin price crash. The implications could ripple beyond the company’s balance sheet and affect Bitcoin’s broader market. Mounting Debt, Negative Cash Flow, And The Bitcoin Lifeline MicroStrategy disclosed several important financial vulnerabilities in a recent Form 8-K filed with the SEC. At the time of filing, the firm reported holding 528,185 BTC, acquired at an average purchase price of $67,458 per Bitcoin, for a total cost basis of approximately $35.63 billion. However, despite the massive size of its Bitcoin treasury, MicroStrategy admitted that its core enterprise software business has not been generating positive operational cash flow. The company is also shouldering $8.22 billion in debt and facing an annual contractual interest burden of $35.1 million. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns Bitcoin Price Could See Further Crash If It Falls Below This Level Although it has issued over $1.6 billion in preferred stock tied to substantial annual dividend obligations of $146.2 million, these liabilities are not being met. Instead, MicroStrategy explicitly outlined that it expects to rely on debt or equity financing to meet its obligations, and those efforts may become severely strained if Bitcoin’s price sharply declines. The report warns that if the market value of its holdings drops significantly, it could negatively affect the firm’s ability to raise funds. In such a situation, the company might be forced to sell Bitcoin at a loss. At the time the report was filed, BTC was trading just 13% above the company’s average purchase price. Because Bitcoin forms the majority of MicroStrategy’s assets, its balance sheet is intimately tied to the crypto’s price. As such, a dip below that level could create a chain reaction of falling stock prices and ultimately force selling pressure even on the price of Bitcoin itself. Michael Saylor’s Response: Staying The Course Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and former CEO, is one of the biggest proponents of Bitcoin and was influential in the company’s adoption of a Bitcoin strategy. Taking to social media platform X after the news of the report broke out, Saylor simply tweeted: “HODL,” a popular mantra among crypto purists that signals long-term conviction. Related Reading: Here’s How Much Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Lost After The BTC Price Crash The post has had over 1.4 million views on the platform and resonated with many bullish proponents, as seen in the comments section. He followed that with another tweet: “Bitcoin is the Best Idea. There is no Second Best.” At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $81,900, up by 6% in the past 24 hours. Even if MicroStrategy were to sell any Bitcoin at this point, it wouldn’t be the first sale of its holdings. Back on December 22, 2022, MicroStrategy sold 704 BTC for $11.8 million under similar circumstances.

Whispers from Handelsblatt, amplified by Walter Bloomberg on X, suggest that the European Union and China are engaging in high-stakes negotiations. The goal? To dismantle the existing EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. For those watching the pulse of global finance and tech – especially within the cryptocurrency space where disruptive innovation is the norm – this news is seismic. Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for the EV landscape, international trade, and perhaps even related sectors. Why Are EU China EV Tariffs Under Discussion? The current EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles are in place to protect European automakers from what is perceived as unfair competition. However, in a world increasingly focused on sustainability and the rapid adoption of EVs, protectionist measures can sometimes hinder progress. Here’s a breakdown of why these EU China EV tariffs are now being reconsidered: Geopolitical Realities: Global trade dynamics are constantly shifting. Dialogue and negotiation are often preferred over escalating trade tensions, especially between major economic powers like the EU and China. Economic Interdependence: Both the EU and China benefit from robust trade relations. A tariff war hurts both sides, impacting various industries and consumer prices. EV Market Growth: The global push for electric vehicles is undeniable. Removing tariffs could accelerate EV adoption by making them more affordable, potentially benefiting consumers worldwide. Industry Pressure: Some European automakers might be realizing that competition is inevitable and adapting to it, rather than relying solely on tariff protection, could be a more sustainable long-term strategy. The Potential Benefits of Removing EU China EV Tariffs If these EU China trade talks are successful and tariffs are indeed removed, the ripple effects could be significant. Let’s explore the potential upsides: Lower EV Prices for European Consumers: Chinese EVs are often more competitively priced. Removing tariffs could make them significantly more affordable for European buyers, accelerating the transition to electric mobility. Increased Competition and Innovation in the EV Market: Greater competition from Chinese manufacturers could spur European automakers to innovate faster, improve their offerings, and become more competitive globally. Boost to the Electric Vehicle Trade: Removing trade barriers can stimulate the overall electric vehicle trade between the EU and China, leading to increased volumes and potentially new collaborations. Positive Impact on Global Trade Relations: Successful negotiations could signal a move towards smoother international trade relations, which is crucial for global economic stability. Potential Benefits for Related Industries: The growth of the EV market benefits numerous ancillary industries, from battery manufacturing to charging infrastructure and even the demand for raw materials. Challenges and Considerations in EU China Trade Talks While the prospect of tariff removal is exciting, the path forward is not without its hurdles. The EU China trade talks will need to navigate several complex issues: Protection of European Automakers: European car manufacturers might voice concerns about being overwhelmed by cheaper Chinese imports. Balancing competition with the need to protect domestic industries is a delicate act. Fair Competition and Level Playing Field: Ensuring fair trade practices and addressing concerns about subsidies and state support for Chinese EV manufacturers will be crucial. Intellectual Property Rights: Protecting intellectual property and ensuring fair technology transfer are always key considerations in international trade agreements. Geopolitical Tensions: Broader geopolitical relations between the EU and China could influence the negotiations. External factors can always complicate trade discussions. Implementation and Timelines: Even if an agreement is reached, the practical implementation of tariff removal and the timelines involved will need to be carefully managed. Examples of Potential Impact on the EV Market To understand the potential impact, let’s consider some examples of how the EV market could be affected: Scenario Potential Impact Tariff Removal on BYD EVs BYD, a major Chinese EV manufacturer, could become significantly more competitive in the European market. Their affordable models could attract a large customer base. Increased European Investment in Chinese EV Tech European companies might increase investments and collaborations with Chinese EV technology firms to gain access to innovations and potentially lower production costs. Shift in Market Share The market share of Chinese EVs in Europe could increase, potentially leading to a reshuffling of the competitive landscape and forcing European brands to adapt more quickly. Acceleration of EV Adoption Lower prices and increased availability of EVs could accelerate the overall adoption rate of electric vehicles across Europe, contributing to environmental goals. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Changing Global Trade Landscape For investors, businesses, and consumers, the potential removal of EU China EV tariffs presents both opportunities and challenges. Here are some actionable insights: For Investors: Keep a close watch on EV stocks, battery manufacturers, and related industries in both Europe and China. Companies that can adapt to increased competition and capitalize on growing EV demand could see significant growth.

Exploring collaborations and strategic partnerships might also be beneficial. For Consumers: Be prepared for potentially lower EV prices and a wider range of electric vehicle options in the coming years. Stay informed about policy changes and market developments to make informed purchasing decisions. For Policymakers: Focus on creating a fair and competitive market environment while supporting the transition to sustainable transportation. Policies should encourage innovation and investment in the EV sector. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Global Trade and the EV Revolution The news of EU China trade talks to remove EV tariffs is more than just a trade negotiation; it’s a potential catalyst for a transformative shift in the global automotive industry and international trade relations. While challenges remain and the outcome is still uncertain, the implications are vast. For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, accustomed to rapid change and disruptive innovation, this development underscores the interconnectedness of global markets and the importance of staying ahead of the curve.

43192128,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148431,1744332604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: NY AG Demands Federal Crypto Rules to Safeguard Dollar and Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/federal-crypto-rules-dollar-investors/,"Is your crypto portfolio safe? New York Attorney General Letitia James is raising critical alarms, urging federal lawmakers to step in and establish a robust regulatory framework for the burgeoning digital asset market. Why? Because the current Wild West environment isn’t just risky for investors, it could pose a significant threat to the U.S. dollar itself. Let’s dive into why the NY AG is pushing for urgent federal crypto rules and what it means for you. Why is Federal Crypto Regulation Suddenly a Hot Topic? For years, the cryptocurrency industry has operated with a patchwork of state-level regulations, leading to confusion, loopholes, and frankly, a breeding ground for bad actors. AG James argues this fragmented approach is no longer sufficient. She points to several key concerns: Rampant Fraud: The crypto space has seen numerous scams, rug pulls, and fraudulent schemes that have cost investors billions. Without clear federal oversight, these activities are difficult to prevent and prosecute effectively. Financial Instability: The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, coupled with the lack of regulation, creates systemic risks that could spill over into the broader financial system. Recent crypto market crashes have highlighted this instability. Criminal Activity: Cryptocurrencies have been used for illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. Federal regulation is needed to enhance anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) efforts within the crypto ecosystem. Think of it like this: imagine driving on a highway with no traffic rules. Chaos, right? That’s essentially the current state of crypto regulation in the US. A federal framework aims to bring order and safety to this rapidly evolving market. The Looming Shadow Over the US Dollar: Is Bitcoin a Threat? One of the most striking aspects of AG James’ letter is her warning about US dollar dominance . She suggests that the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, could undermine the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. This isn’t just about economic pride; it has real-world implications. Why is the Dollar’s Dominance Important? Economic Power: The dollar’s reserve currency status gives the U.S. significant economic and geopolitical leverage. Lower Borrowing Costs: Global demand for dollars keeps interest rates lower in the U.S., benefiting businesses and consumers. International Trade: Most international trade is conducted in dollars, simplifying transactions and reducing exchange rate risks for US companies. AG James is essentially saying that if cryptocurrencies become too popular and displace the dollar in transactions or as a store of value, these advantages could erode. While some might see this as an exaggeration, it’s a concern that policymakers are increasingly taking seriously. The rise of stablecoins, often pegged to the dollar, adds another layer to this discussion. Stablecoin Onshoring: A Strategy to Protect National Interests? In her letter, AG James specifically advocated for stablecoin onshoring . What does this mean, and why is it important? Understanding Stablecoins: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They aim to combine the benefits of crypto (speed, efficiency) with the stability of traditional currencies. Onshoring vs. Offshoring: Onshoring: Refers to activities and operations being located within a country’s borders. In the context of stablecoins, it means encouraging or requiring stablecoin issuers to be based and regulated in the United States. Offshoring: The opposite – operations are located outside the country, often in jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. AG James’ call for stablecoin onshoring is rooted in the idea of maintaining control and oversight. By ensuring stablecoin issuers are based in the US and subject to federal regulation, authorities can better monitor and manage risks associated with these digital assets. This can be seen as a move to: Protect Investors: US-based and regulated stablecoin issuers would be subject to stricter consumer protection laws. Safeguard Financial Stability: Domestic regulation allows for better monitoring and mitigation of systemic risks. Maintain Dollar’s Influence: By promoting US-regulated stablecoins, the dollar’s role in the digital economy can be reinforced. Retirement Accounts and Crypto: A Risky Mix? Another key point in AG James’ letter was her advice against allowing retirement accounts to hold digital assets. This is a particularly sensitive issue as many individuals are looking for ways to diversify their retirement savings and potentially tap into the high-growth potential of crypto. The Argument Against Crypto in Retirement Accounts: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. Exposing retirement savings to such swings can be incredibly risky, especially for those nearing retirement. Lack of Regulation: The current regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of risk. Retirement accounts are meant to be safe and secure, and the crypto market doesn’t quite fit that bill yet. Complexity and Scams: The crypto space can be complex to navigate, and older individuals may be more vulnerable to scams and investment mistakes. While some argue that a small allocation to crypto could enhance long-term returns, AG James’ stance reflects a more cautious approach, prioritizing the protection of retirement savings. It’s a debate that highlights the tension between innovation and investor safety in the crypto world. What’s Next? The Road to Federal Crypto Rules AG James’ letter is a significant push for federal crypto regulation, adding to the growing chorus of voices calling for clearer rules of the road. But what are the potential next steps? Possible Actions: Action Description Likely Impact Congressional Legislation Congress could pass comprehensive legislation creating a federal regulatory framework for digital assets. Most impactful, would bring clarity and consistency across the US. SEC and CFTC Rulemaking The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could expand their existing regulations to cover more aspects of the crypto market. Incremental progress, but might still leave regulatory gaps and jurisdictional ambiguities. Executive Action The Biden administration could issue executive orders directing federal agencies to coordinate and prioritize crypto regulation. Can set the tone and direction, but legislative action is generally needed for comprehensive change. The path forward is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the pressure for federal crypto regulation is mounting. AG James’ intervention underscores the urgency and the potential consequences of inaction. Whether Congress will heed the call and act decisively remains to be seen. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Regulation? New York Attorney General Letitia James’ forceful appeal for federal crypto regulation marks a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset industry in the United States. Her warnings about fraud, financial instability, the threat to US dollar dominance , and the risks associated with retirement accounts holding crypto assets are serious and demand attention. The call for stablecoin onshoring further emphasizes the strategic importance of regulating this sector within national borders. As the crypto market continues to evolve and gain wider adoption, the need for a clear and consistent regulatory framework becomes ever more pressing. The debate is no longer about whether to regulate, but how and when. The decisions made by federal lawmakers in the coming months and years will profoundly shape the future of crypto in America and its role in the global financial landscape.

The country plans to leverage its unused electricity to power Bitcoin mining farms and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, creating new economic opportunities while addressing ongoing energy challenges. By offering this energy, the government offers an opportunity to pursue economic gain in emerging technology sectors instead of letting the surplus energy go to waste. The Pakistan Crypto Council, which was formed to capture the region’s potential in the international cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, is spearheading this initiative. Bilal Bin Saqib, the council’s CEO and adviser to the country’s finance minister, has led negotiations with international mining companies over the best ways to use excess energy to mine Bitcoin and run AI functions. The government will eliminate waste and gain the economic advantage of surplus energy by pinpointing the locations wherein surplus energy is most readily available. Areas with excess capacity for renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms, would make perfect locations for Bitcoin mining farms and AI data centers. The program can transform wasted electricity into high-value assets in the innovation economy, opening new frontiers for local industries and global influencers. Pakistan leverages renewable overflow to fuel digital ambitions Pakistan’s energy sector has long struggled with inefficiency and high costs due to an unstable national grid. Yet, despite these hurdles, the country must continuously generate surplus electricity during peak periods—especially when renewable sources like wind and solar produce more power than the grid can absorb. The lack of adequate infrastructure and energy storage means much of this excess electricity goes to waste. Adding to this challenge is the growing demand for renewable energy, which, although green and pleasant, creates a volatility of supply. Wind and solar energy, for example, can vary based on the weather and seasons. This can lead to periods of excess energy generation, followed by shortfalls when these renewable sources aren’t available to meet demand. Over the years, especially on such days when Pakistan is producing more electricity than it can consume, the question remains about how to efficiently utilize the excess power from the electricity grid in its peak times. This is where Bitcoin mining and AI data centers step in. These sectors are notorious for having high energy needs. Bitcoin mining uses a lot of power to run machines that solve complex algorithms to validate transactions on the blockchain. AI data centers to power machine-learning and deep-learning tech also use a lot of power. Pakistan aims to convert what was, for a long period, considered waste into an economic asset by placing these energy-intensive operations in energy-surplus areas. This would enable more efficient utilization of the country’s energy resources and satisfy the burgeoning global demand for crypto and AIs, which will drive the future of the global economy. Using this approach, Pakistan could become a global leader in the digital economy, luring in foreign direct investment and generating employment opportunities domestically. Essentially, Bitcoin mining has shown immense potential for economic growth, particularly when energy is being used efficiently. Pakistan taps Into AI and crypto to power economic transformation Artificial intelligence continues to be one of the fastest-growing tech sectors, revolutionizing industries from healthcare to finance and logistics. By supporting AI and cryptocurrency, Pakistan can diversify its economy, curb energy inefficiencies, and pave the way for long-term growth. With this global momentum, Pakistan is emerging as a rising player in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Despite lacking formal legislation, the country ranks among the world’s top 10 in digital currency adoption. An endorsement of Pakistani crypto ambitions is Changpeng Zhao, co-founder and ex-CEO of Binance. Joining the Pakistan Crypto Council as a strategic advisor, Zhao’s involvement represents a turning point in Pakistan’s progress towards blockchain technology supremacy. The partnership is symbolic and shows Pakistan means business when it comes to establishing cryptocurrency in the country’s future economic landscape. His participation is particularly important given his background in cryptocurrency regulations and blockchain technology. He has been instrumental in shaping regulations for digital currencies worldwide, and his guidance can enable Pakistan to create th e in frastructure and legal frameworks needed for the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors to take off. Zhao’s support also instills confidence among international investors that Pakistan is committed to providing a safe and secure framework for activities related to digital assets and may bring in foreign capital to the nation’s blossoming tech industry.

The meme coin clawed back to $0.148 after plunging to its 24-hour low of $0.129, a sign of a market teetering between panic and speculative hope. Analysts see potential 200% Rally if DOGE breaks through $0.20 resistance run, but technical indications aren’t encouraging. Death Cross between 100- and 200-day EMAs adds prolonged downward momentum. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is quietly moving through its fourth presale phase; having already raised $6.5 million by selling 396 million tokens. Is $0.025 for Phase 4 and a 20% rise on the way in Phase 5, this seems very much a planned route to the dollar for MUTM compared to those betting on the whims of Dogecoin. Dogecoin’s Uphill Battle Dogecoin’s 8.6% drop this week highlights its fragility in a market shaken by $1.6 billion in liquidations. Despite a slight bounce, DOGE is still pressed under a descending resistance trendline and weakening investor sentiment. Derivatives data show open interest waning and the long-to-short ratio falling below parity, a sign of traders’ hesitation to risk on a sustained recovery. For DOGE to reach $1 per coin, it would have to rise nearly 600% — a move that would take an anything-but-everyday bullish catalyst. Such jumps are rare without such upgrades or institutional backing, which Dogecoin lacks, according to historical patterns in the broader crypto market. The token’s dependence on social hype and meme culture makes its prospects bleak in the face of projects with real utility. Momentum of Mutuum Finance’s Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seizing on the investor desire for predictable returns. Now in its 11-stage presale, it is in Phase 4, with 8,100 holders under its belt, and tokens available for $0.025. At launch — $0.06 per token — based on its tokenomics to date, early participants stand to benefit a whopping 140%. Analysts go even further, estimating that by 2025, MUTM could hit $1.50, yielding a 5,900% return on investment for those who buy into Phase 4. This increase is based on Mutuum Finance’s lending protocol, which creates buy pressure via revenue-driven token buybacks. While the flurry around Dogecoin is speculative, the value of MUTM comes from real-world DeFi applications: overcollateralized loans, in which interest rates fluctuate, and mtTokens that increase in value as users earn interest. Benefits Over Meme Coins As Dogecoin bears the burden of volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily constructing the backbone. Its audit by Certik for smart contracts—yet to be concluded—gets them instant credibility, reassuring investors about security of protocol. The presale is conducted via phased increments of price, creating a strong sense of urgency; the sell-out of each phase of the presale hastens FOMO. As Phase 5 approaches and brings with it a price of $0.03, the opportunity to access tokens at lower valuations is becoming more and more scarce. MUTM’s model is a stark contrast from Dogecoin’s inherent lack of utility, aiming to be a hedge against the whims of meme coins. A Clear Path Forward Dogecoin’s vision of one dollar is predicated on a sea change in market sentiment — a gamble without guarantees. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, contains obvious upside in its presale structure and revenue-splitting mechanisms. Will the intermittent surges of Dogecoin outstrip the methodical ascent of Mutuum Finance? For investors who value stability over luck, the answer comes down firmly on the side of MUTM. Phase 4 will end soon, get your secured tokens now before the upcoming price increase. Act Before the Next Surge Lastly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a blend of innovation and investor intrigue revolutionizing participation in DeFi. With Phase 4 now live and a 20% price increase on the horizon, waiting risks missing potentially life-changing gains. Become one of the 8,100 holders and set yourself up for a 2025 explosion — today’s $0.025 may be the anchor for a $1.50 revolution tomorrow.

43192484,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148432,1744333363,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto History: First Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Worth Unbelievable $16 Billion Today,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-billion-dollars/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye, it’s crucial to remember the lessons of the past. While Bitcoin has revolutionized finance, it has also, unfortunately, attracted its share of bad actors. Today, we delve into a cautionary tale from the early days of Bitcoin – the story of the very first Bitcoin Ponzi scheme , a scam that, unbelievably, would be worth a staggering $16 billion in today’s market. This is a stark reminder of the risks involved in the crypto space and the importance of due diligence. Are you ready to uncover this shocking chapter in crypto history? What Was the First Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme? Let’s rewind to 2011, a time when Bitcoin was still in its nascent stages, trading at around $3 per coin. In this Wild West era of crypto, an individual named Trendon Shavers launched what he deceptively branded as “First Pirate Savings & Trust.” This entity, in reality, was the pioneering crypto fraud built upon the burgeoning Bitcoin network. Shavers, with a silver tongue and promises of guaranteed riches, lured unsuspecting investors into his web of deceit. His proposition was enticing: deposit your Bitcoin, and in return, receive a guaranteed 1% daily interest. Yes, you read that right – 1% daily ! This astronomical return, coupled with the assurance of withdrawals at any time, was designed to trigger a powerful sense of greed and security in potential victims. In a time when traditional finance offered meager returns, Shavers’ offer seemed like a golden ticket. But as with all Ponzi schemes, the reality was far from the promised dream. How Did Trendon Shavers Execute His Crypto Fraud? Trendon Shavers, the mastermind behind this Bitcoin Ponzi scheme , operated with cunning simplicity. He targeted early adopters of Bitcoin, individuals intrigued by the new digital currency but perhaps lacking deep technical or financial expertise. His method involved: Luring Investors with Unrealistic Promises: Shavers promised a daily 1% interest, an unsustainable rate that should have immediately raised red flags. This promise of “easy money” is a classic hallmark of Ponzi schemes. Exploiting Bitcoin’s Novelty: Bitcoin was new and complex to many in 2011. This novelty allowed Shavers to obfuscate the true nature of his scheme and prey on investors’ lack of understanding. Using New Investments to Pay Old Investors: The core mechanism of any Ponzi scheme is to use funds from new investors to pay off earlier investors, creating a false impression of profitability and legitimacy. This creates a snowball effect, attracting more victims until the scheme inevitably collapses. Personal Enrichment: Instead of investing or trading Bitcoin as promised, Shavers allegedly squandered the funds on personal expenses. Reports indicate he used the stolen Bitcoin for rent, car payments, gambling, and shopping – essentially treating investor funds as his personal piggy bank. The Devastating Impact and the $16 Billion Revelation The scale of Shavers’ crypto fraud was significant, especially considering the early stage of Bitcoin. He reportedly convinced victims to send him at least 50 BTC each. At the time, 50 BTC was worth around $150. Today, that same 50 BTC would be worth approximately $4 million! Imagine the shock and devastation for those early investors who entrusted their Bitcoin to Shavers. The U.S. government later estimated that Shavers embezzled a staggering 193,000 BTC from his victims. While this number is shocking in itself, let’s put it into today’s perspective. Based on the current Bitcoin price, 193,000 BTC is equivalent to roughly $16 billion. Yes, you read that correctly – $16 billion . This figure is not just a number; it represents the immense potential value lost by the victims of this pioneering Bitcoin Ponzi scheme . Metric Value at the Time (2011-2012) Value Today (2024) Bitcoin Price (approx.) $3 $67,000 (approx.) 50 BTC Value $150 $4 million Total BTC Embezzled 193,000 BTC $579,000 (at $3/BTC) $16 Billion (at $67,000/BTC) Justice Served, But Lessons Remain Trendon Shavers was eventually brought to justice. He was fined $40 million and sentenced to 18 months in prison. While this may seem like a relatively light sentence compared to the magnitude of the Bitcoin investment risks he exposed his victims to, it marked an important early legal precedent in the cryptocurrency space. It demonstrated that even in the then-unregulated world of crypto, traditional financial crime laws could and would be applied. However, the financial compensation for the victims was likely minimal, and the emotional and financial scars of such a scam can run deep. The story of “First Pirate Savings & Trust” serves as a powerful and cautionary tale for anyone involved in cryptocurrency, both then and now. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights to Avoid Crypto Scams The legacy of the first Bitcoin Ponzi scheme offers invaluable lessons for navigating the often-turbulent waters of cryptocurrency investments. How can you protect yourself from falling victim to similar schemes today? Here are some actionable insights: Be Wary of Unrealistic Returns: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns, especially those that seem too good to be true (like 1% daily!), it’s almost certainly a scam. Legitimate investments carry risk, and consistently high returns are statistically improbable. Do Your Due Diligence: Research thoroughly before investing in any cryptocurrency project or platform. Understand the technology, the team behind it, and the business model. Don’t rely solely on hype or social media buzz. Understand the Investment: Never invest in something you don’t understand. If you can’t explain how an investment is supposed to generate returns, it’s a red flag. Learn about the underlying technology and economics of any crypto project before putting your money in. Beware of Pressure Tactics: Scammers often use high-pressure sales tactics to rush you into making a decision. Legitimate investment opportunities don’t require you to act immediately. Take your time, do your research, and make informed decisions. Verify Credibility: Check if the platform or individual offering the investment is registered with relevant regulatory bodies. While the crypto space is still evolving in terms of regulation, legitimate entities are increasingly seeking compliance. Start Small: If you are unsure about a new platform or investment, start with a small amount you are prepared to lose. This allows you to test the waters without risking significant capital. Is History Repeating Itself? The Enduring Threat of Crypto Ponzi Schemes While the “First Pirate Savings & Trust” may seem like a relic of the past, the unfortunate reality is that Bitcoin investment risks and crypto fraud remain prevalent today. The allure of quick riches and the complexity of cryptocurrency continue to be exploited by scammers. We still see Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, and various other forms of fraud in the crypto space, often disguised with new terminology and technologies. Therefore, the lessons from Trendon Shavers’ Bitcoin Ponzi scheme are more relevant than ever. Staying informed, skeptical, and diligent is paramount to protecting yourself in the exciting but often risky world of cryptocurrency. Remember, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In conclusion, the tale of the first Bitcoin Ponzi scheme is a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls in the cryptocurrency world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer incredible opportunities, they also come with inherent risks. By learning from the mistakes of the past and adopting a cautious and informed approach, you can navigate the crypto landscape more safely and avoid becoming a victim of crypto fraud . The $16 billion “what if” of this early scam should serve as a constant, shocking reminder of the importance of vigilance and due diligence in the digital age.

The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a staff statement on April 10 that it was giving its views “to provide greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets.” The Division said its statement was made of observations of disclosures given in existing disclosure requirements and “addresses our views about certain specific disclosure questions that market participants have presented to the staff.” The guidance, which the Division noted had “no legal force or effect,” said crypto companies who are giving disclosures about their business have typically shared a host of information about their operations, such as what the company specifically does, how any issued tokens work and how the business generates — or intends to generate — revenue. Companies have also disclosed whether they plan to remain engaged in a crypto network or app after they launch it and, if not, whether any other entities will take over. Crypto firms should also explain their technology, such as if their product is a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake blockchain, its block size, transaction speed , reward mechanisms, the measures to ensure network security and whether the protocol is open-source or not. The SEC staff also noted that registration or qualification is not required in connection with crypto offerings that aren’t securities and aren't part of an investment contract. However, the statement didn’t provide clarity on what digital assets could be securities. Commercial litigator Joe Carlasare told Cointelegraph the statement was “a welcome and refreshing step toward clearer regulatory guidance.” “Adhering to the guidelines will help entities not only position themselves more favorably with regulators but also demonstrate a commitment to transparency and credibility,” he said. Crypto firms should share all risks The SEC staff statement said that issuers usually clearly disclose risks related to price volatility, network and cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and custody risks, in addition to standard business, operational, legal and regulatory risks. A “materially complete description” of a security is also typically required from an issuer, which includes the mechanism behind paying dividends, distributions, profit-sharing and voting rights, including how those rights are enforced. Related: No crypto project has registered with the SEC and ‘lived to tell the tale’ — House committee hearing It added a company should share if a protocol’s code can be modified, and if so, who can make such changes and whether the smart contracts involved have been subjected to a third-party security audit. Other disclosures the statement mentioned are whether the token’s supply is fixed and how it was or will be issued along with identifying executives and “significant employees.” The Division said its guidance intended to build on the SEC’s Crypto Task Force , which is planning to host a series of roundtables with the crypto industry to discuss how it should police crypto trading, custody, tokenization and decentralized finance.

This development comes even after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) recently disbanded its cryptocurrency investigation unit, raising eyebrows and sparking questions across the digital asset landscape. Are you wondering how this disbandment impacts ongoing crypto crime cases? Let’s dive into the details and uncover what this means for Do Kwon and the broader crypto regulatory environment. Why Do Kwon’s Case Remains a Priority Despite DoJ Crypto Investigations Unit Changes? The news of the DoJ dismantling its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) sent ripples through the crypto community. Many speculated about a potential softening stance on cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement. However, the prosecution in the Do Kwon case has clarified that this organizational change will not derail the legal proceedings. CoinDesk’s report highlighted the prosecution’s firm stance: the charges against Do Kwon are fundamentally rooted in fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud . This distinction is crucial. Here’s a breakdown of why Do Kwon’s case is proceeding unaffected: Focus on Core Criminal Charges: The charges are centered on established criminal statutes related to fraud and conspiracy. These are not dependent on the nuanced and often debated classifications of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities. Alternative Legal Pathways: Even if arguments were to arise about whether specific cryptocurrencies involved qualify as securities, the prosecution has confirmed that alternative, robust criminal charges are in place. These charges stand independently of security law classifications. Timing of Indictment: The charges against Do Kwon were already in place before the DoJ’s announcement of the NCET disbandment and revised enforcement guidelines. This suggests a commitment to seeing the case through, irrespective of later policy shifts. Crypto Investigations Landscape Shifts: What Does the DoJ Disbandment Really Mean? On April 7th, the DoJ made a significant announcement. It wasn’t just the disbandment of the NCET; it was also the formalization of new guidelines concerning cryptocurrency industry personnel. These guidelines indicate a move away from holding individuals legally accountable under federal securities and commodities laws for certain violations. But what does this mean for the future of crypto investigations and enforcement? Let’s analyze the key takeaways from the DoJ’s announcement: Aspect Details Implications NCET Disbandment The specialized cryptocurrency crime investigation unit within the DoJ is being dissolved. Potentially signifies a shift in how crypto crimes are investigated, possibly integrating them more broadly within existing law enforcement structures rather than specialized units. Revised Enforcement Guidelines The DoJ will not automatically pursue legal action against crypto industry personnel for violations of federal securities and commodities laws. Suggests a more nuanced approach, possibly focusing on egregious fraud and intentional misconduct rather than technical or unintentional regulatory breaches. This could be seen as a relief for compliant crypto businesses but not for those engaged in criminal activity. Focus on Fraud and Conspiracy Criminal charges related to fraud and conspiracy remain a high priority, as exemplified by the Do Kwon case. Indicates that while regulatory technicalities might be approached with more leniency, core financial crimes within the crypto space will still be vigorously prosecuted. Fraud Charges Against Do Kwon: A Case Study in Crypto Accountability The ongoing legal battle against Do Kwon serves as a critical case study in the realm of cryptocurrency accountability. The fraud charges leveled against him and Terraform Labs are not trivial. They represent a significant effort to address alleged misconduct that had widespread financial repercussions across the crypto market. What are the key elements of these fraud charges? The prosecution is likely focusing on demonstrating: Misrepresentation and Deception: Allegations that Do Kwon and Terraform Labs misrepresented the stability and risk factors associated with their algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), and related cryptocurrency, LUNA. Intent to Defraud: Establishing that there was a deliberate intention to deceive investors for personal or corporate gain, rather than mere negligence or business misjudgment. Financial Harm: Demonstrating the significant financial losses suffered by investors as a direct result of the alleged fraudulent activities. This includes the dramatic collapse of UST and LUNA, wiping out billions of dollars in market value. The outcome of the Do Kwon trial could set a precedent for future fraud charges in the cryptocurrency space, clarifying the boundaries of acceptable conduct and the consequences of crossing those lines. The Role of the DoJ in Crypto Regulation: Evolving Strategies? The actions of the DoJ , particularly the disbandment of the NCET, prompt reflection on the government’s evolving strategies for cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement. Is this a retreat, a strategic realignment, or something else entirely? Several interpretations are possible: Decentralization of Enforcement: Instead of a centralized unit, crypto crime investigations might be integrated into broader law enforcement agencies, leveraging their existing infrastructure and expertise across various financial crime domains. Focus on Systemic Risks: The DoJ might be shifting its focus to larger, systemic risks within the crypto market, prioritizing cases that involve significant financial instability or widespread investor harm, like the Terraform Labs collapse. Resource Optimization: Disbanding a specialized unit could be a matter of resource allocation, streamlining operations and avoiding redundancy, especially as crypto knowledge becomes more widespread within law enforcement. Adaptive Regulatory Approach: The evolving nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology requires an adaptive regulatory approach. The DoJ’s changes could reflect a move towards more flexible and responsive enforcement strategies. Terraform Labs and the Aftermath: Lessons for the Crypto Industry The saga of Terraform Labs and its dramatic downfall serves as a stark reminder of the risks and vulnerabilities inherent in the cryptocurrency market. Regardless of the legal outcomes for Do Kwon, the Terraform Labs episode has already left an indelible mark. What crucial lessons can the crypto industry learn from this? Key takeaways include: Transparency and Disclosure: The need for crypto projects to operate with utmost transparency, clearly disclosing risks, underlying mechanisms, and potential vulnerabilities to investors. Robust Risk Management: The importance of rigorous risk management frameworks for cryptocurrency projects, especially those involving stablecoins or complex algorithmic mechanisms. The failure of UST highlighted the dangers of inadequately tested and understood systems. Investor Education: The critical role of investor education in the crypto space. Investors need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools to assess risks, understand complex crypto products, and make informed decisions. Regulatory Clarity: The ongoing need for clear and consistent regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies globally. While over-regulation can stifle innovation, a lack of clarity creates uncertainty and can enable harmful practices. Conclusion: The Unwavering Pursuit of Crypto Justice Despite shifts in organizational structures within the DoJ and evolving regulatory approaches, the message is clear: the pursuit of justice in the cryptocurrency space remains unwavering, particularly when it comes to allegations of significant fraud. Do Kwon’s trial proceeding as scheduled underscores this commitment. The crypto industry, while innovative and transformative, is not immune to the rule of law. As the legal proceedings unfold, the world will be watching closely, seeking clarity on accountability and the future landscape of cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement. This case is a powerful signal that while the crypto world operates at lightning speed, traditional legal principles of fraud and accountability remain steadfast.

Addressing a crowd of education and technology experts at the ASU+GSV Summit, she stated: “You know, AI development — I mean, how can we educate at the speed of light if we don’t have the best technology around to do that? I heard that there was a school system that’s going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching in every year, starting that far down in the grades. That’s a wonderful thing!” While it initially seemed like a simple mispronunciation, the repeated use of ‘A1’ instead of AI throughout her speech led many to wonder if it was more than just a slip of the tongue. The incident quickly spread across social media, becoming a subject of amusement and debate. Why is Understanding Artificial Intelligence in Education Technology Crucial? The context of this gaffe is particularly noteworthy because it occurred at the ASU+GSV Summit, a premier event for discussions on Education Technology . The summit brings together leaders to explore how technology, especially Artificial Intelligence , can revolutionize learning. Here’s why understanding and correctly articulating ‘AI’ is vital, especially for someone in Secretary McMahon’s position: Policy and Funding: Accurate understanding of Artificial Intelligence is essential for formulating effective Education Policy and allocating resources appropriately. Misunderstandings can lead to misguided investments and strategies. Public Perception: When top officials misrepresent key technological terms, it can dilute public understanding and potentially hinder the adoption of beneficial technologies in education. International Standing: In a globally competitive landscape, especially in technology, clear and informed communication from leaders is crucial for maintaining credibility and fostering international collaborations in AI and Education Technology . The Implications for Education Policy and Leadership Secretary McMahon’s role as the U.S. Secretary of Education places her at the forefront of shaping Education Policy nationwide. Her comments, even if seemingly minor, carry significant weight. This incident raises questions about the level of technological literacy expected from leaders in crucial sectors like education. Consider these points: Area Implication of Misunderstanding AI Policy Making Policies might be based on flawed premises if leaders lack a fundamental understanding of Artificial Intelligence and its applications. Resource Allocation Funding for Education Technology and AI initiatives could be misdirected if decision-makers aren’t fully informed. Public Trust Gaffes like this can erode public trust in leadership, especially concerning complex topics like technology and education. Linda McMahon’s ‘A1’ Moment: Just a Slip-Up or a Bigger Issue? While it’s easy to dismiss this as a simple mistake, the repetition of ‘A1’ instead of AI does prompt reflection. Was it merely a verbal slip, or does it indicate a broader unfamiliarity with Artificial Intelligence ? The original article itself notes, “Sometimes people misspeak. Nobody’s perfect. But this feels like a bigger whiff than usual, particularly coming from the secretary of education.” It’s important to consider: Ubiquity of AI: Artificial Intelligence is no longer a niche concept. It’s widely discussed across industries and in public discourse. The acronym ‘AI’ is commonplace. Context Matters: Speaking at an Education Technology summit, the topic of AI was central. Familiarity with the term would be reasonably expected. Role Responsibility: As Secretary of Education , understanding emerging technologies and their impact on learning falls within the purview of the role. Moving Forward: Artificial Intelligence Education for Everyone Regardless of whether it was a mere gaffe or something more, this incident underscores the critical need for widespread Artificial Intelligence education – not just for students, but for leaders and policymakers too. As Artificial Intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into every facet of society, including Education Technology , ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding basic terminology and concepts is paramount. Perhaps this ‘A1’ moment, while humorous, serves as a timely reminder: continuous learning and adaptation to technological advancements are crucial at all levels, especially in leadership positions responsible for shaping future generations.

The approval is likely to improve Ether's investment appeal among institutional traders. The approval was granted following a review of a proposed rule change tendered by BlackRock for its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). SEC Approves Options Trading on Ether ETFs The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved options trading on Ethereum ETFs. The SEC announced an “accelerated approval” for Nasdaq ISE’s proposal to allow options trading on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF. According to an April 9 filing , the regulator also approved a request from NYSE American to allow trading options for the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Mini Trust, and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund. The SEC’s approval of options trading means investors can soon trade options like financial contracts that allow them to follow the price movements on these Ether ETFs, similar to what investors can do with spot Bitcoin ETFs. In its response to the Nasdaq, the SEC stated the following: “…the Exchange proposes to amend its rules to permit the listing and trading of options on the Trust.” Adding; “The Exchange states that options on the Trust will provide investors with an additional, relatively lower cost investing tool to gain exposure to spot ether as well as a hedging vehicle to meet their needs in connection with ether products and positions.” What Does This Mean? The SEC’s approval of options trading adds more flexibility and depth to crypto investing. With the approval, investors can hedge their ETH positions by betting on the price of ETH without having to buy or sell ETH (the underlying asset) directly. Options are also a popular trading vehicle to leverage and hedge risk and are attractive to institutional investors who want to control vast amounts of shares. Expanding the reach of trading is expected to increase trading activity and make ETH ETF more appealing to retail and institutional investors. James Seyffart, ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, highlighted the approvals on his X feed, saying they were “100% expected.” Good news. Ethereum ETF options approved. Was 100% expected. Today was final deadline. I personally don't see it on the SEC website yet but id be shocked if it weren't true. https://t.co/XjOxE0ZqUt — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) April 9, 2025 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43193282,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148437,1744335033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling the Truth: World Liberty Financial Rejects Shocking ETH Sell-Off Rumors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wlfi-denies-eth-selloff-rumors/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, rumors and speculations can spread like wildfire, often fueled by market volatility and on-chain data. Recently, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform associated with former President Trump, found itself at the center of such speculation. Reports emerged suggesting a massive ETH sell-off by WLFI, sending ripples through the crypto community. But is there truth to these claims? Let’s dive into the details and uncover the real story behind the alleged Ethereum dump. Did World Liberty Financial Really Dump Millions in ETH? The controversy began when Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics firm, identified a wallet purportedly linked to World Liberty Financial. Data from Arkham indicated that this wallet had moved a significant amount of Ethereum , specifically 5,471 ETH, valued at approximately $8 million, during a period of heightened market volatility . This data quickly led to reports and discussions across various crypto news platforms, suggesting that WLFI was offloading its Ethereum holdings. The implication was significant, especially given WLFI’s high-profile association and the potential impact such a large sale could have on market sentiment. However, World Liberty Financial wasted no time in addressing these allegations. In a swift and firm response, WLFI vehemently denied the reports, labeling them as “wholly inaccurate.” The company asserted that it had not sold any of its Ethereum holdings. This direct denial raises crucial questions about the accuracy of the initial reports and the reliability of on-chain data interpretation. It also highlights the importance of verifying information before it spreads unchecked in the crypto space. Arkham Intelligence’s Role and Data Interpretation Arkham Intelligence’s data was central to the ETH sell-off claims. It’s important to understand Arkham’s methodology and the nuances of blockchain analytics. Arkham labeled the wallet in question as “closely tied” to WLFI, but crucially, it did not definitively confirm ownership. This distinction is vital. Blockchain analysis can identify patterns and connections, but definitively attributing a wallet to a specific entity is not always straightforward. Wallets can be mislabeled, or the connection might be correlational rather than causal. According to a report by Decrypt, Arkham itself acknowledged the connection as “closely tied” but not confirmed. This admission underscores the preliminary nature of the data and the possibility of misinterpretation. In the decentralized and often pseudonymous world of crypto, identifying the true owner of a wallet requires more than just transactional data. It often involves a combination of on-chain analysis, off-chain information, and sometimes even investigative journalism. Understanding Crypto Platform Operations and Market Volatility World Liberty Financial, as a crypto platform , operates within a complex ecosystem. Crypto platforms hold and manage vast amounts of digital assets, and their transactions are constantly monitored. Large movements of funds from wallets associated with these platforms are naturally scrutinized, especially during periods of market volatility . Market volatility is inherent in the cryptocurrency market. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, driven by various factors including macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, technological developments, and market sentiment. During such volatile times, any perceived large sell-off can exacerbate price drops and trigger further panic selling. This is why rumors of WLFI’s alleged ETH sell-off gained traction and caused concern among investors. However, it’s also crucial to consider the regular operational activities of a crypto platform . Platforms routinely move funds for various reasons: rebalancing portfolios, covering operational costs, facilitating user withdrawals, and managing liquidity. Not every large transaction signifies a strategic sell-off. In WLFI’s case, their denial suggests that the observed ETH movement was likely part of normal platform operations, misconstrued as a deliberate sell-off due to the timing amidst market volatility . Why This Matters for Crypto Investors This incident serves as a valuable lesson for crypto investors and the broader crypto community. Here are key takeaways: Verify Information: Always cross-verify news and data, especially in the fast-paced crypto world. Don’t rely solely on initial reports or unconfirmed data. Understand Data Limitations: Recognize that on-chain data, while insightful, has limitations. Wallet labeling and attribution can be complex and sometimes inaccurate. Consider Context: Interpret crypto transactions within the broader context of market conditions and platform operations. Not every large transaction is a sign of panic or manipulation. Platform Transparency: Transparency from crypto platforms is crucial in building trust and managing rumors. WLFI’s prompt denial is a step in the right direction. Market Sentiment Impact: Be aware of how rumors and misinformation can impact market sentiment and price volatility. Looking Ahead: Trust and Transparency in Crypto News The WLFI ETH sell-off denial underscores the ongoing need for balanced and responsible reporting in the crypto news space. While on-chain data provides valuable insights, it’s crucial to interpret it cautiously and avoid jumping to conclusions. Platforms, in turn, need to be proactive in communicating and clarifying any misinterpretations to maintain user trust and market stability. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial’s firm denial of the ETH sell-off claims highlights the importance of critical evaluation of crypto news and data. It reminds us that in the volatile and dynamic crypto market, verifying information and understanding context are paramount to making informed decisions. The incident also underscores the need for greater transparency and clear communication from crypto platforms to mitigate misinformation and maintain market confidence during periods of market volatility .

This announcement, delivered during a recent Cabinet meeting, comes amidst ongoing trade tensions and has ignited discussions about potential shifts in international economic policy. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this development warrants close attention, as global economic shifts often have a direct impact on crypto market sentiment and digital asset values. Trump China Trade Deal: A Potential Game Changer for Global Markets? President Trump’s statement, “I want to do business with China,” suggests a possible softening of stance in the protracted trade disputes between the world’s two largest economies. He further added a note of optimism, stating his belief that “a good outcome can be achieved for both countries.” This declaration follows closely on the heels of another significant announcement: the postponement of reciprocal tariffs on countries other than China for 90 days. While the White House also clarified that the total tariff on China would be 145%, not 125% as previously indicated, the overarching message seems to be a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and potentially reach a Trump China trade deal . Key Highlights: Trump’s Desire for Business: President Trump publicly stated his intention to pursue business dealings with China, signaling a potential shift in trade relations. Tariff Postponement: The U.S. has postponed reciprocal tariffs on countries excluding China for 90 days, offering a window for negotiation and easing immediate trade pressures. Tariff Clarification: While tariffs on China are set at 145%, the focus on dialogue suggests a path towards resolution, rather than escalating tariffs indefinitely. Decoding the Impact: How Does This Affect the Crypto Market Sentiment? The cryptocurrency market, known for its sensitivity to global events, is likely to react to these developments. Trade wars and economic uncertainties often lead investors to seek safe-haven assets. While traditionally gold has played this role, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are increasingly being considered as alternative stores of value. A potential de-escalation in US-China trade tensions could impact crypto market sentiment in several ways: Reduced Economic Uncertainty: Easing trade tensions can reduce overall economic uncertainty, which may lead to a more stable investment environment. This could, paradoxically, reduce the immediate appeal of safe-haven assets like Bitcoin, as traditional markets become less risky. Positive Market Momentum: Good news in global trade can boost overall market confidence. A positive shift in traditional markets might spill over into the crypto market, encouraging broader investment and potentially driving up prices. Impact on Supply Chains and Global Trade: A smoother trade relationship between the US and China could positively impact global supply chains. This could indirectly benefit companies involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies that rely on international trade for development and expansion. Navigating the Trade War Crypto Market: Challenges and Opportunities The ongoing trade disputes, often referred to as the trade war crypto market era, have presented both challenges and opportunities for the cryptocurrency space. Let’s examine some key aspects: Challenges: Volatility Spikes: Trade war news often triggers volatility in both traditional and crypto markets. Sudden announcements and policy changes can lead to rapid price swings, making it challenging for investors to navigate. Investor Uncertainty: Prolonged trade tensions create an atmosphere of uncertainty, which can deter institutional investors from entering the crypto market. Institutional investment is crucial for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto sector. Economic Slowdown Risks: Trade wars can contribute to a global economic slowdown. A weaker global economy could reduce overall investment appetite, impacting all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Opportunities: Safe-Haven Appeal: As mentioned earlier, economic uncertainty can enhance the safe-haven appeal of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In times of crisis, investors may turn to decentralized, non-sovereign assets. Decentralization Advantage: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies can be seen as an advantage during trade disputes. Cryptocurrencies operate outside the direct control of governments and central banks, potentially making them less susceptible to geopolitical risks. Innovation and Adoption: Economic disruptions can sometimes accelerate innovation. The need for alternative financial systems and solutions may drive further development and adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. The Broader Global Trade Impact Crypto and Beyond The implications of US-China trade relations extend far beyond just tariffs and trade balances. The global trade impact crypto market is just one facet of a much larger picture. Consider these broader points: Aspect Potential Impact of Eased US-China Trade Tensions Global Economic Growth Potential boost to global economic growth as trade flows normalize and supply chains stabilize. Inflation Reduced inflationary pressures as tariffs are rolled back and import costs decrease. Technology Sector Positive impact on technology companies that rely on global supply chains and international markets. Emerging Markets Potential for increased investment in emerging markets as global economic confidence improves. Cryptocurrency Adoption Indirectly, a stable global economy can foster a more conducive environment for the long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies as part of a diversified financial system. US China Business Crypto: What Does the Future Hold? President Trump’s latest statement suggests a possible pivot towards a more business-oriented approach in US China business crypto and beyond. While the details of any potential trade deal remain unclear, the shift in tone is significant. For cryptocurrency investors, it’s crucial to stay informed and adapt to the evolving global economic landscape. Here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Monitor Trade News Closely: Keep a close watch on developments related to US-China trade talks. Major announcements can trigger market volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains key in volatile markets. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of cryptocurrencies and other asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto market. Short-term fluctuations driven by trade news should be viewed in the context of the bigger picture. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. Use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes to mitigate potential losses during periods of high volatility. Stay Informed: Continuously educate yourself about the interplay between global economics, geopolitics, and the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or Fleeting Optimism? President Trump’s expressed desire to do business with China offers a glimmer of hope for easing trade tensions and fostering a more stable global economic environment. For the cryptocurrency market, this could translate to a shift in crypto market sentiment , potentially reducing volatility and fostering a more constructive investment climate. However, it’s essential to remain cautiously optimistic. Trade negotiations are complex, and the path forward may still be fraught with challenges. The cryptocurrency market will continue to react to every twist and turn in this evolving geopolitical narrative. For now, investors should welcome this signal of potential de-escalation while remaining vigilant and prepared for continued market fluctuations.

ONDO price prediction continues to gain traction as its role in tokenized finance expands, while PEPE price analysis hints at possible price stability despite weak on-chain signs. But the most significant momentum is now coming from a completely different source— BlockDAG (BDAG) . Instead of slow updates, BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 made a clear statement. With $213M secured, over 1 million mobile miners using the X1 app, and a live Beta Testnet already outperforming many launched chains, the project is quickly evolving. The presale has become something larger. As shipments of X30 and X100 miners begin and the network builds itself, BlockDAG is setting itself apart as a potential top pick for 2025. BlockDAG’s Testnet Launch Fuels Early Access Momentum BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 went beyond a progress report—it marked a turning point. BlockDAG has raised over $213 million through its presale campaign, with more than 19.2 billion BDAG coins sold so far. Notably, this was accomplished without help from venture capital. The entire movement has been backed by its growing global community. Currently in Batch 27, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0248 each, a significant jump from their starting price of $0.001 in Batch 1—showing a 2,380% increase. What puts BlockDAG ahead is its real user presence. Over 1 million downloads of the X1 mobile mining app have already been recorded. That’s not a goal—it’s reality. Additionally, the Tap Miner game has attracted more than 400,000 users, with about 100,000 playing daily. This activity is doing more than boosting attention; it’s creating a working foundation even before the mainnet goes live. The Beta Testnet now features a no-code tool for launching Tokens and NFTs, a smart contract explorer, and multiple functioning dApps. Weekly airdrops on the testnet are reaching active users. Another major milestone: 10,000 units of the X30 and X100 mining hardware are being distributed. This gives participants a chance to earn early rewards before the full mainnet release. With working tools, a growing user base, and shipping already in progress, BlockDAG is making a strong case to be among the top cryptos to watch for 2025. At this pace, those still on the fence could risk missing a major shift. ONDO Price Prediction Rises With Real-World Asset Adoption Excitement around tokenized real assets is building fast, and ONDO price prediction is becoming central in these discussions. ONDO is helping move traditional financial tools like bonds and Treasuries onto blockchain platforms, supported by real partnerships such as Mastercard and a total value locked (TVL) of over $1 billion—even before the full platform rollout. This growing involvement positions ONDO as a serious name in digital finance. Forecasts now suggest ONDO could climb 5x to 10x, with near-term goals set around $2. What strengthens this outlook is its current price—hovering close to $0.80—offering an accessible entry point. As interest in tokenized financial assets grows, ONDO price prediction continues to stand out, making it a top choice in the RWA category. PEPE Price Analysis Suggests a Pause Before Potential Climb Recent months haven’t been kind to memecoins, and PEPE price analysis reflects these trends. Its trading activity has fallen by 45% compared to the prior month, and fewer on-chain actions are taking place. Both new and active wallet addresses have decreased, and long-term holders are currently facing losses. Yet, data from Mean Coin Age indicates that selling may be slowing, which could hint at an upcoming shift. Price-wise, the decline appears to be stalling. PEPE hasn’t dropped to new lows for several weeks and has recently tested a resistance level of $0.00000883. The MACD is inching toward a bullish crossover, and overall capital movement is steady. This PEPE price analysis points toward a holding phase, not a breakout, but demand could quickly flip that scenario. Final Say! ONDO price prediction continues to strengthen as tokenized asset usage expands, while PEPE price analysis points to possible price stabilization after recent losses. Each of these projects brings its own unique risks and appeal. Meanwhile, BlockDAG appears to be entering a different league. With $213 million raised, over 1 million mobile miners, and a Beta Testnet already active, the project is clearly progressing. Mining equipment is being distributed, dApps are already live, and the presale price has surged by 2,380% from its initial level. For those still undecided, the window may be closing. BlockDAG’s growth is no longer just potential—it’s showing real results. This could be the top crypto for 2025 that’s worth serious attention.

43194126,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=729660,1744336826,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43194126.jpeg,"Bitcoin Will Explode To $250,00 By Year-End, Predicts Cardano Founder",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-explode-to-25000-by-year-end-cardano-founder/,"Charles Hoskinson, who co-founded Ethereum and now leads the Cardano blockchain, has projected that Bitcoin could reach a price of $250,000 by the end of this year or next year. His prediction, made during a CNBC interview, comes despite the recent slump in the wider financial markets including crypto. Why Bitcoin Will Hit $250,000 Within Less Than 2 Years Hoskinson emphasized that rising geopolitical tensions and evolving trade dynamics are creating supportive conditions for decentralized networks like Bitcoin. Speaking on a world that appears to be “moving from a rules-based international order to a great powers conflict,” he suggested this shift would highlight the limitations of traditional banking and trade systems, steering more transactions toward cryptocurrencies. “If Russia wants to invade Ukraine, it invades Ukraine. If China wants to invade Taiwan, it’s going to do that. So treaties don’t really work so well, and global business doesn’t really work so well there. So your only option for globalization is crypto,” Hoskinson told CNBC. He also noted the significant sell-off in crypto and other risk assets, a trend that has partially stemmed from US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on countries worldwide. Bitcoin dipped below $77,000 over the last week before briefly surpassing $83,000 on Wednesday, and remains considerably lower than its record high above $100,000 set in January. Still, Hoskinson’s confidence stands: “No, I think Bitcoin will be over $250,000 by the end of this year or next year.” Among the factors that might drive such a dramatic price surge, Hoskinson pointed to the Federal Reserve possibly lowering interest rates in response to market pressures. “Then you’ll have a lot of fast, cheap money, and then it’ll pour into crypto,” he said, explaining how additional liquidity could lead to renewed interest in digital assets. The potential for big tech companies such as Microsoft and Apple to enter the crypto space also figures into his bullish outlook. Another component of Hoskinson’s optimism lies in the prospect of new legislation. He singled out anticipated stablecoin legislation as well as the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, both of which are currently making their way through Congress. He believes these regulatory moves could streamline the crypto market and pave the way for institutional adoption. Stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currency and backed by real-world assets, may prove especially attractive to major technology companies looking to facilitate rapid, cost-effective global transactions. “The stablecoin bill in particular could lead the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies to begin adopting the assets,” he added, referring to Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other mega-cap tech giants. Hoskinson further argued that once these regulatory frameworks become clearer, the market will likely “stall for probably the next three to five months,” before “a huge wave of speculative interest” re-enters the space around late summer or fall. That renewed enthusiasm, combined with a more settled geopolitical landscape and a stable regulatory environment, could, in his view, push Bitcoin’s price as high as $250,000. At press time, BTC traded at $81,138.

XRP Faces Legal Uncertainty While Ethereum Holds Support,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdag-gains-trust-of-170k-holders-with-top-notch-security-model-xrp-faces-legal-uncertainty-while-ethereum-holds-support/,"Ethereum (ETH) price prediction is once again in the spotlight as traders evaluate whether ETH can rebound while it lingers near crucial support levels. XRP price analysis paints a similar picture of caution, with the asset stuck in a tight range and legal decisions expected to influence upcoming moves. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining recognition for something more essential—protection. The platform has prioritized safety from the beginning, with security audits approved by both CertiK and Halborn, and it implements cutting-edge MPC tech to safeguard its assets. This approach is earning real trust, with more than 170,000 individual holders joining in anticipation of the upcoming mainnet debut. Ethereum Price Prediction Shows Signs of Possible Bounce Ethereum (ETH) price prediction remains under the microscope as ETH trades near $1,802. Analysts observe that ETH is maintaining important support between $1,760 and $1,775, with a resistance zone building close to $1,900. The charts give mixed messages—RSI sits in neutral territory, while MACD hints at a trend change. Even after an 18% dip over the past month, the rising open interest suggests bigger players may be positioning for a rally. The latest Ethereum (ETH) price prediction signals a modest comeback could take shape if the support area stays firm and resistance eases, with upside projections ranging from $1,900 to possibly $1,980 if momentum improves. XRP Price Analysis: Narrow Movement as Legal Outcome Looms XRP price analysis shows the asset holding steady above the $2.00 mark, currently trading around $2.07. Its movement remains confined within a narrow range, reflecting market hesitation as participants await final remarks in the SEC case. Chart indicators remain mixed—RSI holds a neutral stance while MACD leans toward a bullish cross. Some experts highlight a symmetrical triangle that may push XRP toward $3.51, while others remain cautious, warning of a drop if the $2.00 support doesn’t hold. As this XRP price analysis unfolds, much of the focus remains on the legal resolution and Coinbase’s forthcoming XRP futures rollout. Why 170K+ Holders Believe in BlockDAG’s Security-First Approach BlockDAG’s method for ensuring network safety breaks away from the usual approach. Instead of fixing issues after launch, the structure was built from scratch with safety at its foundation. Chief Security Officer Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj emphasized this during Keynote 3 , stating, “Security is not a feature—it’s the bedrock upon which we’ve built everything.” This solid base has already been tested by respected audit firms CertiK and Halborn , which reviewed and verified the robustness of BlockDAG’s smart contracts and framework. This kind of readiness strengthens user confidence even before the mainnet goes live. But the security plan doesn’t end there. BlockDAG’s treasury operates on Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which distributes access among several signers, reducing the risk of any single failure compromising the system. Its core infrastructure is designed to remain operational during disruptions, backed by a fault-resistant and globally spread architecture. These elements reduce the risk of attacks or downtime, key for a system aiming to handle high traffic. All of this has helped build long-term faith in the project—and the numbers back it up. BlockDAG’s crypto presale has already secured over $212.5 million, with more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold across 27 batches. Since the first batch, its price has jumped from $0.001 to $0.0248—marking an incredible 2380% growth. Driving these numbers is a community of over 170,000 holders, developers, and early backers drawn by the project’s technical strength and clear execution. With the mainnet nearing and multiple exchange listings ahead, attention is increasing quickly. For those exploring the best crypto coin to buy, such traction tends not to last forever. Once the launch happens, the current pricing could become part of history. Long Story Short! Ethereum (ETH) price prediction indicates continued uncertainty—support zones are holding, but momentum remains undecided. XRP price analysis shows similar hesitation, with sideways moves and legal updates keeping things slow. While these well-known names wait for decisive changes, BlockDAG is already making strong progress. Its structure, built entirely around safety and supported by major audits and MPC integration, has fueled crypto’s biggest ongoing presale. Having raised over $212.5 million with a 2380% price surge, BlockDAG now heads toward its mainnet and upcoming listings. Missing out at this point may mean watching the best crypto coin to buy surge past earlier opportunities.

Not so fast, according to a fascinating new study from Microsoft Research. While AI models are increasingly touted as programming assistants, even the most advanced ones are still facing significant hurdles when it comes to a crucial aspect of software development: AI debugging . This research offers a sobering reality check amidst the hype surrounding AI’s coding prowess and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where robust and error-free code is paramount. The Surprising Struggle of AI Models with Software Bugs We’ve heard the bold claims. Google’s CEO mentioning that a quarter of their new code is AI-generated. Meta’s ambitions to infuse AI coding tools throughout their operations. These pronouncements paint a picture of rapid AI dominance in software creation. However, the Microsoft study throws a wrench in this narrative, revealing that when it comes to resolving software bugs , AI models from giants like OpenAI and Anthropic are often stumped by issues that seasoned human developers would easily resolve. The study meticulously tested nine different AI models, including Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI’s o3-mini, using a benchmark called SWE-bench Lite. The results? Even with access to debugging tools like a Python debugger, these models, acting as “single prompt-based agents,” struggled to complete more than half of the 300 debugging tasks. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the top performer, only achieved a 48.4% success rate. This underwhelming performance raises critical questions about the current capabilities and limitations of AI in coding. Model Success Rate Claude 3.7 Sonnet 48.4% OpenAI’s o1 30.2% OpenAI’s o3-mini 22.1% Source: Microsoft Research Study Why Do Top AI Models Fail at Code Debugging? The study delves into the reasons behind these shortcomings. One issue is the AI’s ability to effectively utilize debugging tools. Models sometimes struggle to understand which tool is appropriate for which type of bug. However, the researchers pinpoint a more fundamental problem: data scarcity . Current AI models are trained on vast datasets, but the study suggests there’s a lack of data representing the iterative, step-by-step process of human debugging. These “sequential decision-making processes,” or human debugging traces, are crucial for training AI to become proficient debuggers. Think about it: debugging isn’t just about spotting an error; it’s about methodically investigating, testing hypotheses, and using tools strategically to isolate and fix the root cause. This complex process seems to be missing from the training data of current AI. The researchers believe that targeted training or fine-tuning with specialized data focused on debugging interactions could significantly improve AI performance. This specialized data would ideally include “trajectory data” – records of AI agents interacting with debuggers to gather information before suggesting fixes. Is This the End of AI Coding Assistants? Absolutely not. While these findings might seem discouraging, they provide valuable insights into the current state of AI coding tools . It’s important to remember that this is still early days for AI-powered coding assistance. The Microsoft study doesn’t negate the progress made; instead, it highlights areas where further development is needed. It’s also worth noting that previous research has indicated that code generated by AI can sometimes introduce security vulnerabilities and errors due to limitations in understanding programming logic. A recent evaluation of Devin, a prominent AI coding tool, showed it could only complete a small fraction of programming tests. The Microsoft study adds another layer to this understanding, focusing specifically on the debugging challenge. The Human Element Remains Crucial in Coding Despite the buzz around AI automation, many tech leaders emphasize the enduring role of human programmers. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Replit CEO Amjad Masad, and IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, among others, believe that programming as a profession is here to stay. This study reinforces that perspective, showing that human expertise remains essential, especially in critical tasks like debugging. While AI can undoubtedly assist with coding, automating repetitive tasks and potentially speeding up development workflows, it’s not yet ready to replace human developers, particularly when it comes to the nuanced and complex process of code debugging . For the cryptocurrency world, where code integrity is paramount for security and trust, this is a vital consideration. Key Takeaways: AI models are not yet proficient debuggers: Even top models struggle with software bugs that human developers find straightforward. Data scarcity is a major hurdle: Lack of training data representing human debugging processes limits AI performance. Human expertise remains essential: AI coding tools are assistants, not replacements for skilled developers, especially in debugging. Focus on specialized training data: Future AI improvements in debugging will likely depend on targeted training with debugging-specific datasets. Realistic expectations are crucial: While AI coding assistance is valuable, it’s important to understand its current limitations, particularly in critical domains like cryptocurrency and blockchain development. Looking Ahead: The Future of AI and Debugging The Microsoft study serves as a crucial reminder: AI is a powerful tool, but it’s still under development, particularly in complex domains like software engineering. While AI coding assistants will undoubtedly continue to evolve and improve, the human element in software development, especially in ensuring code quality and security through effective debugging, remains indispensable. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries, this means a continued reliance on skilled human developers to build and maintain robust and secure systems, even as AI tools become more sophisticated. The path forward involves focusing on developing specialized training datasets and refining AI models to better mimic and augment human debugging expertise.

And yeah, while AAVE and Chainlink are locked in tug-of-war with technical indicators, Qubetics is pulling ahead with an explosive presale that’s got early adopters buzzing. The clock’s ticking, and this presale window won’t stay open forever. Solving Real Problems with Cross-Border Payments Like Never Before From freelancers in Toronto to logistics firms in Singapore, cross-border payments are the hidden headache no one likes talking about. Qubetics is taking that headache and turning it into smooth sailing. With the power of the $TICS token and blockchain-backed speed, Qubetics makes it possible to transfer funds globally without the fees, delays, and middlemen that drain time and money. It’s not some abstract solution—this is real tech for real transactions. Let’s say a small American business is buying bulk electronics from Korea. Instead of sweating over exchange rates and delayed bank wires, they can settle instantly via Qubetics. That means better deals, happier suppliers, and no stress over payment clearance. Even individuals sending money back home get a win, with fast, secure remittances. It’s no wonder Qubetics is being talked about as a top rated crypto by those looking for actual utility—not just hype. Qubetics Presale: The Top Rated Crypto Presale That’s Turning Heads The Qubetics presale is on fire, and it’s not just hype—it’s backed by real numbers and serious ROI projections. Sitting at Stage 29, the $TICS token is priced at $0.1573, with over $15.9 million already raised. More than 24,500 holders have jumped in, securing their slice of over 507 million tokens sold. Every stage lasts only 7 days, and when Sunday hits at midnight, the price jumps by 10%. That alone creates a frenzy of urgency, but what’s really grabbing attention are the wild ROI projections tied to the mainnet launch in Q2 2025. Let’s break it down. A $100 buy at the current price gives you 636 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s a 535.65% return. If it reaches $5, you’re looking at 3,078.26% ROI. Go to $10? That’s 6,256.47%. And if it climbs to $15—which isn’t out of reach by the looks of Qubetics’ utility—then you’re talking about a jaw-dropping 9,434.71% ROI. That’s why this is being called the top rated crypto and one of the Qubetics presale opportunities nobody wants to miss. With this kind of potential, it’s more than just buzz—it’s a calculated play. AAVE’s Elliott Wave Points to Surprising Market Patterns The latest Elliott Wave technical analysis on AAVE suggests that its price movement may soon break out of its current corrective pattern. AAVE’s formation shows five-wave impulse potential, with the coin currently in Wave (2), a corrective wave that might soon give way to an upward Wave (3). If AAVE follows traditional wave structure, it could rally significantly in Wave (3), offering upside opportunities for those tracking the cycle. But this isn’t just theoretical analysis—this breakdown was backed by key Fibonacci retracement levels, indicating that AAVE is resting at a technical sweet spot. The chart patterns suggest that AAVE may soon regain bullish momentum, with strong price action support near the $90 level. Analysts watching these waves closely believe that a confirmed breakout could send AAVE beyond $130, marking a pivotal shift in its mid-term trajectory. Chainlink Battles Bearish Pressure as Price Hovers Near $10 Chainlink (LINK) is currently weathering a rough ride, having dropped 50% year-to-date and now trading dangerously close to the critical $10 support zone. The IntoTheBlock data confirms the bears are in control, with resistance looming between $10.71 and $12.33. Over 11 million tokens sit in profit just above $10.52, but heavy sell pressure above that zone is making it tough for LINK to push through. The latest signals from the IOMAP indicator suggest LINK may continue slipping, especially if the market doesn’t regain buying strength. Technical indicators paint a gloomy picture too. The MACD has slipped into negative territory, signaling weakening momentum, while a death cross between the 12 EMA and 26 EMA adds fuel to the bearish fire. The Supertrend on the weekly chart also flipped red, hinting that LINK may revisit levels as low as $7.37—or even $4.72, which was last seen in the 2022 bear market. While a bullish turnaround could send LINK toward $15 or even $23, that outcome currently feels like a stretch without a serious shift in market dynamics. Final Word: $TICS, AAVE, or LINK—Who’s Really Leading the Charge? AAVE might be prepping for a breakout with its textbook Elliott Wave structure, and Chainlink is facing a real test of strength as it struggles near key resistance levels. Both are notable contenders in the space, and each has its moment. But Qubetics is out here solving real-world payment problems and creating massive ROI windows for early adopters. That’s what sets it apart as a top rated crypto. With over $15.9 million already raised and the mainnet launch just around the corner in Q2 2025, the smart money is leaning toward those looking to join this best crypto presale before the next price jump. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics being called a top rated crypto? Because it’s fixing cross-border payment issues that major cryptos have left unsolved and delivering serious ROI potential through its ongoing presale. How much can I earn if I invest $100 in the Qubetics presale? At the current price of $0.1573, $100 nets you 636 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s over 5x returns, with projections climbing to nearly 95x at $15. What’s happening with Chainlink right now? Chainlink has dropped 50% YTD and faces heavy resistance. If support at $10 fails, it could fall to $7.37 or even lower. What is AAVE’s technical analysis saying? AAVE is potentially entering Wave (3) of an Elliott Wave pattern, which could lead to a bullish breakout above $130 if confirmed.

The audacious goal of securing a $2 billion seed round – reportedly doubled from an initial target – speaks volumes about the ambition and potential perceived in this venture. But why such a colossal sum, especially for a company with no product or revenue yet? Several factors contribute to this staggering target: Pedigree and Talent: Mira Murati’s leadership, coupled with the recruitment of AI luminaries like Bob McGrew (ex-OpenAI Chief Research Officer) and Alec Radford (key innovator behind OpenAI’s transformative models), instantly lends credibility and attracts investor interest. This isn’t just a startup; it’s a powerhouse of AI talent. Vision and Ambition: Thinking Machines Lab has articulated a compelling vision: to create AI systems that are “more widely understood, customizable, and generally capable.” This suggests a move beyond current limitations, aiming for more accessible, adaptable, and powerful AI solutions.

Investors are aggressively seeking the next big breakthrough in AI, and the promise of a team led by Murati, with a focus on next-generation AI, is undeniably enticing. The sheer scale of the funding round reflects this intense market enthusiasm. Decoding the $2 Billion Seed Round: What Does it Mean? A $2 billion seed round is unprecedented in the tech startup world, let alone the AI sector. To put this into perspective, typical seed rounds are orders of magnitude smaller. This massive AI funding round signals several key implications: Aspect Implication of $2B Seed Round Valuation Reportedly valuing Thinking Machines Lab at “at least” $10 billion pre-revenue, it sets a new benchmark for AI startup valuations and expectations.

Thinking Machines Lab: Beyond the Hype, What’s the Vision? While the massive seed round and high-profile team generate significant buzz, the crucial question remains: what exactly will Thinking Machines Lab build? Their stated mission to create more “widely understood, customizable, and generally capable” AI systems hints at several potential directions: Explainable AI (XAI): Addressing the ‘black box’ nature of many current AI models, aiming for systems that are transparent and understandable in their decision-making processes. Customizable AI: Moving beyond generic models to create AI solutions that can be tailored and adapted to specific user needs and industries, offering greater flexibility and utility. General-Purpose AI: Potentially pursuing advancements towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), although the specific focus remains to be seen. The emphasis on “generally capable” AI suggests a broader scope than narrow, task-specific models. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, the implications are multifaceted. Firstly, the sheer scale of investment in AI reinforces the ongoing tech revolution and the increasing convergence of different technological domains. Secondly, advancements in AI could have profound impacts on blockchain technology itself, from enhancing security and scalability to enabling more sophisticated decentralized applications.

43194998,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148484,1744338610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Victory for DeFi: Trump Expected to Sign Groundbreaking Crypto Tax Relief Bill,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-sign-defi-tax-relief/,"Exciting news for the crypto world! Brace yourselves, because a potentially game-changing moment for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is on the horizon. Sources close to Crypto In America’s Eleanor Terrett are reporting that former U.S. President Donald Trump is anticipated to imminently sign a joint congressional resolution. This isn’t just any resolution; it’s one that aims to overturn the controversial IRS DeFi broker rule, a move that could significantly alter the landscape of crypto taxation in the United States. What does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, or builder? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and explore the potential implications of this Trump crypto bill . What is the IRS DeFi Broker Rule and Why the Pushback? To understand the significance of this potential signing, we first need to grasp what the IRS DeFi broker rule is and why it has faced such strong opposition from the crypto community. Essentially, the rule, as it stands, could classify certain DeFi protocols and participants as ‘brokers’ for tax purposes. This classification would impose stringent reporting requirements on these entities, demanding them to collect and report information about their users’ transactions to the IRS. Here’s a breakdown of the major concerns: Defining ‘Broker’ in DeFi: The decentralized nature of DeFi makes applying traditional financial definitions like ‘broker’ problematic. DeFi protocols are often governed by smart contracts, not centralized intermediaries. Privacy Concerns: The reporting requirements could compromise the privacy of DeFi users, a core tenet of the crypto ethos. Compliance Burden: Forcing DeFi protocols to comply with broker rules could stifle innovation and drive development overseas, as many protocols lack the infrastructure to meet these demands. Technical Challenges: Collecting and reporting user data in a decentralized environment presents significant technical hurdles. Senator Ted Cruz stepped up to champion the crypto cause, introducing a joint resolution specifically designed to exempt DeFi protocols from these burdensome IRS tax reporting requirements. His resolution gained considerable traction, passing the Senate with bipartisan support – a clear signal of growing understanding and acceptance of crypto within the U.S. political landscape. This bipartisan backing highlights the widespread concern over the potentially damaging impact of the IRS crypto regulation on the burgeoning DeFi sector. The Cruz Resolution: A Beacon of Hope for DeFi Senator Cruz’s resolution represents a critical juncture for the DeFi space. It directly challenges the application of traditional financial regulations to the unique characteristics of decentralized finance. If signed into law, it would essentially create a DeFi broker exemption , clarifying that DeFi protocols, in their current form, are not to be treated as brokers under IRS rules. Key aspects of the resolution include: Targeted Relief: It specifically targets DeFi protocols, acknowledging their distinct operational model compared to traditional financial intermediaries. Clarity and Certainty: Signing the resolution would provide much-needed clarity to the DeFi industry, reducing uncertainty and fostering a more predictable regulatory environment. Promoting Innovation: By removing the threat of onerous reporting obligations, the resolution aims to encourage continued innovation and growth within the DeFi sector in the U.S. Bipartisan Support: The broad support in the Senate underscores a growing consensus on the need for a nuanced approach to crypto regulation. Why is Trump’s Signature a Potential Game Changer for Crypto? The anticipation surrounding Donald Trump’s expected signature is palpable within the crypto community. Why is this particular signature so significant? First Crypto Law Signed by a U.S. President: If signed, this would mark a historic moment – the very first piece of crypto-specific legislation to be signed into law by a U.S. President. This symbolic act carries immense weight, signaling a potential shift towards a more crypto-friendly stance at the highest levels of government. Trump’s Evolving Crypto Stance: While his past views on crypto have been varied, this action could indicate a more favorable or at least pragmatic approach to digital assets from Trump and his administration. Setting a Precedent: This resolution could set a precedent for future crypto legislation, potentially paving the way for more tailored and innovation-friendly regulations. Boost to Market Sentiment: The signing is likely to be viewed very positively by the crypto market, potentially leading to increased investment and adoption of DeFi and other crypto assets. Senator Ted Cruz’s expected presence at the signing ceremony further underscores the importance of this event. It highlights the collaborative effort between lawmakers and the crypto community to shape sensible regulations. This crypto legislation is not just about tax rules; it’s about fostering an environment where innovation can thrive while ensuring responsible growth of the digital asset ecosystem. Benefits of Overturning the IRS DeFi Broker Rule Let’s explore the potential benefits that could ripple through the crypto space if the DeFi tax rule is indeed overturned: Benefit Description Innovation Boost Reduced regulatory burden allows DeFi projects to focus on development and innovation rather than compliance complexities. Increased Investment Clarity and certainty attract more institutional and retail investment into the DeFi sector. User Privacy Protection Maintains a degree of privacy for DeFi users, aligning with the core principles of decentralization. Global Competitiveness Keeps the U.S. competitive in the global race for DeFi innovation and talent. Reduced Compliance Costs DeFi protocols and users avoid potentially exorbitant compliance costs associated with broker rules. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While overturning the IRS DeFi broker rule is largely seen as a positive step, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges and considerations remain: Future Regulatory Landscape: This resolution addresses one specific rule, but the broader regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving. Ongoing dialogue and collaboration are crucial. Taxation of DeFi Still Needed: Exempting DeFi from broker rules doesn’t mean DeFi transactions are tax-free. Clear and appropriate tax guidelines for DeFi activities will still be necessary. Balancing Innovation and Compliance: The challenge lies in finding the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible financial practices within the crypto space. Global Regulatory Coordination: Crypto is global, and international regulatory coordination will be essential for consistent and effective oversight. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what can you, as a crypto enthusiast, take away from this development? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the crypto space. This is a rapidly evolving area, and staying informed is crucial. Engage with Policymakers: Support organizations and initiatives that advocate for sensible crypto regulations. Your voice matters! Understand Tax Implications: Even with this potential relief, remember that crypto transactions generally have tax implications. Consult with a tax professional for personalized advice. Explore DeFi Opportunities: A more favorable regulatory environment could unlock further opportunities in the DeFi space. Research and explore responsibly. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point for DeFi The expected signing of the resolution overturning the IRS DeFi broker rule is more than just a technical adjustment; it’s a potential turning point for the DeFi sector in the United States. It represents a victory for sensible regulation, innovation, and the crypto community as a whole. While challenges remain, this move signals a growing recognition of the unique nature of DeFi and a willingness to create a regulatory environment that fosters its growth. Keep watching this space – the future of DeFi and crypto regulation is unfolding before our eyes, and this Trump crypto bill could be a pivotal moment in that journey.

Infrastructure & Network Tokens: EIGEN (EigenLayer), GEOD (Geodnet), HNT (Helium). These projects are building crucial infrastructure for the decentralized web. Beyond the Classified: Uncharted Crypto Territories Interestingly, Grayscale also included a set of “unclassified assets,” hinting at exploration beyond their current Crypto Sectors framework. These include projects like Babylon, BERA, Monad, MOVE, Lombard, OM, SYRUP, ELIZA, DEEP, GRASS, Prime Intellect, Sentient, Space and Time, and WAL. This suggests Grayscale is not just looking at established categories but also venturing into more novel and experimental areas within the digital assets space. Why is This Expansion a Big Deal for Crypto Investors? Grayscale’s interest in these new assets carries significant weight. Here’s why: Increased Institutional Exposure: Grayscale products often serve as a bridge for institutional investors to enter the crypto market. Adding these assets to their offerings could channel significant institutional capital into these projects. Retail Investor Access: For retail investors, Grayscale products provide a regulated and potentially simpler way to gain exposure to various cryptocurrencies without directly managing wallets and exchanges. Market Validation: Grayscale’s consideration can be seen as a form of validation for these projects, potentially boosting their credibility and market awareness. Price Impact: Historically, assets listed on Grayscale’s watchlist, and especially those eventually included in their investment products, have often experienced positive price movements due to increased demand and investor interest. What Kind of Investment Products Could We See? While being on the “Assets Under Consideration” list is not a guarantee of product launch, it’s a crucial first step. Grayscale offers various types of crypto investment products , including: Single-Asset Trusts: These trusts focus on a single cryptocurrency, like their Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) or Ethereum Trust (ETHE). We could potentially see new trusts for some of the assets on the watchlist. Diversified Funds: Grayscale also offers diversified funds that hold a basket of cryptocurrencies, like their Digital Large Cap Fund. New funds with different focuses (e.g., DeFi fund, AI crypto fund) could be on the horizon. ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): With the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the door is potentially open for other crypto ETFs. Grayscale might be exploring ETFs for some of these new assets in the future. Navigating the Altcoin Landscape: What to Consider? The inclusion of such a wide array of altcoins on Grayscale’s watchlist highlights the growing diversity within the crypto market. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in altcoins comes with its own set of considerations: Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Price swings can be significant. Risk Assessment: Thoroughly research each project. Understand its technology, team, use case, and tokenomics before investing. Market Sentiment: Altcoin prices are often heavily influenced by market sentiment and trends. Stay informed about the overall crypto market conditions. Long-Term Potential: Consider the long-term viability and adoption potential of each project. Is it solving a real problem? Does it have a strong community and development team? What’s Next for Grayscale and the Crypto Market? Grayscale’s expanded Grayscale watchlist is a clear indicator of their bullish stance on the future of the crypto market and their commitment to offering a wider range of investment options. While it remains to be seen which of these assets will ultimately make it into new investment products, this move undoubtedly injects fresh excitement and opportunity into the digital asset space.

43195570,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148494,1744339802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Approval: Hong Kong SFC Greenlights Ethereum Staking for HashKey & OSL,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hong-kong-eth-staking-approval/,"Get ready for a significant leap in Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency landscape! The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has just given the nod to HashKey and OSL, two prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, to offer Ethereum staking services. This landmark decision marks a pivotal moment for crypto investors in Hong Kong, opening up exciting new avenues within a regulated framework. For those keeping a close eye on the evolving world of digital assets, this news is a game-changer. Hong Kong SFC Approves Ethereum Staking: What Does It Mean? So, what exactly does this SFC approval mean for you? Previously, Hong Kong investors could indirectly participate in staking rewards through Ethereum ETFs that incorporated staking mechanisms. However, HashKey has announced on its website that this approval now allows users to directly stake their ETH holdings through the HashKey platform itself. OSL has also received the green light to provide similar services, further solidifying this trend. This direct access to Ethereum staking represents a significant enhancement for investors looking to maximize their crypto holdings. Let’s break down the key takeaways: Direct ETH Staking Access: Investors can now stake ETH directly on platforms like HashKey, rather than solely relying on ETF exposure. Regulatory Clarity: The SFC’s approval provides a clear regulatory framework for Ethereum staking activities in Hong Kong, fostering greater trust and security. Expanded Investment Opportunities: This move broadens the range of investment strategies available to crypto enthusiasts in Hong Kong. Platform Growth: For HashKey and OSL, this approval signifies a major expansion of their service offerings and strengthens their position in the competitive crypto exchange market. Why is Ethereum Staking Gaining Traction? Ethereum staking has become increasingly popular as the Ethereum network transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Instead of relying on energy-intensive mining, PoS allows ETH holders to ‘stake’ their coins to support the network’s operations and earn rewards in return. Think of it as earning interest on your crypto holdings while contributing to the security and efficiency of the blockchain. Here’s a quick comparison to understand the benefits: Feature Proof-of-Work (PoW) – Previous Ethereum Model Proof-of-Stake (PoS) – Current Ethereum Model Consensus Mechanism Mining – Solving complex computational problems Staking – Locking up ETH to validate transactions Energy Consumption High Significantly Lower Reward System Block rewards for miners Staking rewards for validators Accessibility Requires specialized hardware and technical expertise More accessible to ETH holders with varying technical skills As you can see, Ethereum staking offers a more sustainable and accessible way to participate in the network and earn passive income. This shift towards PoS is a major reason why staking is becoming a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. Navigating Hong Kong Crypto Regulation: A Maturing Market Hong Kong crypto regulation has been evolving rapidly, aiming to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting investors. The SFC’s approval of Ethereum staking services for HashKey and OSL is a testament to this maturing regulatory landscape. It signals a more welcoming approach to digital assets within a well-defined framework. This regulatory clarity is crucial for attracting institutional investors and fostering broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. Consider these points regarding Hong Kong’s crypto regulation : Progressive Approach: Hong Kong is positioning itself as a hub for digital assets by adopting a relatively progressive regulatory stance compared to some other jurisdictions. Investor Protection: The SFC’s involvement underscores a commitment to investor protection within the crypto space. Market Growth: Clear regulations can attract more businesses and investors to the Hong Kong crypto market, leading to further growth and innovation. Global Significance: Hong Kong’s regulatory developments are closely watched globally and can influence regulatory trends in other regions. HashKey and OSL: Leading the Charge in Ethereum Staking HashKey and OSL are not just any exchanges; they are among the first licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong. Their SFC approval to offer Ethereum staking services further solidifies their leadership positions in the region’s burgeoning crypto market. By embracing staking, they are catering to the growing demand for yield-generating crypto products and demonstrating their commitment to offering innovative services within a compliant environment. Here’s why HashKey and OSL’s move is significant: Pioneer Status: As licensed platforms, their foray into Ethereum staking sets a precedent for other regulated entities in Hong Kong and potentially beyond. Enhanced Service Offerings: Staking expands their service portfolio, making them more attractive to users seeking comprehensive crypto solutions. Market Confidence: Their involvement adds credibility and confidence to the Ethereum staking ecosystem in Hong Kong. Competitive Advantage: Offering regulated staking services gives them a competitive edge in attracting and retaining users in a dynamic market. Unlock Exciting Opportunities with Ethereum Staking in Hong Kong The SFC approval for Ethereum staking in Hong Kong is more than just regulatory news; it’s a gateway to exciting new opportunities for crypto investors. By providing a regulated and accessible pathway to staking, Hong Kong is solidifying its position as a forward-thinking crypto hub. Whether you are a seasoned crypto investor or just exploring the possibilities, this development opens doors to potentially enhance your portfolio with staking rewards within a secure and regulated environment. Keep an eye on HashKey and OSL as they roll out their Ethereum staking services and explore how you can benefit from this groundbreaking advancement. In conclusion, the Hong Kong SFC’s decision to approve Ethereum staking for HashKey and OSL is a landmark moment. It underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market in Hong Kong and provides investors with regulated access to the burgeoning world of staking rewards. This move not only benefits individual investors but also strengthens Hong Kong’s position as a leading center for digital asset innovation and responsible crypto regulation .

The feature is available to US, Singapore, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Channel Islands users. Coinbase’s Verified Pools are available to institutional and retail traders and offer KYC-verified liquidity pools to maintain the company's position regarding the openness and efficiency of on-chain markets. Safer Way for Retail and Institutional Clients to Engage with DeFi Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase launched KYC-Verified Pools, which it claims reduces counterparty risk for decentralized finance (DeFi) retail and institutional participants. In a blog post announcing the launch of Verified Pools , the exchange markets the service as a “trusted and seamless way to access liquidity pools” for “both retail and institutional participants in eligible locations.” The exchange highlights the launch of Verified Pools as the next step in the exchange’s “advancing on-chain adoption.” Seamless Onchain Trading and Swapping Through Verified Pools, Coinbase introduces “a trusted way to seamlessly trade and swap onchain.” The service is available to institutions seeking liquidity and retail traders looking for an easy way to trade on-chain. According to Coinbase, Verified Pools set a new standard in which compliance efficiency, trust and transparency meet. Powered by Base, Utilizing the Uniswap v4 Protocol According to Coinbase, Verified Pools is a “breakthrough” in on-chain liquidity by leveraging the company’s KYC-integrated verification system, Coinbase Verification. Through the seamless integration of identity verification and smart contract transparency, Verified Pools reduces counterparty risks while maintaining the openness and efficiency of on-chain markets. Verified Pools is powered by Coinbase’s scalable Layer-2 network, Base, and is built on the Uniswap v4 protocol. Coinbase also partnered with Gauntlet, a leading risk modelling and economic optimization provider, which will optimize liquidity pool configurations and maintain overall liquidity pool health to ensure liquidity. Recognizing that institutional investors, traders, and liquidity providers have long battled to participate in on-chain trading with enhanced security standards, Coinbase delivered Verified Pools to ease their way into it. Institutions gain numerous benefits with Verified Pools, including: “Concentrated Liquidity: Liquidity providers can specify a price range for their capital, enhancing capital efficiency and earning potential. Controlled Access: Coinbase Verifications provide the onchain credentials required for access to Verified Pools liquidity. This ensures that only verified users can supply or interact with liquidity. Autonomy: Verified Pools are non-custodial which allow you to maintain control and ownership over your assets.” How to Access Verified Pools Verified Pools are connected through Coinbase’s “institutional-grade” Prime Onchain Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, or any third-party wallet with Coinbase Verification credentials. Users must complete Coinbase’s KYC-procedure to join the initiative and address the necessary compliance concerns associated with the DeFi sector. Verified Pools are available in the US, Singapore, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Channel Islands. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

New Hampshire’s House passed its Bitcoin reserve bill, HB302, in a 192-179 vote on April 10 which will now head to the Senate. The state is now the fourth to pass a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve bill through one chamber, joining Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma. If HB302 clears New Hampshire’s Senate and Governor Kelly Ayotte signs it into law it would allow the state’s treasurer to use 10% of the state’s general fund and other authorized funds to invest in precious metals and certain digital assets. The bill also sets out how they should be custodied. The bill specifies that only cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $500 billion would be eligible for investment, a criteria that only Bitcoin currently meets. New Hampshire’s House votes to pass HB302, the state’s Bitcoin reserve bill. Source: New Hampshire House of Representatives In a debate prior to the vote, Democrat Representative Terry Spahr argued that the bill is unnecessary and could undermine the future security of the state’s digital assets stockpile. “Unbeknownst to the committee and to the sponsor the treasurer testified that they already have that authority,” Spahr said. He added that cryptocurrency is “constantly shifting and changing, and it’s sort of dangerous to be kind of locked into certain types of security measures, and I think that bill does this.” Republican Representative Jordan Ulery countered that the bill was necessary as it could create the “potential for a large amount of money being earned by the state in these investments.” New Hampshire has two other blockchain-related bills working their way through the legislature — HB310, which covers stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization (RWA) and HB 639, which deals with blockchain regulation and dispute resolution. Florida House Committee passes Bitcoin reserve bill Meanwhile on April 10, Florida’s House Insurance and Banking Committee passed the state’s Bitcoin reserve bill , HB487, with a unanimous vote. The bill has three committees to clear before it progresses to Florida’s House.

Webster Barnaby pic.twitter.com/myAlNvtFl9 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) April 10, 2025 Similar to New Hampshire’s bill, HB487 would allow Florida’s chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of certain state funds — including the General Revenue Fund and the Budget Stabilization Fund — into Bitcoin. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Representative Webster Barnaby pleaded with the Committee before the vote “to vote up on this very important bill” which he claimed would “put Florida in the leading edge of this very new technology.” Related: US federal agencies to report crypto holdings to Treasury by April 7 Florida’s bill gives the state’s financial chief the ability to invest in digital assets directly, through certain qualified custodians, or through exchange-traded products and details security and custody requirements. According to Bitcoin Laws, which tracks the progress of digital assets legislation, Arizona is currently leading the race to become the first US state to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Source: Bitcoin Laws On March 24, two digital assets reserve bills, SB1373 and SB1025, cleared Arizona’s House Rules Committee and are now headed to the state’s House for a full floor vote. If passed by the House, the bills would then need the signature of Arizona’s Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs to become law.

This dramatic development, revealed by Helium founder Amir Haleem on X, marks a significant shift in the ongoing saga between crypto innovators and regulatory bodies. But what exactly does this mean for Helium, for the broader landscape of crypto regulation , and for investors holding HNT and other related tokens? What Sparked the SEC Lawsuit Against Nova Labs? Earlier this year, the SEC initiated legal action against Nova Labs, alleging that the company had been offering and selling unregistered securities . The core of the SEC’s argument revolved around the assertion that Helium’s native token, HNT, along with MOBILE and IoT tokens, qualified as securities under U.S. law. The SEC further claimed that Nova Labs had misled investors regarding the nature and risks associated with these digital assets. To recap the SEC’s accusations: Unregistered Securities Sales: The SEC contended that Nova Labs had sold HNT, MOBILE, and IoT tokens without proper registration, violating securities laws. Misleading Investors: The lawsuit suggested that Nova Labs had not been transparent enough about the risks and nature of these crypto assets, potentially misleading investors. Helium (HNT) Community Celebrates a Major Victory The news of the SEC withdrawing its lawsuit has been met with jubilation within the Helium community. For months, the legal cloud cast a shadow over the project, creating uncertainty and potentially hindering growth and adoption. With the lawsuit now dropped, Helium HNT and its ecosystem can breathe a collective sigh of relief and refocus on its mission of building a decentralized wireless infrastructure. The dismissal is widely seen as a significant win for Nova Labs and a potential indicator of shifting winds in the regulatory approach towards certain types of crypto projects. It raises questions about the SEC’s criteria for classifying digital assets as securities and whether this case signals a more nuanced perspective. Impact on Crypto Regulation and the Industry This development arrives at a crucial juncture for the cryptocurrency industry, which has been grappling with regulatory ambiguity and increased scrutiny from agencies like the SEC. The decision to drop the SEC Lawsuit against Nova Labs could have several broader implications: Precedent Setting? While each case is unique, this withdrawal might suggest a re-evaluation within the SEC regarding enforcement actions against certain crypto projects, particularly those focused on utility and decentralized infrastructure rather than pure financial speculation. Clarity on Token Classification: The lawsuit’s dismissal could prompt further discussion and hopefully, clearer guidelines on when a digital token is deemed a security. The industry has long called for more explicit rules to foster innovation while ensuring compliance. Investor Confidence Boost: The resolution of the lawsuit could inject renewed confidence into the crypto market, particularly for projects operating in the decentralized infrastructure space. It demonstrates that regulatory challenges can be overcome and that constructive dialogue is possible. What’s Next for Nova Labs and Helium? With the legal hurdle cleared, Nova Labs can now fully concentrate on expanding the Helium network and fostering its ecosystem. The project has ambitious goals for providing decentralized wireless coverage and enabling a range of IoT applications. The lawsuit’s dismissal allows them to move forward without the distraction and burden of costly litigation. Key areas of focus for Helium moving forward could include: Network Expansion: Continuing to grow the global network of Helium hotspots, enhancing coverage and capacity. Ecosystem Development: Encouraging more applications and use cases to be built on top of the Helium network, driving demand for HNT and network usage. Community Engagement: Further strengthening the Helium community, which is a vital component of its decentralized model. Navigating the Complexities of Unregistered Securities in Crypto The core issue in the SEC’s lawsuit was the classification of HNT and other tokens as unregistered securities . This remains a central challenge for many crypto projects. Understanding what constitutes a security under the Howey Test and other legal frameworks is crucial for projects operating in the U.S. market. Here are some key takeaways for crypto projects regarding securities compliance: Aspect Consideration Token Utility Demonstrating genuine utility beyond just investment can strengthen arguments against security classification. Decentralization A higher degree of decentralization in governance and operations may be viewed more favorably by regulators. Disclosure Transparency and clear communication with investors about risks and tokenomics are essential. Legal Counsel Seeking expert legal advice early on is crucial to navigate the complex regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Ray of Hope for Crypto Innovation? The SEC’s decision to drop the lawsuit against Nova Labs is undoubtedly a positive development for Helium and the wider crypto space. While it doesn’t necessarily signal a complete shift in regulatory stance, it does offer a glimmer of hope that regulators may be adopting a more nuanced approach, considering the unique characteristics of decentralized technologies and their potential benefits. For now, the Helium community and crypto enthusiasts alike can celebrate this victory and look forward to continued innovation in the decentralized wireless space.

This legislation, which has passed through both the Senate and the House, aims to prevent the IRS from enforcing tax reporting requirements on DeFi protocols. The move is seen as a key development in crypto regulation. Donald Trump Signs First Crypto-Related Bill Into Law According to ex-Fox journalist Eleanor Terret, the US president Donald Trump has signed the resolution into law imminently. Two sources familiar with the matter said President Donald Trump has signed the resolution, with Senator Ted Cruz attending the event as its lead sponsor in the Senate. SCOOP: President Trump is expected to sign Congress’s joint resolution to overturn the IRS DeFi broker rule into law imminently, according to two people familiar with the plans. @SenTedCruz , who introduced the joint resolution in the Senate, is expected to be present at the… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 10, 2025 The bill marks the first time a US president will sign a crypto-related bill into law. It comes after weeks of legislative activity, during which both chambers of Congress passed versions of the resolution with broad bipartisan support. The Senate passed the final version of the bill on March 26 with a 70–28 vote after the House approved it on March 11. Overview of the Repealed IRS Rule The IRS DeFi broker rule, introduced during the Biden administration, was designed to expand existing tax reporting requirements to DeFi platforms. Consequently, these platforms are required to report gross proceeds from crypto transactions and provide identifying details about the parties involved. The rule was part of a broader effort to close tax gaps and improve oversight in the cryptocurrency sector. However, the rule drew criticism from the crypto industry and some lawmakers. Opponents argued that the decentralized structure of DeFi protocols makes it difficult or impossible to gather user data or file tax reports. Many, however, said that enforcing such requirements would hinder development and discourage innovation in the blockchain space. Congressional Action and Political Support The resolution to overturn the IRS rule passed with broad support in both chambers of Congress. Although a similar resolution passed in the Senate earlier in March, a revised version originated in the House due to rules governing tax-related legislation. The final Senate vote on March 26 completed the process and sent the resolution to President Donald Trump. Senator Ted Cruz, who introduced the resolution, stated that the IRS rule was “an attack on emerging technologies that could transform financial systems.” As a result, the legislation received support from lawmakers who emphasized the need for clear, innovation-friendly policies on crypto regulation. David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto advisor, confirmed President Donald Trump supports eliminating the rule. Sacks said the administration aims to protect decentralized technologies from what it sees as overregulation. Implications After Donald Trump Sign Once signed into law by Donald Trump, the resolution will exempt DeFi platforms from complying with certain IRS tax reporting obligations. This will, as a result, give developers and operators of decentralized protocols more freedom to operate without facing regulatory penalties for noncompliance with rules they cannot practically follow. The repeal also signals a shift in how federal policymakers view crypto technologies. With this bill, US President Donald Trump will formalize a new stance on crypto regulation that emphasizes technological growth and decentralized innovation. Industry groups like the DeFi Education Fund have supported the resolution and called it a step toward more practical crypto policy in the United States.

43196201,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148496,1744341057,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Fusion: Google DeepMind to Merge Gemini and Veo Models,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gemini-veo-ai-models-fusion/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts and tech aficionados! Google DeepMind is about to unleash a game-changer in the AI world. Imagine a future where AI not only understands text and images but also grasps the nuances of the physical world through video. That future is inching closer as Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently unveiled plans to combine their cutting-edge Gemini and Veo AI models . Why Merge Gemini and Veo? Unveiling the Vision In a fascinating discussion on the “Possible” podcast, Hassabis articulated Google’s ambitious vision for a “universal digital assistant.” This isn’t just about creating another chatbot; it’s about building an AI that can truly assist you in the real world. The key to this? Multimodal AI . Gemini , designed from the ground up to be multimodal, is poised to become even more powerful by integrating with Veo , Google’s advanced video-generating model. Here’s a breakdown of the core idea: Enhanced World Understanding: By combining Gemini with Veo , Google aims to equip Gemini AI models with a deeper understanding of the physical world. Veo’s video processing capabilities will enrich Gemini’s knowledge base beyond text and images. Universal Digital Assistant: The ultimate goal is to create an AI assistant that’s not limited to digital interactions but can bridge the gap between the digital and physical realms, offering more comprehensive and context-aware support. The Rise of Omni Models: This move aligns with the broader industry trend toward “omni” models – AI systems capable of processing and generating various media formats. Google, alongside competitors like OpenAI and Amazon, is pushing the boundaries of what AI can do. Veo’s Secret Weapon: YouTube’s Vast Video Data Where does Veo get its incredible ability to understand the physical world from video? The answer, according to Hassabis, lies in YouTube. Google’s ownership of YouTube provides a massive trove of video data, which is crucial for training Veo . Hassabis hinted that Veo 2 learns “the physics of the world” by watching “a lot of YouTube videos.” This raises some interesting points: Data is King: Training these advanced AI models requires enormous datasets of diverse media – text, images, audio, and especially video. YouTube’s vast library is a significant asset for Google in this AI race. Ethical Considerations: Google has acknowledged using “some” YouTube content for training, adhering to agreements with creators. However, the scale of data usage for training omni models raises ongoing discussions about data privacy and creator compensation in the age of AI. Competitive Advantage: Access to YouTube’s video data gives Google a distinct advantage in developing video-understanding AI models compared to companies without such a vast video platform. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? While the immediate impact on the cryptocurrency world might not be direct, the advancements in AI models like Gemini and Veo have broader implications: Smarter Applications: More sophisticated AI models can lead to smarter applications across various sectors, including potentially impacting how blockchain technology is used and developed. Imagine AI-powered tools for analyzing crypto market trends or enhancing blockchain security. Increased Efficiency: As AI models become more adept at understanding complex data, they can drive efficiency gains in various industries, potentially including the crypto space. New Possibilities: The development of omni models opens up entirely new possibilities we haven’t even imagined yet. From enhanced virtual experiences to more intuitive human-computer interactions, the future powered by advanced AI models is brimming with potential. The Road Ahead for Gemini and Veo The integration of Gemini and Veo is not just a minor upgrade; it’s a strategic move by Google DeepMind to push the boundaries of AI models . As the industry moves towards more comprehensive and versatile AI, Google’s approach highlights the importance of multimodal capabilities and access to vast datasets. This fusion promises to deliver: More Context-Aware AI: Gemini will be able to understand and respond to user queries with a richer understanding of the real world, gleaned from video data. Enhanced Creative Tools: Imagine the creative possibilities when a powerful language model like Gemini is combined with a video generation model like Veo . Content creation could reach new heights of sophistication and efficiency. A Leap Towards General AI: While still far from general artificial intelligence, these advancements represent incremental steps toward creating AI that can reason and understand the world in a more human-like way. In conclusion, Google DeepMind’s plan to combine Gemini and Veo is a significant development in the AI landscape. It underscores the industry’s focus on creating multimodal AI that can understand and interact with the world in more comprehensive ways. As these AI models evolve, we can expect to see even more transformative applications across various sectors, paving the way for a future where AI plays an increasingly integral role in our lives.

According to an Apr. 10 press release statement from Rep. Mike Carey (R-Ohio), who introduced the bill alongside Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the president’s signing of the bill marks a major legislative win for the crypto industry and its advocates in Congress. The bill repeals an IRS DeFi broker rule finalized at the end of 2024 that expanded the definition of “broker” to include decentralized finance platforms and other non-custodial digital asset services. The rule would have required DeFi platforms, wallet providers, and front-end protocol interfaces to collect user information and report crypto transaction data using Form 1099. “This is the first cryptocurrency bill ever signed into law and the first tax-related Congressional Review Act of Disapproval signed into law,” Rep. Carey said in a statement. He added that the rule “needlessly hindered American innovation” and would have overwhelmed the IRS with compliance demands it is unequipped to handle. “By repealing this misguided rule, President Trump and Congress have given the IRS an opportunity to return its focus to the duties and obligations it already owes to American taxpayers instead of creating a new series of bureaucratic hurdles.” — Mike Carey, Ohio Congressman You might also like: OpenSea pushes SEC to drop exchange, broker designation for NFT marketplaces The resolution, known as H.J.Res.25, passed the Senate on Mar. 4, 2025, and the House on Mar. 11. Due to its budget-related implications, the bill required a final Senate vote , which occurred on Mar. 26, before being sent to the president’s desk. Trump’s signature ensures the rule “shall have no force or effect,” and prevents the IRS from issuing a similar rule without explicit Congressional approval under the CRA. The White House had already voiced support for the resolution, calling the rule a “midnight regulation” introduced during the final days of the Biden administration. The signing comes amid a wider regulatory shift in Washington. In recent months, the Securities and Exchange Commission under acting chair Mark Uyeda dropped lawsuits against firms like Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. On Apr. 8, the Department of Justice also disbanded its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, citing strategic missteps. In another major development, Paul Atkins, a long-time SEC commissioner and crypto advocate, is set to officially take office as the new SEC chair after Senate confirmation . With Atkins in office, industry insiders expect the agency to shift focus away from enforcement towards a more supportive environment for crypto innovation.

The move marks a major rollback of a Biden-era tax reporting measure and further signals Trump’s alignment with the crypto industry. Finalized in late 2024, the IRS rule was meant to clarify that new broker reporting requirements also applied to DeFi platforms. The rule was not yet in force but was scheduled to take effect in 2026. It aimed to ensure crypto users paid taxes on asset sales. The Treasury estimated that billions in crypto-related taxes were going uncollected each year. HISTORY MADE Just now, @POTUS signed my bill to repeal to the IRS DeFi Crypto Broker Rule. This is the first cryptocurrency bill EVER signed into law by a president. @HouseGOP is working to keep America as the crypto capital of the world! — Congressman Mike Carey (@RepMikeCarey) April 10, 2025 Regulators Face Resistance After Expanding Broker Scope to DeFi The rule drew sharp criticism from the digital asset industry. DeFi platforms, unlike centralized exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, do not act as intermediaries. They also lack access to user identities. Executives and developers said the rule was technically impossible to follow and legally risky. They warned it placed unworkable burdens on protocols built to be permissionless. Industry lobbying intensified after the IRS expanded the definition of “broker” to include software-based DeFi tools. Crypto advocates called the move government overreach, warning it would push development overseas. Republicans backed their concerns and moved to block the rule using the Congressional Review Act. Trump Backs Crypto Industry in Reversing DeFi Tax Mandate In March, both chambers of Congress passed the resolution with a simple majority . The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that repealing the rule could cost the government nearly $4b over ten years. Despite the projected loss, lawmakers supporting the repeal argued that privacy, technical feasibility and innovation were more important. Rep. Mike Carey said: “The DeFi Broker Rule needlessly hindered American innovation, infringed on the privacy of everyday Americans, and was set to overwhelm the IRS with an overflow of new filings that it doesn’t have the infrastructure to handle during tax season.” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith added that with Trump’s signature, Congress had reaffirmed its authority to write tax law rather than leaving it to regulators. Trump has positioned himself as a strong supporter of the crypto industry, pledging to make the US a global hub for digital assets. His administration quickly moved to establish a federal working group on crypto regulation and announced a national Bitcoin reserve strategy within weeks of his inauguration.

In an Apr. 11 blog post on its official Medium page, Helium called the outcome “a major win for Helium ( HNT ) and The People’s Network.” The dismissal resolves long-standing uncertainty about the regulatory status of its three main tokens, HNT, IOT, and MOBILE. The SEC has agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning the agency cannot pursue the same charges again in the future. Helium credited the agency’s new leadership for bringing clarity to crypto infrastructure projects, which has helped close a chapter that had created uncertainty for the wider Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network sector. According to Helium , this legal outcome provides clarity that selling hardware and distributing tokens to promote network growth does not automatically classify them as securities under U.S. law.

According to court documents reviewed by Yahoo Finance, Nova Labs agreed to pay the SEC to settle civil securities fraud charges over allegedly misleading investors during a fundraising round in 2021–2022. The SEC accused the company of exaggerating partnerships with Nestle, Lime, and Salesforce to attract investment at a $1 billion valuation. Nova Labs did not admit or deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The SEC originally filed the lawsuit in January, shortly before former Chair Gary Gensler stepped down. Since then, under the new Trump administration, the SEC has dropped several high-profile cases against crypto firms including Coinbase, Kraken, and Consensys. In addition, Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly regulator and advocate, was confirmed as the new SEC chairman on Apr. 10. Atkins is expected to steer the agency towards clearer digital asset rules that promote innovation.

This Undervalued DeFi Coin Might Be the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/this-undervalued-defi-coin-might-be-the-best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-now/,"The post Next Crypto to Hit $1? This Undervalued DeFi Coin Might Be the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto market steadily recovers and interest in smaller-cap tokens grows, a handful of projects are beginning to attract serious attention from analysts and early investors alike. One of the latest names to spark conversation is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a relatively new decentralized finance protocol that some believe is quietly setting itself up to be the next crypto to hit $1. Currently priced at $0.025 during its presale, MUTM is already gaining traction among those looking for value-driven opportunities in the DeFi crypto space. So what’s fueling the confidence behind this price target? A combination of real world utility, well-structured tokenomics, increasing investor interest, and a product launch timeline that adds momentum to the outlook. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What makes Mutuum different from many other emerging tokens is its clear focus on solving an actual problem. The platform offers a decentralized, non-custodial system where users can lend or borrow digital assets through smart contracts. This includes both pooled lending, where users earn passive yield by providing liquidity, and peer-to-peer agreements for more tailored loan terms. When lenders deposit assets into the protocol, they receive mtTokens in return, which accumulate interest automatically. Borrowers, meanwhile, can access liquidity by locking up collateral, giving them access to funds without selling their underlying holdings. This kind of structure puts Mutuum in line with other working DeFi crypto models but with a few key updates that improve usability and transparency. With over $6.4 million already raised and thousands of users joining the presale, MUTM is already showing signs of strong early adoption. Unlike tokens that rely on hype, Mutuum’s steady growth has been driven by functionality, roadmap clarity, and growing confidence from both retail investors and crypto investment analysts. The protocol’s total token supply is capped at 4 billion, offering a clear sense of structure for future valuation. With the token priced at just $0.025 in the current presale phase, a move to $1 would represent a 40x return. While that may sound ambitious, analysts point to a number of factors that make this target plausible within a reasonable timeframe. For example, an investor putting in $1,000 at the current presale price would receive 40,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $1, that same position would be worth $40,000 — a significant return made possible by entering early in a project with measurable fundamentals and market potential. Unlike many presale projects that take months or even years to deliver a product, Mutuum is preparing to launch a beta version of its platform around the time the token goes live. This means users will be able to engage with the core protocol features almost immediately, rather than speculating on future development. Access to a working product from day one can play a major role in supporting early token demand. Users will be able to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral as soon as the platform is live, tying MUTM’s value directly to real world utility and platform activity. Another component analysts are watching closely is the way revenue generated by the platform is tied to MUTM’s token economy. A portion of the interest paid by borrowers is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market. These are then distributed to holders of mtTokens, introducing consistent buy pressure and providing rewards for those who engage with the platform. This built-in feedback loop encourages long-term participation and helps stabilize token demand as usage grows. As more borrowers use the platform, more revenue flows back into MUTM, supporting price growth in a measurable way. Why $1 Isn’t Out of Reach With all of these elements in place, the $1 target is beginning to look less like speculation and more like a strategic milestone. From its current presale price, it would only take modest adoption and platform engagement to justify a climb to that level — especially with the protocol’s low market cap and focused use case. Early-stage tokens often see dramatic appreciation once they reach public markets and begin generating real activity. For Mutuum Finance, the presence of a functioning protocol, combined with strong tokenomics and increasing visibility, creates a pathway that analysts believe makes the $1 mark achievable, not aspirational. Many are beginning to see MUTM as the next big cryptocurrency, backed by infrastructure and demand rather than narrative alone. For those still considering whether to participate, the current presale window may be one of the last opportunities to get in before exchange listings and product rollout begin to change the pricing floor. In short, Mutuum Finance isn’t trying to sell hype. It’s building infrastructure that works — and that’s exactly what long-term crypto investment seekers are starting to notice.

He used a UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart to map out the price XRP holders acquired their coins. According to Martinez, the data points to key support zones at $1.39 and $1.67, with major resistance forming at $2.04 and $2.38. $XRP key support levels sit at $1.67 and $1.39, while major resistance stands at $2.04 and $2.38! pic.twitter.com/VpmCwaU9tK — Ali (@ali_charts) April 9, 2025 Realized Price Distribution Reveals Holder Behavior The URPD chart shows the volume of XRP moved at different price levels, providing insight into where investors may become active again. At the $1.39 level, roughly 1.29 billion XRP were last moved, while $1.67 accounts for over 1.15 billion. These prices mark significant cost bases and could act as support as investors look to defend those positions. On the resistance side, $2.04 and $2.38 stand out. More than 1.12 billion XRP were moved at $2.04, and $2.38 is even more substantial, representing 2.13 billion XRP, making it the largest concentration in the higher price range. Following the digital asset’s recent decline , Martinez’s post highlights crucial levels to watch as it attempts to recover. These levels suggest where sell pressure may increase as XRP approaches previous break-even zones. Large Accumulation Below $1 While Martinez focused on upper-level price zones, the chart also reveals a large cluster of transactions in the $0.44–$0.57 range. One bar in this region shows over 6 billion XRP moved, the highest on the chart. Though not highlighted as immediate support, this accumulation is a broader structural base and reflects strong historical buying interest at lower levels.

Each bar represents how much XRP moved at specific price levels, and higher bars indicate a stronger potential influence in future price action. While he avoided direct predictions, his use of the URPD data presents a more grounded approach to determining support and resistance based on actual market behavior. The asset’s low price also presents a good buying opportunity, as one expert recently described buying now as a no-brainer . XRP is trading at $1.99 after a 13.15% increase from yesterday. With the digital asset trading between large clusters of realized volume, price movement through or rejection at these key levels may determine the next trend, and the next crucial level to watch is $2.04.

Despite this plunge in spot trading volume, the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has continued to lead other platforms, with its share of spot volume increasing by the end of the first quarter. Binance Leads Spot Volume Market According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, bitcoin’s spot trading volume on exchanges fell from a high of $44 billion on February 3 to $10 billion by the end of Q1. Likewise, the total altcoin spot trading volume on crypto trading platforms plummeted from $122 billion to $23 billion within the same period. While total spot trading volume generally declined, Binance saw more trading activity compared to other crypto exchanges. This indicates that trading volumes on other exchanges reduced much faster than on Binance and that the world’s leading crypto platform became the largest liquidity venue during periods of higher market volatility. From February 3 to the end of Q1, Binance’s share of total Bitcoin spot trading volume rose from 33% to 49%, while that of altcoins spiked from 38% to 44%. Binance now accounts for almost 50% of total crypto spot trading volume. Largest Liquidity Venue During Volatility Substantiating the claim that Binance becomes the venue for the largest trading liquidity in times of high volatility, CryptoQuant revealed that the exchange’s spot trading volume surpassed that of all other platforms combined between February 24 and 26, when BTC plummeted from $96,000 to $90,000. Bitcoin’s decline during those two days triggered a substantial correction in the crypto market, affecting other coins; however, Binance’s altcoin spot trading volume rose to 64%, adding a total of $18 billion. In addition, CryptoQuant discovered that some altcoins have shown relatively high spot trading volumes despite the overall market correction. Market participants are trading large-cap assets like Binance Coin (BNB), Toncoin (TON), and EOS (EOS) with relatively high activity on Binance, regardless of the decline in crypto volumes. Meanwhile, Binance is planning to delist several altcoins on April 16, including Badger (BADGER), Balancer (BAL), Beta Finance (BETA), Cream (CREAM), Cortex (CTXC), aelf (ELF), Firo (FIRO), and Kava Lend (HARD). The delisting follows a collective decision by users via the exchange’s Vote to Delist mechanism.

CryptoQuant analysts said in an April 10 markets report that if Bitcoin ( BTC ) “continues to rally,” it could hit resistance around the $84,000 price level, but if it breaks through, it could soar before its next resistance level of $96,000. Bitcoin’s previous support levels are now resistance “These price levels have acted as price support during this bull cycle but can now act as price resistance if bullish conditions don’t continue to improve,” CryptoQuant said in its report. “This has been the case in past bearish cycles.” Bitcoin was trading at $79,474 at the time of publication, down 3.5% over the past day, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 2.24% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap April has been a volatile month for Bitcoin. US President Donald Trump ramped up global tariffs on April 2, which triggered fear in financial markets, before later abruptly pausing them for 90 days and softening the bearish momentum. Bitcoin briefly rose above $85,000 on April 1, but it pulled back to around $76,000 by April 8 due to uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff plans. CryptoQuant said prices recovered “most of the lost ground” on April 9, after Trump announced the 90-day pause on tariffs to all countries except China, which have now been ramped up to 145%. Bitcoin may first find resistance at $84,000 and then at the $96,000 area. Source: CryptoQuant After Trump’s tariff pause announcement on April 9, both the crypto and broader financial markets saw a wider surge. Bitcoin surged by approximately 9%, reversing most of the losses it incurred earlier in the week, to retest $83,000. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest public US companies , closed 9.52% higher, its third-largest single-day gain since World War II. The Nasdaq 100 posted a 12.02% gain over the trading day. Abra Global CEO Bill Barhydt said in an April 10 X post that it may only be a matter of months before Bitcoin sees its price go almost 29% above its $109,000 all-time high set in January. “Bitcoin is a levered bet on tech stocks, and all of it is going up and to the right,” Barhydt said, adding that Bitcoin may go as high as $130,000 to $140,000 by late June.

CryptoQuant said that of the ten bull signals it tracks in its Bull Score Index, only one is still active, with Bitcoin trading above its 365-day moving average.

She said that without appropriate safeguards, the “unchecked proliferation of digital assets” undermines US dollar dominance, weakens national security due to criminal activity, and “undermines the stability of financial markets.” Unregulated crypto also subjects investors to “price manipulation and rigged markets,” facilitates fraud that “drains billions of dollars from hardworking Americans, and extracts assets and investments from the American economy,” she said. An excerpt of James’ letter to Congress. Source: Office of the New York State Attorney General James made a number of recommendations and pushed Congress for legislation that would require stablecoin issuers to have a US presence and regulatory oversight and mandate backing stablecoins with US dollars or treasuries. She also wants regulations that require platforms to work only with anti-money laundering-compliant entities, establish registration requirements for issuers and intermediaries, protect against conflicts of interest and promote price transparency and require fraud prevention measures. No crypto assets in pension funds The New York’s top lawyer also aired her concerns about including crypto in pension funds. “Digital assets are uniquely unsuitable for retirement savings due to their high volatility,” she said, claiming that they have no value. “The underlying value of cryptocurrency is unpredictable and not determined by true price discovery because they have no intrinsic value on which their prices are based.” James also urged against retirement funds investing in crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds, stating that “unlike traditional exchange-traded funds backed by stocks and bonds, cryptocurrency held to back cryptocurrency ETFs are at risk of permanent theft.” Related: US lawmaker will reintroduce crypto retirement bill to help Trump agenda “As Congress takes the mantle to propose legislation governing the cryptocurrency industry, we hope it also takes action to mitigate the risks posed by the industry to America’s national security, financial stability, and citizens,” James said.

The macro uncertainty and Trump tariff war escalation have cast dark clouds on the crypto space, impacting XRP equally, despite key developments in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit. XRP Price In A Make It or Break It Position XRP price has been flirting at a crucial support of $2.0, and any directional move can decide the next market action. In the last 24 hours, the Ripple cryptocurrency has bounced back once again from the $1.9 levels and is currently trading at $2.0. However, the daily trading volumes have crashed 51% to $4.21 billion. Although the bounce back has been sharp, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that XRP needs to surge past this breakout zone to continue with the rally. As shown in the image below, XRP price is forming a head and shoulders pattern. Also, the immediate support is $1.80, while the gates of a 40% drop to $1.20 are still open. Source: Ali Martinez However, if the Ripple cryptocurrency manages to roar back above $2.0, it can chart its path for an upside breakout to $22, $30, and beyond. Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto cited the multi-year time-frame, stating that the breakout on a multi-year timeframe can lead to a strong breakout on the upside. The analyst noted: “I’m looking at the last pump from the 2017 cycle, which was an incredible 2,600%! Starting from $1.20, if we see a retracement back to the edge of the triangle, then $30 is definitely within reach!” Source: EGRAG Crypto On-Chain and Ripple Lawsuit Developments XRP’s on-chain metrics highlight huge growth for the Ripple blockchain. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez reports that over 6.26 million addresses now hold at least one XRP, marking a record high for the network. This milestone highlights strong investor confidence despite ongoing market volatility. At the same time, talks of a spot XRP ETF are also on the rise amid positive developments in the Ripple lawsuit, which can be a catalyst to XRP price upside. On Thursday, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs have jointly filed a pivotal motion following their settlement of the XRP lawsuit .

However, this upward momentum was short-lived as Trump’s rapid imposition of tariffs introduced new uncertainty, triggering volatility and a pullback in trading activity, according to blockchain analytics firm Kaiko’s Q1 2025 report. Kaiko reported that weekly trading volumes for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the top 10 altcoins fell by 30% compared to pre-election levels observed in November 2024. Average weekly volume stood at $266 billion in Q1. The decline was primarily due to the decline in demand for altcoins and cautious risk appetite, especially on offshore exchanges. “Altcoin volatility has soared in early 2025, reaching multi-year or all-time highs for select tokens, most notably Cardano (ADA),” Kaiko analysts wrote, adding that “Bitcoin’s volatility has also increased sharply, rising from 34% in February to 51% in March.” This widening volatility gap between Bitcoin and altcoins has made some investors more risk-averse and discouraged entry into altcoin markets amid broader macroeconomic concerns. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance, it was not immune to market turbulence in Q1. BTC lost 12% during the quarter, its worst performance since 2018, and is currently trading around 25% below its January peak. It still outperformed most altcoins, especially tokens in the AI and memecoin sectors, which have seen average losses of over 50%. “While expectations for U.S. rate cuts have increased, this is not the kind of dovish turn markets were hoping for,” said Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert. “Risk-off sentiment has weighed on both equities and crypto assets.” Related News: Grayscale, Managing Billion Dollars, Said ""Tariffs Will Benefit Bitcoin"", Explained The Reason Despite a shaky first quarter, analysts believe that Q2 could bring new momentum. Historically, crypto markets tend to outperform in Q2, and several upcoming catalysts could support this pattern. Kaiko’s Adam McCarthy cited Bitcoin’s institutionalization as a key driver, noting that altcoins could benefit in a similar way if exchange-traded products (ETPs) gain regulatory approval. Currently, more than 40 crypto-related ETF applications are awaiting review by new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and his team. “If there is going to be a bull run in the second half of 2025, altcoins will need to see similar uptake,” McCarthy said, adding, “The introduction of ETFs and other investment products could significantly increase demand.” The expanding stablecoin ecosystem is another promising signal, with the total stablecoin supply increasing by 33% since late 2024 to surpass $230 billion. Kaiko noted that growth in this segment, dominated by USDT and USDC, often precedes rallies in the broader crypto markets. Kaiko analysts concluded that continued policy clarity and macroeconomic downturn, as well as a potentially weaker US dollar, could help Bitcoin decouple from traditional assets in the coming months. *This is not investment advice.

President Donald Trump paused his administration's hefty reciprocal tariffs until July 8, but kept a minimum 10% tariff on most countries bar China, which had its rate hiked to 145%. Hashlabs CEO Jaran Mellerud told Cointelegraph that while the 10% levy is much lighter than the initial tariffs, US miners are still at a “clear disadvantage” when it comes to purchasing mining machines compared to competitors abroad . He said the baseline US tariffs aren’t enough “to make mining in the US unprofitable, but it definitely raises capital expenditure and will impact the long-term viability of new investments.” “We expect to see a short-term spike in machine imports as miners rush to get ahead of potential future tariff hikes,” Mellerud added. Source: Jaran Mellerud A price hike on crypto mining rigs is already happening, Luxor Technology’s chief operating officer Ethan Vera told Cointelegraph. “US miners are still looking to purchase machines ahead of the potential further increase in 90 days. In addition, US-landed machines have run up in price, as have contracts with onshore assembly.” On April 2, Trump’s hiked tariffs placed levies on Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia — countries home to three of the largest mining rig manufacturers — at respective rates of 36%, 32% and 24%. Tariff instability will stunt US Bitcoin mining growth Mellerud said in an April 8 report, before the pause on the hiked tariffs, that Trump’s levies could collapse US demand for mining rigs, to the benefit of non-US mining operations, as manufacturers will look outside the US to sell their surplus inventory for cheaper. He told Cointelegraph the now-lowered tariffs would offer some relief for US miners, but imposing the tariffs and then suddenly pausing them only added uncertainty to US Bitcoin mining firms looking to plan and scale. “What miners need is predictability and stable rules — not policy whiplash every few months.” Luxor’s Vera said that the policy changes “will certainly hurt growth” in the US. Related: Bitcoin hashrate tops 1 Zetahash in historic first, trackers show Vera said Luxor has even been forced to rethink its strategy and consider expanding into international markets for future expansion. Trump pledged during his presidential campaign that he wanted all the remaining Bitcoin ( BTC ) to be “made in the USA.” Several members of Trump’s family have also partnered with Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 to lead Bitcoin mining venture “American Bitcoin” late last month. The venture aims to build the world’s largest Bitcoin mining firm with strategic reserves. While the tariffs are broad in nature, the crypto mining industry simply isn’t a “high priority” for the Trump administration, Vera said. Trump’s tariffs have shaken up almost every market, including the crypto markets and Bitcoin, which is down 1.2% over the last 24 hours to $80,555, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now 26% off the $108,786 all-time high it set on Jan. 20 — the same day that Trump returned to the White House. Asia Express: Illegal arcade disguised as … a fake Bitcoin mine?

But interestingly, the news didn’t come from the SEC — it was Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse who confirmed that the long-running legal battle is nearing its end. That’s left many in the XRP community feeling frustrated and a bit skeptical, as they wait for something more official from the SEC. In the latest twist, both Ripple and the SEC have filed a joint motion asking the court to pause the appeal. This is based on their agreement to settle the case — although the settlement still needs to be formally approved by the SEC. Because of this, there won’t be a legal brief filed on April 16th as originally planned. Paul Atkins To Decide What’s Next? Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel weighed in, suggesting that the delay may have something to do with the recent leadership change at the Commission. “Presumably the SEC wanted Atkins at the helm for the vote,” he said, referring to the newly appointed commissioner. “Having him vote on his first day would’ve looked bad — not that his support for the settlement isn’t likely.” He also said that this move avoids any risk of Ripple pulling back from submitting a brief and potentially derailing the process. Attorney Bill Morgan also chimed in with a question that’s on a lot of minds: does the mention of an “indicative ruling” mean the judge is just finalizing the settlement? And does that include removing the injunction against Ripple, which hasn’t been mentioned yet? JUST IN: In a 52-44 vote, the Senate has confirmed Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. https://t.co/jNY1C66FE4 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 9, 2025 Fagel responded, saying we’re in uncharted territory here. He interpreted the language to mean the settlement is contingent on Judge Torres revisiting the injunctive order. If she refuses to modify it, then the appeal — and possibly Ripple’s cross-appeal — could still move forward. All in all, while this case seems to be nearly over, a few key pieces still need to fall into place.

The filing signals a possible end to a high-profile dispute that has gripped the payments upstart industry since December 2020 for its sale of XRP tokens , which the SEC alleged were unregistered securities. The case has been a focal point for debates over the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies in the United States, with Ripple arguing that XRP is a currency, not a security, and thus outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. Ripple and the SEC have reached an “agreement in principle” to resolve all outstanding issues, per a post shared by attorney James Filan. This includes not only the SEC’s appeal of the district court’s final judgment but also Ripple’s cross-appeal and the claims against Ripple founders Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. The motion requests that the court hold the appeals process in abeyance — effectively pausing it — while the parties hammer out the final terms of the settlement, which still requires formal approval from the SEC’s commissioners. This follows a similar request from the SEC and Gemini in early April , where the two parties requested the court approve a two-month pause to finalize a deal to close their long-running legal dispute over Gemini's Earn program.",Policy|XRP|Ripple|SEC,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-11 05:20:39

Now, its dismissal with prejudice confirms the SEC cannot revisit the charges. Meanwhile, the SEC recently issued new guidance to provide some more clarity on crypto disclosures, but it stopped short of defining what constitutes a security. While the lawsuits against other crypto companies were dropped, Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. settled with New York regulators for $40 million over Cash App compliance failures. SEC Ends Legal Battle With Helium The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially dropped its lawsuit against Nova Labs, the company behind the decentralized wireless network Helium. This is according to a blog post that was published by Helium on April 10. The suit was originally filed in January of 2025, and it alleged that Nova Labs issued unregistered securities when it launched its native token, Helium (HNT), in 2019. However, the SEC’s dismissal of the case “with prejudice” means the agency cannot pursue similar charges against the company again. This was one of the last enforcement actions that was initiated under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who resigned after the inauguration of President Donald Trump on Jan. 20. The agency's decision to drop the case coincided with Paul Atkins, a Trump nominee and known crypto-friendly policymaker, officially taking over as SEC Chair. Helium stated that the outcome of the case confirms the legality of its operations, particularly the distribution of HNT, IOT, and MOBILE tokens, as well as the sale of Helium-compatible Hotspots. The company believes that the SEC's decision affirms these tokens are not securities and that hardware distribution for network expansion does not automatically fall under securities law. HNT’s market cap since launch (Source: CoinMarkletCap ) The Helium network enables people to build and operate decentralized wireless infrastructure, and currently hosts around 375,000 active hotspots. While HNT’s market capitalization sits near $506 million, it is still far from its all-time high of over $5 billion from November of 2021. The SEC’s retreat from aggressive crypto enforcement signals a sharp pivot in regulatory policy since Trump assumed office. Under Gensler, the agency launched more than 100 enforcement actions targeting crypto firms. But since January, the SEC dropped cases against several high-profile entities including Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, and Uniswap. Trump made his pro-crypto stance very clear, and vowed to turn the US into a global crypto hub. Despite this shift, not all industry participants are optimistic. Some executives worry that Trump’s other policies, like newly announced tariffs on US imports, could ultimately hinder the industry’s growth despite the new regulatory relief. SEC Staff Offers Crypto Firms Clarity The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance recently issued a staff statement offering some guidance on how federal securities laws might apply to the crypto industry. While the statement holds no legal force, it was made to clarify disclosure expectations for companies issuing or dealing with digital assets that could be considered securities. The Division clarified that its views are based on observations from past disclosures and feedback from market participants. Part of the SEC’s staff statement (Source: SEC ) According to the SEC staff, crypto firms have typically shared various details about their operations, like the nature of their business, the functionality of their tokens, and how they plan to generate revenue. The guidance suggests that companies should also disclose whether they intend to stay active in a blockchain network or application after its launch and identify any successors who may assume operational responsibilities. The staff further recommended that disclosures should include technical specifics about the underlying blockchain, including whether it uses proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, block size, transaction speed, incentive structures, network security features, and whether the code is open-source. These elements help paint a clearer picture of the project for regulators and investors. While the guidance reiterated that tokens not classified as securities or part of an investment contract are not subject to registration requirements, it did not provide concrete criteria for determining what qualifies as a security. Despite this omission, legal experts like Joe Carlasare welcomed the statement as a positive move toward more predictable and consistent regulation. He believes that following these guidelines could help firms position themselves more favorably with regulators. (Source: SEC ) The SEC also urged crypto companies to disclose all relevant risks, including price volatility, cybersecurity concerns, custody arrangements, and standard business and legal risks. The guidance stated that issuers should provide a “materially complete description” of any token considered a security. This includes how dividends or distributions are handled, voting rights, and who holds the authority to change smart contracts or protocol code. Firms should also disclose whether such smart contracts have undergone third-party security audits. Additionally, the Division recommended that firms specify whether a token has a fixed supply, how and when it was or will be issued, and who the key executives or major employees are. The SEC plans to build on this initiative by organizing a series of roundtables through its Crypto Task Force to engage with the industry on issues including crypto trading, custody, tokenization, and decentralized finance. Block Settles for $40M Over Cash App Violations While Helium is now off the hook with the SEC, Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. recently agreed to a $40 million settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services over allegations related to compliance failures in its Cash App platform. According to Bloomberg , which reviewed the consent order, the settlement follows an investigation into Cash App’s anti-money laundering and crypto compliance practices. Regulators concluded that Block allegedly failed to meet consumer protection requirements, did not perform adequate due diligence on its customers, and was slow to report suspicious transactions involving high-risk Bitcoin activity. Although Block confirmed it worked with the NYDFS to resolve the matter, it did not admit to any wrongdoing. The company stated that the settlement primarily relates to legacy compliance issues. The agreement is the second major fine Block faced this year already, after an earlier $80 million settlement with multiple state regulators over similar AML concerns. Despite these regulatory setbacks, Block’s financial performance stayed very resilient through the end of 2024. The company reported a 4.5% increase in year-over-year revenue, reaching $6.03 billion, while earnings per share jumped by 51% to $0.71. Merchant gross payment volume also grew by 10%, totaling $61.95 billion. Cash App, which is the central driver of Block’s business, recorded $1.38 billion in gross profit during the fourth quarter and maintained a strong user base of over 57 million monthly transacting users in early 2024. Cash App has supported Bitcoin purchases since 2018 and has taken steps to improve its crypto functionality, including a 2023 integration with TaxBit to simplify crypto tax reporting for users.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|HNT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-11 05:22:47
43199916,https://nulltx.com/?p=147908,1744349031,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Bitcoin Losses Shift to Older Cohorts, Indicating Broadening Capitulation",https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-losses-shift-to-older-cohorts-indicating-broadening-capitulation/,"The past few months have seen Bitcoin’s price shifts trigger a really big shift in the pattern of realized losses that affect us all. And what is that pattern? We now have a pretty solid transition from younger to older coins when it comes to shelling out and accepting realized losses. You used to be able to count on the fact that if someone was going to go out and realize a loss on their Bitcoin, it was likely going to be someone who had just acquired it. But not anymore. Seems like a lot more people are giving up. So, who exactly is giving up? Our main suspects are people who have held their coins for three to six months. The change in loss realization is quite pronounced, showing that even mid-term holders—who usually have a long-term outlook and can tolerate some amount of market volatility—are now bailing on their positions. This could be read as a sign of market weakness and an intensifying sense of uncertainty that has even experienced holders selling at a loss. The Evolution of Loss Realization Throughout 2025 In the early part of the year, the realized losses from Bitcoin sell-offs were largely coming from the younger coins. Most of these losses were coming from people who had recently bought their Bitcoin (either last month or three months ago). By February 27, for instance, when the price dropped to $86.7k, the total realized losses hit $51 million. The groups that were mostly selling were the ones that had held their Bitcoin for either one week to one month or one month to three months. They accounted for over 50% of these losses. Meanwhile, the next group up (three months to six months) was hardly selling at all and only accounted for 0.8% of those losses. This is how the losses were shared on February 27: – Price of Bitcoin: $86.7K – Total realized losses: $51M – 1 week–1 month cohort: $13.1M (25.7%) – 1 month–3 months cohort: $14.4M (28.2%) – 3 months–6 months cohort: $0.4M (0.8%) By then, it was evident that the losses were occurring among coins that had been recently bought. This indicated that newer holders were the ones reacting to price dips that were clearly short-term in nature. The reason for this part of the selling seemed to be the same as for the earlier part: fear, and possibly panic. The Shift Begins: Older Holders React to Market Pressure By the next day, February 28, 2023, (in 2023, beginnings are visible) a change compositionwise in the losses taken was already visible. While the price of Bitcoin had slipped a little to $83.7k, the losses being borne by the cohort of holders aged 3 to 6 months had surged nearly fivefold from the previous day. This was potentially the first sign of something worth noticing in all of this: older holders, who in most cases seem to be enduring price swings in the expectation of long-term gains, started to take some action in response to a downturn. On the 28th of February, the following losses were realized: – Price of Bitcoin: $83.7k – Overall losses taken: $51.1M – Losses from the 1w–1m cohort: $16.9M (33.1%) – Losses from the 1m–3m cohort: $12.3M (24.0%) – Losses from the 3m–6m cohort: $1.9M (3.8%) Here, the 1w-1m cohort’s share of losses surged to 33.1%, signaling that some short-term holders were still under pressure, while the 3m-6m cohort’s share grew to 3.8%. This shift in the loss composition suggested that the pain was spreading beyond the more recent investors, with mid-term holders starting to feel the strain. Broadening Capitulation: April 2025 Data Shows Even Split April 7 generated what are hopefully the final data to show how even the losses on Bitcoin are becoming. With the price of Bitcoin at $78.9k, total realized losses dropped to a low of $34.4 million. Yet, the composition of those losses is pretty interesting. Just about as many mid-term holders (holding for 1 month to 1 year) are cashing out and taking losses as are short-term holders (holding for 1 week to 1 month). Additionally, even more long-term holders (holding for 3 to 6 months) seem to be taking losses. This last point is particularly serious. It indicates that more and more people who bought Bitcoin last fall are shaking it off. Also, this seems to be a shift from the typical As of April 7, the losses were broken down as follows: – Bitcoin price: $78.9k – Total realized losses: $34.4M – 1w–1m cohort: $8.2M (23.8%) – 1m–3m cohort: $6.5M (18.9%) – 3m–6m cohort: $6.7M (19.4%) An even split between short-term and mid-term holders, with the 3m–6m cohort now accounting for 19.4% of total realized losses, suggests that the market is seeing a broadening of capitulation. This is often a precursor to a market bottom. The increase in losses from older cohorts indicates that more holders are choosing to sell and lock in their losses rather than wait for a market recovery. They seem to be acting on what is now a fairly consensus opinion among traders that the near-term price outlook is pretty dismal. In comparison to previous large #Bitcoin sell-offs YTD, losses are now spreading to older coins – especially in the 3m–6m group, whose share in loss realization jumped from 0.8% to 19.4% of total losses since Feb 27: pic.twitter.com/cShuvGCuLz — glassnode (@glassnode) April 9, 2025 What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Price Outlook? The market is receiving a very important signal from the change in loss acceptance from younger Bitcoin holders to older Bitcoin holders. This is such a clear and compelling signal that I believe it deserves a section of its own to discuss what it might imply for the price of Bitcoin going forward. The first thing to understand is that the kind of signal this loss acceptance shift is broadcasting is very similar to the type of signal that is often seen at the tail end of a market correction: This data may provide a possible buying chance for investors keeping an eye on the market, particularly if they think the present sell-off is approaching its conclusion. Otherwise, if things keep getting worse in the broader market, there’s definite downside risk for any buying we’re doing at this point. Moving deeper into 2025, it is vital to keep an eye on whether this surrender trend goes on and how it could influence the price of Bitcoin in the long run.

This inordinate amount of whale action points to a market under pressure, with long-term holders apparently capitulating. If this development sent a chill up your spine, freeze it. Ethereum remains a fine accumulation candidate, with an impending 2.0 upgrade allowing it to usurp the market share of Bitcoin (BTC) and potentially everyone else. Whales have moved over 530,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past week! pic.twitter.com/ecIDbvcSEi — Ali (@ali_charts) April 9, 2025 Right now, the Ethereum market seems to be moving toward a key price area—one that, in the past, has indicated the market was nearing a bottom and has provided strong buying opportunities. When you look at this recent price action and the fact that large holders are taking profits and/or adjusting positions, you have to ask: does this situation spell impending bottom for the Ethereum market? Or is it more likely that we are going to see further price weakness in the near future? Ethereum OG Sells 10,702 ETH After Two Years of Dormancy A recent development that is worth talking about came from a person who is considered to be one of the original Ethereum investors. This individual sold 10,702 ETH—which was worth about $16.86 million at around $1,576—just a few days ago. This is a significant development not just because of who it is, but also because this individual held this Ethereum for a very long time. Supposedly, this person held the Ethereum since 2016, when it was worth just $8. This sale’s timing is interesting. Even though Ethereum hit over $4,000 during the 2021 bull market, this investor did not choose to sell then. Instead, the dip that is now signaling a bear market saw this investor finally executing their option to sell. Why would an attractive asset holder sell at what seems to be a low point? This action seems to fly in the face of conventional market wisdom. An Ethereum OG dumped 10,702 $ETH ($16.86M) at $1,576 again after 2 years of dormancy. He received the $ETH as early as 2016, when the price was just $8. Interestingly, he never sold when $ETH was above $4,000 — but always chose to sell during major dips.… pic.twitter.com/YZrLWT5exF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 10, 2025 Ethereum’s durability through extended slumps implies that numerous holders are maintaining a long-term perspective on the asset, looking for greater valuations. Nonetheless, this most recent broad-based liquidation seems to suggest that a number of investors might be shifting their outlooks, potentially in response to worries about more pronounced downside risks developing in the near term. Ethereum ETFs Face Continued Outflows Amid Market Uncertainty The market sentiment surrounding Ethereum appears to be under pressure. On April 9, a total net outflow of $11.19 million left Ethereum spot ETFs, marking yet another day that they did not enjoy any inflows. Of the nine Ethereum ETFs, none experienced net inflows, which could indicate a lack of institutional confidence in the current Ethereum marketplace. On April 9, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $127 million, marking the fifth consecutive day of net outflows. Ethereum spot ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $11.1873 million, with none of the nine ETFs experiencing any net inflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 10, 2025 The consistent outflows from Ethereum ETFs could be a sign of institutional interest that is not as strong as it once was—or possibly of market conditions that make institutional interest less likely. The sentiment expressed by ETF investors is being tested by a number of external factors, including regulatory uncertainty, that are affecting the whole market—Bitcoin, for instance, is not doing any better, and is also seeing outflows from its own ETF. Despite this, I’m still kind of optimistic about Ethereum. Currently, these outflows cast a spotlight on the deliberate and prudent path taken by institutional investors. They do not appear to be running back into the arms of the crypto markets yet. And in contrast to retail investors, institutional investors take a lot of time to make decisions. Yet, in their defense, institutional investors command a lot of capital. So their re-entry and exit can make waves in the crypto market. Is This the Right Time to Accumulate Ethereum? As Ethereum nears a support zone that many analysts regard as crucial, the longer-term forecast for the asset remains unclear. Whales have been on the move, transferring large swaths of E T H to various new addresses. The signals from these big holders, however, are far from straightforward. One key long-term holder has recently sold a sizable amount of E T H, dumping it during a market dip instead of at what many would call a more favorable price point near the recent top. Long-term holders throwing in the towel seems to be a potentially ideal situation for contrarian investors to start accumulating. We’ve historically seen that when the widespread fear and uncertainty of a market bottom leads to a sharp recovery, it’s because attractive buying opportunities present themselves at risk-reward ratios that make sense. And right now, if you’re a contrarian investor, the setup seems to be ideal. Long-term #Ethereum $ETH holders have entered ""capitulation"" mode. For contrarians, this could signal a prime accumulation zone from a risk-reward standpoint.

The token has been bouncing around a well-defined support level and has offered significantly better returns than the overall crypto space since the middle of June. Still, ample warning signs and indicators suggest that these bounces—and any potential gains realized by retail investors—are likely to be sold into by Ethereum’s large and deep investor base. In the end, the next couple of weeks will be very important in deciding whether Ethereum holds the currently critical support levels or whether a continuing price slide tests the faith of even the most loyal holders. From the perspective of anyone looking at this market over the long haul, the appearance of Ethereum’s cryptographic money in our world is hard to see as anything but a net positive. Its foundational strength, in both the architecture of its underlying blockchain and the well-nigh irresistible decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built upon that blockchain, seems to make it a good bet. At the very least, it should be a doubly good bet when it is available at a price reduced from its previous highs. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Simultaneously, Cardano founder and Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson has projected that Bitcoin could skyrocket to $250,000 by the end of the year, citing a combination of regulatory clarity, growing adoption by tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, and shifting global economic dynamics. With both miners and thought leaders signaling confidence, the stage appears set for a transformative year in the digital asset space. Charles Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $250K by 2025 as Tech Giants and Regulatory Clarity Fuel Crypto Revival Despite recent market turbulence, Charles Hoskinson , the blockchain pioneer behind Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, believes that Bitcoin is on track for an explosive resurgence — potentially reaching $250,000 as early as this year. Speaking to CNBC during a recent episode of the Beyond The Valley podcast , Hoskinson laid out a bullish forecast fueled by tech adoption, macroeconomic shifts, and impending regulatory breakthroughs. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency market has been in flux. Bitcoin temporarily dropped below the $77,000 threshold, spooked by US President Donald Trump's aggressive ”reciprocal tariff” policy targeting multiple countries in a broad escalation of trade tensions. However, a temporary 90-day reduction of these levies to 10% — designed to create space for new negotiations — triggered a swift rebound in crypto, with Bitcoin surging back above $82,000. Still, the market remains well below its all-time high of over $100,000 in January. That hasn’t shaken long-term optimism among industry leaders like Hoskinson, who believes the pullback is only a pause before the next major leg upward. Hoskinson, who also serves as CEO of Input Output Global (IOHK), painted a scenario in which multiple global catalysts converge to reignite Bitcoin’s price. “By the end of this year or next year,” we’ll see Bitcoin at $250,000, he said. ”The markets will stabilize a little bit, and they'll get used to the new normal, and then the Fed[eral Reserve] will lower interest rates, and then you'll have a lot of fast, cheap money, and then it'll pour into crypto,” he added. Three Mega Forces Poised to Drive the Next Crypto Boom Hoskinson cited three key factors that he believes will fuel Bitcoin's surge: Explosive User Growth: According to data from Crypto.com, the global number of cryptocurrency users grew by 13% in 2024 to a total of 659 million. With nearly one in ten people on Earth now owning some form of digital asset, the market is nearing a tipping point in mainstream adoption. Geopolitical Decentralization: Hoskinson pointed to a world increasingly governed by power politics rather than treaties and institutions. Impending US Crypto Legislation: The potential passage of two key regulatory proposals — stablecoin legislation and the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act — could establish clearer rules of the road for digital assets. This legal certainty, Hoskinson argued, is vital for institutional adoption and market stability. Perhaps the most intriguing part of Hoskinson’s forecast is his prediction that major technology firms — specifically the so-called “Magnificent 7” (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla) — could become direct players in the cryptocurrency market. With clearer stablecoin regulations in place, Hoskinson believes these firms could begin integrating crypto into their platforms. For example, stablecoins could enable Apple or Amazon to pay workers across borders or facilitate microtransactions that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive using traditional payment rails. Timeline for the Next Wave Hoskinson isn’t predicting an immediate skyrocket. Instead, he sees a short-term period of stagnation — followed by an intense speculative push. ”[The crypto market] will stall for probably the next three to five months, and then you'll have a huge wave of speculative interest come, probably [in] August or September, into the markets, and that'll carry through probably another six to 12 months,” Hoskinson said. If his forecast proves accurate, that speculative wave could begin right as interest rates begin to drop, regulation firms up, and tech giants announce stablecoin integrations — setting the stage for a historic bull market. Top Bitcoin Miners Generate $800M in Q1 2025 as Industry Rides High on BTC Price Surge In related news, Bitcoin mining firms have kicked off 2025 with remarkable momentum, generating close to $800 million in mined BTC during the first quarter alone — a signal of renewed strength in the sector as Bitcoin prices remain close to their all-time highs. The largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies produced a combined 9,746 BTC in Q1. This extraordinary output comes as miners ramp up production to capitalize on favorable market conditions and prepare for the anticipated effects of the upcoming halving event. Largest Bitcoin miners by market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap) Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest Bitcoin mining company by market capitalization, led the industry with a staggering 2,285 BTC mined in Q1 — valued at roughly $186 million. The company’s production trajectory has been steadily rising, culminating in a 17.4% month-over-month increase in March when it mined 829 BTC. This also represents a 10.5% increase compared to January, suggesting an aggressive scale-up in hash rate and operational efficiency. The mining giant has long pursued a high-capacity growth strategy, and its recent performance suggests that it remains the dominant force in industrial-scale Bitcoin mining heading into the midyear. CleanSpark, the second-largest producer in Q1 by volume, mined 1,950 BTC worth nearly $160 million. The firm reported a 13.4% increase in its March production compared to February, reflecting consistent operational expansion. Iren (formerly known as Iris Energy), came in third with 1,513 BTC mined in Q1, valued at approximately $124 million. Its March output of 533 BTC represented a 16.1% increase from February, underlining the company’s push to regain market share after a relatively modest 2024. Despite being ranked sixth by market capitalization, Iren’s production figures place it among the most efficient miners in terms of hash rate output per dollar of market cap. Riot Blockchain and the Quiet Climb Riot Blockchain, the second-largest company in the sector by market capitalization, mined 1,428 BTC — about $117 million — making it the fourth-largest producer this quarter. In March, Riot matched Iren’s monthly output of 533 BTC, marking a 13.4% increase from the previous month. The mining firm has been relatively quiet on major expansion announcements this quarter but remains a central player in the North American mining landscape. While Hut 8 Mining had the smallest production volume among the top players — mining 199 BTC worth roughly $16 million — it recorded the highest growth rate across the sector. In March, Hut 8 mined 88 BTC, marking a 91% surge from its 46 BTC production in February. Hut 8’s performance spike coincided with a groundbreaking partnership announcement on March 31: the company has teamed up with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to launch a new mining venture dubbed “American Bitcoin.” The project aspires to become the “world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner,” and its alignment with the Trump family signals a strong political dimension to the firm’s strategy, particularly in light of growing regulatory scrutiny in the US. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot emphasized this strategic pivot in a prior interview, stating that the firm is determined to “build one of the largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms rooted in American soil.” Industry Trends and What Lies Ahead The Q1 production figures reflect a broader theme in 2025: industrial Bitcoin mining is maturing. The largest players continue to consolidate their position with greater operational efficiency, tighter integration with energy providers, and increased political engagement. Bitcoin’s elevated trading range is providing strong tailwinds for miners. At the same time, growing anticipation around the next halving event, expected in early 2026, is prompting firms to expand capacity now to maximize profitability before rewards are reduced. Additionally, with US lawmakers moving closer to passing key digital asset legislation and stablecoin regulation, publicly traded miners are beginning to factor regulatory clarity into their long-term capital planning — potentially setting the stage for new entrants and more institutional investment.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-11 05:30:00

Even at the local price lows of this week, over 85% of Bitcoin holders are sitting in the black. This is a stat that reveals the underlying strength of the market structure and the long-term accumulation trend of this asset. This degree of profit, even when the markets are pulling back, reflects a major change in how investors are interacting with Bitcoin in this cycle. Even at this week's lows, more than 85% of Bitcoin holders remained in profit, underscoring its resilience amid tariff concerns. The chart below shows how Bitcoin’s overall profitability has changed over time. Where do you think the market is heading next? pic.twitter.com/3rgB17Wowd — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 10, 2025 Even when the price has fallen, most investors have seen it go up enough that they’ve made profit since buying at lower prices. And with the way the price has moved lately, you can’t say that this is some kind of fantastic new high that is just mesmerizing to altcoin and stockholders. We’re not going back to the $20,000 price point at this level. Yet, with the price at around $11,000, these must be tough times if you’re holding Equities or some kind of altcoin. Bitcoin is doing better than both at this point. Rising DeFi Adoption Among Bitcoin Holders One of the more interesting trends this year is the integration of Bitcoin with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. Currently, over 234,000 BTC have been deployed on EVM-compatible chains, a nearly 10% jump since the start of 2025. Currently, more than 234,000 BTC are deployed on EVM chains, a figure that has grown by around 10% since the start of the year. This trend highlights how Bitcoin holders are increasingly turning to DeFi mechanisms, such as Bitcoin staking, to earn yield on their assets. pic.twitter.com/6oLZrYF2pq — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 10, 2025 This movement underscores what seems to be an increasingly common desire among Bitcoin holders to earn yield on their assets through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. We are witnessing Bitcoin being used in a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that were until recently the exclusive domain of Ethereum-based assets. Wrapped Bitcoin and synthetic Bitcoin allow users to access DeFi primitives on Ethereum, and this is a pretty big deal. It reflects the maturation of cross-chain infrastructure and speaks to Bitcoin’s evolving utility. This shift toward yield-bearing strategies may also help to explain the high percentage of holders in profit. Not only have many entered at lower price points, but they’re now able to generate passive income through smart contract-based applications, providing yet another layer of incentive to hold rather than sell. Key Price Levels: Support, Resistance, and Long-Term Targets Technical analysis concludes that Bitcoin possibly is entering a decisive stage in its current cycle. The Mayer Multiple, a favored indicator that relates the current price to the 200-day moving average, suggests that Bitcoin may find strong support around $69,500. This zone has a rich history of providing reliable bases during times of market uncertainty and consolidation. Based on the Mayer Multiple, #Bitcoin $BTC could find solid support around $69,500. And, a breakout above $86,900 might set the stage for a market top near $208,550. pic.twitter.com/aoLK9F4vrI — Ali (@ali_charts) April 10, 2025 Optimistically, forthcoming resistance is seen coming in around $94,500, based on multiple key pricing tiers. A sustained break above this level could trigger a major upswing, almost certainly taking us toward some of our longer-term price targets. One of those targets, derived from historical breakout structure, is just about reading 2-and-change times higher from this level, our apparent uptrending target near $208,550, likely the top price for this cycle, if the current rally gathers any momentum. As #Bitcoin $BTC rebounds, the next immediate resistance stands at $94,500, according to pricing bands. pic.twitter.com/pObd0IXAsW — Ali (@ali_charts) April 10, 2025 Short-term headwinds still exist, though. On April 9, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net outflow of $127 million, the fifth day in a row of outflows. This apparently signals declining institutional interest in the near term, but the ETFs’ price impact has been pretty mild so far. That suggests that retail and on-chain investors, the true backbone of Bitcoin’s current strength, have been absorbing the selling. On April 9, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $127 million, marking the fifth consecutive day of net outflows. Ethereum spot ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $11.1873 million, with none of the nine ETFs experiencing any net inflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 10, 2025 These outflows may be due to more general market problems, rather than any change in Bitcoin’s fundamentals. At the moment, investors have a lot to juggle. And the basic narrative they are constructing is that, when there’s a lack of clarity around monetary policy, and certainly when there’s heightened geopolitical risk, like there is right now, investors tend to pull back from riskier assets, which would include Bitcoin. What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin With macro uncertainty at play and important price levels close at hand, the question now is: Where does Bitcoin go from here? On-chain data suggests that long-term holders are still confident, despite the ETF outflows. The profitability of wallet addresses is consistent; DeFi engagement across EVM chains is rising; and the reactions to negative headlines have been relatively minor. All this suggests that Bitcoin’s current structure is still something you would characterize as bullish. Should Bitcoin manage to take back the resistance close to $94,500, the road toward the $100,000 psychological mark—and even higher—might become much more clear. Till then, the support area around $69,500 will be key in deciding whether the ongoing consolidation is a prolonged healthy breather or the onset of a more serious downward adjustment. At present, Bitcoin is still confidently asserting its strength. The wider market, in contrast, appears to be searching for a definite way forward. And in a segment of the investment world increasingly animated by on-chain usefulness and worldwide interest, Bitcoin’s bullish behavior might well be the signal—not the noise.

Since Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, the seven-day realized volatility of the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, has surged from an annualized 50% to 169%, according to data from TradingView. That's the highest level since the coronavirus crash in 2020. BTC's seven-day realized volatility has doubled to 83%, yet it remains significantly lower than the S&P 500, hinting at the cryptocurrency's possible evolution as a low-beta hedge against stocks. The cryptocurrency also looks significantly less volatile than the S&P 500 on a 30-day basis. ""Equity markets [have] experienced a dramatic spike in volatility—surpassing that of Bitcoin, which is currently seeing a decline in volatility. This raises the question: should investors place their trust in assets that are highly susceptible to political influence and human error, or in a mathematical framework and emerging store of value that is more resilient to such risks?"" CoinShares' Head of Research James Butterfill said in an email. Investors dump U.S. assets The S&P 500 has cracked 14% in less than two months, largely due to trade war fears that have recently come true. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average have suffered similar losses alongside increased volatility in global equity markets. Risk aversion of such magnitudes has historically seen investors park money in Treasury notes, which underpin the global financial system, and the U.S. dollar, the global reserve currency. But since last Friday, investors have aggressively dumped Treasury notes, driving yields higher, and the dollar index has tanked. The so-called benchmark 10-year bond yield has surged by 62 basis points to 4.45% since last Friday and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, has extended its first quarter swoon to 100, the lowest level since late September. Currencies typically appreciate when their national bond yields rise unless markets are worried about the country's debt situation, in which case investors pull money out of the bond markets, leading to a spike in yields and a concurrent currency depreciation. The Global South witnessed this in 2018. ""Yields higher, currency lower is common in EM. We saw this in the UK during the Truss debacle. But it is highly abnormal for the US: there are only four other episodes in the last 30 years in which the dollar depreciated more than 1.5% with the 30-year yield up more than 10bp,"" Evercore ISI said, according to Wall Street Journal's Chief Economic Correspondent Nick Timaros.

43200225,https://nulltx.com/?p=147911,1744349615,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Flows Back Into Memecoins as Net Inflows Turn Positive,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-flows-back-into-memecoins-as-net-inflows-turn-positive/,"On April 9, 2025, on-chain data shows a sharp increase in smart money entering the memecoin sector, with net inflows positive across the entire space. The capital markets, as a whole, aren’t exactly doing well—with most crypto assets in the red. However, when it comes to memecoins, this seems to be an area where some investors are regaining confidence. As per analytics from blockchain, inflow amounts to $5.26 million, while outflow amounts to $3.78 million. The net volume is $1.48 million, which is a positive sign and seems to indicate that the overall sentiment is bullish. The trading volume is $9.04 million, which also seems to be a positive sign and indicates that the querulous level of activity is still very much alive. Spotlight on Key Movers: Inflows Lead the Way Some of the tokens that saw most significant inflows from smart money involved a mixture of established digital assets and viral memecoins. This indicates a bifurcated strategy among experienced investors—one in which they express a preference for both liquidity and high-risk, high-reward plays. Wrapped Bitcoin ($WBTC) was at the head of the inflow pack with net purchases of $469,000. Although it isn’t a traditional memecoin, its presence in the data suggests smart traders either hedging or rebalancing their exposure as they start to invest in the market again. WBTC’s presence is especially interesting because it shows that, when positioning around memecoins, traders are pairing that with safer, blue-chip collateral. Next is RFC, which raised $505,000. Although it is not as much in the spotlight as some other viral coins, RFC seems to be getting some traction and maybe even some attention from whales and experienced DeFi players for whom the coin is an asymmetric bet. TITCOIN—an extremely controversial but very popular memecoin—received $249,000 of inflows. This niche following for TITCOIN is really hard to explain. Its relentless meme-driven marketing and the highly active community around it are almost its only defining features. That said, these two areas have led to a rather remarkable rise in the price of TITCOIN. POPCAT was another unexpected line item; it showed up on both sides of the ledger — $147,000 coming in and $196,000 going out, for a net outflow of $49,000. The mixed behavior around POPCAT reflects divided sentiment: Some traders seem to be taking profits after a recent run-up, while others continue to accumulate, perhaps in anticipation of a community-driven push or rebound. LUCE, a relatively obscure memecoin, garnered $108,000 in investments. While this amount may appear trifling next to the investments found in major cryptocurrencies, LUCE’s incoming capital is noteworthy, indeed, for what it could signal: the early stages of accumulating this asset. In the world of memecoins, where even the smallest projects can gain significant traction because of internet virality, this accumulation pattern is a sign that people in the know are betting on LUCE. Profit-Taking and Rotations: Outflows Tell Their Own Story Although the general market flow was positive, some tokens experienced significant capital outflows. This appears to be either profit-taking or a shift in sentiment toward those tokens. FARTCOIN took the lead on the outflow side, with $256,000 exiting the protocol. Its slapstick branding and momentary viral appeal aside, FARTCOIN has been unable to maintain the excitement it generated in its initial hype cycle. This recent outflow, however, may be more indicative of FARTCOIN’s holders rebalancing into other, newer plays or perhaps just a signal that market enthusiasm is cooling and that we’re all more responsible with our coins than we were a few months ago. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 09/04/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $5.26M Outflow: $3.78M Volume: $9.04M Net Volume: $1.48M There was inflow into: $WBTC ($469K) #TITCOIN ($249K) $RFC ($505K) $POPCAT ($147K) $LUCE … pic.twitter.com/aZJNyXziID — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 10, 2025 As noted earlier, POPCAT also experienced outflows of about $196,000, which was almost a match for its inflows. These two activities point to trading rather than holding in these tokens with a high degree of conviction. On the other side of the picture, GIGA, GOAT, MPLX, and USDS all saw outflows in the moderate five- and six-figure range. These outflows may signify either a loss of confidence or a shift toward tokens with more solid short-term upside potential, especially in a sector where sentiment and virality drive more than fundamentals. Outlook: Smart Money Paints a Cautiously Optimistic Picture In conclusion, April 9 was a relatively positive day for the memecoin market. It had inflows of $1.48 million and some movement in our interest across select assets; the data suggests traders are becoming more comfortable re-entering the space, though it appears they are still being selective. As is always the case with memecoins, their prices and the sentiments around them can change suddenly and severely. However, if today’s trends hold, they could signal the start of yet another wave of capital rotation into the most meme-able parts of the crypto world.

However, a look at TVL efficiency — the average capital allocated per protocol — reveals a different sort of story about ecosystem health and user conviction. DeFi may be the narrative driver, but from a basic investment allocation perspective, average capital efficiency is a better metric of ecosystem health. The most recent data show that the TRON network is currently the leader in total value locked (TVL) per protocol, with an average of $131 million per protocol. This is significantly ahead of all the other major blockchain ecosystems. In second place is Bitcoin, with an average of $83.4 million per protocol. Ethereum, despite having the most protocols by a large margin, comes in third with an average of only $33.7 million per project. And in a distant fourth is Solana, with an average of $29.0 million. TRON and Bitcoin lead in average TVL per protocol @trondao leads with $131M in TVL per protocol, followed by #Bitcoin , averaging $83.4M. @berachain also shows notable capital concentration, with $48.6M across its 53 protocols. @ethereum ecosystem, with 1,322 protocols, averages… pic.twitter.com/0Xvvl1Rneg — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 9, 2025 This commonly ignored metric provides a clear image of capital efficiency, user distribution, and the selectivity with which funds are being deployed across ecosystems. Capital Efficiency Shifts the Narrative TRON’s outstanding status in average TVL per protocol is particularly remarkable, especially in light of the widespread belief that DeFi development is centered in Ethereum. Indeed, Ethereum is not only the leading DeFi network in terms of TVL but also in terms of the number of protocols built on it. Yet, spread across these 1,322 DeFi projects, Ethereum’s capital concentration is not nearly as great as that of TRON. And it’s not as if TRON has a massive number of protocols just sitting there. In fact, like many blockchains outside of Ethereum, TRON has a far smaller number of protocols, which means a far smaller number of DeFi projects. This indicates a DeFi landscape that is clearer and more concentrated on TRON, where a small number of very successful protocols generate a lot of liquidity. By contrast, the DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum is enormous. Its sheer size and the number of different types of projects across its many layers means that the average protocol on Ethereum has a much lower total value locked down in it than the average protocol on TRON. What gives? The second place of Bitcoin in the ranking may surprise some, as the network is classically not seen in the same light as Ethereum or Solana when it comes to DeFi. But recent activity around layer-2 solutions for Bitcoin and the development of DeFi protocols that operate directly on the Bitcoin blockchain have led to substantial inflows of capital. With relatively few of these types of platforms currently live and operational on the Bitcoin network, the really astounding thing is the average total value locked (TVL) per platform — about $83.4 million. Berachain, an up-and-coming player that has yet to leave the testnet phase, is already showing burgeoning signs of capital concentration. The project boasts a striking 53 protocols in its ecosystem. On average, those protocols hold a total value locked of $48.6 million each. If you look only at Berachain’s mainnet preparation, this number looks even better. Solana and Ethereum: Broad But Shallow? Although Solana’s throughput and popularity are high, its overall average total value locked (TVL) is not, landing at $29.0 million across its 210 protocols. And although Solana, like its predecessor Ethereum, has a wide assortment of applications that might suggest otherwise (everything from social dApps to DeFi to NFTs is being built on Solana), the reality is that TVL on Solana, on average, is locked in very few protocols.$ The low figure of TVL per protocol isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it can also be seen as an experimental ecosystem that’s rich and vibrant. Yet it’s hard to not think of it as questioning the balance between breadth and depth. Protocols with a low TVL run the risk of negotiating their way through a liquidity trap and retaining their users in times of hardship. At $33.7 million per protocol, Ethereum is just above Solana. This number still reflects a good amount of capital deployed and is an efficient capital use. But the amount deployed across the prototypes also shows the challenges that these upstream developers face in capital efficiency. What TVL Per Protocol Really Tells Us In the end, the metric that is average total value locked per protocol serves as quite a fresh angle to assess blockchain systems. TRON and Bitcoin tally up high averages and with them a very handful, indeed concentrated, assembly of projects that are purportedly receiving a strong commitment of capital. By contrast, Ethereum and Solana have on board swathes of fans, and they muster almost an entire army of developers in Ecosystem Land. People who invest in and develop DeFi are starting to look more closely at not just total capital but at how effectively that capital is being used. We hear a lot these days about efficiency, concentration, and protocol-level traction. These things are said to matter just as much, if not more, than TVL itself.

43200328,https://nulltx.com/?p=147913,1744349918,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Rising Open Interest and Negative Funding Point to Growing Short Pressure in Select Altcoins,https://nulltx.com/rising-open-interest-and-negative-funding-point-to-growing-short-pressure-in-select-altcoins/,"A recent change in the derivatives landscape is bringing a possibly bearish altcoin setup to light. Why? Because open interest is rising—and it’s now being paired with negative funding rates. These two together signal that not only is the market being forced to short, but also that the shorts are being put on with some serious size. And when you open a short in the types of products that really give you the edge in crypto , you’re kind of signaling to the market that you expect prices to go down. On this front, several assets are raising red flags, with Zcash ($ZEC) being the most prominent case. It is a privacy coin that is now under suspicion and has been flagged by multiple sources as possibly non-compliant with SEC regulations. Some other tokens, like $NEO, $FET, and $AIOT, are also starting to show the early signs of compliance issues. These assets moving in a certain non-compliant direction could serve as the directional impetus for any spots and derivatives to now also make a non-compliant move. Zcash Leads the Pack in Bearish Sentiment Zcash ($ZEC) currently stands out as the asset with the most extreme divergence between rising leverage and bearish positioning. Over the past 24 hours, open interest on ZEC futures has surged by 35.5%, a significant uptick that typically indicates increased trader engagement. However, this rise in leverage is occurring alongside a deeply negative funding rate of -0.17% — the most negative across the observed assets. Several assets are seeing rising open interest paired with negative funding – suggesting a concentration of short positioning despite increasing leverage: $ZEC: OI +35.5%, Funding -0.17% pic.twitter.com/Qz1Zlen535 — glassnode (@glassnode) April 9, 2025 Funding rates show the cost of holding long versus short positions in the perpetual futures market. When the rate is negative, it means that the short traders are paying the long traders; in other words, most traders in the market are shorting the asset. ZEC saw a very large increase in OI, or open interest, over the past week. At the same time, the funding rate is sharply negative and getting more so, which suggests that traders in this market are very aggressively building short positions. This dynamic can create a feedback loop in thin or illiquid markets. When a lot of traders are going short, even small negative price movements can lead to more unwinding of positions, which means that we could see a downside move that is faster than what we might expect in a normal market condition. But we could also see a fast, upside reversal if sentiment changes to the bullish side or if selling pressure just dries up. NEO and FET: Rising Leverage, Flat Price Action Though ZEC’s situation is the most extreme, $NEO and $FET are also showing signs of potential directional stress. NEO’s open interest has jumped 47.8%, the largest increase in this group by far. Despite this increase, however, price action for NEO has remained stagnant and even slightly bearish, which suggests that this increase in OI is not a function of bullish longs driving the price higher, but rather an influx of shorts driving the price lower. NEO’s funding rate has dipped into negative territory at -0.045%, which supports the notion that most recent traders are shorting the asset. Open interest is also up for FET (Fetch.ai). However, since the funding rate is also at -0.045%, any recent price moves that have possibly occurred for FET should not be credited with shoring up the asset’s funding rate. Yet another slow day for FET shows it is not earning strength from traders who are willing to bet on a price increase. Both assets may be at heightened risk of volatility for two reasons: -Traders may start unwinding short positions in both assets if they begin to move up in price. -Even if traders maintain short positions, they could be at risk of having those positions move against them if some market catalyst leads to a decline in the prices of the safe-haven assets they’re using as proxies. AIOT: Falling OI and Mildly Bearish Funding Interestingly, not all assets are seeing rising leverage. Open interest for AIOT has dropped a considerable 25.1%, and still AIOT has a mildly negative funding rate of -0.060%. Given that this is a funding rate that’s not actually that crazy in the negative, it suggests, to me at least, that traders are decreasing risk as they get ready for whatever is coming next in AIOT. While the funding stays negative, the mix of declining open interest and a relatively small amount of money suggests that bearish pressure is either dissipating or that traders are still too tentative to re-short the market aggressively. Conclusion: Market Poised for Volatility Data taken together depicts a picture of a derivatives market that is increasingly one-sided, at least in the short term. Open interest across multiple assets is rising. But when you pair that with funding rates that are down across the board, it suggests that the market is betting on a downward movement. Yet, when markets become too one-sided, they become fragile. With so many traders packed into short positions, the risk of a short squeeze — a sudden, sharp upward move that forces shorts to close — also increases. And the more we crowd into our safe spaces, the bigger and more violent the resultant move when the inevitable unwind occurs. These setups should be watched closely by traders. They are closely correlated to many of the setups we just discussed. Trading them means you think either current sentiment is about to continue or that a violent reversal is in the works.

The pole position in this ecosystem is occupied by eETH, Ether.fi’s flagship liquid restaking token (LRT), which represents Ethereum that has been both kind of “staked” to the Ethereum Beacon chain and “restaked” on EigenLayer, the not-so-long-ago showered-in-glory infrastructure given to Ethereum for pooled security. eETH’s rapid ascent in DeFi strategies—especially in leveraged staking loops—has made it a foundational block in many portfolios. Yet, with that increasing centrality comes a deep need to understand and manage risk. Events that could test liquidity, the behavior of validators, and the threat of slashing in EigenLayer all have our attention, and new monitoring tools are beginning to provide much-needed clarity into the slightly uncomfortable fragility underneath the surface. Watching the Pulse: Why Validator Exit Times Matter At its most fundamental, eETH is a tokenized representation of staked ETH that is additionally restaked to EigenLayer through the Ether.fi network of validators. This double-layer construction not only increases the potential yield and utility of eETH but also adds quite a few more moving parts — and therefore risk vectors — than plain vanilla liquid staking protocols. One of the primary indicators of possible strain in the Ether.fi system is the validator exit time average. If this figure starts to rise sharply, it could mean that validators are starting to pull out of the network or that queue congestion is rising because of some external market stress. In either instance, such a spike in exit times can act as a leading signal for liquidity pressure. When users notice this bottleneck, they may hasten to unload their eETH or weETH (wrapped eETH) tokens in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs), which is bound to push the price down and might even trigger a depeg from ETH. 1/ With ~2.5M ETH in TVL, @ether_fi is the largest liquid restaking platform in DeFi, powered by their eETH LRT. As a core component of DeFi strategies like leveraged staking, it is critical to monitor risks that can impact eETH pic.twitter.com/vsmHcS3fUn — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 9, 2025 Now it is possible to monitor these real-time dynamics through Risk Pulse alerts, which give early warnings connected to validator activity and exit patterns. When the pulse begins to spike, that’s when we start to look deeper into the complementary metrics shared on the Risk Radar (like the peg monitor and slippage indicator). These tools assist traders and protocol designers in evaluating not simply if a depeg is occurring but also to gauge its severity and to gauge the market’s response in terms of liquidity depth, spreads, and the overall user sentiment. Slashing Ahead: New Frontier in LRT Risk Management Presently, risks associated with liquidity and the exit queue are well understood. Yet, the next big layer of risk is coming into play with slashing on EigenLayer. Slashing is the nasty mechanism that reduces a validator’s stake if they misbehave or fail to perform as promised. But slashing won’t be targeting just validators of Ethereum’s mainchain; it will also be applied to those validators who are restaking assets like eETH on EigenLayer. If these validators misbehave, then the capital we thought was secured in restaked eETH is actually at risk. The liquid staking sector now faces a seismic shift that until now had not threatened the most restaked positions within it with slashing. Ether.fi is an example of a platform integrated with EigenLayer that will need to bolster its monitoring and protection mechanisms, at both the protocol and user level, if it is to keep those parts of its service from slashing. To prepare for this, new risk alerts and indicators are being developed to track slashing-related data. The idea is to give users much earlier visibility into the kinds of operational risks that, while theoretical for now, will soon become a part of the everyday reality of using Ethereum 2.0. DeFi’s Core Infrastructure Faces a Stress Test As DeFi amplifies and Ether.fi’s eETH becomes intertwined in complex DeFi plays, the risk profile of eETH is increasingly taking on the appearance of a traditional financial instrument — complete with embedded, layered risks that are difficult (and in some cases, impossible) to assess. This is not staking anymore; this is not risk-free yield. This is complex finance. And the part of it that concerns me the most is that the validator network isn’t doing anything very interesting. Having approximately 2.5 million ETH at stake and wider integrations with lending protocols, yield aggregators, and restaking products, Ether.fi is now a central figure in DeFi. Its core infrastructure—like any central piece in a system—will set the tone for the rest of the assemblage. And if it, or any other central part, is to fail, the whole system can only wobble. Currently, the tools are enhancing, the dangers are being outlined, and the closely observing market awaits. The core test of the liquid restaking thesis will be whether Ether.fi can steer through the next phase—especially slashing—without event-driven turmoil.

The downturn followed confirmation from the White House that cumulative tariffs on Chinese imports have climbed to 145%, deepening fears of a prolonged trade war. Gold surged past $3,200 per ounce on Friday, hitting a fresh record, supported by a weaker US dollar and rising safe-haven demand amid escalating US-China trade tensions. For the week, gold is on track for its best performance since last November. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 4.26% tumbled on Friday. The Japanese yen strengthened past 144 per dollar on Friday, hitting a six-month-high.

This first overseas trip of 2025, as reported by state media, is designed to bolster ties with crucial Southeast Asian neighbors. China, Japan, and South Korea held talks in Malaysia to discuss the impact of U.S. tariffs on global and regional economies. The talks were part of the ASEAN+3 Finance and Central Bank Deputies' Meeting. The three countries also discussed economic trends and ways to strengthen regional financial cooperation, with the People's Bank of China reaffirming its commitment to a moderately loose monetary policy. Traders are bracing for China’s March trade data, due over the weekend, amid concerns that exports and imports may start to feel the strain from rising tariffs. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.92% to 20,575 in early Friday, snapping three-day gains as U.S. futures slumped and tensions with China escalated. India ( SENSEX ) rose 1.78% to 75,165 in morning trade on Friday, rebounding from losses in the prior session as trading resumed after the Mahavir Jayanti holiday. Traders welcomed a 90-day suspension of an additional 26% tariff on India, while also engaging in short-term profit-taking ahead of another market closure on Monday for the Ambedkar Jayanti holiday. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 1.39% fell sharply on Friday as global trade concerns rattled investor sentiment.

She added that the market turmoil caused by the trade conflict is not as severe as the 2008 global financial crisis. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended in red reversing some of the previous day’s historic rally as renewed fears over escalating trade tensions between the US and China shook investor confidence. U.S. stock declined on Friday, capping off a turbulent week dominated by sharp market swings amid ongoing trade uncertainty: Dow +0.03%; S&P 500 +0.11%; Nasdaq +0.05%.

This week’s event is pretty similar to previous weeks , where derivatives trading has been somewhat muted, so the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal. Markets have been extremely volatile this week, dumping to a five-month low before bouncing back on the Trump administration’s global trade tariff flip-flops. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.88, meaning that the short and long contract sellers are pretty closely matched. There is also a max pain point of $82,000, which is where most losses will be made. Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $70,000 strike price, with just over a billion dollars in open contracts betting that Bitcoin will fall further. However, there is a similar amount of OI at the $100,000 strike price as the bulls are maintaining their positions, according to Deribit. Options Expiry Alert At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $2.59B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $2.32B notional | Put/Call: 0.97 | Max Pain: $82K $ETH : $270M notional | Put/Call: 0.91 | Max Pain: $1,750 With recent market volatility and ongoing tariff… pic.twitter.com/2OywATV66o — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) April 10, 2025 Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was “cautiously bullish” after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, “though many remain skeptical this rally will be sustained,” it added. “Key levels being watched are $85K as a near-term target and $100K as a longer-term resistance, with traders debating whether this news-driven pump will eventually be faded.” Greeks also commented that several traders noted this was a “clear case of insider knowledge” as heavy buying occurred in the $75,000 to $77,500 range hours before the 90-day tariff pause announcement. In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, there are around 183,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $283 million, a max pain point of $1,750, and a put/call ratio of 0.92. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.5 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto market capitalization is back in the red, having lost 3.6% over the past 24 hours and declined to $2.65 trillion. After reclaiming $83,000 on Thursday, Bitcoin sank back below $79,000 in late trading in reaction to lower-than-expected CPI figures before recovering marginally to reach $80,000 during Friday morning trading in Asia. Zooming out, the asset has been steadily downtrending since mid-January, having declined 26% from its all-time high. Ethereum is still in bear market territory , having slumped 4% on the day in a fall to $1,540. However, the rest of the altcoins were mixed with minor daily gains for Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Hedera (HBAR).

They’ve evolved. What started as dog-themed internet banter is now a full-blown financial movement. Whether you love ‘em, hate ‘em, or just missed the boat on the last one, you must admit that these digital misfits have made real people real money. Some even changed their zip codes. Imagine if you could rewind the clock and catch Doge before Elon tweeted about it. Or hop on Shiba Inu when everyone thought it was just another rug waiting to happen. That’s the zone TrollerCat ($TCAT) is in right now. And no, this isn’t just another token with a furry face and no future. Trollercat is flipping the meme coin game on its head—hard. It’s smart, it’s spicy, and it’s making serious waves before it even drops. If you’ve been lurking, waiting for the one , this is your shot. But you’ve gotta move fast. Troller Cat’s whitelist is open, and once the crowd catches on, it’s game over for latecomers. Let’s break down why this isn’t just another presale and why getting in now could be one of the smartest plays you make in 2025. Troller Cat: A New Breed of Meme Coin Enter Troller Cat, a meme coin that’s not just riding the wave but is set to make its splash. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Troller Cat combines humor, community engagement, and strategic tokenomics to create a compelling investment opportunity.

The Advantages of Joining the Whitelist Joining the whitelist for Troller Cat’s presale offers several compelling benefits: Early Access to Tokens: Whitelist members gain priority access to purchase $TCAT tokens before the general public. This early entry allows investors to acquire tokens at lower prices, maximizing the potential for returns once the coin hits the broader market. Exclusive Rewards: Joining the whitelist isn’t just about purchasing tokens—it’s about being part of a community. Whitelist members are privy to exclusive rewards, including staking opportunities and early access to Troller Cat’s upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) games. These rewards are designed to enhance the overall value proposition for early supporters. Influence on Project Development: Early investors often have a say in the project’s direction. By joining the whitelist, you’re not just a passive investor but an active participant in shaping the future of Troller Cat. This level of engagement fosters a sense of ownership and community, making your investment experience more fulfilling. The Buzz Around Troller Cat’s Presale The excitement surrounding Troller Cat’s presale is palpable. Investors are closely monitoring the project’s developments, eager to secure their spot before the presale opens to the public. The potential for significant returns is a major draw, with some speculating that early investors could see gains reminiscent of those who invested in Dogecoin or Shiba Inu at their inception. The Rumored High Staking Rewards While details are still under wraps, there’s talk of Troller Cat offering impressive staking rewards for early adopters. Staking allows investors to earn passive income by locking up their tokens to support the network’s operations. High staking rewards can significantly enhance the value of your investment, providing a steady income stream while you hold your tokens. If these rumors hold true, early investors stand to benefit substantially. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center: A Game-Changer Another exciting aspect of Troller Cat is the rumored Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center. This feature is expected to gamify the investment experience, allowing token holders to earn rewards through gameplay. The P2E model adds an entertainment factor and introduces a deflationary mechanism to tokenomics. As players engage with the games, tokens may be burned, reducing the overall supply and potentially increasing demand. This innovative approach could set Troller Cat apart from other meme coins, offering utility and fun. The Power of Community in Meme Coin Success The success of meme coins is heavily reliant on community support. A strong, engaged community can drive awareness, adoption, and sustained growth. Troller Cat understands this dynamic, placing a high emphasis on building a vibrant community.

The current assets that are over-collateralized do not seem to be affecting the intended value that sUSD should hold. The asset dipped as low as $0.869 and now hovers at about $0.908. The mechanism that maintains the value seems to be undergoing a transformation that has some asking if the underlying setup can maintain the sort of peg seen in typical stablecoins. sUSD continues to depeg, with its price dropping as low as $0.869 and currently trading at $0.908. Previously, Synthetix founder Kain stated that the sUSD peg restoration mechanism is undergoing a transition. He also revealed that he has sold 90% of his ETH holdings and increased… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 10, 2025 The dip marks one of the most significant instances of sUSD losing its peg in recent memory and comes at a sensitive moment for Synthetix. The community and team behind the protocol have acknowledged that the stablecoin is in a “transitional period” as it shifts away from the debt-burning model that previously helped keep the peg stable. Attracting attention currently is the Synthetix ecosystem, where instability exists. And major players in Synthetix, including its founder, Kain Warwick, are very much involved and making headlines. Warwick recently revealed to the Synthetix community via a video that he has sold 90% of his ETH to buy Synthetix and double his exposure to the protocol’s native token, SNX. A Transition in Motion: From Debt-Burning to the 420 Pool In recent weeks, the Synthetix community has been open about the developing mechanics under sUSD’s peg. Per a detailed post in the official sUSD Discord, the old model— which required burning debt to maintain the peg— is being retired. In its place, the 420 pool and an upcoming mechanism for liquidity pool management are expected to step in as the primary means of restoring and maintaining sUSD peg stability over the long term. The change has briefly disconnected sUSD from its dollar equivalence. sUSD has De-pegged Synthetic USD ( #sUSD ) is going through a Transition Period, possibly involving hormones. Will the PulseChain Pioneers build a nice Decentralised Stablecoin called #pDAI ? From the Synthetix sUSD Discord: ""We're in a transitionary period… pic.twitter.com/FXGTwmrNKw — yourfriendSOMMI (@yourfriendSOMMI) April 10, 2025 “We’re in a transitionary period where maintaining the peg no longer burns debt effectively,” the post states. “The 420 pool will eventually lead to sUSD being designed in a way so that it is more efficient in the long term and much more effective at maintaining the peg with the dollar.” The current main problem is surplus supply. With the previous stabilization mechanisms now defunct and the new system still being rolled out, the market is flooded with sUSD. This excess is creating downward price pressure and making it difficult for sUSD to achieve the necessary demand to maintain its dollar peg. Even though the protocol states that sUSD is still healthily over-collateralized, many in the crypto community now question whether any stablecoin can be trusted if the collateral it is backed by has been deemed by the market as having lost its value. sUSD was down 1.3% to $0.9860 at the time of writing. Short-Term Incentives, Long-Term Vision In reaction to the depegging, Synthetix is implementing initiatives to reinforce confidence and liquidity in the short term. These consist of: upping the ante for Curve liquidity pools — in which sUSD is paired with other stablecoins — and extending the Infinex deposit campaign. The campaign invites users to stake sUSD in exchange for rewards, effectively and temporarily helping to remove the excess supply from the market. The team is also working on something else that could change the demand dynamics for sUSD, and that’s something we call “snaxchain,” which is an initiative of ours that we hope will allow for a lot more utility in the sUSD space. What is snaxchain? It’s not so much a project as it is a rethinking of sUSD and the spaces in which it can be used and work. We have a lot of fun ideas, and some of them are quite wild. Discord message emphasized the criticality of the sUSD peg for the success of the 420 pool—”The sUSD peg is critical to the success of the 420 pool,” the Discord message stated. On the same day, another Discord message made clear the Plan B being acted upon. We will maintain incentives for a stable sUSD price during this transition towards longer-term solutions. Expected in the coming weeks are additional announcements that will outline further measures intended to stabilize sUSD. The market, until then, will remain in this holding pattern, with sUSD trading at a decent, if not too concerning, discount in comparison with the US dollar and SNX volatility reflecting the sort of concern mixed with hope that it has recently reflected. Though the current depeg is noteworthy, it is not the first instance of an algorithmic stablecoin having structural issues. What makes Synthetix distinct is its clear and forthright operation, along with its exhibited flexibility—both of which might help restore not just confidence in sUSD, but also in stablecoins as a whole. Even so, the clock is ticking. Stablecoins depend on stability — and getting back to the peg is now more than just a technical must. It’s a test of whether the trust that users place in stablecoins can be regained. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a post shared on X, Farina stated that he was frustrated by the apparent lack of price movement following major developments related to Ripple. He referenced Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition and expressed that, under fair market conditions, the price of XRP should have “skyrocketed.” He noted that various external narratives appear to be holding the price back. Not going to lie, today I was frustrated with the markets. In a fair market, XRP's price should’ve skyrocketed after today’s news about Ripple’s $1.25B acquisition. But, as always, there’s a narrative to suppress the price. whether it’s the lawsuit, the SEC’s war on crypto,… pic.twitter.com/aMfFQ7rkzK — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 8, 2025 These include the ongoing lawsuit involving Ripple, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s broader regulatory stance on the crypto industry, President Trump’s trade tariffs, and the recent Bitcoin crash. Farina insisted that if not for these factors, XRP would already be trading well above $100 without question. He closed his message by encouraging holders to remain patient and committed, asserting that “our time is coming.” Details of Ripple’s Acquisition According to a recent Times Tabloid article, Ripple has completed a record-breaking $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road, a global prime brokerage firm. The deal marks a significant expansion for Ripple, positioning it as the first crypto firm to own and operate a multi-asset global prime broker. Hidden Road’s existing infrastructure offers services in foreign exchange, digital assets, and other derivatives markets, and the acquisition is expected to enhance Ripple’s offerings in these areas. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The report notes that this strategic move aligns with Ripple’s broader goal of bridging traditional and blockchain-based financial systems. It also underscores Ripple’s commitment to expanding its presence in key financial jurisdictions, with Hidden Road already having regulatory footprints in North America, Europe, and Asia. With this acquisition, Ripple aims to streamline institutional access to digital assets through a regulated and comprehensive brokerage framework. Community Reactions and Broader Sentiment Farina’s comments echoed the sentiments of other XRP community members who were also surprised by the market’s muted reaction to the acquisition. One user, Atom XRPL, wrote , “Seriously it’s like XRP’s stuck in the mud sometimes… this acquisition was massive, it should’ve pumped like crazy! but!!! our time will come.” This perspective highlights a broader concern among XRP supporters that the asset’s price performance does not always correlate with Ripple’s business achievements or long-term prospects. Despite the frustration expressed by Farina and others in the XRP community, there remains a persistent belief that XRP’s value will eventually reflect its underlying fundamentals and Ripple’s expanding role in the financial sector.

CryptoPunk #3100, one of just nine Alien Punks in the original 10,000-piece collection, was sold for 4,000 Ethereum ( ETH ), worth about $6.07 million at the time of sale, according to an Apr. 10 transaction flagged by Arkham on X. The art brokerage firm Fountain reportedly brokered the sale, which was finalized through a private offer on the CryptoPunks marketplace.

But with Ethereum’s price down roughly 56% over the past year, the seller’s 500 ETH loss turned into a net $10 million hit in dollar terms.

At that time, ETH was trading at around $3,500, placing the floor price above $400,000 compared to just $65,900 at press time. As NFTs’ popularity and asset prices continue to fall , the industry has been facing significant pressure. In Q1 2025, NFT trading volume fell to $1.5 billion, a 24% decrease from Q4 2024, according to DappRadar’s Q1 report . Despite only a slight drop in trading activity, the steep drop in volume indicates fewer high-value transactions rather than a decline in users. CryptoPunks still commands a sizable share of the market, making up 23% of the $2.7 billion global NFT market capitalization.

43200636,https://nulltx.com/?p=147916,1744350523,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Altcoin Unlocks Near Completion: Market Still Sleeping on Fully Circulating Supply,https://nulltx.com/altcoin-unlocks-near-completion-market-still-sleeping-on-fully-circulating-supply/,"While the overall crypto market is dealing with ups and downs dictated by macroeconomic events and is undergoing a sector-wide re-pricing, one key storyline hasn’t really been told: Many of the altcoins that make up this market are getting set to unlock the vast majority of the tokens they hold by the end of 2025. Surprising as it may seem, this pivotal narrative isn’t quite grabbing the attention it probably should. Historically, token unlocks have been linked to price risks, with the locked supply gradually coming into the market. In contrast, the almost total unlocking of certain tokens eliminates this persistent overhang. This change has big implications. We’re in a space where Fully Diluted Valuations (FDVs) often cast shadows over market caps and make it hard to see genuine supply-demand dynamics. With only a few months left until full circulation for many major altcoins, traders and investors might be forgetting about an important inflection point: these projects will soon clear away supply-side uncertainty, probably making the pricing in these markets much cleaner and organic demand much more apparent. The Final Stretch: What’s Unlocking and When Upon looking closely, one can see that there are several altcoins whose total token supply is already more than 95% in circulation. Moreover, the remaining portion is set to unlock well before 2025. Here’s some more information about them and some of the main players in this area. Biconomy ($BICO) – Left to Unlock: 4% – Last Unlock Date: September 2025 – Fully Diluted Valuation: $89.1 million – Upcoming Allocation: Community Biconomy is a protocol that is simplifying Web3 interactions. It is in the last phase of its token distribution journey, with only 4% of its total supply left to unlock. This supply is earmarked for the community. Consequently, any sell pressure resulting from the allocations that are yet to unlock is minimal, and community-targeted allocations tend to be slower and more cautious in hitting the market compared to investor-and team-targeted allocations. This stroke of allocation luck makes the event relatively low-risk. Dodo (DODO) – Percent Remaining to Unlock: 5% – Total Unlock Date: July 2025 – Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV): $48.3 million – Allocated to: Community A decentralized exchange using Proactive Market Making (PMM), Dodo occupies a similar place. There, too, only 5% of the supply remains to be unlocked and the fully diluted valuation (FDV) is just 83.7 million—not much and certainly not large in comparison to some figures that are tossed around at the present time. Most of the dilution is already done there as well, and when 5% does unlock on Dodo, the community-targeted allocation will again help to soften the impact. Gelato ($GEL) -Left to Unlock: 3% – Last Unlock Date: September 2025 – FDV: $19.1 million – Planned Future Allocation: Team & Foundation Gelato, a Web3 automation layer, has just 3% of its tokens left to unlock. Unlike BICO and DODO, the tokens going to the team and foundation might introduce more risk. Still, the relatively small FDV limits the downside, especially if the unlock is gradual and transparent. Cartesi ($CTSI) – Left to Unlock: 3% – Last Unlock Date: Dec. ’25 – FDV: *$49.5 mil – Awaiting Allocation: Reserves Cartesi makes it possible to scale smart contracts based on Linux and also sits near the completion of its token unlock cycle. The final 3% is set to go into reserves — an allocation that often stays off the market for long periods — which suggests low immediate risk. VVS Finance ($VVS) – Unlocking Remains: 3% – Concluding Unlock Date: November 2025 – FDV:* At $209 million – Moneys Awaiting Allocation: Team VVS Finance is one of the higher-FDV projects on this list. Its team allocation is worth monitoring. Team unlocks can create sell pressure. But much of the supply is already in circulation, which helps balance concerns. These tokens will be fully unlocked by 2025 — and the market isn’t pricing it in. While many altcoins still carry unlock overhangs, these tokens are nearing 100% circulating supply, removing a key source of supply-side risk. Check: – Remaining % to unlock – Final unlock date -… pic.twitter.com/00pDXH6o7e — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) April 9, 2025 Coin98 ($C98) – Unlocking Remaining: 5% – Unlock Date Final: June 2025 – Valuation in USD at Full Unlock: 49.7 million department: Pending Allocation: Community, Treasury, Team. The unlock saga of Coin98 is more intricate, with the leftover tokens divided among the community, treasury, and teams. Depending on how these groups manage their tokens, there could be varied levels of impact. But with just 5 percent of the tokens left to unlock, the worst is clearly over. 1inch (1INCH) – Unlocking Remaining: 8% – Final Unlocking Date: December 2025 – Fully Diluted Valuation: $242 million – Allocation Pending: Team & Investors 1inch is the farthest from full circulation on this list, with 8% of the supply still locked and destined for insiders. This could create more volatility, especially considering its larger FDV and investor allocation. Still, the unlock horizon isn’t long, and the worst might already be priced in. Unlocking Opportunity in a Mispriced Market Despite the market being caught up in macro narratives and the meme coin frenzy, the upcoming full unlocks in a few select digital assets present something of an opportunity for those investors plugged into the real story. Unlike the typical offer that comes with an initial coin offering (ICO), where tokens are doled out in stages with no expectation that they will be for sale until the offer is exhausted, the day after defined unlock periods end, in this case, defined by the time on the digital clock in the upper right corner of an asset’s UI in its blockchain environment. In a crypto world where attention and liquidity are everything, projects that have fully circulating supplies and low FDVs may reemerge as the ones allocators like to talk about. The problem is the allocators never seem to talk about them until the market is aware they have been unlocked. This prompts a question: Is the market aware of what it has anyway? As of now, the clock appears to be ticking, and the opportunity to front-run the entire supply realization may be coming to an end. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In an April 10 letter to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Senators said the decision to disband the department’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team was a “grave mistake” that would support “sanctions evasion, drug trafficking, scams, and child sexual exploitation.” Senators Richard Durbin, Mazie Hirono, Sheldon Whitehouse, Christopher Coons and Richard Blumenthal signed the letter in addition to Warren. On April 7, Blanche shuttered the DOJ’s crypto enforcement team, saying in a memo that “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator.” The senators claim that the decision gave a “free pass to cryptocurrency money launderers” and claimed that crypto mixing services — used to obfuscate blockchain transactions — are “go-to tools for cybercriminals.” “It makes no sense for DOJ to announce a hands-off approach to tools that are being used to support such terrible crimes,” the letter said. An excerpt of Democrat’s letter to the DOJ. Source: US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs The senators also questioned why the Justice Department had decided not to prosecute a “host of crimes involving digital assets, including violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.” They claimed that this creates a “systemic vulnerability in the digital assets sector,” which “drug traffickers, terrorists, fraudsters, and adversaries” will exploit on a large scale. The lawmakers requested a staff-level briefing no later than May 1, providing “detailed information on the rationale behind these decisions.” Targeting Trump family crypto endeavors The letter also took a swipe at the Trump family’s crypto projects , suggesting potential conflicts of interest. Related: SafeMoon boss cites DOJ’s nixed crypto unit in latest bid to toss suit A press release accompanying the letter stated that the senators are raising concerns about the “potential connections” between the DOJ’s actions and the crypto ventures of President Donald Trump and his family. The Trumps have an interest in and have backed the crypto platform World Liberty Financial along with its token. The platform is also planning to launch a stablecoin while President Trump’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are working to launch a crypto-mining company called American Bitcoin. “Your decisions give rise to concerns that President Trump’s interest in selling his cryptocurrency may be the reason for easing law enforcement scrutiny,” the Democrats stated. In a memo announcing the crypto enforcement team’s disbandment, Blanche accused the Biden administration of using the Justice Department to “pursue a reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution.” Magazine: Illegal arcade disguised as … a fake Bitcoin mine?

The decision, delivered in typical Trumpian flair, has ignited a wave of optimism among investors and traders who were growing weary of relentless trade uncertainty. After the announcement, the U.S. and crypto markets rebounded sharply, taking back the direction they had been heading in for the past week—one filled with confusion, misinformation, and sell-off panic that had so many investors deciding to divest. On the day of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price leapt to $82,600, Ethereum’s value jumped to $1,650, the S&P 500 stock index surged 8.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw a stunning one-day surge of 10%.

This positive news (albeit a temporary alleviation to a still… pic.twitter.com/zOWbDZflml — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 9, 2025 The shift, although it is transitory and affects just a select few, has been enough to bring bullish sentiment back into a market that has become highly reactive—if not downright jumpy—to anything related to the trade war. From False Alarms to FOMO Today’s market activity couldn’t be any more different from what we saw just 48 hours ago. On Monday, traders were sent scrambling by a misreported story that was doing the rounds. It had us believing we were on the verge of a tariff pause — something we’ve all been waiting for. Of course, the story turned out to be wrong, and when traders realized we were still on the verge of tariff hell instead, prices corrected right back to where they’d been just before the rumor broke. Adding insult to injury, Tuesday then hit us with the news that we were slapping China with a new massive 104% tariff hike. Ouch! The present, definitively declared notification has altered the atmosphere, albeit for now. The primary distinction? At last, the cessation is endorsed—applying to all countries save China. Yet this exempting of China hardly resolves the wider issue of global trade turbulence. Still, it is more than enough to set can’t-sit-still investors, who have been abiding in sidelined status, in a FOMO frenzy. And signal it did. The markets wasted no time in pricing in the optimistic signals. Bitcoin, which had taken a beating during the false start earlier in the week, rebounded swiftly, now bolstered by a surge in risk appetite and a renewed narrative that it is a potential inflation hedge. Ethereum followed, although its gains were more muted, reflecting a continued divide in confidence between the top two cryptocurrencies. In the stock market, the rally was even more marked. The S&P 500 had its best single-day gain in recent memory, rising 8.1% as big investors and individual traders piled in. The Nasdaq, always more reactive to shifts in economic policy, leaped even more at 10%, as tech companies continued to benefit from the renewed hope of a somewhat improved global trade situation—not that anyone’s counting on it in the long term. Caution Beneath the Euphoria Even with all the excitement, market fundamentals are still as unclear as ever. A 90-day tariff truce is still just a truce. It doesn’t repair the harm done over years of back-and-forth trade battles, and with China still the main target, the largest and most prolonged uncertainty remains utterly unresolved. One trader observed, “Lately, the market compass has been greed and fear, and the crowd has been most accurate at indicating where the market is heading. And this bounce we’re seeing? It’s really about sentiment — not substance.” Traders who bought the dip in the past week, especially after Tuesday’s tariff shock, have received handsome rewards. But that could change just as quickly if the story shifts again — something that has become all too common in today’s markets, which seem more directed by emotional whiplash than by any grounded assessment of fundamentals. Indeed, the current market climate feels more like a narrative-driven soap opera. At present, the signal is clear: the market is very sensitive to news about tariffs, whether it is real news or just rumors. In these times of heightened volatility, even a short-term delay can set off a big market reaction. But just as easily, a single tweet or casual comment could send the market back down.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Boston Fed President Susan Collins made important assessments on interest rates, inflation and trade tariffs. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated that the course of the economy should be monitored before taking a new step in interest rate policies. “Right now, the Fed’s threshold for policy changes is quite high,” Goolsbee said, adding that all policy options should be kept on the agenda. Goolsbee said current tariffs will increase inflation and negatively impact economic growth in the short term. Describing the tariff system as a “major scenario,” Goolsbee said that although the Trump administration has suspended some measures, current levels are above most scenarios. Despite the previous sell-off in the bond market, Goolsbee said the strong 10-year Treasury note auction eased market concerns, adding that these sales were not limited to the U.S. Noting the difficulty of measuring financial conditions, Goolsbee avoided speculation on how the Fed would respond to market stress. Related News: Rumors Are Spreading About The Next Big US Move In The US-China Trade War - Here's The Leaked Information Noting that employment data remains strong, Goolsbee said he prefers to rely on market inflation expectations rather than survey data. Boston Fed President Susan Collins said the current interest rate policy is well positioned and that holding steady seems like the best option. Collins said there is still room for a rate cut in 2025, but that rising price pressures could delay that cut. Collins said the tariffs would put upward pressure on inflation and slow economic growth, warning that this could push core inflation well above 3% this year. Collins also said it was critical to keep inflation expectations steady. *This is not investment advice.

Thielen said in an April 11 markets report that credit spreads continue to widen, indicating that “recessionary concerns may be seeping deeper into the economy.” “Expecting a bullish impulse is too early,” he said. Bitcoin may face short-term headwinds While the long-term effects of a recession could be bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) — due to the monetary easing that typically follows US Federal Reserve rate cuts — Thielen warned that Bitcoin may face headwinds before gaining bullish momentum. “Normally, Bitcoin first sells off when China devalues or the Fed cuts, as the first cut might not be so impactful and also confirms economic weakness,” Thielen told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin is trading at $80,620 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks said in an April 10 X post that it is “time for a rate cut” after the core Consumer Price Index increased 2.8% year-by-year for March, the lowest it has been since March 2021. CME Group’s FedWatch Tool shows a 64.8% chance of no rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s May Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Traders typically see interest rate cuts and monetary supply expansions as positively affecting asset prices, especially Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, Thielen said that historically, when year-over-year credit spreads “begin to widen,” Bitcoin often faces more downside pressure and takes longer to recover. Related: Bitcoin ‘significantly de-risked here’ as nearly 80% of cyclical price correction is done — Analyst “This pattern suggests that while a longer-term opportunity may emerge, Bitcoin could still face pressure in the near term,” Thielen said. He added that currency devaluations have also historically been bearish for markets in the short term before being bullish in the long term. It comes amid growing concern among market participants over the weakening US dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is sitting at 100.337, down 2.92% over the past five days, according to TradingView data. The DXY is sitting at 100.337 at the time of publication.

The NY AG urged saying, lawmakers should mandate that crypto companies register with a federal regulatory agency. The firms must register to establish minimum listing standards for crypto tokens, she added. The letter comes as Congress prepares to pass GENIUS Act – a bipartisan step to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoin payments. Besides, James noted that lawmakers should require stablecoin issuers to have a U.S. presence. Onshoring stablecoins would help protect the U.S. dollar and the treasuries market, James noted. Source: ag.ny.gov Bitcoin Threat to Dollar Dominance The NY AG highlighted fraud risks and Bitcoin’s challenge to the U.S. dollar’s dominance. She noted that the growing crypto influence specifically Bitcoin, could undermine the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the global financial system. James also stressed that the displacement of the USD’s dominance by Bitcoin would weaken the dollar and “the ability for America to enforce its interests globally and to finance a robust economy.” Increasing Crypto Fraud Activities Need to Be Under Check: NY AG AG James called for stronger federal regulations to protect investors from increasing fraud and criminal activity within the digital asset space. She noted: “Countless New Yorkers invest in cryptocurrency and digital assets, and more must be done to protect them and their money. Thousands of investors in New York and across the country have lost millions of dollars to cryptocurrency scams and fraud that could be prevented with stronger federal regulations.” New York lawmakers already introduced a new bill on March 5 aimed at combating cryptocurrency fraud, particularly rug pulls. The proposal came at a time when several high-profile incidents were reported involving meme coins.

Despite opposition from Democrats and strict republicans, the bill still made it through. Notably, the budget is a crucial part of Trump’s policy goals which he calls ‘a big, beautiful bill’. He views it as a major win for his administration and supporters. After a narrow 216-214 bill House vote on Thursday, Trump shared in a social media post – “ Congratulations to the House on the passage of a Bill that sets the stage for one of the Greatest and Most Important Signings in the History of our Country.” House Plan Includes Bigger Cuts, $5T in Tax Breaks The House and Senate have passed different versions of the bill and now they need to merge them together into one final version which Trump can sign. The process is called ‘Reconciliation’. Notably, the House’s version includes bigger spending cuts and proposes around $5 trillion in tax cuts. But this could increase the national debt by about a whopping $5.7 trillion over 10 years. With the US government currently owing around $36 trillion, this plan could significantly add to the debt unless other savings or revenue sources are found. Initially, some staunch Republicans opposed the bill over rising US debt concerns demanding bigger spending cuts. Earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the vote fearing it would not pass due to the slim Republican majority. Only two republicans voted against it by Thursday. The Senate’s version of the bill passed on Saturday includes at least $4 billion in spending cuts which is far less than the $1.5 trillion in cuts proposed by the House. The Senate Republicans note that the $4 billion is just the minimum figure and they will do everything they can to be as aggressive as possible. Critics Warn This Could Worsen US Debt Trump’s new budget bill proposes major spending cuts and big tax breaks including cuts on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. While supporters claim that it will boost the economy, critics warn that it could worsen US debt. White House believes that higher tariffs will cover up the losses, but experts warn that fewer imports could lead to lesser revenue. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent praised that the bill shows the administration’s commitment to growth. The Congress may have to soon raise the US’ debt ceiling again. While the House passed the bill, Democrats call it reckless due to the proposed cuts to medicaid and are determined to fight harder in Congress. The fight within the party comes as Trump’s tariffs have led to global market chaos. Lawmakers are concerned that a slowed economy due to trade war could result in lower tax revenues. White House Slams Insider Trading Claim The White House criticised the accusations by Democrats who questioned whether some lawmakers knew in advance of Trump’s surprise Tariff pause, which triggered a sharp stock market rally. After dropping for four days, markets surged on Trump’s 90-day delay on steep tariffs for countries other than China. Besides, Trump’s advisor Peter Navarro dismissed concerns that the sudden tariff pause caused lasting economic damage. Instead he said that it was just ‘a normal pullback’ and no big deal. He also claimed that the media outlets were exaggerating and turning the situation into political “spin.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 06:13:28

The drop follows a steep decline in recent days, with the token down over 30% in the last 14 days and more than 80% below its February 26th peak. The price pressure comes as a massive token unlock continues to unfold. According to PiScan, more than 119 million Pi tokens are expected to enter circulation this month alone, with 1.4 million already unlocked on April 11 alone. The remaining tokens will be released gradually throughout the rest of the month. Community Frustration Grows Over Delays and Lack of Transparency As prices tumble, discontent within the Pi Network community is reaching new highs. Recetly, Pi Network Turkey, the project’s largest community group in the region, issued a strong statement criticizing the core team’s handling of the project. The group accused Pi Network developers of adopting a top-down management style, ignoring community feedback, and straying from the platform’s original decentralized vision. “What we once eagerly anticipated has now turned into disappointment,” the statement read, stressing broken promises, lack of transparency, and indefinite delays to the Open Mainnet launch. The group also pointed to unclear financials, vague details on partnerships, and little visibility into the actual number of live decentralized applications (dApps) on the network. Is Pi Network Losing Trust? Some analysts believe the sharp decline in Pi’s value is being driven not only by token unlocks but also by widening skepticism about the project’s long-term vision and deliverables. As concerns mount over whether Pi Network is truly building a meaningful Web3 ecosystem — or simply riding the crypto hype — the project’s credibility appears to be at risk.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 06:14:18

In a big win for the crypto community, President Donald Trump has officially signed off on the repeal of the controversial IRS “DeFi Broker Rule.” This marks the first time a crypto-related bill has ever become law in the United States — a significant milestone that reflects the changing attitude toward digital assets at the federal level. Crypto Czar David Sacks credited Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Carey, and Bryan Steil for pushing the resolution through Congress. UPDATE: As promised, President Trump has signed the bill to repeal the DeFi Broker Rule. Congratulations to @SenTedCruz , @RepMikeCarey , and @RepBryanSteil for steering the resolution through Congress. https://t.co/SugdszjIPp — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) April 11, 2025 What Was the DeFi Broker Rule? Originally introduced during the Biden administration , the DeFi Broker Rule was set to take effect in 2027. It aimed to expand IRS reporting requirements by forcing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to report details about crypto transactions, including the gross proceeds and user information, similar to traditional brokers reporting stock trades. Supporters of the rule claimed it would help prevent tax evasion, especially among the wealthy. However, critics said it would impose impossible demands on decentralized systems that don’t have centralized operators or user databases. Why It Was Repealed Trump’s repeal of the rule came after heavy criticism from lawmakers and crypto advocates who believed it would stifle innovation and overwhelm the IRS with data it’s not equipped to process. Representative Mike Carey, one of the key backers, said the rule would have hurt everyday Americans’ privacy while creating chaos during tax season. HISTORY MADE Just now, @POTUS signed my bill to repeal to the IRS DeFi Crypto Broker Rule. This is the first cryptocurrency bill EVER signed into law by a president. @HouseGOP is working to keep America as the crypto capital of the world! — Congressman Mike Carey (@RepMikeCarey) April 10, 2025 Crypto lobby groups like the Blockchain Association even filed lawsuits calling the rule an “unconstitutional overreach.” Their CEO, Kristin Smith, celebrated the repeal, stating that crypto innovators could “breathe again” and that the rule would have destroyed the U.S. crypto industry. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : House Approves Trump’s Budget Bill with Trillion-Dollar Tax Cuts and Big Spending Cuts , How It Happened The resolution to repeal the rule moved quickly through Congress. It passed the House in March and the Senate shortly after. Trump’s signature on April 10 officially turned it into law. According to reports, Trump was expected to support the move, especially after his crypto advisor David Sacks confirmed the President’s favorable stance toward crypto policies. The repeal of the DeFi Broker Rule sends a strong message that the U.S. may be shifting toward more crypto-friendly regulations. Under Trump’s administration, the SEC has already begun to roll back aggressive enforcement actions taken under Gary Gensler, signaling a new approach that leans more toward innovation than regulation. Overall, this could mark the beginning of a much-needed regulatory reset for the crypto industry. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43201498,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148539,1744352391,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,North Carolina’s Revolutionary Bill: Legalizing Bitcoin as Payment – A Crypto Breakthrough?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/north-carolina-bitcoin-legal-payment/,"Is North Carolina about to become a beacon for Bitcoin adoption in the United States? A groundbreaking new bill, the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act, has been introduced, and it’s sending ripples of excitement through the cryptocurrency community. Could this be a pivotal moment for Bitcoin and digital assets in the state and beyond? Let’s dive into what this bill entails and what it could mean for you. What’s Brewing in North Carolina? The Push for Bitcoin as Legal Payment Representative Neal Jackson is spearheading a legislative effort that could redefine how digital assets are perceived and utilized in North Carolina. The proposed North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act isn’t just another piece of legislation; it’s a bold step towards acknowledging the legitimacy and utility of decentralized cryptocurrencies, specifically those resembling Bitcoin . At its core, the bill seeks to recognize certain decentralized digital assets as lawful methods of payment within the state. But what exactly does this mean? Here’s a breakdown: Legal Tender Recognition: The bill aims to classify digital assets that meet specific criteria as legal forms of payment. This means businesses and individuals could legally use these assets for transactions, including paying taxes to the state. Specific Criteria for Recognition: The bill isn’t opening the door to every cryptocurrency out there. It sets forth stringent requirements for a digital asset to qualify, including: Proof-of-Work Mechanism: Assets must operate on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, a hallmark of Bitcoin’s security and decentralization. Capped Supply: A limited, or capped, supply is another key criterion, mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity and predictable monetary policy. Significant Market Capitalization: The asset must boast a market capitalization exceeding $750 billion. This benchmark effectively points directly to Bitcoin , as it is currently the only cryptocurrency that consistently meets this massive valuation. Implicit Bitcoin Focus: While the bill doesn’t explicitly name Bitcoin , the criteria are so narrowly defined that it strongly suggests Bitcoin is the intended beneficiary of this legislation. Following the CBDC Ban: Interestingly, this bill emerges shortly after North Carolina’s 2024 ban on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This sequence of events could indicate a clear preference within the state legislature for decentralized, permissionless cryptocurrencies over centralized, government-controlled digital currencies. Why is North Carolina Considering This Move? Unpacking the Benefits of Legalizing Bitcoin So, why is North Carolina potentially paving the way for Bitcoin to become a recognized form of legal payment ? Let’s explore the potential advantages: Economic Innovation and Attractiveness: Embracing digital assets can position North Carolina as a forward-thinking, innovative state, attracting businesses and individuals within the burgeoning cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. This could lead to economic growth, job creation, and increased investment within the state. Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can offer alternative financial avenues for individuals who are unbanked or underbanked. By recognizing Bitcoin as legal payment , North Carolina could promote greater financial inclusion and accessibility for its residents. Reduced Transaction Costs: Cryptocurrency transactions can often have lower fees compared to traditional banking systems, especially for international transfers. This could benefit businesses and consumers alike. Enhanced Privacy and Control: Decentralized cryptocurrencies offer users greater control over their funds and potentially enhanced privacy compared to traditional financial systems. Tax Revenue Opportunities: By formally recognizing Bitcoin for tax payments, the state could streamline tax collection processes for cryptocurrency holders and potentially tap into a new revenue stream. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead for Crypto Regulation While the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act presents exciting possibilities, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Here are some key points to ponder regarding crypto regulation : Challenge Description Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are known for their price volatility. This can pose challenges for businesses accepting Bitcoin for payments, as the value of the asset can fluctuate significantly in short periods. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving both at the state and federal levels. Navigating these uncertainties and ensuring compliance will be crucial. Consumer Education and Protection Widespread adoption of Bitcoin as legal payment will necessitate robust consumer education initiatives to ensure users understand the risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies. Consumer protection measures will also be vital to safeguard users from fraud and scams. Infrastructure and Adoption For Bitcoin to function effectively as a legal payment method, the necessary infrastructure for seamless transactions needs to be in place. This includes payment processors, point-of-sale systems, and widespread merchant adoption. Environmental Concerns Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin , have faced criticism regarding their energy consumption. Addressing environmental concerns and promoting sustainable cryptocurrency practices will be important for long-term acceptance. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you’re a cryptocurrency enthusiast, a business owner in North Carolina, or simply curious about the future of finance, this bill warrants attention. Here’s what you can consider: Stay Informed: Keep track of the progress of the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act. Follow legislative updates and news from reputable sources like Cointelegraph to understand how this bill is developing. Engage with Policymakers: If you’re a resident of North Carolina, consider contacting your representatives to express your views on this legislation. Your voice can influence the direction of crypto regulation in your state. Prepare Your Business: If you own a business in North Carolina, start thinking about the potential implications of Bitcoin becoming a legal payment option. Explore payment processing solutions and consider how you might integrate cryptocurrency payments into your operations. Educate Yourself on Bitcoin: Whether or not this bill passes, understanding Bitcoin and other digital assets is becoming increasingly important in our rapidly evolving financial landscape. Take the time to learn about the technology, its potential benefits, and associated risks. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future? North Carolina’s proposed bill is undoubtedly a significant development in the ongoing conversation about cryptocurrency adoption and crypto regulation in the United States. By aiming to recognize Bitcoin -like assets as legal payment , North Carolina is not just following a trend; it’s potentially setting a precedent. This legislative push could ignite further discussions and actions in other states, accelerating the integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. The journey towards widespread cryptocurrency adoption is complex and multifaceted, but initiatives like the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act signal a compelling shift towards a more digitally inclusive financial future.
