Forget dipping your toes in – Jassy believes now is the time for companies to invest “aggressively” in Artificial Intelligence to unlock substantial financial rewards in the years ahead. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors watching the tech landscape, this call to action signifies a potentially massive shift in resource allocation, with implications far beyond just Amazon’s bottom line. Why is Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Pushing for Aggressive AI Investment? Jassy’s annual letter to Amazon shareholders, released this Thursday, wasn’t just a routine update. It was a rallying cry for AI investment . He emphasized that keeping pace with the breakneck speed of AI innovation and meeting the surging customer demand for AI-powered products necessitates “substantial capital.” Amazon itself, he stated, must commit significant resources now to ensure strong returns on its AI investment in the future. This isn’t just about keeping up; it’s about leading the charge in the AI revolution. This urgent plea follows Amazon’s February announcement during its fourth-quarter earnings call, revealing plans for a staggering $100 billion+ in capital expenditures for 2025. The “vast majority” of this colossal sum is earmarked for bolstering AWS AI infrastructure capabilities, as Jassy clarified at the time. He doubled down on his conviction in the shareholder letter, declaring, “We continue to believe AI is a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention of everything we know.” The demand, he noted, is unprecedented, and aggressive AI investment is crucial to serve customers, shareholders, and the business effectively. The Cost of Leading the AI Revolution: Investing in AI Infrastructure Where is all this money going? Jassy pinpointed data centers and chips as the primary drivers of current AI investment expenses. He acknowledged that the upfront costs are significant, but stressed that this infrastructure will yield long-term benefits and become more cost-effective over time. He elaborated on the cost dynamics within AWS, stating, “In AWS, the faster demand grows, the more data centers, chips, and hardware we need to procure (and AI chips are much more expensive than CPU chips). We spend this capital upfront, even though these assets are useful for many years.” This highlights the long-term vision behind Amazon’s AI infrastructure build-out – a strategic move to establish a dominant position in the burgeoning AI market. To illustrate the anticipated decrease in AI infrastructure costs, Jassy highlighted Amazon’s own Trainium2 chips. He asserted that these chips deliver a remarkable 30%-40% improvement in price-performance compared to currently available GPU-powered computing instances. The release of Trainium2 in late 2024 signals Amazon’s commitment to driving down the cost of AI and making it more accessible. Shifting Focus: From AI Training to Inference and Generative AI Jassy further explained that the economic landscape of AI investment is poised to evolve. As training costs for AI models decrease, the focus will increasingly shift towards inference – the process of actually deploying and using AI models. He emphasized Amazon’s urgency in making inference more affordable for customers. Several factors will contribute to this shift: More Price-Performant Chips: Like Trainium2, advancements in chip technology will directly reduce inference costs. Model Distillation: Creating smaller, more efficient models that retain performance. Prompt Caching: Optimizing AI model responses by storing and reusing frequently requested information. Computing Infrastructure Improvements: General advancements in data center technology and efficiency. Model Architecture Enhancements: Developing more streamlined and resource-efficient AI models. Amazon’s commitment to generative AI is also evident. Jassy revealed that Amazon is actively developing over 1,000 generative AI applications. This significant undertaking underscores the company’s belief in the transformative potential of generative AI across various industries and applications. The Explosive Growth of Amazon AI: A Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity The numbers speak volumes. Jassy proudly announced that Amazon’s AI revenue is experiencing “triple-digit” year-over-year growth, translating to a “multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate.” This explosive growth trajectory validates Amazon’s aggressive AI investment strategy and signals the immense market opportunity in the AI sector. For investors in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, this is a clear indicator of where future growth and innovation are concentrated. Bitcoin World has reached out to Amazon for further comment on this significant push into Cloud AI and generative AI technologies. Key Takeaways for Crypto and Tech Investors: AI is the Next Frontier: Amazon’s massive AI investment signals a fundamental shift towards AI as the next major technological revolution. Infrastructure is King: Investing in AI infrastructure , including data centers and specialized chips, is paramount for companies seeking to lead in the AI era. Generative AI is Booming: The rapid growth of generative AI applications presents immense opportunities for innovation and investment. Cloud AI Dominance: Amazon’s focus on AWS Cloud AI reinforces the cloud’s central role in delivering AI solutions to businesses. Long-Term Vision Required: AI investment is a long-term game. Companies need to be prepared for significant upfront costs to reap future rewards. Andy Jassy’s shareholder letter is more than just corporate communication; it’s a strategic roadmap for the future of tech. His forceful endorsement of aggressive AI investment should serve as a wake-up call for businesses across all sectors. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, companies that fail to prioritize AI investment risk being left behind in this transformative era. The message is clear: the AI revolution is here, and it demands bold action and substantial resources.

Speculation now surrounds whether other digital assets like SOL might follow a similar trend. This article reviews the current indicators and evaluates if SOL could realistically see notable growth in the present cautious market environment. Ondo Altcoin: Steady Monthly Growth and Key Level Signals Ondo recorded a strong monthly gain of 9.37% and a six-month rise of 20.75%, with a one-week surge close to 9.18%. Price action remained within a range of $0.60 to $1.10, reflecting gradual but solid accumulation over time. Trends over these periods have shown organic gains and steady investor interest without drastic fluctuations, indicating a phase of healthy market activity. Current prices face a resistance at $1.42 while support holds near $0.41. Indicator readings, including an RSI of 51.27 and a modest momentum of 0.077, point to a balanced market with neither bulls nor bears in full control. The absence of a clear trend creates opportunities for traders to buy near support and sell at resistance, with careful monitoring for any breakout. Solana: Resistance Levels and Current Price Dynamics Solana experienced a decline of approximately 1.87% in the past month, with a more significant drop of around 20% over the last six months. The price fluctuated between roughly 98 and 166 dollars, reflecting short-term corrections alongside ongoing downward pressure. Over this extended period, the coin has struggled to regain upward momentum, facing persistent challenges against rising prices. Currently, Solana trades within a range of $98 to $166, facing immediate resistance near $207 and a stronger barrier around $274. Support is established near $71. Indicators show bears are in control, with negative oscillators and an RSI at 43.5. The lack of a clear trend suggests focusing on range-bound trading strategies within these key levels. Conclusion The recent performance of ONDO suggests growing interest and strong momentum in the market. Investors are now closely watching SOL . If current trends continue, SOL may follow in ONDO's footsteps, potentially seeing increased activity and price action. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

SEI’s sharp 65% price drop has some community members sweating, even as technical indicators hint at an oversold setup. Meanwhile, XRP is caught in a tug-of-war with macroeconomics, where whispers of an emergency Fed rate cut might flip the game for altcoins. But while those two deal with volatility, another name is quietly building something big— Qubetics ($TICS). And the timing couldn’t be more interesting for anyone scanning the market for the best crypto investment in 2025. Enter Qubetics—a project that’s not promising moonshots but offering something a lot more grounded: real-world use. While other tokens play the hype game, Qubetics is flipping the script by solving a key problem most cryptos haven’t cracked—real-world asset tokenization. This isn’t just some theoretical blockchain talk either. Qubetics is building a marketplace where physical and digital assets—from real estate to rare collectibles—can be converted into tradable tokens. That’s a game-changer for communities, businesses, and everyday folks looking for more than just speculative coin flips. And what’s wild? This might just be the early stage of the best crypto investment the market has seen this year. Qubetics: Where Real Assets Meet Web3 Utility Qubetics isn’t just another coin—it’s a full-blown infrastructure play. At its core is a tokenized asset marketplace, where the everyday and extraordinary collide. Picture a small business owner in Texas wanting to raise funds without diving into debt—Qubetics lets them tokenize parts of their commercial property and offer it to early buyers globally. Or imagine an art curator in Brooklyn unlocking liquidity by fractionalizing a six-figure piece of digital art. Qubetics makes that happen—securely, fast, and with real-world impact. And it’s not just for solo users. Enterprises, startups, and real estate groups can tap into the Qubetics ecosystem to unlock cash flow from frozen assets. The platform isn’t confined to a single chain either—it acts as a web3 aggregator, bridging multiple top blockchains for faster, broader asset exposure. That blend of security, cross-chain flexibility, and real-world utility makes Qubetics a standout pick for anyone watching closely for the best crypto investment of this cycle.\ Qubetics Presale: Your Early Access to the Best Crypto Investment The Qubetics presale is heating up—and it’s not hype, it’s all about smart timing and real numbers. The current stage—29th—is priced at $0.1573 per $TICS. In just under 29 weeks, Qubetics has locked in over $15.9 million from the community, selling more than 507 million tokens to over 24,500 active holders. Each stage runs just seven days, ending every Sunday at midnight, and the price jumps by 10% immediately after. That time crunch is fueling serious demand. Now let’s talk ROI. Based on the data, an early adopter throwing in $100 at the current rate gets roughly 636 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that turns into $636—an ROI of 535.65%. If it hits $5, it climbs to 3,078.26%. The bigger projections? $TICS reaching $10 would mean $6,256.47 in value—over 6,000% growth—and $15 per token takes that same $100 to $9,434.71. Whether you’re a casual community member or a serious crypto researcher, these stats prove why the Qubetics presale is being talked about as the best crypto investment right now. SEI Price Plunge Signals Oversold Setup, But Recovery Looks Uncertain SEI’s been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Its price has plunged a staggering 65% so far in 2025, making it one of the worst-performing altcoins this year. A big factor behind the nosedive is fading demand across the board. Right now, SEI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 26.96—a number that screams “oversold” and usually hints at a bounce. But here’s the kicker: the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) isn’t playing along, signaling ongoing bearish momentum. On top of that, SEI is trading below the Ichimoku Cloud, which historically signals resistance and more downside pressure ahead. So while there’s a glimmer of technical hope, the broader outlook suggests SEI could stay under water for a bit longer. And let’s not sugarcoat it—the indicators aren’t offering much relief for short-term gains. For community members hoping for a turnaround, it’s not just about watching charts anymore—it’s about waiting out deeper macro shifts or developer announcements that might jolt sentiment. But as of now, the data leans bearish, and any recovery could be slow and hard-won. In this kind of climate, SEI feels more like a “watch and wait” than a “dive in and buy” scenario. XRP Could Get a Boost if the Fed Makes a Big Move While SEI fights to stay afloat, XRP is being pulled into a bigger economic story. Right now, XRP’s price sits at $1.79, reflecting an 8.9% slide amid rising global tensions—especially after China slapped an 84% tariff on U.S. goods. But here’s the twist: speculation is rising fast that the U.S. Federal Reserve might slash interest rates in an emergency move. If that happens, altcoins like XRP could be the biggest winners. That’s because lower rates usually push more people toward riskier assets, and historically, XRP tends to benefit when liquidity floods back into the market. Forecasts from Polymarket and Kalshi—two major prediction markets—show a jump in confidence that the Fed will act soon. For XRP holders, that could mean a new rally if the central bank does pull the trigger. But until then, XRP’s fate remains closely tied to broader macro signals, not just internal ecosystem moves. It’s not all doom and gloom—it’s more like a waiting game where the prize could be worth it, if timing lines up. One Word: Timing. Qubetics, XRP, and SEI Each Have a Different Clock Here’s the truth—SEI might be oversold, but that doesn’t mean it’s ready to bounce. XRP has macro tailwinds but still needs the Fed to make a move. Meanwhile, Qubetics is carving out a lane of its own, solving actual problems through its tokenized asset marketplace and drawing millions into its structured presale. For those looking for the best crypto investment, now is the time to join this best crypto presale while SEI and XRP ride the uncertainty wave. Qubetics offers the clearest path to calculated, high-upside exposure. It’s not about hype—it’s about real applications and smart timing. So whether you’re tracking news or chasing the next breakout, now might be your chance to join this best crypto presale before the rest of the market catches on. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other crypto projects? Qubetics turns real-world assets like real estate and art into tradable tokens, creating utility beyond price speculation. How much can someone earn by joining the Qubetics presale now? At the current price, ROI ranges from over 500% to more than 9,000% depending on future $TICS value. Why is Qubetics being called the best crypto investment in 2025? It solves real-world problems, connects multiple chains, and its presale structure rewards early adopters, making it a strong contender for the best crypto investment.

That narrowly focused IRS rule, approved in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration, has been formally struck down, according to Representative Mike Carey, an Ohio Republican who backed the effort. And the agency is prevented from pursuing anything like it, according to the Congressional Review Act power used by lawmakers to get rid of the tax regulation. Though the issue was relatively limited, its completion marks the first time a pro-crypto effort has cleared the U.S. Congress. Both the Senate and House of Representatives agreed to reverse the IRS action with strong bipartisan showings, further underlining the crypto sector's strength in this Congress. That could bode well for the industry's chances with other more wide-ranging matters, including legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers and to set market rules for crypto transactions. Trump's signature on the DeFi tax resolution puts that concern for DeFi in the rearview. The next crypto priority in Congress has been stablecoin legislation. Similar bills have passed relevant committees in both the House and Senate and are awaiting floor votes in each chamber. Approvals would start a process to meld the two efforts into one compromise version. The president has called for a bill to arrive on his desk by August, and the lawmakers behind the legislation have said such a timeline is still possible.",Policy|Top Stories|Breaking News|Internal Revenue Service|Donald Trump|U.S. Congress|DeFi,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-10 23:17:21

The often-unpredictable world of cryptocurrency has delivered another jolt. Just when you thought things were settling down, a massive Ethereum whale, slumbering for three long years, has suddenly sprung to life and executed a significant ETH sell-off . This isn’t just pocket change we’re talking about; it’s a whopping $11.8 million worth of Ether that has just entered the market. Let’s dive deep into what this means and why it’s sending ripples through the crypto market . Why is a Dormant Ethereum Whale’s Activity a Big Deal? In the crypto world, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their movements can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of their holdings. A dormant wallet , especially one belonging to a whale, is like a sleeping giant. When it suddenly becomes active after a long period of inactivity, it immediately grabs attention. Here’s why this particular event is noteworthy: Market Impact: Large sell orders, especially from whales, can create downward pressure on prices. When a whale dumps millions of dollars worth of ETH, it can trigger a chain reaction, potentially leading to further sell-offs as other investors react. Market Sentiment Indicator: Whale movements are often seen as indicators of market sentiment. A sudden sell-off by a long-term holder might suggest a change in their outlook on Ethereum’s future prospects. Liquidity Implications: Selling such a large amount of ETH can test the market’s liquidity, especially if executed rapidly. It can reveal the depth of buy orders at various price levels. Speculation and Uncertainty: Dormant wallet activations breed speculation. Why now? What’s the motive? This uncertainty can add volatility to the market. Decoding the $11.8M ETH Sell-Off: What We Know According to the on-chain analytics firm LookOnChain, this particular Ethereum whale wallet, which had been inactive for three years, decided it was time to make a move. Let’s break down the key details of this substantial transaction: Metric Details Amount of ETH Sold 7,974 ETH Value of ETH Sold $11.8 million Selling Price per ETH $1,479 Wallet Inactivity Period 3 years Remaining ETH in Wallet 30,606 ETH Value of Remaining ETH $45.7 million (approximately) Source of Information LookOnChain (via X) The whale executed this massive ETH sell-off over a relatively short period of two hours, indicating a decisive move. Selling at $1,479 per ETH, while potentially below recent peaks, still represents a significant profit for someone who likely acquired ETH years ago, possibly at much lower prices. The fact that the wallet still holds a substantial 30,606 ETH suggests this might be a partial profit-taking move rather than a complete exit from Ethereum. Analyzing the Blockchain Transaction: Tracing the Whale’s Move The beauty of blockchain technology is its transparency. We can actually track these large transactions and gain insights into the whale’s activity. By examining the transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, we can potentially see: Destination of Funds: Where did the sold ETH go? Was it moved to exchanges, other wallets, or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms? Tracking the flow of funds can provide clues about the whale’s intentions. Transaction Patterns: Are there multiple smaller transactions or a few large ones? The pattern of transactions can indicate whether the whale is trying to minimize market impact or is in a hurry to sell. Wallet History: Looking back at the wallet’s transaction history might reveal previous buying or selling patterns, offering context to this recent activity. Tools like Etherscan and other blockchain explorers allow anyone to delve into these details and become a crypto detective of sorts! Potential Reasons Behind the Whale’s Sudden Activity Why would a dormant wallet suddenly wake up and execute such a large crypto sell-off after three years? There could be several reasons, ranging from personal financial needs to strategic market maneuvers: Profit Taking: After years of holding, the whale might see the current price levels as an attractive opportunity to realize substantial profits. Market Concerns: The whale might have concerns about the current state of the crypto market, macroeconomic factors, or Ethereum specifically, prompting them to reduce their holdings. Portfolio Rebalancing: This could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy, shifting funds to other asset classes or cryptocurrencies. Personal Circumstances: Life events or financial obligations could necessitate the liquidation of crypto assets. Strategic Market Move: In more speculative scenarios, some might suggest whales intentionally create sell pressure to trigger price dips, potentially to buy back in at lower levels or to manipulate the market for other trading strategies. It’s important to remember that without direct insight into the whale’s intentions, any explanation remains speculative. However, analyzing on-chain data and market context can help us make informed deductions. Impact on the Crypto Market and What to Watch For While a single whale’s ETH sell-off might not trigger a catastrophic market crash, it’s certainly a noteworthy event, especially in the currently sensitive crypto market environment. Here’s what to keep an eye on: Price Action: Monitor Ethereum’s price movement in the coming hours and days. Did the sell-off trigger a significant price dip? Is there a recovery? Trading Volume: Increased trading volume around this event could indicate heightened market activity and volatility. Whale Activity: Are other large holders showing similar selling behavior? A cluster of whale sell-offs could signal a broader shift in sentiment. Market Sentiment: Gauge the overall market sentiment. Are investors becoming more cautious or fearful in response to this and other market events? Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Investors Learn? This event serves as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep track of on-chain data and whale movements. Services like LookOnChain and Nansen provide valuable insights into these activities. Manage Risk: Diversification and risk management are crucial in crypto. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and be prepared for market volatility. Understand Market Dynamics: Whale activity is just one factor influencing the market. Stay informed about broader economic trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the crypto space. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term price fluctuations are common, maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments, especially if you believe in the underlying technology and potential. Conclusion: The Whale Has Spoken – What’s Next for Ethereum? The sudden awakening of a dormant Ethereum whale and the subsequent $11.8 million ETH sell-off has injected a dose of intrigue and volatility into the crypto market. While the exact reasons behind this move remain a mystery, it underscores the significant influence that large holders can wield. As we move forward, keeping a close watch on market reactions, further whale activity, and broader market trends will be crucial. The crypto narrative is ever-evolving, and events like these are pivotal chapters in its ongoing story. Will this be a minor ripple or the start of a bigger wave? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the crypto seas remain fascinatingly unpredictable.

The US, the EU, and the UK have since imposed sanctions on Russian trading companies and banks, which they have also disconnected from the SWIFT network. Officially, Russian trade firms must use the Central Bank’s sandbox program to conduct cross-border trade in crypto. However, scores of companies are widely thought to be trading outside the sandbox, apparently with Moscow’s unspoken blessing. This has led to uncertainty in the sector, however. Many companies are still reluctant to use crypto, as tokens are still largely unregulated in Russia.

ETE noted that “sanctions against Russian financial institutions hinder settlements with foreign suppliers.” It claimed that payments between firms in Russia and China often face delays, ranging “from five days to several months.” Similar situations are also frequent in trade deals between Russia and Kazakhstan, the company added. ETE said that the length of the delays “extends with each new sanctions package.” Russia-Kazakhstan payments take “at least two to three weeks” to complete, “depending on the payment code, the recipient bank, and accompanying documents,” the firm said. ETE explained: “The situation today is complicated by the inclusion of not only large Chinese banks in America’s [sanctions regime scrutiny], but also municipal institutions. The slightest suspicion of a payer’s connection with Russia will lead to the credit institution refusing to credit the payment to the recipient’s bank account and returning it. This process can take anything from two or three weeks to several months.” The firm remarked that Russian law stipulates that crypto “cannot be used to pay for goods, since the ruble remains the [sole] official currency.” The investment firm VanEck this week claimed it had seen evidence that Russia and China are using Bitcoin (BTC) to settle energy trade payments .

The financial winds are shifting, and it’s sending ripples through the cryptocurrency market. We’re seeing a significant surge in traditional finance that could spell volatility for digital assets. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield has just hit 4.855%, a notable jump that’s making investors rethink their strategies. What does this mean for your Bitcoin and crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into this developing situation and unpack what it signifies for the future of digital gold and beyond. What’s Driving the Treasury Yield Surge? Before we delve into the implications for Bitcoin , let’s understand what’s fueling this rise in Treasury yields. A Treasury yield is essentially the return an investor receives for holding U.S. government debt. When yields rise, it generally indicates a few key things: Economic Outlook: Rising yields can suggest expectations of stronger economic growth and potentially higher inflation in the future. Federal Reserve Policy: Actions and signals from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates significantly influence Treasury yields. Investor Sentiment: Changes in investor confidence and risk appetite play a crucial role. Currently, the increase points towards a growing risk-off sentiment . In simple terms, when investors anticipate higher returns from safer assets like U.S. Treasuries, they might become less inclined to invest in riskier assets. This is where cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, come into the picture. The Bitcoin Connection: Why Treasury Yields Matter for Crypto You might be wondering, “Why should I care about Treasury yields when I’m focused on Bitcoin and crypto?” The answer lies in how investors perceive risk and allocate capital. Here’s the crux of the matter: Opportunity Cost: As Treasury yields climb, they offer a more attractive, low-risk return compared to the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies. This increases the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin and other digital assets. Risk-Off Trade: A rising Treasury yield often coincides with a broader “risk-off” trade in financial markets. Investors tend to move away from riskier assets like equities and cryptocurrencies and towards safer havens like government bonds. Dollar Strength: Higher yields can strengthen the U.S. dollar, which historically has had an inverse relationship with Bitcoin. A stronger dollar can sometimes put downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. To illustrate this point, consider the following table which simplifies the typical investor behavior during periods of rising Treasury yields: Asset Class Investor Behavior During Rising Treasury Yields Impact U.S. Treasuries Increased demand due to higher returns and lower risk Price may stabilize or slightly increase; Yields remain high Bitcoin & Cryptocurrencies Decreased demand as investors seek safer returns Potential price correction or stagnation Equities (Stocks) Reduced demand due to increased attractiveness of bonds Potential market downturn or reduced growth Real Estate May face pressure due to rising borrowing costs Potential slowdown in market activity Decoding Risk-Off Sentiment: What Does It Mean for Your Investments? The current rise in Treasury yields is largely attributed to growing risk-off sentiment in the market. But what exactly does this mean? Risk-off sentiment emerges when investors become more cautious and apprehensive about the economic outlook or potential market instability. This can be triggered by various factors, including: Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events and political instability can fuel risk aversion. Economic Data: Disappointing economic indicators or fears of recession can increase risk-off sentiment. Inflation Concerns: Persistent high inflation can lead investors to seek safer assets. When risk-off sentiment prevails, investors typically flock to assets perceived as safe havens. Historically, these have included: Government Bonds: U.S. Treasuries are a prime example. Gold: Often seen as a store of value during economic uncertainty. Cash: Holding cash becomes more attractive when risk is elevated. In contrast, assets like cryptocurrencies, which are still considered relatively new and volatile, tend to underperform during periods of risk aversion. This is because they are viewed as higher-risk investments, and investors prefer to reduce their exposure to such assets when uncertainty increases. Navigating Investment Risk in a High-Yield Environment So, what should crypto investors do in light of rising Treasury yields and growing investment risk aversion? Here are some actionable insights: Portfolio Review: Assess your current crypto portfolio and consider your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with potential short-term volatility? Diversification: Ensure your investment portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes. Don’t put all your eggs in the crypto basket. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic indicators, Federal Reserve announcements, and market sentiment shifts. News outlets like CNBC are crucial for staying updated. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider employing a DCA strategy, especially if you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and crypto. This involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market cycles are natural. While rising Treasury yields might create short-term headwinds for crypto, the long-term fundamentals of blockchain technology and digital assets remain compelling for many. Future Outlook: Will Market Sentiment Shift? Predicting the future of financial markets is never an exact science, but understanding the interplay of factors like Treasury yields, market sentiment , and global economic conditions is crucial. Whether the current risk-off sentiment will persist or shift depends on a multitude of variables. Keep an eye on: Inflation Data: Will inflation continue to be elevated, or will it start to cool down? Central Bank Actions: How will the Federal Reserve and other central banks respond to inflation and economic growth? Geopolitical Landscape: Will geopolitical tensions escalate or de-escalate? Technological Advancements: Continued innovation and adoption within the crypto space could bolster long-term prospects, despite short-term market fluctuations. Conclusion: Staying Vigilant in the Crypto Space The rise in the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield to 4.855% is more than just a number; it’s a signal of changing tides in the financial world. For crypto investors, it serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of traditional and digital finance. While risk-off sentiment and higher yields can create short-term challenges for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, understanding these dynamics empowers you to make informed decisions and navigate the ever-evolving landscape with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and remember that in the world of crypto, knowledge is your most powerful asset.

With the new act signed into law, Nigeria has positioned itself as the digital finance leader in Africa. Regulatory Clarity After Years of Uncertainty and Tension In a landmark legal shift, Nigerian lawmakers have finally recognised cryptocurrencies as securities. Nigeria’s President, Bola Tinubu, recently added digital assets to the Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 2024, which repeals the Investments and Securities Act No. 29 of 2007. According to Forbes Africa and local Nigerian news agency Business Day reports , Nigeria’s new capital markets law officially classifies crypto and other virtual assets as securities for the first time. The landmark legislation is expected to provide greater transparency and increased investments. The legislation is welcomed after Nigeria faced years of regulatory uncertainty and tension between its government and the burgeoning crypto sector. On February 1, 2021, supported by concerns over money laundering, terrorism financing, and lack of consumer protection, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a directive prohibiting financial institutions from facilitating crypto transactions. The outright ban evoked public outrage, especially among the country’s tech-savvy youth, who have increasingly turned to crypto as an alternative store of value amid high inflation, economic instability and uncertainty. Despite the prohibitive ban from the government, Nigeria emerged as the largest cryptocurrency market in Africa by market volume as citizens, spurred by necessity, kept finding creative ways to bypass government restrictions through peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. The persistent demands and growing global adoption rate of digital assets forced the government to reconsider its position, culminating in the enactment of ISA 2024. Relaxing Crypto Bans In December 2022, the Nigerian Central Bank (CBN) published strict guidelines for banks and financial institutions opening crypto accounts. The guidelines were issued after the CBN lifted the ban on banks’ operation accounts for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). At the time, the CNB recognized the need to revise its 2021 policy, stating: “However current trends globally have shown that there is need to regulate the activities of virtual assets service providers (VASPs), which include cryptocurrencies and crypto assets.” Just days after the CBN issued a comprehensive ban on banks engaging with crypto, the CBN revised its restrictions on banks facilitating crypto transactions. After a nearly two-year comprehensive ban on banks’ involvement with digital currencies, the CBN relaxed its restrictions by allowing crypto firms to open bank accounts with Nigerian banks. Nigeria boast one of the highest rates of crypto adoption and forced the CBN to revise its stance toward digital assets. Bringing Cryptocurrencies Under the Purview of the SEC According to Forbes’ reporting, “the new law provides long-awaited regulatory clarity, bringing Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), Digital Asset Operators (DAOPs), and Digital Asset Exchanges under the direct oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).” Nigerian financial analyst Olumide Adesina spoke to Forbes Africa, highlighting the importance of this legislation, stating: “The regulation brings clarity and affirms the input of digital assets in the Nigerian capital market.” Adesina adds: “The law would likely attract huge players in the global industry to engage directly by setting up a physical presence with Africa’s biggest crypto market. Finally, it will also widen tokenization usage built on traditional assets and intensify interest among the younger populace.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The recovery was aided by technical support near Bitcoin’s 365-day moving average at approximately $76.1K. Despite this technical rebound, overall investor sentiment remains weak. Looking ahead, Bitcoin may face resistance around $84K and $96K, suggesting that any rally is still vulnerable to reversal if bullish conditions do not continue to improve. An April 10 CryptoQuant Report showed that crypto markets experienced renewed volatility this week as the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause by President Trump temporarily alleviated escalating trade tensions, while overall bullish sentiment remains subdued. Early in the week, the uncertainty driven by retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and the EU pushed Bitcoin into a sharp sell-off, dropping its price from approximately $84K to a five-month low near $74K. Digital Assets Sensitive to International Policy Shifts This decline was a direct response to the escalating trade war, underlining the sensitivity of the digital asset market to international policy shifts. Following the initial plunge, prices rebounded shortly after on April 9. President Trump’s tariff pause announcement, which applies a universal 10% tariff on all countries except China—where tariffs were increased to 125%—played an important role in restoring investor confidence and recovering much of the lost value. Global markets responded sharply after @POTUS announced a major escalation in his trade stance toward China. #Tariffs #Trump https://t.co/GDJxWUZDdg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 9, 2025 Technical analysis shows that Bitcoin’s price bounce was supported by its 365-day moving average (MA) , which currently stands at around $76.1K. Past observations in August 2024, July 2021, and December 2021 further confirm that a sustained drop below the 365-day MA could signal the commencement of a prolonged bear market. Market Sentiment Remains Notably Pessimistic, Says CryptoQuant While Bitcoin found temporary stability above this average, caution persists among traders regarding its long-term implications. Despite the technical rebound, market sentiment remains notably pessimistic. According to CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index, Bitcoin currently registers a reading of 10, its lowest since November 2022. This depressed score reflects an overall cautious investor outlook and indicates a low probability of an enduring rally, suggesting that the recent recovery might be more of a short-term correction than the onset of a bullish trend. CryptoQuant reports should this score continue to linger below the 40 mark, market conditions could resemble those seen in previous bearish cycles. Looking ahead, if Bitcoin’s upward trajectory sustains, it may encounter resistance at near-term price levels of around $84K and subsequently at the $96K zone. These resistance levels have historically served as markers within this trading cycle, potentially acting as barriers should the present rally fail to translate into a sustained shift in market sentiment. Overall, while the tariff pause has provided a temporary breather, the market remains cautious, eagerly awaiting more robust bullish signals.

Here’s why these are the best cryptos to buy in 2025 for outsized gains. 1. XRP (Ripple) Current Price: ~$2.12 2025 Target: $106 (50x) Potential ROI: 5,000% XRP is an old-timer with new energy. After settlement with the SEC it is trading for $2.12, with analysts targeting $10–$15 as a conservative target. A parabolic 50x rise toward $106 could happen if ETF approval does hit and institutional adoption continues expanding. It maintains a formidable choice for cross-border payments at 1,500 transactions per second speed. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (Presale) Current Price: $0.0002804 Listing Price: $0.007 2025 Target: $0.014 (50x from listing) Potential ROI: 4,900% (from current presale) The Presale Star For 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE. Having already secured $5.7M and more than 10,000 holders, it’s going to launch at $0.007 — a 2,397% increase from its current price of $0.0002804. Traders are predicting a huge price increase to $0.014 by the end of the year, a whopping 50x from its listing price, both due to its DeFi lending model and hype as the classic best altcoin with 100x potential. 3. SHIBA INU (SHIB) Current Price: ~$0.00002 2025 Target: $0.001 Potential ROI: 4,900% While SHIB never became a moonshot, its massive community — along with token-burning efforts — keeps it ever in play. While a 50x rally to $0.001 is some way to go, it remains a top meme coin to keep a close eye on if meme coin mania returns. 4. Solana (SOL) Current Price: ~$119 2025 Target: $5,950 Potential ROI: 4,900% With Solana’s high throughput chain and institutional support, $450+ is conservative. This would take a 50x from the moonshot to $5,950, but it is a serious contender as it boasts strong fundamentals of its own. 5. Pepecoin (PEPE) Current Price: ~$0.0000014 2025 Target: $0.00007 Potential ROI: 4,900% PEPE is a meme coin that lives and dies by meme coin volatility. The price of $0.00007 would represent a 50x rise from $0.000014 and speculation is as high as prices of $0.00007 in 2025 assuming that the community hype and momentum build from in the crypto market. 6. Cardano (ADA) Current Price: ~$0.80 2025 Target: $40 Potential ROI: 4,900% The ecosystem for smart contracts on Cardano is expanding. $0.951 may be a base prediction, but a 50x leap to $40 is possible with some breakthroughs in adoption. 7. Hedera (HBAR) Current Price: ~$0.10 2025 Target: $5 Potential ROI: 4,900 At $0.10, HBAR’s enterprise-grade blockchain is undervalued. A $5 price is a steep climb 50x, but not impossible with broader corporate adoption. 8. Chainlink (LINK) Current Price: ~$13 2025 Target: $650 Potential ROI: 4,900% Chainlink’s privacy oracle network is vital for DeFi. A huge bull run would be required for the price to 50x to $650, but it has utility that could bear big upside. 9. Stellar (XLM) Current Price: ~$0.12 2025 Target: $6 Potential ROI: 4,900% XLM’s focus on cheap, fast payments mirrors XRP. A 50x leap to $6 could materialize with global remittance growth. 10. Kaspa (KAS) Current Price: ~$0.18 2025 Target: $9 Potential ROI: 4,900% Kaspa’s innovative blockDAG tech is flying under the radar. A 50x surge to $9 is within reach if adoption accelerates. Final Thoughts OVER +2532% ROI – ACT NOW – PRESALE SELLING OUT That’s why XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE top this list. XRP delivers calm with big opportunity, MAGACOIN FINANCE still in presale under $0.0003 is the ultimate low-bore shot to be in crypto under $1 with upside. SHIB, SOL, and PEPE are meme and tech-friendly, while ADA, HBAR, LINK, XLM, and KAS are underrated gems. In 2025, you could be enjoying your 50x all thanks to presale prices like MAGACOIN FINANCE—act quickly as we know presales never last!

In a new YouTube video , Cowen tells his 891,000 subscribers that ETH’s recent price points look like a 10x reflection of what it tracked six years ago. “Ethereum’s going through the same structure that it went through in 2019, but the reason why the cycle feels so different is because it has taken place over a much longer period of time. But there’s a reason why it’s taking place over a much longer period of time, and the reason is that quantitative tightening has lasted a lot longer. Remember last cycle, QT ended in the pre-halving year. We’re now not that far from being halfway through the post-halving year and QT still hasn’t ended, but it probably will within the next few months.” Quantitative tightening (QT) is when central banks shrink their budgets to reduce the amount of money circulation in the economy as a means of countering inflation. Cowen says a document summarizing a Federal Open Market Committee meeting in January suggests the U.S. Federal Reserve might end QT by mid-2025. Ethereum is trading at $1,652 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 12% in the past 24 hours. ?

43191000,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-to-ship-10000-miners-by-2025-while-fartcoin-defies-bear-market-doge-dips-to-monthly-low/,1744329644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/43191000.jpeg,"BlockDAG To Ship 10,000+ Miners By 2025 While Fartcoin Defies Bear Market & DOGE Dips To Monthly Low",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-to-ship-10000-miners-by-2025-while-fartcoin-defies-bear-market-doge-dips-to-monthly-low/,"In a market dominated by volatility, three distinct crypto narratives are emerging. Fartcoin, a meme token on Solana, has defied the broader downtrend with a 135% YTD gain and strong on-chain signals like reduced exchange balances and resilient whale holdings. Dogecoin, despite falling 20% in 24 hours, is perched at a crucial support level, with technicals hinting at a possible rebound. But while both coins stir short-term speculation, BlockDAG is quietly rewriting what early-stage execution looks like. With over 10,000 X-Series miners ready to deploy and a $212M+ presale already 2,380% up, BDAG isn’t waiting for market sentiment—it’s building its own demand engine. Real utility, hardware integration, and strategic exchange listings put it in a category beyond hype. In a crowd of maybes, BlockDAG looks like the first crypto of 2025 that’s walking the talk. Fartcoin Defies Market Crash—Is a 160% Rally to $1.22 Coming Soon? Fartcoin is showing strength as markets tumble, rising 35% from its monthly low to trade at $0.4755. While major coins like Bitcoin and Solana declined, Fartcoin has jumped 135% from its year-to-date low. On-chain data suggests growing investor confidence. Exchange balances have dropped 3.62% in a week, and 2 million FART coins have moved to self-custody—signaling reduced sell pressure. With over 113,000 holders staying firm and top profit wallets holding their positions, bullish sentiment remains intact. Technically, the chart shows a forming cup and handle pattern, a signal that could drive the price to $1.22—around 160% above current levels. However, a drop below $0.355 would cancel the bullish case and open room for a fall to $0.20. For now, Fartcoin stands out in a weak market, and all eyes are on whether it can break out. Dogecoin Falls to $0.13—Is a Major Rebound Just Around the Corner? Dogecoin dropped over 20% in the past 24 hours, sliding to $0.1300 as the crypto market reels from broader sell-offs. Still, analysts say this level is critical. If DOGE holds here, it could mark the base for a future rally. Momentum indicators like the MACD and RSI are showing early signs of recovery, with RSI bouncing back above 50 and MACD flipping bullish. Short-term resistance lies at $0.1400–$0.1450, while a dip below $0.1350 could trigger further losses. DOGE’s performance is closely tied to Bitcoin, which means its next move depends heavily on overall market sentiment. Traders are watching for stability and volume to confirm any bounce. For buyers eyeing a discount entry, this could be a key setup—if DOGE holds the line, it may signal the start of a sharp reversal. BlockDAG to Ship 10,000 Miners—Is This Your Last Chance to Mine BDAG Before It Explodes? BlockDAG is gearing up for a major milestone with nearly 10,000 X-Series miners—X30 and X100—ready for global shipment ahead of its mainnet launch. This marks a key step in expanding the project’s infrastructure and community access. The X30 is tailored for home users, quietly mining up to 600 BDAG daily with low power use. For high-volume mining, the X100 delivers up to 2,000 BDAG per day, making it an ideal choice for serious miners looking to maximize returns. With BDAG currently priced at just $0.0248 and a $1 target forecasted for 2025, miners could see returns as high as 3,900%. So far, BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $212.5 million, with 19+ billion BDAG coins sold across 27 batches. Since launching at $0.001, BDAG has surged 2,380%, and prices continue climbing with each new batch. As exchange listings approach and hardware rolls out, this could be the most strategic moment to enter. For anyone asking what the best crypto to mine in 2025 is, BlockDAG’s fast-paced delivery, real utility, and bullish projections make it a front-runner worth serious attention. Takeaway Dogecoin may still ride the meme wave, and Fartcoin could surprise with short-term gains, but neither has matched BlockDAG’s combination of infrastructure, tokenomics, and user growth. While Doge awaits momentum and Fartcoin relies on market sentiment, BlockDAG is deploying hardware, running a live testnet, and preparing for CEX listings—transforming itself from presale hype into operational reality. With miners earning up to 2,000 BDAG daily and prices at just $0.0248, the opportunity window is narrowing. Should BDAG hit its projected $1 target, early miners and buyers could realize gains of nearly 4,000%. This isn’t just a speculative swing—it’s a coordinated roadmap supported by product delivery and ecosystem incentives. For anyone eyeing serious upside in 2025, BlockDAG offers more than a token—it offers a head start in a network already gaining traction. In the race ahead, BDAG may not just keep up—it could lead.

43190766,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=708670,1744329650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43190766.jpeg,Perpetual futures may soon hit U.S. markets as Trump-era crypto shift gains steam,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/perpetual-futures-may-soon-hit-u-s-markets/,"Perpetual futures contracts—a mainstay of offshore digital asset exchanges—may finally become accessible to U.S.-based traders under regulated platforms. Industry experts say that a regulatory shift under President Donald Trump’s administration is clearing the way for these high-risk instruments to be available in the U.S. market for the first time. Perpetual futures , also known as “perps,” enable investors to bet on cryptocurrency’s price without having the underlying assets. These contracts don’t expire like traditional futures and are settled every eight hours, which allows them to track spot prices closely. They also provide traders with an option to leverage position up to 100 times—an alluring option to risk-on retail investors. In global terms, perps control cryptocurrency trading volume, frequently comprising the greater portion of the action on exchanges like Binance, where daily volumes can surpass $70 billion, vastly outdoing spot market activity. Yet, due to their prevalence, regulators ban these instruments from U.S. retail investors. That may soon change. On March 28, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced the withdrawal of two long-standing staff advisories, widely speculated as a further alignment of the regulatory treatment of crypto-derivatives and traditional financial products. Separately, Coinbase Derivatives, part of crypto giant Coinbase Global Inc., has said it is working to bring perpetual-style futures contracts to the U.S. in what would be a first-of-its-kind offering in that country. Trump’s policies speed up regulatory easing Regions say that President Trump’s administration has brought a clear break from the hard-line posture of its predecessors. In recent months, officials have dismissed several lawsuits against crypto companies, hosted a White House summit on digital assets, and even trained national token reserves. Trump has also expressed support for stablecoins, allowing for a more permissive approach toward the wider digital asset framework. Legal experts say an upcoming change is in sight. The clear direction of travel was toward the U.S. permitting crypto-based derivatives, so in his view, it was only a matter of time, said Gabe Rosenberg, partner at law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Having been introduced by BitMEX in 2016, perpetual futures have long been a favorite instrument for offshore investors and those wanting exposure to crypto without holding the digital assets themselves. They also provide improved hedging capabilities, as traders are not required to roll over contracts regularly. Adam McCarthy, an analyst at Kaiko, said that the perps market has been the heart of crypto speculation and pricing for almost a decade. U.S.-based crypto platforms are gearing up for a derivatives rush with the opening of the regulatory door. It is also in advanced discussions to acquire the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, one of the largest in the world, in a deal that would value the company at between $4 billion and $5 billion. Kraken, a competing exchange, indicated its ambitions in the futures space when it recently announced its $1.5 billion acquisition of retail trading outfit NinjaTrader. Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, noted that perpetual futures represent a simple and accessible mechanism for users to speculate with leverage. He pointed to the thrills of meme stocks, zero-day options, and weekly expiries as near-definitive evidence of the appetite for U.S. retail investment risk moving upward on an upward trajectory. Institutional players are also closely observing. The instruments could represent a “great unlock” for larger firms, as they would fit with existing risk and operational frameworks, said Jason Urban, global head of trading at Galaxy Digital. Retail investors challenge regulatory barriers as demand grows There are questions about how U.S. regulators will deal with perps and the risks that are part and parcel of using them, especially with a retail audience. They said any approval framework should include leverage caps, position limits, and other risk controls. While institutional entities can legally swap crypto on registered exchanges, retail remains heavily restricted, Rosenberg tweeted. The main problem, he added, is the lack of clear legislation over what’s eligible for margin and the long-term regulatory certainty. In addition, perps are competing for investor attention with other U.S.-regulated crypto products, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and CME futures. ETFs provide a passive way to get crypto exposure but don’t provide the leverage and immediacy of perpetual futures. Finally, leveraged ETFs afford daily balancing/rebalancing and transaction fees, which will eat into returns over time. Newhouse noted the active trader as the main target market in this case (passive investors already have sufficient coverage in the ETF), adding that real-time market exposure seekers would find perps more cost-effective and efficient. Although some Americans already access perps through VPNs and offshore accounts, the real opportunity lies in attracting new flows through regulated domestic platforms. As regulatory signals get more positive and market infrastructure develops frenzied, it’s only a matter of time before American investors are given legal access to the core of the global crypto derivatives market.

In a Thursday letter to Blanche, six Senate Democrats — Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) — blasted his decision to cut the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) as “giv[ing] a free pass to cryptocurrency money launderers.” The Senators called Blanche’s directive that DOJ staff no longer pursue cases against crypto exchanges, mixers or offline wallets “for the acts of their end users” or bring criminal charges for regulatory violations in cases involving crypto, including violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), “nonsensical.” “By abdicating DOJ’s responsibility to enforce federal criminal law when violations involve digital assets, you are suggesting that virtual currency exchanges, mixers, and other entities dealing in digital assets need not fulfill their [anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism] obligations, creating a systemic vulnerability in the digital assets sector,” the lawmakers wrote. “Drug traffickers, terrorists, fraudsters, and adversaries will exploit this vulnerability on a large scale.” In his memo to DOJ staff on Monday evening, Blanche cited U.S. President Donald Trump’s January executive order on crypto, which promised to bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry, as the reason for his decision. “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator,” Blanche wrote, adding that the agency will “no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that have the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets while President Trump's actual regulators do this work outside the punitive criminal justice framework.” Instead, Blanche urged DOJ staff to focus their enforcement efforts on prosecuting criminals who use “victimize digital asset investors” or those who use crypto in the furtherance of other criminal schemes, like organized crime, gang financing, and terrorism. Read more: DOJ Axes Crypto Unit As Trump’s Regulatory Pullback Continues For the Senate Democrats, however, Blanche’s claim doesn’t quite cut the mustard. “You claim in your memo that DOJ will continue to prosecute those who use cryptocurrencies to perpetrate crimes. But allowing the entities that enable these crimes — such as cryptocurrency kiosk operators — to operate outside the federal regulatory framework without fear of prosecution will only result in more Americans being exploited,” the lawmakers wrote. The lawmakers urged Blanche to reconsider his decision to dismantle NCET, calling it a “critical resource for state and local law enforcement who often lack the technical knowledge and skill to investigate cryptocurrency related crimes.” New York Attorney General Letitia James raised similar concerns in her own letter to Congress on Thursday, urging lawmakers to pass federal legislation to regulate the crypto markets. Though her letter itself made no mention of Blanche’s memo or the shuttering of NCET, a press release from her office highlighted that her letter “comes after the [DOJ] announced the dismantling of federal criminal cryptocurrency fraud enforcement, making a robust regulatory framework all the more critical.”",Policy|Sen.

The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance shared the guidance for issuers urging clear disclosures for business description, risk factors, and financial statements. SEC Drops Fresh Guidance For Issuers Of Crypto Asset Securities The US SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance has released disclosure requirements for securities in crypto-asset markets. According to the press release , the Division notes that disclosure requirements are mere guidance for issuers designed to smoothen the curve for market participants. Under the requirements, the US SEC urges securities issuers to describe their businesses in clear language. Per the guidance, the issuers should disclose information on revenue generation, timelines for network development, procedures for validating transactions, and network governance procedures. Furthermore, the US SEC makes a case for specifying risk factors relating to the issuer’s business operations. Other risk disclosures will relate to the security, its volatility, liquidity, and supply. The Division specifies a “materially complete description” of the securities with issuers urged to spell out the rights of holders. Per the guidance, information around the technical specifications revolving around the crypto asset divisibility and smart contract functionalities. The Division’s guidance comes on the heels of the US Senate confirming Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. According to the division, the guidance will serve as a stopgap for issuers pending proper regulations by the Crypto Task Force. Securities Watchdog Provides Securities Clarity For Cryptocurrencies The Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Pierce, is spearheading the push for disclosure requirements for securities issuers. However, Pierce declared support for the new guidance by the Division of Corporation Finance. “We’re not saying your crypto assets are securities, but if they are (and we’re working on clarifying that) or your company is involved in the cryptocurrencies, here’s some disclosure guidance,” said Pierce on X. The disclosure guidance extends to financial statements, exhibits, and details of significant employees. The US SEC has rolled out an avalanche of securities clarifications since the start of the year. Last week, the SEC clarified that dollar-backed 1:1 stablecoins are not securities since they are used primarily for payments. Previously, the US SEC exempted proof-of-work mining from securities obligations. In a remarkable development, the SEC clarified that securities regulations do not apply to memecoins.

Imagine a world where your AI chatbot remembers your past conversations, making interactions feel incredibly personal and efficient. That future is closer than ever as OpenAI rolls out a groundbreaking ChatGPT memory feature . This update promises to transform how we interact with AI, offering a more tailored and relevant experience. Let’s dive into what this personalized AI means for you and the future of conversational technology. Unveiling the Revolutionary ChatGPT Memory Feature OpenAI has just dropped a game-changer: ChatGPT memory feature , designed to make your conversations with the AI chatbot feel more natural and context-aware. Forget repeating details in every new chat – ChatGPT can now reference your previous interactions to provide more relevant and personalized responses. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental shift towards creating a truly conversational and intuitive AI chatbot experience. Here’s a breakdown of what this exciting update brings: Contextual Conversations: ChatGPT will now consider your past chats when responding, eliminating the need to re-explain context repeatedly. Personalized Responses: Expect answers tailored to your specific needs and preferences based on your conversation history. This moves beyond generic responses towards truly personalized AI interactions. Enhanced Features: The memory feature enhances text, voice, and even image generation within ChatGPT, providing a more cohesive and integrated experience. User Control: Worried about privacy? OpenAI provides robust controls. You can disable the memory feature, manage specific saved memories, or use Temporary Chats for conversations you don’t want stored. How Does the ChatGPT Memory Feature Work? The core idea is simple yet powerful: ChatGPT learns from your conversations, just like you would in a human interaction. Instead of treating each chat as a fresh start, ChatGPT now retains context from prior discussions. This allows for a smoother, more efficient, and ultimately more human-like dialogue. Think of it as building a rapport with your AI chatbot over time. Let’s illustrate with an example: Without Memory: User: “I’m interested in learning about Bitcoin mining. Can you explain it?” ChatGPT: “Bitcoin mining is the process… [explains Bitcoin mining]” User (in a new chat): “What are the energy consumption concerns related to Bitcoin?” ChatGPT: “Bitcoin mining does consume a significant amount of energy… [explains energy concerns]” With Memory: User: “I’m interested in learning about Bitcoin mining. Can you explain it?” ChatGPT: “Bitcoin mining is the process… [explains Bitcoin mining]” User (in a new chat): “What are the energy consumption concerns related to Bitcoin?” ChatGPT: “Building on our previous conversation about Bitcoin mining, you’re right to be concerned about energy consumption… [explains energy concerns, referencing the prior topic]” See the difference? With the ChatGPT memory feature , the second interaction is more fluid and connected to the first. This subtle shift drastically improves the user experience, making ChatGPT feel less like a tool and more like a helpful assistant. Who Gets to Experience Personalized AI First? Initially, the ChatGPT memory feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus subscribers. However, there’s a geographical caveat. Users in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland will have to wait a bit longer due to pending regulatory reviews. OpenAI has assured these regions that they are working towards compliance and aim to bring the feature to them eventually. For free ChatGPT users, there’s no immediate news. OpenAI is currently focused on the paid tiers, but hopefully, this powerful personalized AI feature will become widely accessible in the future. Privacy and Control: Addressing Concerns Understandably, some users might be wary of an AI chatbot storing their conversation history. OpenAI has proactively addressed these privacy concerns by providing users with significant control over the ChatGPT memory feature . Here’s how you can manage your ChatGPT memory: Opt-Out: You can completely disable the memory feature in ChatGPT’s settings. Manage Memories: You can view and delete specific saved memories, giving you granular control over what ChatGPT retains. Temporary Chats: For sensitive or private conversations, use the Temporary Chat option. These chats are not stored and won’t contribute to ChatGPT’s memory. Inquire About Memory: You can even ask ChatGPT directly, “What do you remember about me?” to see what information it has stored. These controls are crucial for building trust and ensuring users feel comfortable with this new level of conversational AI personalization. ChatGPT Memory vs. Google Gemini Memory: A Quick Comparison It’s worth noting that Google Gemini also introduced a similar memory feature earlier this year. While both aim to enhance user experience through contextual awareness, there might be subtle differences in implementation and capabilities. Both updates signal a broader industry trend towards more sophisticated and user-centric AI chatbot interactions. Feature OpenAI ChatGPT Memory Google Gemini Memory Availability (Initial Rollout) ChatGPT Pro/Plus users (excluding some European regions) Gemini users (specific tiers and regions may vary) User Control Opt-out, manage specific memories, temporary chats Likely similar controls, details may vary Integration Text, voice, and image generation Likely multi-modal as well Purpose Personalize conversations, improve context relevance Personalize conversations, improve context relevance The Future of Conversational AI is Here OpenAI’s update to include a ChatGPT memory feature is more than just a minor improvement; it’s a significant leap forward in the evolution of conversational AI . By enabling ChatGPT to remember past interactions, OpenAI is paving the way for more intuitive, efficient, and genuinely helpful AI assistants. This move towards personalized AI promises to reshape how we interact with technology, making AI less transactional and more conversational. As AI chatbot technology continues to advance, features like memory will become increasingly crucial for creating truly seamless and user-friendly experiences.

Though the company did not admit to any findings, the firm agreed to pay the fine and keep NYDFS’s preferred independent monitor for a year. In addition, Block had already faced fines and settlements in a similar vein, including a $55 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and an $80 million settlement with other state regulators. Block reaches an agreement with the New York Department of Financial Services to settle the dispute Just recently, the New York Department of Financial Services imposed a $ 40 million fine on Block following an investigation that revealed Block had neglected to monitor and promptly report suspicious transactions and failed to perform sufficient due diligence on its clients, the agency said in a consent order. Additionally, it was alleged that Block neglected to screen and monitor high-risk Bitcoin transactions. The department discovered violations of laws about consumer protection. Concerning this, in a statement, Block said, “Following our recent settlement with our other state money transmission regulators, we have now agreed with the final remaining state money transmission regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services, to resolve the matter principally related to Cash App’s past compliance program.” According to the reports from sources Based in Oakland, California, Block has consented to pay the fine and retain the independent monitor that NYDFS had preferred for a year, even though they disagree with all of the findings stated in the order. Block’s inability to keep up with its rapid user growth has resulted in multiple fines The current penalty follows a previous $80 million settlement in January 2025 with 48 U.S. state regulators over similar violations. In that case, regulators found that Block’s services could be exploited for money laundering and terrorism financing due to insufficient compliance measures .​ In a different case, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Block to pay up to $120 million in compensation to consumers who were harmed in January and $55 million in civil money penalties for failing to address fraud on the Cash App platform adequately. In a February filing, the company said it was still negotiating with NYDFS on matters similar to the settlement offer it had received a month earlier. To address this, the order highlighted that Block’s incapacity to keep up with the rapid user growth it experienced was the root cause of its alleged shortcomings. Since then, the firm has shifted its focus from prioritizing user growth to offering banking services to its established base. Furthermore, in a statement, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris mentioned that to safeguard customers and the financial system’s integrity, all financial institutions, whether traditional financial services firms or new cryptocurrency platforms, were supposed to adhere to the set guidelines strictly.

The country’s residents, ranked lowest amongst 30 in terms of life satisfaction in a recent survey, could be given between ¥30,000 and ¥50,000. Anyone who really knows politics knows that countries do not act, individuals do. And the individuals ruling both Japan and the US in the guise of “government,” seem to agree that fiscal recklessness at the expense of the populace is A-OK. Japan’s LDP has just floated the idea of revving up the money printer to toss a few bread crumbs to struggling Japanese residents, in light of Donald Trump’s (currently “paused”) tariff trade war on the country’s businesses. “We have conveyed our concern and strongly asked (the United States) to review the tariff measures at various levels,” chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi was quoted by local media as saying at a Thursday press conference. The money giveaway idea is also in answer to ongoing inflation in Japan, sources “familiar with the matter” reportedly said Wednesday (JST). While Japan’s prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has said Trump’s 24% tariffs are “regrettable” in spite of the current 90-day pause, some residents view this concern as insincere. The PM loves dumping money into the U.S., and unmitigated spending when it comes to Japan’s defense budget. Ishiba has recently vowed to pour a staggering one trillion yen into U.S. initiatives, and to boost military spending in Japan, and military alliance with the United States government. So what would the cash handouts look like? Well, between about ¥30,000 and ¥50,000 yen, or $200-$350 USD at current exchange rates. Not exactly a big help to people who cannot even afford rice anymore, and a reckless endeavor considering the current weakness of the yen, and the already loose money printing machine. Critically leading up to the current economic weakness was the mass creation of cash from thin air during the so-called “coronavirus pandemic,” as well. The cash handout plan reportedly emerged after Hayashi asked LDP policy maker Itsunori Onodera to come up with some options to support the economy. Komeito, the LDP’s junior coalition partner, suggested Thursday that tax cuts would be a more effective measure, with the helicopter money as a mere stop-gap. Amid all the economic woes, Japan’s residents have notably come in last place in a survey on happiness with quality of life, conducted across 30 countries. According to the survey , “the most common reason [Japan residents are unhappy] was their ‘economic situation,’ cited by 64%.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Speaking at a recent Cabinet meeting, Trump articulated that these changes would be ‘costly and problematic,’ signaling a potentially turbulent period ahead for international trade and financial markets. For those invested in or closely monitoring the cryptocurrency space, such pronouncements are crucial. Why? Because broader economic policies, especially those concerning trade and tariffs, can have cascading effects on market sentiment, investor behavior, and ultimately, the landscape of digital assets. Decoding Trump’s Tariff Policy Stance: What’s the Fuss About? Donald Trump’s approach to tariff policy has always been assertive, often prioritizing what he perceives as American interests first. His recent statements are a continuation of this stance, emphasizing a willingness to disrupt established trade norms. But what exactly did he say, and what are the possible implications? ‘Costly and Problematic’: Trump didn’t mince words, labeling the impending changes as potentially detrimental. This suggests he acknowledges the short-term pain that could accompany these policy shifts. ‘No One Else Had Taken It On’: This statement underscores Trump’s self-proclaimed role as a disruptor of the status quo. He frames his tariff policies as necessary actions that previous administrations were unwilling to undertake. ‘Difficult Transition, Positive End Result’: Here lies a glimmer of optimism, albeit couched in the acknowledgment of near-term difficulties. Trump believes that while the transition will be challenging, the ultimate outcome of his tariff policy changes will be beneficial. These points, as reported by Walter Bloomberg’s economic news account on X, paint a picture of a leader doubling down on his trade strategies, despite potential economic headwinds. But what does this mean for the average investor, and more specifically, for those in the crypto market? The Economic Impact of Trump Tariffs: Beyond the Headlines To truly understand the potential ramifications, we need to delve deeper into the economic impact of tariff policies. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are designed to protect domestic industries by making imported products more expensive. However, the reality is far more complex and often involves unintended consequences. Potential Positive Impacts (According to Proponents): Boosting Domestic Industries: Tariffs can make domestically produced goods more competitive, potentially leading to increased production and job creation within the country imposing the tariffs. National Security: In certain sectors deemed critical for national security, tariffs can reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, strengthening domestic capabilities. Negotiating Leverage: Tariffs can be used as a tool in trade negotiations, pressuring other countries to reduce their own trade barriers or address other trade-related concerns. Potential Negative Impacts (The Concerns): Increased Consumer Prices: Tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday products. This can lead to inflation and reduce purchasing power. Retaliatory Tariffs: Imposing tariffs often invites retaliatory measures from other countries, leading to trade wars where multiple countries impose tariffs on each other’s goods. This can severely disrupt global trade flows and harm businesses on all sides. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, forcing businesses to find alternative, potentially less efficient, and more costly sources for inputs. Reduced Economic Growth: Trade wars and increased costs due to tariffs can dampen economic growth, both domestically and globally. Uncertainty surrounding trade policy can also deter investment. The economic impact of these policies is a highly debated topic, with economists holding diverse views on the net effect. The complexity arises from the interconnectedness of the global economy, where actions in one area can have far-reaching and often unpredictable consequences. Trade Policy Under Scrutiny: Navigating the Shifting Sands Trade policy is not static; it’s a dynamic field constantly evolving in response to geopolitical events, economic shifts, and political ideologies. Trump’s remarks indicate a potential for further significant changes in U.S. trade policy , which could have profound implications for the global economic order. Consider these key aspects of current trade policy discussions: Aspect Description Potential Impact Protectionism vs. Free Trade The ongoing debate between policies that prioritize domestic industries (protectionism through tariffs, quotas, etc.) and those that advocate for open markets and reduced trade barriers (free trade). Direction of trade policy significantly impacts global trade flows, economic growth, and market sentiment. A shift towards protectionism could increase market volatility. Geopolitical Tensions Trade policy is increasingly intertwined with geopolitical considerations, used as a tool to exert influence or address national security concerns. Geopolitical tensions can lead to unpredictable trade policy changes, creating uncertainty and potentially impacting specific industries and markets. Supply Chain Resilience Recent global events have highlighted the vulnerability of global supply chains, leading to discussions about diversification and regionalization of production. Trade policy can be used to incentivize or disincentivize certain supply chain configurations, potentially reshaping global manufacturing and logistics networks. Technological Advancements New technologies like automation and e-commerce are transforming trade patterns and raising new questions for trade policy regarding digital trade, data flows, and intellectual property. Adapting trade policy to the digital age is crucial for fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition in the evolving global economy. Navigating this complex landscape requires businesses and investors to stay informed, adaptable, and prepared for potential shifts in trade policy that could reshape the global economic environment. Market Volatility on the Horizon? The Crypto Connection The cryptocurrency market, while often perceived as detached from traditional finance, is not immune to broader economic trends. In fact, events like potential shifts in tariff policy and the resulting market volatility can indirectly influence the crypto space in several ways: How Tariffs and Economic Uncertainty Can Impact Crypto: Safe Haven Asset Narrative: In times of economic uncertainty and traditional market volatility , some investors may turn to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, viewing them as ‘safe haven’ assets, similar to gold. Increased demand could drive up prices. Inflationary Pressures: If tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and inflation, as many economists predict, this could further strengthen the narrative of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, potentially attracting more investment. Risk-Off Sentiment: Conversely, significant market volatility in traditional markets, triggered by trade policy uncertainties, could lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Investors might reduce exposure to perceived riskier assets in favor of safer havens like government bonds or cash. Global Economic Slowdown: If Trump’s tariff policy changes contribute to a global economic slowdown, this could negatively impact all markets, including crypto. Reduced economic activity and business investment could dampen overall market sentiment. Currency Fluctuations: Trade policy shifts can influence currency exchange rates. Significant fluctuations in major currencies could indirectly impact the value of cryptocurrencies, particularly in trading pairs involving those currencies. Therefore, while the direct link between tariff policy and crypto prices might not always be immediately apparent, the broader economic impact and resulting market volatility create a complex web of influences that crypto investors need to be aware of. Actionable Insights: Staying Ahead in a Tariff-Sensitive World Given the potential for significant changes in tariff policy and the ensuing market volatility , what steps can investors and businesses take to navigate this uncertain environment? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor news and analysis related to trade policy , economic indicators, and market developments. Reliable sources like economic news outlets and financial analysis platforms are crucial. Diversify Investments: Diversification across asset classes, including a mix of traditional and alternative investments like crypto, can help mitigate risk in volatile market conditions. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. For crypto investors, this might include setting stop-loss orders, diversifying crypto holdings, and understanding the risks associated with different cryptocurrencies. Scenario Planning: Develop contingency plans for different economic scenarios. Consider how your investments and business might be affected by various trade policy outcomes and adjust your strategies accordingly. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial advisors and economic experts to gain deeper insights and personalized guidance on navigating the complexities of trade policy and market volatility . Conclusion: Navigating the Tariff Tightrope Donald Trump’s recent remarks serve as a stark reminder that tariff policy remains a potent and potentially disruptive force in the global economy. While the long-term outcomes of these policy shifts are uncertain, the immediate implications point towards potential market volatility and significant economic impact . For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding these broader economic trends is crucial. The crypto market, while innovative and often operating outside traditional financial norms, is still interconnected with the global economic landscape.

Co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin has defined the company’s strategy for years. However, that strategy now faces a challenge after a recent SEC filing hinted at the possibility of MicroStrategy being forced to liquidate some of its Bitcoin holdings under financial pressure and the recent Bitcoin price crash. The implications could ripple beyond the company’s balance sheet and affect Bitcoin’s broader market. Mounting Debt, Negative Cash Flow, And The Bitcoin Lifeline MicroStrategy disclosed several important financial vulnerabilities in a recent Form 8-K filed with the SEC. At the time of filing, the firm reported holding 528,185 BTC, acquired at an average purchase price of $67,458 per Bitcoin, for a total cost basis of approximately $35.63 billion. However, despite the massive size of its Bitcoin treasury, MicroStrategy admitted that its core enterprise software business has not been generating positive operational cash flow. The company is also shouldering $8.22 billion in debt and facing an annual contractual interest burden of $35.1 million. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns Bitcoin Price Could See Further Crash If It Falls Below This Level Although it has issued over $1.6 billion in preferred stock tied to substantial annual dividend obligations of $146.2 million, these liabilities are not being met. Instead, MicroStrategy explicitly outlined that it expects to rely on debt or equity financing to meet its obligations, and those efforts may become severely strained if Bitcoin’s price sharply declines. The report warns that if the market value of its holdings drops significantly, it could negatively affect the firm’s ability to raise funds. In such a situation, the company might be forced to sell Bitcoin at a loss. At the time the report was filed, BTC was trading just 13% above the company’s average purchase price. Because Bitcoin forms the majority of MicroStrategy’s assets, its balance sheet is intimately tied to the crypto’s price. As such, a dip below that level could create a chain reaction of falling stock prices and ultimately force selling pressure even on the price of Bitcoin itself. Michael Saylor’s Response: Staying The Course Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and former CEO, is one of the biggest proponents of Bitcoin and was influential in the company’s adoption of a Bitcoin strategy. Taking to social media platform X after the news of the report broke out, Saylor simply tweeted: “HODL,” a popular mantra among crypto purists that signals long-term conviction. Related Reading: Here’s How Much Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Lost After The BTC Price Crash The post has had over 1.4 million views on the platform and resonated with many bullish proponents, as seen in the comments section. He followed that with another tweet: “Bitcoin is the Best Idea. There is no Second Best.” At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $81,900, up by 6% in the past 24 hours. Even if MicroStrategy were to sell any Bitcoin at this point, it wouldn’t be the first sale of its holdings. Back on December 22, 2022, MicroStrategy sold 704 BTC for $11.8 million under similar circumstances.

Whispers from Handelsblatt, amplified by Walter Bloomberg on X, suggest that the European Union and China are engaging in high-stakes negotiations. The goal? To dismantle the existing EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. For those watching the pulse of global finance and tech – especially within the cryptocurrency space where disruptive innovation is the norm – this news is seismic. Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for the EV landscape, international trade, and perhaps even related sectors. Why Are EU China EV Tariffs Under Discussion? The current EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles are in place to protect European automakers from what is perceived as unfair competition. However, in a world increasingly focused on sustainability and the rapid adoption of EVs, protectionist measures can sometimes hinder progress. Here’s a breakdown of why these EU China EV tariffs are now being reconsidered: Geopolitical Realities: Global trade dynamics are constantly shifting. Dialogue and negotiation are often preferred over escalating trade tensions, especially between major economic powers like the EU and China. Economic Interdependence: Both the EU and China benefit from robust trade relations. A tariff war hurts both sides, impacting various industries and consumer prices. EV Market Growth: The global push for electric vehicles is undeniable. Removing tariffs could accelerate EV adoption by making them more affordable, potentially benefiting consumers worldwide. Industry Pressure: Some European automakers might be realizing that competition is inevitable and adapting to it, rather than relying solely on tariff protection, could be a more sustainable long-term strategy. The Potential Benefits of Removing EU China EV Tariffs If these EU China trade talks are successful and tariffs are indeed removed, the ripple effects could be significant. Let’s explore the potential upsides: Lower EV Prices for European Consumers: Chinese EVs are often more competitively priced. Removing tariffs could make them significantly more affordable for European buyers, accelerating the transition to electric mobility. Increased Competition and Innovation in the EV Market: Greater competition from Chinese manufacturers could spur European automakers to innovate faster, improve their offerings, and become more competitive globally. Boost to the Electric Vehicle Trade: Removing trade barriers can stimulate the overall electric vehicle trade between the EU and China, leading to increased volumes and potentially new collaborations. Positive Impact on Global Trade Relations: Successful negotiations could signal a move towards smoother international trade relations, which is crucial for global economic stability. Potential Benefits for Related Industries: The growth of the EV market benefits numerous ancillary industries, from battery manufacturing to charging infrastructure and even the demand for raw materials. Challenges and Considerations in EU China Trade Talks While the prospect of tariff removal is exciting, the path forward is not without its hurdles. The EU China trade talks will need to navigate several complex issues: Protection of European Automakers: European car manufacturers might voice concerns about being overwhelmed by cheaper Chinese imports. Balancing competition with the need to protect domestic industries is a delicate act. Fair Competition and Level Playing Field: Ensuring fair trade practices and addressing concerns about subsidies and state support for Chinese EV manufacturers will be crucial. Intellectual Property Rights: Protecting intellectual property and ensuring fair technology transfer are always key considerations in international trade agreements. Geopolitical Tensions: Broader geopolitical relations between the EU and China could influence the negotiations. External factors can always complicate trade discussions. Implementation and Timelines: Even if an agreement is reached, the practical implementation of tariff removal and the timelines involved will need to be carefully managed. Examples of Potential Impact on the EV Market To understand the potential impact, let’s consider some examples of how the EV market could be affected: Scenario Potential Impact Tariff Removal on BYD EVs BYD, a major Chinese EV manufacturer, could become significantly more competitive in the European market. Their affordable models could attract a large customer base. Increased European Investment in Chinese EV Tech European companies might increase investments and collaborations with Chinese EV technology firms to gain access to innovations and potentially lower production costs. Shift in Market Share The market share of Chinese EVs in Europe could increase, potentially leading to a reshuffling of the competitive landscape and forcing European brands to adapt more quickly. Acceleration of EV Adoption Lower prices and increased availability of EVs could accelerate the overall adoption rate of electric vehicles across Europe, contributing to environmental goals. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Changing Global Trade Landscape For investors, businesses, and consumers, the potential removal of EU China EV tariffs presents both opportunities and challenges. Here are some actionable insights: For Investors: Keep a close watch on EV stocks, battery manufacturers, and related industries in both Europe and China. Companies that can adapt to increased competition and capitalize on growing EV demand could see significant growth. For Businesses (Automotive): European automakers should focus on innovation, cost optimization, and developing competitive EV models. Exploring collaborations and strategic partnerships might also be beneficial. For Consumers: Be prepared for potentially lower EV prices and a wider range of electric vehicle options in the coming years. Stay informed about policy changes and market developments to make informed purchasing decisions. For Policymakers: Focus on creating a fair and competitive market environment while supporting the transition to sustainable transportation. Policies should encourage innovation and investment in the EV sector. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Global Trade and the EV Revolution The news of EU China trade talks to remove EV tariffs is more than just a trade negotiation; it’s a potential catalyst for a transformative shift in the global automotive industry and international trade relations. While challenges remain and the outcome is still uncertain, the implications are vast. For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, accustomed to rapid change and disruptive innovation, this development underscores the interconnectedness of global markets and the importance of staying ahead of the curve.

43192128,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148431,1744332604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: NY AG Demands Federal Crypto Rules to Safeguard Dollar and Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/federal-crypto-rules-dollar-investors/,"Is your crypto portfolio safe? New York Attorney General Letitia James is raising critical alarms, urging federal lawmakers to step in and establish a robust regulatory framework for the burgeoning digital asset market. Why? Because the current Wild West environment isn’t just risky for investors, it could pose a significant threat to the U.S. dollar itself. Let’s dive into why the NY AG is pushing for urgent federal crypto rules and what it means for you. Why is Federal Crypto Regulation Suddenly a Hot Topic? For years, the cryptocurrency industry has operated with a patchwork of state-level regulations, leading to confusion, loopholes, and frankly, a breeding ground for bad actors. AG James argues this fragmented approach is no longer sufficient. She points to several key concerns: Rampant Fraud: The crypto space has seen numerous scams, rug pulls, and fraudulent schemes that have cost investors billions. Without clear federal oversight, these activities are difficult to prevent and prosecute effectively. Financial Instability: The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, coupled with the lack of regulation, creates systemic risks that could spill over into the broader financial system. Recent crypto market crashes have highlighted this instability. Criminal Activity: Cryptocurrencies have been used for illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. Federal regulation is needed to enhance anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) efforts within the crypto ecosystem. Think of it like this: imagine driving on a highway with no traffic rules. Chaos, right? That’s essentially the current state of crypto regulation in the US. A federal framework aims to bring order and safety to this rapidly evolving market. The Looming Shadow Over the US Dollar: Is Bitcoin a Threat? One of the most striking aspects of AG James’ letter is her warning about US dollar dominance . She suggests that the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, could undermine the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. This isn’t just about economic pride; it has real-world implications. Why is the Dollar’s Dominance Important? Economic Power: The dollar’s reserve currency status gives the U.S. significant economic and geopolitical leverage. Lower Borrowing Costs: Global demand for dollars keeps interest rates lower in the U.S., benefiting businesses and consumers. International Trade: Most international trade is conducted in dollars, simplifying transactions and reducing exchange rate risks for US companies. AG James is essentially saying that if cryptocurrencies become too popular and displace the dollar in transactions or as a store of value, these advantages could erode. While some might see this as an exaggeration, it’s a concern that policymakers are increasingly taking seriously. The rise of stablecoins, often pegged to the dollar, adds another layer to this discussion. Stablecoin Onshoring: A Strategy to Protect National Interests? In her letter, AG James specifically advocated for stablecoin onshoring . What does this mean, and why is it important? Understanding Stablecoins: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They aim to combine the benefits of crypto (speed, efficiency) with the stability of traditional currencies. Onshoring vs. Offshoring: Onshoring: Refers to activities and operations being located within a country’s borders. In the context of stablecoins, it means encouraging or requiring stablecoin issuers to be based and regulated in the United States. Offshoring: The opposite – operations are located outside the country, often in jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. AG James’ call for stablecoin onshoring is rooted in the idea of maintaining control and oversight. By ensuring stablecoin issuers are based in the US and subject to federal regulation, authorities can better monitor and manage risks associated with these digital assets. This can be seen as a move to: Protect Investors: US-based and regulated stablecoin issuers would be subject to stricter consumer protection laws. Safeguard Financial Stability: Domestic regulation allows for better monitoring and mitigation of systemic risks. Maintain Dollar’s Influence: By promoting US-regulated stablecoins, the dollar’s role in the digital economy can be reinforced. Retirement Accounts and Crypto: A Risky Mix? Another key point in AG James’ letter was her advice against allowing retirement accounts to hold digital assets. This is a particularly sensitive issue as many individuals are looking for ways to diversify their retirement savings and potentially tap into the high-growth potential of crypto. The Argument Against Crypto in Retirement Accounts: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. Exposing retirement savings to such swings can be incredibly risky, especially for those nearing retirement. Lack of Regulation: The current regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of risk. Retirement accounts are meant to be safe and secure, and the crypto market doesn’t quite fit that bill yet. Complexity and Scams: The crypto space can be complex to navigate, and older individuals may be more vulnerable to scams and investment mistakes. While some argue that a small allocation to crypto could enhance long-term returns, AG James’ stance reflects a more cautious approach, prioritizing the protection of retirement savings. It’s a debate that highlights the tension between innovation and investor safety in the crypto world. What’s Next? The Road to Federal Crypto Rules AG James’ letter is a significant push for federal crypto regulation, adding to the growing chorus of voices calling for clearer rules of the road. But what are the potential next steps? Possible Actions: Action Description Likely Impact Congressional Legislation Congress could pass comprehensive legislation creating a federal regulatory framework for digital assets. Most impactful, would bring clarity and consistency across the US. SEC and CFTC Rulemaking The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could expand their existing regulations to cover more aspects of the crypto market. Incremental progress, but might still leave regulatory gaps and jurisdictional ambiguities. Executive Action The Biden administration could issue executive orders directing federal agencies to coordinate and prioritize crypto regulation. Can set the tone and direction, but legislative action is generally needed for comprehensive change. The path forward is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the pressure for federal crypto regulation is mounting. AG James’ intervention underscores the urgency and the potential consequences of inaction. Whether Congress will heed the call and act decisively remains to be seen. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Regulation? New York Attorney General Letitia James’ forceful appeal for federal crypto regulation marks a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset industry in the United States. Her warnings about fraud, financial instability, the threat to US dollar dominance , and the risks associated with retirement accounts holding crypto assets are serious and demand attention. The call for stablecoin onshoring further emphasizes the strategic importance of regulating this sector within national borders. As the crypto market continues to evolve and gain wider adoption, the need for a clear and consistent regulatory framework becomes ever more pressing. The debate is no longer about whether to regulate, but how and when. The decisions made by federal lawmakers in the coming months and years will profoundly shape the future of crypto in America and its role in the global financial landscape.

The country plans to leverage its unused electricity to power Bitcoin mining farms and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, creating new economic opportunities while addressing ongoing energy challenges. By offering this energy, the government offers an opportunity to pursue economic gain in emerging technology sectors instead of letting the surplus energy go to waste. The Pakistan Crypto Council, which was formed to capture the region’s potential in the international cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, is spearheading this initiative. Bilal Bin Saqib, the council’s CEO and adviser to the country’s finance minister, has led negotiations with international mining companies over the best ways to use excess energy to mine Bitcoin and run AI functions. The government will eliminate waste and gain the economic advantage of surplus energy by pinpointing the locations wherein surplus energy is most readily available. Areas with excess capacity for renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms, would make perfect locations for Bitcoin mining farms and AI data centers. The program can transform wasted electricity into high-value assets in the innovation economy, opening new frontiers for local industries and global influencers. Pakistan leverages renewable overflow to fuel digital ambitions Pakistan’s energy sector has long struggled with inefficiency and high costs due to an unstable national grid. Yet, despite these hurdles, the country must continuously generate surplus electricity during peak periods—especially when renewable sources like wind and solar produce more power than the grid can absorb. The lack of adequate infrastructure and energy storage means much of this excess electricity goes to waste. Adding to this challenge is the growing demand for renewable energy, which, although green and pleasant, creates a volatility of supply. Wind and solar energy, for example, can vary based on the weather and seasons. This can lead to periods of excess energy generation, followed by shortfalls when these renewable sources aren’t available to meet demand. Over the years, especially on such days when Pakistan is producing more electricity than it can consume, the question remains about how to efficiently utilize the excess power from the electricity grid in its peak times. This is where Bitcoin mining and AI data centers step in. These sectors are notorious for having high energy needs. Bitcoin mining uses a lot of power to run machines that solve complex algorithms to validate transactions on the blockchain. AI data centers to power machine-learning and deep-learning tech also use a lot of power. Pakistan aims to convert what was, for a long period, considered waste into an economic asset by placing these energy-intensive operations in energy-surplus areas. This would enable more efficient utilization of the country’s energy resources and satisfy the burgeoning global demand for crypto and AIs, which will drive the future of the global economy. Using this approach, Pakistan could become a global leader in the digital economy, luring in foreign direct investment and generating employment opportunities domestically. Essentially, Bitcoin mining has shown immense potential for economic growth, particularly when energy is being used efficiently. Pakistan taps Into AI and crypto to power economic transformation Artificial intelligence continues to be one of the fastest-growing tech sectors, revolutionizing industries from healthcare to finance and logistics. By supporting AI and cryptocurrency, Pakistan can diversify its economy, curb energy inefficiencies, and pave the way for long-term growth. With this global momentum, Pakistan is emerging as a rising player in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Despite lacking formal legislation, the country ranks among the world’s top 10 in digital currency adoption. An endorsement of Pakistani crypto ambitions is Changpeng Zhao, co-founder and ex-CEO of Binance. Joining the Pakistan Crypto Council as a strategic advisor, Zhao’s involvement represents a turning point in Pakistan’s progress towards blockchain technology supremacy. The partnership is symbolic and shows Pakistan means business when it comes to establishing cryptocurrency in the country’s future economic landscape. His participation is particularly important given his background in cryptocurrency regulations and blockchain technology. He has been instrumental in shaping regulations for digital currencies worldwide, and his guidance can enable Pakistan to create th e in frastructure and legal frameworks needed for the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors to take off. Zhao’s support also instills confidence among international investors that Pakistan is committed to providing a safe and secure framework for activities related to digital assets and may bring in foreign capital to the nation’s blossoming tech industry.

The meme coin clawed back to $0.148 after plunging to its 24-hour low of $0.129, a sign of a market teetering between panic and speculative hope. Analysts see potential 200% Rally if DOGE breaks through $0.20 resistance run, but technical indications aren’t encouraging. Death Cross between 100- and 200-day EMAs adds prolonged downward momentum. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is quietly moving through its fourth presale phase; having already raised $6.5 million by selling 396 million tokens. Is $0.025 for Phase 4 and a 20% rise on the way in Phase 5, this seems very much a planned route to the dollar for MUTM compared to those betting on the whims of Dogecoin. Dogecoin’s Uphill Battle Dogecoin’s 8.6% drop this week highlights its fragility in a market shaken by $1.6 billion in liquidations. Despite a slight bounce, DOGE is still pressed under a descending resistance trendline and weakening investor sentiment. Derivatives data show open interest waning and the long-to-short ratio falling below parity, a sign of traders’ hesitation to risk on a sustained recovery. For DOGE to reach $1 per coin, it would have to rise nearly 600% — a move that would take an anything-but-everyday bullish catalyst. Such jumps are rare without such upgrades or institutional backing, which Dogecoin lacks, according to historical patterns in the broader crypto market. The token’s dependence on social hype and meme culture makes its prospects bleak in the face of projects with real utility. Momentum of Mutuum Finance’s Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seizing on the investor desire for predictable returns. Now in its 11-stage presale, it is in Phase 4, with 8,100 holders under its belt, and tokens available for $0.025. At launch — $0.06 per token — based on its tokenomics to date, early participants stand to benefit a whopping 140%. Analysts go even further, estimating that by 2025, MUTM could hit $1.50, yielding a 5,900% return on investment for those who buy into Phase 4. This increase is based on Mutuum Finance’s lending protocol, which creates buy pressure via revenue-driven token buybacks. While the flurry around Dogecoin is speculative, the value of MUTM comes from real-world DeFi applications: overcollateralized loans, in which interest rates fluctuate, and mtTokens that increase in value as users earn interest. Benefits Over Meme Coins As Dogecoin bears the burden of volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily constructing the backbone. Its audit by Certik for smart contracts—yet to be concluded—gets them instant credibility, reassuring investors about security of protocol. The presale is conducted via phased increments of price, creating a strong sense of urgency; the sell-out of each phase of the presale hastens FOMO. As Phase 5 approaches and brings with it a price of $0.03, the opportunity to access tokens at lower valuations is becoming more and more scarce. MUTM’s model is a stark contrast from Dogecoin’s inherent lack of utility, aiming to be a hedge against the whims of meme coins. A Clear Path Forward Dogecoin’s vision of one dollar is predicated on a sea change in market sentiment — a gamble without guarantees. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, contains obvious upside in its presale structure and revenue-splitting mechanisms. Will the intermittent surges of Dogecoin outstrip the methodical ascent of Mutuum Finance? For investors who value stability over luck, the answer comes down firmly on the side of MUTM. Phase 4 will end soon, get your secured tokens now before the upcoming price increase. Act Before the Next Surge Lastly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a blend of innovation and investor intrigue revolutionizing participation in DeFi. With Phase 4 now live and a 20% price increase on the horizon, waiting risks missing potentially life-changing gains.

43192484,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148432,1744333363,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto History: First Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Worth Unbelievable $16 Billion Today,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-billion-dollars/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye, it’s crucial to remember the lessons of the past. While Bitcoin has revolutionized finance, it has also, unfortunately, attracted its share of bad actors. Today, we delve into a cautionary tale from the early days of Bitcoin – the story of the very first Bitcoin Ponzi scheme , a scam that, unbelievably, would be worth a staggering $16 billion in today’s market. This is a stark reminder of the risks involved in the crypto space and the importance of due diligence. Are you ready to uncover this shocking chapter in crypto history? What Was the First Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme? Let’s rewind to 2011, a time when Bitcoin was still in its nascent stages, trading at around $3 per coin. In this Wild West era of crypto, an individual named Trendon Shavers launched what he deceptively branded as “First Pirate Savings & Trust.” This entity, in reality, was the pioneering crypto fraud built upon the burgeoning Bitcoin network. Shavers, with a silver tongue and promises of guaranteed riches, lured unsuspecting investors into his web of deceit. His proposition was enticing: deposit your Bitcoin, and in return, receive a guaranteed 1% daily interest. Yes, you read that right – 1% daily ! This astronomical return, coupled with the assurance of withdrawals at any time, was designed to trigger a powerful sense of greed and security in potential victims. In a time when traditional finance offered meager returns, Shavers’ offer seemed like a golden ticket. But as with all Ponzi schemes, the reality was far from the promised dream. How Did Trendon Shavers Execute His Crypto Fraud? Trendon Shavers, the mastermind behind this Bitcoin Ponzi scheme , operated with cunning simplicity. He targeted early adopters of Bitcoin, individuals intrigued by the new digital currency but perhaps lacking deep technical or financial expertise. His method involved: Luring Investors with Unrealistic Promises: Shavers promised a daily 1% interest, an unsustainable rate that should have immediately raised red flags. This promise of “easy money” is a classic hallmark of Ponzi schemes. Exploiting Bitcoin’s Novelty: Bitcoin was new and complex to many in 2011. This novelty allowed Shavers to obfuscate the true nature of his scheme and prey on investors’ lack of understanding. Using New Investments to Pay Old Investors: The core mechanism of any Ponzi scheme is to use funds from new investors to pay off earlier investors, creating a false impression of profitability and legitimacy. This creates a snowball effect, attracting more victims until the scheme inevitably collapses. Personal Enrichment: Instead of investing or trading Bitcoin as promised, Shavers allegedly squandered the funds on personal expenses. Reports indicate he used the stolen Bitcoin for rent, car payments, gambling, and shopping – essentially treating investor funds as his personal piggy bank. The Devastating Impact and the $16 Billion Revelation The scale of Shavers’ crypto fraud was significant, especially considering the early stage of Bitcoin. He reportedly convinced victims to send him at least 50 BTC each. At the time, 50 BTC was worth around $150. Today, that same 50 BTC would be worth approximately $4 million! Imagine the shock and devastation for those early investors who entrusted their Bitcoin to Shavers. The U.S. government later estimated that Shavers embezzled a staggering 193,000 BTC from his victims. While this number is shocking in itself, let’s put it into today’s perspective. Based on the current Bitcoin price, 193,000 BTC is equivalent to roughly $16 billion. Yes, you read that correctly – $16 billion . This figure is not just a number; it represents the immense potential value lost by the victims of this pioneering Bitcoin Ponzi scheme . Metric Value at the Time (2011-2012) Value Today (2024) Bitcoin Price (approx.) $3 $67,000 (approx.) 50 BTC Value $150 $4 million Total BTC Embezzled 193,000 BTC $579,000 (at $3/BTC) $16 Billion (at $67,000/BTC) Justice Served, But Lessons Remain Trendon Shavers was eventually brought to justice. He was fined $40 million and sentenced to 18 months in prison. While this may seem like a relatively light sentence compared to the magnitude of the Bitcoin investment risks he exposed his victims to, it marked an important early legal precedent in the cryptocurrency space. It demonstrated that even in the then-unregulated world of crypto, traditional financial crime laws could and would be applied. However, the financial compensation for the victims was likely minimal, and the emotional and financial scars of such a scam can run deep. The story of “First Pirate Savings & Trust” serves as a powerful and cautionary tale for anyone involved in cryptocurrency, both then and now. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights to Avoid Crypto Scams The legacy of the first Bitcoin Ponzi scheme offers invaluable lessons for navigating the often-turbulent waters of cryptocurrency investments. How can you protect yourself from falling victim to similar schemes today? Here are some actionable insights: Be Wary of Unrealistic Returns: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns, especially those that seem too good to be true (like 1% daily!), it’s almost certainly a scam. Legitimate investments carry risk, and consistently high returns are statistically improbable. Do Your Due Diligence: Research thoroughly before investing in any cryptocurrency project or platform. Understand the technology, the team behind it, and the business model. Don’t rely solely on hype or social media buzz. Understand the Investment: Never invest in something you don’t understand. If you can’t explain how an investment is supposed to generate returns, it’s a red flag. Learn about the underlying technology and economics of any crypto project before putting your money in. Beware of Pressure Tactics: Scammers often use high-pressure sales tactics to rush you into making a decision. Legitimate investment opportunities don’t require you to act immediately. Take your time, do your research, and make informed decisions. Verify Credibility: Check if the platform or individual offering the investment is registered with relevant regulatory bodies. While the crypto space is still evolving in terms of regulation, legitimate entities are increasingly seeking compliance. Start Small: If you are unsure about a new platform or investment, start with a small amount you are prepared to lose. This allows you to test the waters without risking significant capital. Is History Repeating Itself? The Enduring Threat of Crypto Ponzi Schemes While the “First Pirate Savings & Trust” may seem like a relic of the past, the unfortunate reality is that Bitcoin investment risks and crypto fraud remain prevalent today. The allure of quick riches and the complexity of cryptocurrency continue to be exploited by scammers. We still see Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, and various other forms of fraud in the crypto space, often disguised with new terminology and technologies. Therefore, the lessons from Trendon Shavers’ Bitcoin Ponzi scheme are more relevant than ever. Staying informed, skeptical, and diligent is paramount to protecting yourself in the exciting but often risky world of cryptocurrency. Remember, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In conclusion, the tale of the first Bitcoin Ponzi scheme is a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls in the cryptocurrency world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer incredible opportunities, they also come with inherent risks. By learning from the mistakes of the past and adopting a cautious and informed approach, you can navigate the crypto landscape more safely and avoid becoming a victim of crypto fraud . The $16 billion “what if” of this early scam should serve as a constant, shocking reminder of the importance of vigilance and due diligence in the digital age.

The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a staff statement on April 10 that it was giving its views “to provide greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets.” The Division said its statement was made of observations of disclosures given in existing disclosure requirements and “addresses our views about certain specific disclosure questions that market participants have presented to the staff.” The guidance, which the Division noted had “no legal force or effect,” said crypto companies who are giving disclosures about their business have typically shared a host of information about their operations, such as what the company specifically does, how any issued tokens work and how the business generates — or intends to generate — revenue. Companies have also disclosed whether they plan to remain engaged in a crypto network or app after they launch it and, if not, whether any other entities will take over. Crypto firms should also explain their technology, such as if their product is a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake blockchain, its block size, transaction speed , reward mechanisms, the measures to ensure network security and whether the protocol is open-source or not. The SEC staff also noted that registration or qualification is not required in connection with crypto offerings that aren’t securities and aren't part of an investment contract. However, the statement didn’t provide clarity on what digital assets could be securities. Commercial litigator Joe Carlasare told Cointelegraph the statement was “a welcome and refreshing step toward clearer regulatory guidance.” “Adhering to the guidelines will help entities not only position themselves more favorably with regulators but also demonstrate a commitment to transparency and credibility,” he said. Crypto firms should share all risks The SEC staff statement said that issuers usually clearly disclose risks related to price volatility, network and cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and custody risks, in addition to standard business, operational, legal and regulatory risks. A “materially complete description” of a security is also typically required from an issuer, which includes the mechanism behind paying dividends, distributions, profit-sharing and voting rights, including how those rights are enforced. Related: No crypto project has registered with the SEC and ‘lived to tell the tale’ — House committee hearing It added a company should share if a protocol’s code can be modified, and if so, who can make such changes and whether the smart contracts involved have been subjected to a third-party security audit. Other disclosures the statement mentioned are whether the token’s supply is fixed and how it was or will be issued along with identifying executives and “significant employees.” The Division said its guidance intended to build on the SEC’s Crypto Task Force , which is planning to host a series of roundtables with the crypto industry to discuss how it should police crypto trading, custody, tokenization and decentralized finance.

This development comes even after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) recently disbanded its cryptocurrency investigation unit, raising eyebrows and sparking questions across the digital asset landscape. Are you wondering how this disbandment impacts ongoing crypto crime cases? Let’s dive into the details and uncover what this means for Do Kwon and the broader crypto regulatory environment. Why Do Kwon’s Case Remains a Priority Despite DoJ Crypto Investigations Unit Changes? The news of the DoJ dismantling its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) sent ripples through the crypto community. Many speculated about a potential softening stance on cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement. However, the prosecution in the Do Kwon case has clarified that this organizational change will not derail the legal proceedings. CoinDesk’s report highlighted the prosecution’s firm stance: the charges against Do Kwon are fundamentally rooted in fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud . This distinction is crucial. Here’s a breakdown of why Do Kwon’s case is proceeding unaffected: Focus on Core Criminal Charges: The charges are centered on established criminal statutes related to fraud and conspiracy. These are not dependent on the nuanced and often debated classifications of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities. Alternative Legal Pathways: Even if arguments were to arise about whether specific cryptocurrencies involved qualify as securities, the prosecution has confirmed that alternative, robust criminal charges are in place. These charges stand independently of security law classifications. Timing of Indictment: The charges against Do Kwon were already in place before the DoJ’s announcement of the NCET disbandment and revised enforcement guidelines. This suggests a commitment to seeing the case through, irrespective of later policy shifts. Crypto Investigations Landscape Shifts: What Does the DoJ Disbandment Really Mean? On April 7th, the DoJ made a significant announcement. It wasn’t just the disbandment of the NCET; it was also the formalization of new guidelines concerning cryptocurrency industry personnel. These guidelines indicate a move away from holding individuals legally accountable under federal securities and commodities laws for certain violations. But what does this mean for the future of crypto investigations and enforcement? Let’s analyze the key takeaways from the DoJ’s announcement: Aspect Details Implications NCET Disbandment The specialized cryptocurrency crime investigation unit within the DoJ is being dissolved. Potentially signifies a shift in how crypto crimes are investigated, possibly integrating them more broadly within existing law enforcement structures rather than specialized units. Revised Enforcement Guidelines The DoJ will not automatically pursue legal action against crypto industry personnel for violations of federal securities and commodities laws. Suggests a more nuanced approach, possibly focusing on egregious fraud and intentional misconduct rather than technical or unintentional regulatory breaches. This could be seen as a relief for compliant crypto businesses but not for those engaged in criminal activity. Focus on Fraud and Conspiracy Criminal charges related to fraud and conspiracy remain a high priority, as exemplified by the Do Kwon case. Indicates that while regulatory technicalities might be approached with more leniency, core financial crimes within the crypto space will still be vigorously prosecuted. Fraud Charges Against Do Kwon: A Case Study in Crypto Accountability The ongoing legal battle against Do Kwon serves as a critical case study in the realm of cryptocurrency accountability. The fraud charges leveled against him and Terraform Labs are not trivial. They represent a significant effort to address alleged misconduct that had widespread financial repercussions across the crypto market. What are the key elements of these fraud charges? The prosecution is likely focusing on demonstrating: Misrepresentation and Deception: Allegations that Do Kwon and Terraform Labs misrepresented the stability and risk factors associated with their algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), and related cryptocurrency, LUNA. Intent to Defraud: Establishing that there was a deliberate intention to deceive investors for personal or corporate gain, rather than mere negligence or business misjudgment. Financial Harm: Demonstrating the significant financial losses suffered by investors as a direct result of the alleged fraudulent activities. This includes the dramatic collapse of UST and LUNA, wiping out billions of dollars in market value. The outcome of the Do Kwon trial could set a precedent for future fraud charges in the cryptocurrency space, clarifying the boundaries of acceptable conduct and the consequences of crossing those lines. The Role of the DoJ in Crypto Regulation: Evolving Strategies? The actions of the DoJ , particularly the disbandment of the NCET, prompt reflection on the government’s evolving strategies for cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement. Is this a retreat, a strategic realignment, or something else entirely? Several interpretations are possible: Decentralization of Enforcement: Instead of a centralized unit, crypto crime investigations might be integrated into broader law enforcement agencies, leveraging their existing infrastructure and expertise across various financial crime domains. Focus on Systemic Risks: The DoJ might be shifting its focus to larger, systemic risks within the crypto market, prioritizing cases that involve significant financial instability or widespread investor harm, like the Terraform Labs collapse. Resource Optimization: Disbanding a specialized unit could be a matter of resource allocation, streamlining operations and avoiding redundancy, especially as crypto knowledge becomes more widespread within law enforcement. Adaptive Regulatory Approach: The evolving nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology requires an adaptive regulatory approach. The DoJ’s changes could reflect a move towards more flexible and responsive enforcement strategies. Terraform Labs and the Aftermath: Lessons for the Crypto Industry The saga of Terraform Labs and its dramatic downfall serves as a stark reminder of the risks and vulnerabilities inherent in the cryptocurrency market. Regardless of the legal outcomes for Do Kwon, the Terraform Labs episode has already left an indelible mark. What crucial lessons can the crypto industry learn from this? Key takeaways include: Transparency and Disclosure: The need for crypto projects to operate with utmost transparency, clearly disclosing risks, underlying mechanisms, and potential vulnerabilities to investors. Robust Risk Management: The importance of rigorous risk management frameworks for cryptocurrency projects, especially those involving stablecoins or complex algorithmic mechanisms. The failure of UST highlighted the dangers of inadequately tested and understood systems. Investor Education: The critical role of investor education in the crypto space. Investors need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools to assess risks, understand complex crypto products, and make informed decisions. Regulatory Clarity: The ongoing need for clear and consistent regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies globally. While over-regulation can stifle innovation, a lack of clarity creates uncertainty and can enable harmful practices. Conclusion: The Unwavering Pursuit of Crypto Justice Despite shifts in organizational structures within the DoJ and evolving regulatory approaches, the message is clear: the pursuit of justice in the cryptocurrency space remains unwavering, particularly when it comes to allegations of significant fraud. Do Kwon’s trial proceeding as scheduled underscores this commitment. The crypto industry, while innovative and transformative, is not immune to the rule of law. As the legal proceedings unfold, the world will be watching closely, seeking clarity on accountability and the future landscape of cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement. This case is a powerful signal that while the crypto world operates at lightning speed, traditional legal principles of fraud and accountability remain steadfast.

43193024,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148436,1744334436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hilarious Blunder: US Education Secretary Confuses AI with Steak Sauce ‘A1’,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/education-secretary-ai-steak-sauce-gaffe/,"In a truly unbelievable moment at the ASU+GSV Summit, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon raised eyebrows and sparked chuckles by repeatedly referring to Artificial Intelligence as ‘A1,’ yes, like the famous steak sauce. In a world increasingly shaped by technological advancements, especially in education, this slip-up has become a talking point. Let’s dive into what happened and why it’s causing such a stir. Decoding the ‘A1’ Gaffe: What Happened with Artificial Intelligence? During a panel discussion focused on the pivotal role of Artificial Intelligence in the modern workforce and learning environments, Secretary McMahon’s pronunciation of ‘AI’ as ‘A1’ became the unexpected highlight. Addressing a crowd of education and technology experts at the ASU+GSV Summit, she stated: “You know, AI development — I mean, how can we educate at the speed of light if we don’t have the best technology around to do that? I heard that there was a school system that’s going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching in every year, starting that far down in the grades. That’s a wonderful thing!” While it initially seemed like a simple mispronunciation, the repeated use of ‘A1’ instead of AI throughout her speech led many to wonder if it was more than just a slip of the tongue. The incident quickly spread across social media, becoming a subject of amusement and debate. Why is Understanding Artificial Intelligence in Education Technology Crucial? The context of this gaffe is particularly noteworthy because it occurred at the ASU+GSV Summit, a premier event for discussions on Education Technology . The summit brings together leaders to explore how technology, especially Artificial Intelligence , can revolutionize learning. Here’s why understanding and correctly articulating ‘AI’ is vital, especially for someone in Secretary McMahon’s position: Policy and Funding: Accurate understanding of Artificial Intelligence is essential for formulating effective Education Policy and allocating resources appropriately. Misunderstandings can lead to misguided investments and strategies. Public Perception: When top officials misrepresent key technological terms, it can dilute public understanding and potentially hinder the adoption of beneficial technologies in education. International Standing: In a globally competitive landscape, especially in technology, clear and informed communication from leaders is crucial for maintaining credibility and fostering international collaborations in AI and Education Technology . The Implications for Education Policy and Leadership Secretary McMahon’s role as the U.S. Secretary of Education places her at the forefront of shaping Education Policy nationwide. Her comments, even if seemingly minor, carry significant weight. This incident raises questions about the level of technological literacy expected from leaders in crucial sectors like education. Consider these points: Area Implication of Misunderstanding AI Policy Making Policies might be based on flawed premises if leaders lack a fundamental understanding of Artificial Intelligence and its applications. Resource Allocation Funding for Education Technology and AI initiatives could be misdirected if decision-makers aren’t fully informed. Public Trust Gaffes like this can erode public trust in leadership, especially concerning complex topics like technology and education. Linda McMahon’s ‘A1’ Moment: Just a Slip-Up or a Bigger Issue? While it’s easy to dismiss this as a simple mistake, the repetition of ‘A1’ instead of AI does prompt reflection. Was it merely a verbal slip, or does it indicate a broader unfamiliarity with Artificial Intelligence ? The original article itself notes, “Sometimes people misspeak. Nobody’s perfect. But this feels like a bigger whiff than usual, particularly coming from the secretary of education.” It’s important to consider: Ubiquity of AI: Artificial Intelligence is no longer a niche concept. It’s widely discussed across industries and in public discourse. The acronym ‘AI’ is commonplace. Context Matters: Speaking at an Education Technology summit, the topic of AI was central. Familiarity with the term would be reasonably expected. Role Responsibility: As Secretary of Education , understanding emerging technologies and their impact on learning falls within the purview of the role. Moving Forward: Artificial Intelligence Education for Everyone Regardless of whether it was a mere gaffe or something more, this incident underscores the critical need for widespread Artificial Intelligence education – not just for students, but for leaders and policymakers too. As Artificial Intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into every facet of society, including Education Technology , ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding basic terminology and concepts is paramount. Perhaps this ‘A1’ moment, while humorous, serves as a timely reminder: continuous learning and adaptation to technological advancements are crucial at all levels, especially in leadership positions responsible for shaping future generations.

43193297,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/us-sec-approves-trading-of-ether-eth-etf-options,1744334930,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43193297.jpeg,US SEC Approves Trading of Ether (ETH) ETF Options,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/us-sec-approves-trading-of-ether-eth-etf-options,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light for options trading for multiple spot Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The approval is likely to improve Ether's investment appeal among institutional traders. The approval was granted following a review of a proposed rule change tendered by BlackRock for its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). SEC Approves Options Trading on Ether ETFs The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved options trading on Ethereum ETFs. The SEC announced an “accelerated approval” for Nasdaq ISE’s proposal to allow options trading on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF. According to an April 9 filing , the regulator also approved a request from NYSE American to allow trading options for the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Mini Trust, and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund. The SEC’s approval of options trading means investors can soon trade options like financial contracts that allow them to follow the price movements on these Ether ETFs, similar to what investors can do with spot Bitcoin ETFs. In its response to the Nasdaq, the SEC stated the following: “…the Exchange proposes to amend its rules to permit the listing and trading of options on the Trust.” Adding; “The Exchange states that options on the Trust will provide investors with an additional, relatively lower cost investing tool to gain exposure to spot ether as well as a hedging vehicle to meet their needs in connection with ether products and positions.” What Does This Mean? The SEC’s approval of options trading adds more flexibility and depth to crypto investing. With the approval, investors can hedge their ETH positions by betting on the price of ETH without having to buy or sell ETH (the underlying asset) directly. Options are also a popular trading vehicle to leverage and hedge risk and are attractive to institutional investors who want to control vast amounts of shares. Expanding the reach of trading is expected to increase trading activity and make ETH ETF more appealing to retail and institutional investors. James Seyffart, ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, highlighted the approvals on his X feed, saying they were “100% expected.” Good news. Ethereum ETF options approved. Was 100% expected. Today was final deadline. I personally don't see it on the SEC website yet but id be shocked if it weren't true. https://t.co/XjOxE0ZqUt — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) April 9, 2025 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43193282,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148437,1744335033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling the Truth: World Liberty Financial Rejects Shocking ETH Sell-Off Rumors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wlfi-denies-eth-selloff-rumors/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, rumors and speculations can spread like wildfire, often fueled by market volatility and on-chain data. Recently, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform associated with former President Trump, found itself at the center of such speculation. Reports emerged suggesting a massive ETH sell-off by WLFI, sending ripples through the crypto community. But is there truth to these claims? Let’s dive into the details and uncover the real story behind the alleged Ethereum dump. Did World Liberty Financial Really Dump Millions in ETH? The controversy began when Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics firm, identified a wallet purportedly linked to World Liberty Financial. Data from Arkham indicated that this wallet had moved a significant amount of Ethereum , specifically 5,471 ETH, valued at approximately $8 million, during a period of heightened market volatility . This data quickly led to reports and discussions across various crypto news platforms, suggesting that WLFI was offloading its Ethereum holdings. The implication was significant, especially given WLFI’s high-profile association and the potential impact such a large sale could have on market sentiment. However, World Liberty Financial wasted no time in addressing these allegations. In a swift and firm response, WLFI vehemently denied the reports, labeling them as “wholly inaccurate.” The company asserted that it had not sold any of its Ethereum holdings. This direct denial raises crucial questions about the accuracy of the initial reports and the reliability of on-chain data interpretation. It also highlights the importance of verifying information before it spreads unchecked in the crypto space. Arkham Intelligence’s Role and Data Interpretation Arkham Intelligence’s data was central to the ETH sell-off claims. It’s important to understand Arkham’s methodology and the nuances of blockchain analytics. Arkham labeled the wallet in question as “closely tied” to WLFI, but crucially, it did not definitively confirm ownership. This distinction is vital. Blockchain analysis can identify patterns and connections, but definitively attributing a wallet to a specific entity is not always straightforward. Wallets can be mislabeled, or the connection might be correlational rather than causal. According to a report by Decrypt, Arkham itself acknowledged the connection as “closely tied” but not confirmed. This admission underscores the preliminary nature of the data and the possibility of misinterpretation. In the decentralized and often pseudonymous world of crypto, identifying the true owner of a wallet requires more than just transactional data. It often involves a combination of on-chain analysis, off-chain information, and sometimes even investigative journalism. Understanding Crypto Platform Operations and Market Volatility World Liberty Financial, as a crypto platform , operates within a complex ecosystem. Crypto platforms hold and manage vast amounts of digital assets, and their transactions are constantly monitored. Large movements of funds from wallets associated with these platforms are naturally scrutinized, especially during periods of market volatility . Market volatility is inherent in the cryptocurrency market. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, driven by various factors including macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, technological developments, and market sentiment. During such volatile times, any perceived large sell-off can exacerbate price drops and trigger further panic selling. This is why rumors of WLFI’s alleged ETH sell-off gained traction and caused concern among investors. However, it’s also crucial to consider the regular operational activities of a crypto platform . Platforms routinely move funds for various reasons: rebalancing portfolios, covering operational costs, facilitating user withdrawals, and managing liquidity. Not every large transaction signifies a strategic sell-off. In WLFI’s case, their denial suggests that the observed ETH movement was likely part of normal platform operations, misconstrued as a deliberate sell-off due to the timing amidst market volatility . Why This Matters for Crypto Investors This incident serves as a valuable lesson for crypto investors and the broader crypto community. Here are key takeaways: Verify Information: Always cross-verify news and data, especially in the fast-paced crypto world. Don’t rely solely on initial reports or unconfirmed data. Understand Data Limitations: Recognize that on-chain data, while insightful, has limitations. Wallet labeling and attribution can be complex and sometimes inaccurate. Consider Context: Interpret crypto transactions within the broader context of market conditions and platform operations. Not every large transaction is a sign of panic or manipulation. Platform Transparency: Transparency from crypto platforms is crucial in building trust and managing rumors. WLFI’s prompt denial is a step in the right direction. Market Sentiment Impact: Be aware of how rumors and misinformation can impact market sentiment and price volatility. Looking Ahead: Trust and Transparency in Crypto News The WLFI ETH sell-off denial underscores the ongoing need for balanced and responsible reporting in the crypto news space. While on-chain data provides valuable insights, it’s crucial to interpret it cautiously and avoid jumping to conclusions. Platforms, in turn, need to be proactive in communicating and clarifying any misinterpretations to maintain user trust and market stability. In conclusion, World Liberty Financial’s firm denial of the ETH sell-off claims highlights the importance of critical evaluation of crypto news and data. It reminds us that in the volatile and dynamic crypto market, verifying information and understanding context are paramount to making informed decisions. The incident also underscores the need for greater transparency and clear communication from crypto platforms to mitigate misinformation and maintain market confidence during periods of market volatility .

This announcement, delivered during a recent Cabinet meeting, comes amidst ongoing trade tensions and has ignited discussions about potential shifts in international economic policy. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this development warrants close attention, as global economic shifts often have a direct impact on crypto market sentiment and digital asset values. Trump China Trade Deal: A Potential Game Changer for Global Markets? President Trump’s statement, “I want to do business with China,” suggests a possible softening of stance in the protracted trade disputes between the world’s two largest economies. He further added a note of optimism, stating his belief that “a good outcome can be achieved for both countries.” This declaration follows closely on the heels of another significant announcement: the postponement of reciprocal tariffs on countries other than China for 90 days. While the White House also clarified that the total tariff on China would be 145%, not 125% as previously indicated, the overarching message seems to be a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and potentially reach a Trump China trade deal . Key Highlights: Trump’s Desire for Business: President Trump publicly stated his intention to pursue business dealings with China, signaling a potential shift in trade relations. Tariff Postponement: The U.S. has postponed reciprocal tariffs on countries excluding China for 90 days, offering a window for negotiation and easing immediate trade pressures. Tariff Clarification: While tariffs on China are set at 145%, the focus on dialogue suggests a path towards resolution, rather than escalating tariffs indefinitely. Decoding the Impact: How Does This Affect the Crypto Market Sentiment? The cryptocurrency market, known for its sensitivity to global events, is likely to react to these developments. Trade wars and economic uncertainties often lead investors to seek safe-haven assets. While traditionally gold has played this role, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are increasingly being considered as alternative stores of value. A potential de-escalation in US-China trade tensions could impact crypto market sentiment in several ways: Reduced Economic Uncertainty: Easing trade tensions can reduce overall economic uncertainty, which may lead to a more stable investment environment. This could, paradoxically, reduce the immediate appeal of safe-haven assets like Bitcoin, as traditional markets become less risky. Positive Market Momentum: Good news in global trade can boost overall market confidence. A positive shift in traditional markets might spill over into the crypto market, encouraging broader investment and potentially driving up prices. Impact on Supply Chains and Global Trade: A smoother trade relationship between the US and China could positively impact global supply chains. This could indirectly benefit companies involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies that rely on international trade for development and expansion. Navigating the Trade War Crypto Market: Challenges and Opportunities The ongoing trade disputes, often referred to as the trade war crypto market era, have presented both challenges and opportunities for the cryptocurrency space. Let’s examine some key aspects: Challenges: Volatility Spikes: Trade war news often triggers volatility in both traditional and crypto markets. Sudden announcements and policy changes can lead to rapid price swings, making it challenging for investors to navigate. Investor Uncertainty: Prolonged trade tensions create an atmosphere of uncertainty, which can deter institutional investors from entering the crypto market. Institutional investment is crucial for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto sector. Economic Slowdown Risks: Trade wars can contribute to a global economic slowdown. A weaker global economy could reduce overall investment appetite, impacting all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Opportunities: Safe-Haven Appeal: As mentioned earlier, economic uncertainty can enhance the safe-haven appeal of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In times of crisis, investors may turn to decentralized, non-sovereign assets. Decentralization Advantage: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies can be seen as an advantage during trade disputes. Cryptocurrencies operate outside the direct control of governments and central banks, potentially making them less susceptible to geopolitical risks. Innovation and Adoption: Economic disruptions can sometimes accelerate innovation. The need for alternative financial systems and solutions may drive further development and adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. The Broader Global Trade Impact Crypto and Beyond The implications of US-China trade relations extend far beyond just tariffs and trade balances. The global trade impact crypto market is just one facet of a much larger picture. Consider these broader points: Aspect Potential Impact of Eased US-China Trade Tensions Global Economic Growth Potential boost to global economic growth as trade flows normalize and supply chains stabilize. Inflation Reduced inflationary pressures as tariffs are rolled back and import costs decrease. Technology Sector Positive impact on technology companies that rely on global supply chains and international markets. Emerging Markets Potential for increased investment in emerging markets as global economic confidence improves. Cryptocurrency Adoption Indirectly, a stable global economy can foster a more conducive environment for the long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies as part of a diversified financial system. US China Business Crypto: What Does the Future Hold? President Trump’s latest statement suggests a possible pivot towards a more business-oriented approach in US China business crypto and beyond. While the details of any potential trade deal remain unclear, the shift in tone is significant. For cryptocurrency investors, it’s crucial to stay informed and adapt to the evolving global economic landscape. Here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Monitor Trade News Closely: Keep a close watch on developments related to US-China trade talks. Major announcements can trigger market volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains key in volatile markets. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of cryptocurrencies and other asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto market. Short-term fluctuations driven by trade news should be viewed in the context of the bigger picture. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. Use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes to mitigate potential losses during periods of high volatility. Stay Informed: Continuously educate yourself about the interplay between global economics, geopolitics, and the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or Fleeting Optimism? President Trump’s expressed desire to do business with China offers a glimmer of hope for easing trade tensions and fostering a more stable global economic environment. For the cryptocurrency market, this could translate to a shift in crypto market sentiment , potentially reducing volatility and fostering a more constructive investment climate. However, it’s essential to remain cautiously optimistic. Trade negotiations are complex, and the path forward may still be fraught with challenges. The cryptocurrency market will continue to react to every twist and turn in this evolving geopolitical narrative. For now, investors should welcome this signal of potential de-escalation while remaining vigilant and prepared for continued market fluctuations.

ONDO price prediction continues to gain traction as its role in tokenized finance expands, while PEPE price analysis hints at possible price stability despite weak on-chain signs. But the most significant momentum is now coming from a completely different source— BlockDAG (BDAG) . Instead of slow updates, BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 made a clear statement. With $213M secured, over 1 million mobile miners using the X1 app, and a live Beta Testnet already outperforming many launched chains, the project is quickly evolving. The presale has become something larger. As shipments of X30 and X100 miners begin and the network builds itself, BlockDAG is setting itself apart as a potential top pick for 2025. BlockDAG’s Testnet Launch Fuels Early Access Momentum BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 went beyond a progress report—it marked a turning point. BlockDAG has raised over $213 million through its presale campaign, with more than 19.2 billion BDAG coins sold so far. Notably, this was accomplished without help from venture capital. The entire movement has been backed by its growing global community. Currently in Batch 27, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0248 each, a significant jump from their starting price of $0.001 in Batch 1—showing a 2,380% increase. What puts BlockDAG ahead is its real user presence. Over 1 million downloads of the X1 mobile mining app have already been recorded. That’s not a goal—it’s reality. Additionally, the Tap Miner game has attracted more than 400,000 users, with about 100,000 playing daily. This activity is doing more than boosting attention; it’s creating a working foundation even before the mainnet goes live. The Beta Testnet now features a no-code tool for launching Tokens and NFTs, a smart contract explorer, and multiple functioning dApps. Weekly airdrops on the testnet are reaching active users. Another major milestone: 10,000 units of the X30 and X100 mining hardware are being distributed. This gives participants a chance to earn early rewards before the full mainnet release. With working tools, a growing user base, and shipping already in progress, BlockDAG is making a strong case to be among the top cryptos to watch for 2025. At this pace, those still on the fence could risk missing a major shift. ONDO Price Prediction Rises With Real-World Asset Adoption Excitement around tokenized real assets is building fast, and ONDO price prediction is becoming central in these discussions. ONDO is helping move traditional financial tools like bonds and Treasuries onto blockchain platforms, supported by real partnerships such as Mastercard and a total value locked (TVL) of over $1 billion—even before the full platform rollout. This growing involvement positions ONDO as a serious name in digital finance. Forecasts now suggest ONDO could climb 5x to 10x, with near-term goals set around $2. What strengthens this outlook is its current price—hovering close to $0.80—offering an accessible entry point. As interest in tokenized financial assets grows, ONDO price prediction continues to stand out, making it a top choice in the RWA category. PEPE Price Analysis Suggests a Pause Before Potential Climb Recent months haven’t been kind to memecoins, and PEPE price analysis reflects these trends. Its trading activity has fallen by 45% compared to the prior month, and fewer on-chain actions are taking place. Both new and active wallet addresses have decreased, and long-term holders are currently facing losses. Yet, data from Mean Coin Age indicates that selling may be slowing, which could hint at an upcoming shift. Price-wise, the decline appears to be stalling. PEPE hasn’t dropped to new lows for several weeks and has recently tested a resistance level of $0.00000883. The MACD is inching toward a bullish crossover, and overall capital movement is steady. This PEPE price analysis points toward a holding phase, not a breakout, but demand could quickly flip that scenario. Final Say! ONDO price prediction continues to strengthen as tokenized asset usage expands, while PEPE price analysis points to possible price stabilization after recent losses. Each of these projects brings its own unique risks and appeal. Meanwhile, BlockDAG appears to be entering a different league. With $213 million raised, over 1 million mobile miners, and a Beta Testnet already active, the project is clearly progressing. Mining equipment is being distributed, dApps are already live, and the presale price has surged by 2,380% from its initial level. For those still undecided, the window may be closing.

43194126,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=729660,1744336826,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43194126.jpeg,"Bitcoin Will Explode To $250,00 By Year-End, Predicts Cardano Founder",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-explode-to-25000-by-year-end-cardano-founder/,"Charles Hoskinson, who co-founded Ethereum and now leads the Cardano blockchain, has projected that Bitcoin could reach a price of $250,000 by the end of this year or next year. His prediction, made during a CNBC interview, comes despite the recent slump in the wider financial markets including crypto. Why Bitcoin Will Hit $250,000 Within Less Than 2 Years Hoskinson emphasized that rising geopolitical tensions and evolving trade dynamics are creating supportive conditions for decentralized networks like Bitcoin. Speaking on a world that appears to be “moving from a rules-based international order to a great powers conflict,” he suggested this shift would highlight the limitations of traditional banking and trade systems, steering more transactions toward cryptocurrencies. “If Russia wants to invade Ukraine, it invades Ukraine. If China wants to invade Taiwan, it’s going to do that. So treaties don’t really work so well, and global business doesn’t really work so well there. So your only option for globalization is crypto,” Hoskinson told CNBC. He also noted the significant sell-off in crypto and other risk assets, a trend that has partially stemmed from US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on countries worldwide. Bitcoin dipped below $77,000 over the last week before briefly surpassing $83,000 on Wednesday, and remains considerably lower than its record high above $100,000 set in January. Still, Hoskinson’s confidence stands: “No, I think Bitcoin will be over $250,000 by the end of this year or next year.” Among the factors that might drive such a dramatic price surge, Hoskinson pointed to the Federal Reserve possibly lowering interest rates in response to market pressures. “Then you’ll have a lot of fast, cheap money, and then it’ll pour into crypto,” he said, explaining how additional liquidity could lead to renewed interest in digital assets. The potential for big tech companies such as Microsoft and Apple to enter the crypto space also figures into his bullish outlook. Another component of Hoskinson’s optimism lies in the prospect of new legislation. He singled out anticipated stablecoin legislation as well as the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, both of which are currently making their way through Congress. He believes these regulatory moves could streamline the crypto market and pave the way for institutional adoption. Stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currency and backed by real-world assets, may prove especially attractive to major technology companies looking to facilitate rapid, cost-effective global transactions. “The stablecoin bill in particular could lead the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies to begin adopting the assets,” he added, referring to Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other mega-cap tech giants. Hoskinson further argued that once these regulatory frameworks become clearer, the market will likely “stall for probably the next three to five months,” before “a huge wave of speculative interest” re-enters the space around late summer or fall. That renewed enthusiasm, combined with a more settled geopolitical landscape and a stable regulatory environment, could, in his view, push Bitcoin’s price as high as $250,000. At press time, BTC traded at $81,138.

XRP Faces Legal Uncertainty While Ethereum Holds Support,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdag-gains-trust-of-170k-holders-with-top-notch-security-model-xrp-faces-legal-uncertainty-while-ethereum-holds-support/,"Ethereum (ETH) price prediction is once again in the spotlight as traders evaluate whether ETH can rebound while it lingers near crucial support levels. XRP price analysis paints a similar picture of caution, with the asset stuck in a tight range and legal decisions expected to influence upcoming moves. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining recognition for something more essential—protection. The platform has prioritized safety from the beginning, with security audits approved by both CertiK and Halborn, and it implements cutting-edge MPC tech to safeguard its assets. This approach is earning real trust, with more than 170,000 individual holders joining in anticipation of the upcoming mainnet debut. Ethereum Price Prediction Shows Signs of Possible Bounce Ethereum (ETH) price prediction remains under the microscope as ETH trades near $1,802. Analysts observe that ETH is maintaining important support between $1,760 and $1,775, with a resistance zone building close to $1,900. The charts give mixed messages—RSI sits in neutral territory, while MACD hints at a trend change. Even after an 18% dip over the past month, the rising open interest suggests bigger players may be positioning for a rally. The latest Ethereum (ETH) price prediction signals a modest comeback could take shape if the support area stays firm and resistance eases, with upside projections ranging from $1,900 to possibly $1,980 if momentum improves. XRP Price Analysis: Narrow Movement as Legal Outcome Looms XRP price analysis shows the asset holding steady above the $2.00 mark, currently trading around $2.07. Its movement remains confined within a narrow range, reflecting market hesitation as participants await final remarks in the SEC case. Chart indicators remain mixed—RSI holds a neutral stance while MACD leans toward a bullish cross. Some experts highlight a symmetrical triangle that may push XRP toward $3.51, while others remain cautious, warning of a drop if the $2.00 support doesn’t hold. As this XRP price analysis unfolds, much of the focus remains on the legal resolution and Coinbase’s forthcoming XRP futures rollout. Why 170K+ Holders Believe in BlockDAG’s Security-First Approach BlockDAG’s method for ensuring network safety breaks away from the usual approach. Instead of fixing issues after launch, the structure was built from scratch with safety at its foundation. Chief Security Officer Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj emphasized this during Keynote 3 , stating, “Security is not a feature—it’s the bedrock upon which we’ve built everything.” This solid base has already been tested by respected audit firms CertiK and Halborn , which reviewed and verified the robustness of BlockDAG’s smart contracts and framework. This kind of readiness strengthens user confidence even before the mainnet goes live. But the security plan doesn’t end there. BlockDAG’s treasury operates on Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which distributes access among several signers, reducing the risk of any single failure compromising the system. Its core infrastructure is designed to remain operational during disruptions, backed by a fault-resistant and globally spread architecture. These elements reduce the risk of attacks or downtime, key for a system aiming to handle high traffic. All of this has helped build long-term faith in the project—and the numbers back it up. BlockDAG’s crypto presale has already secured over $212.5 million, with more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold across 27 batches. Since the first batch, its price has jumped from $0.001 to $0.0248—marking an incredible 2380% growth. Driving these numbers is a community of over 170,000 holders, developers, and early backers drawn by the project’s technical strength and clear execution. With the mainnet nearing and multiple exchange listings ahead, attention is increasing quickly. For those exploring the best crypto coin to buy, such traction tends not to last forever. Once the launch happens, the current pricing could become part of history. Long Story Short! Ethereum (ETH) price prediction indicates continued uncertainty—support zones are holding, but momentum remains undecided. XRP price analysis shows similar hesitation, with sideways moves and legal updates keeping things slow. While these well-known names wait for decisive changes, BlockDAG is already making strong progress. Its structure, built entirely around safety and supported by major audits and MPC integration, has fueled crypto’s biggest ongoing presale. Having raised over $212.5 million with a 2380% price surge, BlockDAG now heads toward its mainnet and upcoming listings. Missing out at this point may mean watching the best crypto coin to buy surge past earlier opportunities.

Not so fast, according to a fascinating new study from Microsoft Research. While AI models are increasingly touted as programming assistants, even the most advanced ones are still facing significant hurdles when it comes to a crucial aspect of software development: AI debugging . This research offers a sobering reality check amidst the hype surrounding AI’s coding prowess and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where robust and error-free code is paramount. The Surprising Struggle of AI Models with Software Bugs We’ve heard the bold claims. Google’s CEO mentioning that a quarter of their new code is AI-generated. Meta’s ambitions to infuse AI coding tools throughout their operations. These pronouncements paint a picture of rapid AI dominance in software creation. However, the Microsoft study throws a wrench in this narrative, revealing that when it comes to resolving software bugs , AI models from giants like OpenAI and Anthropic are often stumped by issues that seasoned human developers would easily resolve. The study meticulously tested nine different AI models, including Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI’s o3-mini, using a benchmark called SWE-bench Lite. The results? Even with access to debugging tools like a Python debugger, these models, acting as “single prompt-based agents,” struggled to complete more than half of the 300 debugging tasks. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the top performer, only achieved a 48.4% success rate. This underwhelming performance raises critical questions about the current capabilities and limitations of AI in coding. Model Success Rate Claude 3.7 Sonnet 48.4% OpenAI’s o1 30.2% OpenAI’s o3-mini 22.1% Source: Microsoft Research Study Why Do Top AI Models Fail at Code Debugging? The study delves into the reasons behind these shortcomings. One issue is the AI’s ability to effectively utilize debugging tools. Models sometimes struggle to understand which tool is appropriate for which type of bug. However, the researchers pinpoint a more fundamental problem: data scarcity . Current AI models are trained on vast datasets, but the study suggests there’s a lack of data representing the iterative, step-by-step process of human debugging. These “sequential decision-making processes,” or human debugging traces, are crucial for training AI to become proficient debuggers. Think about it: debugging isn’t just about spotting an error; it’s about methodically investigating, testing hypotheses, and using tools strategically to isolate and fix the root cause. This complex process seems to be missing from the training data of current AI. The researchers believe that targeted training or fine-tuning with specialized data focused on debugging interactions could significantly improve AI performance. This specialized data would ideally include “trajectory data” – records of AI agents interacting with debuggers to gather information before suggesting fixes. Is This the End of AI Coding Assistants? Absolutely not. While these findings might seem discouraging, they provide valuable insights into the current state of AI coding tools . It’s important to remember that this is still early days for AI-powered coding assistance. The Microsoft study doesn’t negate the progress made; instead, it highlights areas where further development is needed. It’s also worth noting that previous research has indicated that code generated by AI can sometimes introduce security vulnerabilities and errors due to limitations in understanding programming logic. A recent evaluation of Devin, a prominent AI coding tool, showed it could only complete a small fraction of programming tests. The Microsoft study adds another layer to this understanding, focusing specifically on the debugging challenge. The Human Element Remains Crucial in Coding Despite the buzz around AI automation, many tech leaders emphasize the enduring role of human programmers. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Replit CEO Amjad Masad, and IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, among others, believe that programming as a profession is here to stay. This study reinforces that perspective, showing that human expertise remains essential, especially in critical tasks like debugging. While AI can undoubtedly assist with coding, automating repetitive tasks and potentially speeding up development workflows, it’s not yet ready to replace human developers, particularly when it comes to the nuanced and complex process of code debugging . For the cryptocurrency world, where code integrity is paramount for security and trust, this is a vital consideration. Key Takeaways: AI models are not yet proficient debuggers: Even top models struggle with software bugs that human developers find straightforward. Data scarcity is a major hurdle: Lack of training data representing human debugging processes limits AI performance. Human expertise remains essential: AI coding tools are assistants, not replacements for skilled developers, especially in debugging. Focus on specialized training data: Future AI improvements in debugging will likely depend on targeted training with debugging-specific datasets. Realistic expectations are crucial: While AI coding assistance is valuable, it’s important to understand its current limitations, particularly in critical domains like cryptocurrency and blockchain development. Looking Ahead: The Future of AI and Debugging The Microsoft study serves as a crucial reminder: AI is a powerful tool, but it’s still under development, particularly in complex domains like software engineering. While AI coding assistants will undoubtedly continue to evolve and improve, the human element in software development, especially in ensuring code quality and security through effective debugging, remains indispensable. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries, this means a continued reliance on skilled human developers to build and maintain robust and secure systems, even as AI tools become more sophisticated. The path forward involves focusing on developing specialized training datasets and refining AI models to better mimic and augment human debugging expertise.

AAVE and Chainlink have been all over the headlines, with one making waves through technical formations and the other tumbling dangerously close to bear market lows. AAVE’s recent Elliott Wave analysis hints at fresh market dynamics, while Chainlink is dancing near critical support, triggering major red flags. The spotlight is on these two top dogs—but there’s a third contender making serious noise in the space: Qubetics ($TICS), and it’s not here to play safe. Qubetics is shaking things up with a killer use case that the so-called “top rated crypto” players haven’t fully nailed yet: ultra-fast, cost-efficient cross-border transactions. While older projects built the stage, Qubetics is rewriting the playbook with tech that unifies blockchain ecosystems and brings real change to real people. And yeah, while AAVE and Chainlink are locked in tug-of-war with technical indicators, Qubetics is pulling ahead with an explosive presale that’s got early adopters buzzing. The clock’s ticking, and this presale window won’t stay open forever. Solving Real Problems with Cross-Border Payments Like Never Before From freelancers in Toronto to logistics firms in Singapore, cross-border payments are the hidden headache no one likes talking about. Qubetics is taking that headache and turning it into smooth sailing. With the power of the $TICS token and blockchain-backed speed, Qubetics makes it possible to transfer funds globally without the fees, delays, and middlemen that drain time and money. It’s not some abstract solution—this is real tech for real transactions. Let’s say a small American business is buying bulk electronics from Korea. Instead of sweating over exchange rates and delayed bank wires, they can settle instantly via Qubetics. That means better deals, happier suppliers, and no stress over payment clearance. Even individuals sending money back home get a win, with fast, secure remittances. It’s no wonder Qubetics is being talked about as a top rated crypto by those looking for actual utility—not just hype. Qubetics Presale: The Top Rated Crypto Presale That’s Turning Heads The Qubetics presale is on fire, and it’s not just hype—it’s backed by real numbers and serious ROI projections. Sitting at Stage 29, the $TICS token is priced at $0.1573, with over $15.9 million already raised. More than 24,500 holders have jumped in, securing their slice of over 507 million tokens sold. Every stage lasts only 7 days, and when Sunday hits at midnight, the price jumps by 10%. That alone creates a frenzy of urgency, but what’s really grabbing attention are the wild ROI projections tied to the mainnet launch in Q2 2025. Let’s break it down. A $100 buy at the current price gives you 636 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s a 535.65% return. If it reaches $5, you’re looking at 3,078.26% ROI. Go to $10? That’s 6,256.47%. And if it climbs to $15—which isn’t out of reach by the looks of Qubetics’ utility—then you’re talking about a jaw-dropping 9,434.71% ROI. That’s why this is being called the top rated crypto and one of the Qubetics presale opportunities nobody wants to miss. With this kind of potential, it’s more than just buzz—it’s a calculated play. AAVE’s Elliott Wave Points to Surprising Market Patterns The latest Elliott Wave technical analysis on AAVE suggests that its price movement may soon break out of its current corrective pattern. AAVE’s formation shows five-wave impulse potential, with the coin currently in Wave (2), a corrective wave that might soon give way to an upward Wave (3). If AAVE follows traditional wave structure, it could rally significantly in Wave (3), offering upside opportunities for those tracking the cycle. But this isn’t just theoretical analysis—this breakdown was backed by key Fibonacci retracement levels, indicating that AAVE is resting at a technical sweet spot. The chart patterns suggest that AAVE may soon regain bullish momentum, with strong price action support near the $90 level. Analysts watching these waves closely believe that a confirmed breakout could send AAVE beyond $130, marking a pivotal shift in its mid-term trajectory. Chainlink Battles Bearish Pressure as Price Hovers Near $10 Chainlink (LINK) is currently weathering a rough ride, having dropped 50% year-to-date and now trading dangerously close to the critical $10 support zone. The IntoTheBlock data confirms the bears are in control, with resistance looming between $10.71 and $12.33. Over 11 million tokens sit in profit just above $10.52, but heavy sell pressure above that zone is making it tough for LINK to push through. The latest signals from the IOMAP indicator suggest LINK may continue slipping, especially if the market doesn’t regain buying strength. Technical indicators paint a gloomy picture too. The MACD has slipped into negative territory, signaling weakening momentum, while a death cross between the 12 EMA and 26 EMA adds fuel to the bearish fire. The Supertrend on the weekly chart also flipped red, hinting that LINK may revisit levels as low as $7.37—or even $4.72, which was last seen in the 2022 bear market. While a bullish turnaround could send LINK toward $15 or even $23, that outcome currently feels like a stretch without a serious shift in market dynamics. Final Word: $TICS, AAVE, or LINK—Who’s Really Leading the Charge? AAVE might be prepping for a breakout with its textbook Elliott Wave structure, and Chainlink is facing a real test of strength as it struggles near key resistance levels. Both are notable contenders in the space, and each has its moment. But Qubetics is out here solving real-world payment problems and creating massive ROI windows for early adopters. That’s what sets it apart as a top rated crypto. With over $15.9 million already raised and the mainnet launch just around the corner in Q2 2025, the smart money is leaning toward those looking to join this best crypto presale before the next price jump. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics being called a top rated crypto? Because it’s fixing cross-border payment issues that major cryptos have left unsolved and delivering serious ROI potential through its ongoing presale. How much can I earn if I invest $100 in the Qubetics presale? At the current price of $0.1573, $100 nets you 636 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s over 5x returns, with projections climbing to nearly 95x at $15. What’s happening with Chainlink right now? Chainlink has dropped 50% YTD and faces heavy resistance. If support at $10 fails, it could fall to $7.37 or even lower. What is AAVE’s technical analysis saying? AAVE is potentially entering Wave (3) of an Elliott Wave pattern, which could lead to a bullish breakout above $130 if confirmed.

Mira Murati, the former CTO of OpenAI, is making headlines once again, not with ChatGPT updates, but with her brand-new venture: Thinking Machines Lab. This ambitious AI startup is reportedly aiming for a jaw-dropping $2 billion seed funding round. For those in the cryptocurrency space, accustomed to rapid innovation and substantial investments, this news signals a potential paradigm shift in how AI development is being funded and valued. Could this be the dawn of a new era of AI giants, and what does it mean for the future of technology and investment? Why is Mira Murati’s AI Startup Targeting a Massive Seed Round?

It’s spearheaded by Mira Murati, a figure deeply respected and recognized for her pivotal role in shaping OpenAI’s groundbreaking technologies. The audacious goal of securing a $2 billion seed round – reportedly doubled from an initial target – speaks volumes about the ambition and potential perceived in this venture. But why such a colossal sum, especially for a company with no product or revenue yet? Several factors contribute to this staggering target: Pedigree and Talent: Mira Murati’s leadership, coupled with the recruitment of AI luminaries like Bob McGrew (ex-OpenAI Chief Research Officer) and Alec Radford (key innovator behind OpenAI’s transformative models), instantly lends credibility and attracts investor interest. This isn’t just a startup; it’s a powerhouse of AI talent. Vision and Ambition: Thinking Machines Lab has articulated a compelling vision: to create AI systems that are “more widely understood, customizable, and generally capable.” This suggests a move beyond current limitations, aiming for more accessible, adaptable, and powerful AI solutions. Market Momentum and Investor Appetite: The AI funding landscape is currently white-hot. Investors are aggressively seeking the next big breakthrough in AI, and the promise of a team led by Murati, with a focus on next-generation AI, is undeniably enticing. The sheer scale of the funding round reflects this intense market enthusiasm. Decoding the $2 Billion Seed Round: What Does it Mean? A $2 billion seed round is unprecedented in the tech startup world, let alone the AI sector. To put this into perspective, typical seed rounds are orders of magnitude smaller. This massive AI funding round signals several key implications: Aspect Implication of $2B Seed Round Valuation Reportedly valuing Thinking Machines Lab at “at least” $10 billion pre-revenue, it sets a new benchmark for AI startup valuations and expectations.

Industry Impact Could reshape the AI startup landscape, setting a new precedent for funding and potentially accelerating the pace of AI innovation. Thinking Machines Lab: Beyond the Hype, What’s the Vision? While the massive seed round and high-profile team generate significant buzz, the crucial question remains: what exactly will Thinking Machines Lab build? Their stated mission to create more “widely understood, customizable, and generally capable” AI systems hints at several potential directions: Explainable AI (XAI): Addressing the ‘black box’ nature of many current AI models, aiming for systems that are transparent and understandable in their decision-making processes. Customizable AI: Moving beyond generic models to create AI solutions that can be tailored and adapted to specific user needs and industries, offering greater flexibility and utility. General-Purpose AI: Potentially pursuing advancements towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), although the specific focus remains to be seen. The emphasis on “generally capable” AI suggests a broader scope than narrow, task-specific models. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, the implications are multifaceted. Firstly, the sheer scale of investment in AI reinforces the ongoing tech revolution and the increasing convergence of different technological domains. Secondly, advancements in AI could have profound impacts on blockchain technology itself, from enhancing security and scalability to enabling more sophisticated decentralized applications.

43194998,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148484,1744338610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Victory for DeFi: Trump Expected to Sign Groundbreaking Crypto Tax Relief Bill,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-sign-defi-tax-relief/,"Exciting news for the crypto world! Brace yourselves, because a potentially game-changing moment for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is on the horizon. Sources close to Crypto In America’s Eleanor Terrett are reporting that former U.S. President Donald Trump is anticipated to imminently sign a joint congressional resolution. This isn’t just any resolution; it’s one that aims to overturn the controversial IRS DeFi broker rule, a move that could significantly alter the landscape of crypto taxation in the United States. What does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, or builder? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and explore the potential implications of this Trump crypto bill . What is the IRS DeFi Broker Rule and Why the Pushback? To understand the significance of this potential signing, we first need to grasp what the IRS DeFi broker rule is and why it has faced such strong opposition from the crypto community. Essentially, the rule, as it stands, could classify certain DeFi protocols and participants as ‘brokers’ for tax purposes. This classification would impose stringent reporting requirements on these entities, demanding them to collect and report information about their users’ transactions to the IRS. Here’s a breakdown of the major concerns: Defining ‘Broker’ in DeFi: The decentralized nature of DeFi makes applying traditional financial definitions like ‘broker’ problematic. DeFi protocols are often governed by smart contracts, not centralized intermediaries. Privacy Concerns: The reporting requirements could compromise the privacy of DeFi users, a core tenet of the crypto ethos. Compliance Burden: Forcing DeFi protocols to comply with broker rules could stifle innovation and drive development overseas, as many protocols lack the infrastructure to meet these demands. Technical Challenges: Collecting and reporting user data in a decentralized environment presents significant technical hurdles. Senator Ted Cruz stepped up to champion the crypto cause, introducing a joint resolution specifically designed to exempt DeFi protocols from these burdensome IRS tax reporting requirements. His resolution gained considerable traction, passing the Senate with bipartisan support – a clear signal of growing understanding and acceptance of crypto within the U.S. political landscape. This bipartisan backing highlights the widespread concern over the potentially damaging impact of the IRS crypto regulation on the burgeoning DeFi sector. The Cruz Resolution: A Beacon of Hope for DeFi Senator Cruz’s resolution represents a critical juncture for the DeFi space. It directly challenges the application of traditional financial regulations to the unique characteristics of decentralized finance. If signed into law, it would essentially create a DeFi broker exemption , clarifying that DeFi protocols, in their current form, are not to be treated as brokers under IRS rules. Key aspects of the resolution include: Targeted Relief: It specifically targets DeFi protocols, acknowledging their distinct operational model compared to traditional financial intermediaries. Clarity and Certainty: Signing the resolution would provide much-needed clarity to the DeFi industry, reducing uncertainty and fostering a more predictable regulatory environment. Promoting Innovation: By removing the threat of onerous reporting obligations, the resolution aims to encourage continued innovation and growth within the DeFi sector in the U.S. Bipartisan Support: The broad support in the Senate underscores a growing consensus on the need for a nuanced approach to crypto regulation. Why is Trump’s Signature a Potential Game Changer for Crypto? The anticipation surrounding Donald Trump’s expected signature is palpable within the crypto community. Why is this particular signature so significant? First Crypto Law Signed by a U.S. President: If signed, this would mark a historic moment – the very first piece of crypto-specific legislation to be signed into law by a U.S. President. This symbolic act carries immense weight, signaling a potential shift towards a more crypto-friendly stance at the highest levels of government. Trump’s Evolving Crypto Stance: While his past views on crypto have been varied, this action could indicate a more favorable or at least pragmatic approach to digital assets from Trump and his administration. Setting a Precedent: This resolution could set a precedent for future crypto legislation, potentially paving the way for more tailored and innovation-friendly regulations. Boost to Market Sentiment: The signing is likely to be viewed very positively by the crypto market, potentially leading to increased investment and adoption of DeFi and other crypto assets. Senator Ted Cruz’s expected presence at the signing ceremony further underscores the importance of this event. It highlights the collaborative effort between lawmakers and the crypto community to shape sensible regulations. This crypto legislation is not just about tax rules; it’s about fostering an environment where innovation can thrive while ensuring responsible growth of the digital asset ecosystem. Benefits of Overturning the IRS DeFi Broker Rule Let’s explore the potential benefits that could ripple through the crypto space if the DeFi tax rule is indeed overturned: Benefit Description Innovation Boost Reduced regulatory burden allows DeFi projects to focus on development and innovation rather than compliance complexities. Increased Investment Clarity and certainty attract more institutional and retail investment into the DeFi sector. User Privacy Protection Maintains a degree of privacy for DeFi users, aligning with the core principles of decentralization. Global Competitiveness Keeps the U.S. competitive in the global race for DeFi innovation and talent. Reduced Compliance Costs DeFi protocols and users avoid potentially exorbitant compliance costs associated with broker rules. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While overturning the IRS DeFi broker rule is largely seen as a positive step, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges and considerations remain: Future Regulatory Landscape: This resolution addresses one specific rule, but the broader regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving. Ongoing dialogue and collaboration are crucial. Taxation of DeFi Still Needed: Exempting DeFi from broker rules doesn’t mean DeFi transactions are tax-free. Clear and appropriate tax guidelines for DeFi activities will still be necessary. Balancing Innovation and Compliance: The challenge lies in finding the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible financial practices within the crypto space. Global Regulatory Coordination: Crypto is global, and international regulatory coordination will be essential for consistent and effective oversight. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what can you, as a crypto enthusiast, take away from this development? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the crypto space. This is a rapidly evolving area, and staying informed is crucial. Engage with Policymakers: Support organizations and initiatives that advocate for sensible crypto regulations. Your voice matters! Understand Tax Implications: Even with this potential relief, remember that crypto transactions generally have tax implications. Consult with a tax professional for personalized advice. Explore DeFi Opportunities: A more favorable regulatory environment could unlock further opportunities in the DeFi space. Research and explore responsibly. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point for DeFi The expected signing of the resolution overturning the IRS DeFi broker rule is more than just a technical adjustment; it’s a potential turning point for the DeFi sector in the United States. It represents a victory for sensible regulation, innovation, and the crypto community as a whole. While challenges remain, this move signals a growing recognition of the unique nature of DeFi and a willingness to create a regulatory environment that fosters its growth. Keep watching this space – the future of DeFi and crypto regulation is unfolding before our eyes, and this Trump crypto bill could be a pivotal moment in that journey.

Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset manager, has just dropped a major hint about the future of their investment offerings. They’ve updated their “Assets Under Consideration” list, and it’s packed with over 30 new and intriguing cryptocurrencies. This move suggests Grayscale is seriously exploring expanding its range of crypto investment products , and the crypto community is buzzing with anticipation. Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the broader digital asset market. What’s the Buzz About Grayscale’s Expanded Watchlist? Grayscale’s “Assets Under Consideration” list is essentially a public declaration of digital assets they are researching for potential inclusion in their investment products. Think of it as a sneak peek into what tokens might become more accessible to institutional and retail investors through Grayscale’s trusted investment vehicles. The recent update, revealed by Wu Blockchain on X, has added a whopping number of new names to this Grayscale watchlist , signaling a significant broadening of their horizons. Here’s a breakdown of the exciting new additions: Layer 1 & 2 Blockchains: APT (Aptos), ARB (Arbitrum), TIA (Celestia), HBAR (Hedera Hashgraph), MNT (Mantle), TON (Toncoin), TRX (Tron), VET (VeChain), BNB (Binance Coin). These represent a diverse set of foundational blockchains and scaling solutions. DeFi & Web3 Tokens: AERO (Aerodrome Finance), ENA (Ethena), JUP (Jupiter), ONDO (Ondo Finance), PENDLE (Pendle Finance), PLUME, IMX (Immutable X), JTO (Jito). This category highlights Grayscale’s interest in the growing decentralized finance and Web3 ecosystems. AI & Data Focused Tokens: AIXBT, IP (InterPlanetary Consensus), AKT (Akash Network), FET (Fetch.ai), AR (Arweave). The inclusion of these tokens suggests a forward-looking approach towards the intersection of crypto and artificial intelligence. Infrastructure & Network Tokens: EIGEN (EigenLayer), GEOD (Geodnet), HNT (Helium). These projects are building crucial infrastructure for the decentralized web. Beyond the Classified: Uncharted Crypto Territories Interestingly, Grayscale also included a set of “unclassified assets,” hinting at exploration beyond their current Crypto Sectors framework. These include projects like Babylon, BERA, Monad, MOVE, Lombard, OM, SYRUP, ELIZA, DEEP, GRASS, Prime Intellect, Sentient, Space and Time, and WAL. This suggests Grayscale is not just looking at established categories but also venturing into more novel and experimental areas within the digital assets space. Why is This Expansion a Big Deal for Crypto Investors? Grayscale’s interest in these new assets carries significant weight. Here’s why: Increased Institutional Exposure: Grayscale products often serve as a bridge for institutional investors to enter the crypto market. Adding these assets to their offerings could channel significant institutional capital into these projects. Retail Investor Access: For retail investors, Grayscale products provide a regulated and potentially simpler way to gain exposure to various cryptocurrencies without directly managing wallets and exchanges. Market Validation: Grayscale’s consideration can be seen as a form of validation for these projects, potentially boosting their credibility and market awareness. Price Impact: Historically, assets listed on Grayscale’s watchlist, and especially those eventually included in their investment products, have often experienced positive price movements due to increased demand and investor interest. What Kind of Investment Products Could We See? While being on the “Assets Under Consideration” list is not a guarantee of product launch, it’s a crucial first step. Grayscale offers various types of crypto investment products , including: Single-Asset Trusts: These trusts focus on a single cryptocurrency, like their Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) or Ethereum Trust (ETHE). We could potentially see new trusts for some of the assets on the watchlist. Diversified Funds: Grayscale also offers diversified funds that hold a basket of cryptocurrencies, like their Digital Large Cap Fund. New funds with different focuses (e.g., DeFi fund, AI crypto fund) could be on the horizon. ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): With the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the door is potentially open for other crypto ETFs. Grayscale might be exploring ETFs for some of these new assets in the future. Navigating the Altcoin Landscape: What to Consider? The inclusion of such a wide array of altcoins on Grayscale’s watchlist highlights the growing diversity within the crypto market. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in altcoins comes with its own set of considerations: Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Price swings can be significant. Risk Assessment: Thoroughly research each project. Understand its technology, team, use case, and tokenomics before investing. Market Sentiment: Altcoin prices are often heavily influenced by market sentiment and trends. Stay informed about the overall crypto market conditions. Long-Term Potential: Consider the long-term viability and adoption potential of each project. Is it solving a real problem? Does it have a strong community and development team? What’s Next for Grayscale and the Crypto Market? Grayscale’s expanded Grayscale watchlist is a clear indicator of their bullish stance on the future of the crypto market and their commitment to offering a wider range of investment options. While it remains to be seen which of these assets will ultimately make it into new investment products, this move undoubtedly injects fresh excitement and opportunity into the digital asset space.

43195570,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148494,1744339802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Approval: Hong Kong SFC Greenlights Ethereum Staking for HashKey & OSL,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hong-kong-eth-staking-approval/,"Get ready for a significant leap in Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency landscape! The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has just given the nod to HashKey and OSL, two prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, to offer Ethereum staking services. This landmark decision marks a pivotal moment for crypto investors in Hong Kong, opening up exciting new avenues within a regulated framework. For those keeping a close eye on the evolving world of digital assets, this news is a game-changer. Hong Kong SFC Approves Ethereum Staking: What Does It Mean? So, what exactly does this SFC approval mean for you? Previously, Hong Kong investors could indirectly participate in staking rewards through Ethereum ETFs that incorporated staking mechanisms. However, HashKey has announced on its website that this approval now allows users to directly stake their ETH holdings through the HashKey platform itself. OSL has also received the green light to provide similar services, further solidifying this trend. This direct access to Ethereum staking represents a significant enhancement for investors looking to maximize their crypto holdings. Let’s break down the key takeaways: Direct ETH Staking Access: Investors can now stake ETH directly on platforms like HashKey, rather than solely relying on ETF exposure. Regulatory Clarity: The SFC’s approval provides a clear regulatory framework for Ethereum staking activities in Hong Kong, fostering greater trust and security. Expanded Investment Opportunities: This move broadens the range of investment strategies available to crypto enthusiasts in Hong Kong. Platform Growth: For HashKey and OSL, this approval signifies a major expansion of their service offerings and strengthens their position in the competitive crypto exchange market. Why is Ethereum Staking Gaining Traction? Ethereum staking has become increasingly popular as the Ethereum network transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Instead of relying on energy-intensive mining, PoS allows ETH holders to ‘stake’ their coins to support the network’s operations and earn rewards in return. Think of it as earning interest on your crypto holdings while contributing to the security and efficiency of the blockchain. Here’s a quick comparison to understand the benefits: Feature Proof-of-Work (PoW) – Previous Ethereum Model Proof-of-Stake (PoS) – Current Ethereum Model Consensus Mechanism Mining – Solving complex computational problems Staking – Locking up ETH to validate transactions Energy Consumption High Significantly Lower Reward System Block rewards for miners Staking rewards for validators Accessibility Requires specialized hardware and technical expertise More accessible to ETH holders with varying technical skills As you can see, Ethereum staking offers a more sustainable and accessible way to participate in the network and earn passive income. This shift towards PoS is a major reason why staking is becoming a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. Navigating Hong Kong Crypto Regulation: A Maturing Market Hong Kong crypto regulation has been evolving rapidly, aiming to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting investors. The SFC’s approval of Ethereum staking services for HashKey and OSL is a testament to this maturing regulatory landscape. It signals a more welcoming approach to digital assets within a well-defined framework. This regulatory clarity is crucial for attracting institutional investors and fostering broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. Consider these points regarding Hong Kong’s crypto regulation : Progressive Approach: Hong Kong is positioning itself as a hub for digital assets by adopting a relatively progressive regulatory stance compared to some other jurisdictions. Investor Protection: The SFC’s involvement underscores a commitment to investor protection within the crypto space. Market Growth: Clear regulations can attract more businesses and investors to the Hong Kong crypto market, leading to further growth and innovation. Global Significance: Hong Kong’s regulatory developments are closely watched globally and can influence regulatory trends in other regions. HashKey and OSL: Leading the Charge in Ethereum Staking HashKey and OSL are not just any exchanges; they are among the first licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong. Their SFC approval to offer Ethereum staking services further solidifies their leadership positions in the region’s burgeoning crypto market. By embracing staking, they are catering to the growing demand for yield-generating crypto products and demonstrating their commitment to offering innovative services within a compliant environment. Here’s why HashKey and OSL’s move is significant: Pioneer Status: As licensed platforms, their foray into Ethereum staking sets a precedent for other regulated entities in Hong Kong and potentially beyond. Enhanced Service Offerings: Staking expands their service portfolio, making them more attractive to users seeking comprehensive crypto solutions. Market Confidence: Their involvement adds credibility and confidence to the Ethereum staking ecosystem in Hong Kong. Competitive Advantage: Offering regulated staking services gives them a competitive edge in attracting and retaining users in a dynamic market. Unlock Exciting Opportunities with Ethereum Staking in Hong Kong The SFC approval for Ethereum staking in Hong Kong is more than just regulatory news; it’s a gateway to exciting new opportunities for crypto investors. By providing a regulated and accessible pathway to staking, Hong Kong is solidifying its position as a forward-thinking crypto hub. Whether you are a seasoned crypto investor or just exploring the possibilities, this development opens doors to potentially enhance your portfolio with staking rewards within a secure and regulated environment. Keep an eye on HashKey and OSL as they roll out their Ethereum staking services and explore how you can benefit from this groundbreaking advancement. In conclusion, the Hong Kong SFC’s decision to approve Ethereum staking for HashKey and OSL is a landmark moment. It underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market in Hong Kong and provides investors with regulated access to the burgeoning world of staking rewards. This move not only benefits individual investors but also strengthens Hong Kong’s position as a leading center for digital asset innovation and responsible crypto regulation .

The feature is available to US, Singapore, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Channel Islands users. Coinbase’s Verified Pools are available to institutional and retail traders and offer KYC-verified liquidity pools to maintain the company's position regarding the openness and efficiency of on-chain markets. Safer Way for Retail and Institutional Clients to Engage with DeFi Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase launched KYC-Verified Pools, which it claims reduces counterparty risk for decentralized finance (DeFi) retail and institutional participants. In a blog post announcing the launch of Verified Pools , the exchange markets the service as a “trusted and seamless way to access liquidity pools” for “both retail and institutional participants in eligible locations.” The exchange highlights the launch of Verified Pools as the next step in the exchange’s “advancing on-chain adoption.” Seamless Onchain Trading and Swapping Through Verified Pools, Coinbase introduces “a trusted way to seamlessly trade and swap onchain.” The service is available to institutions seeking liquidity and retail traders looking for an easy way to trade on-chain. According to Coinbase, Verified Pools set a new standard in which compliance efficiency, trust and transparency meet. Powered by Base, Utilizing the Uniswap v4 Protocol According to Coinbase, Verified Pools is a “breakthrough” in on-chain liquidity by leveraging the company’s KYC-integrated verification system, Coinbase Verification. Through the seamless integration of identity verification and smart contract transparency, Verified Pools reduces counterparty risks while maintaining the openness and efficiency of on-chain markets. Verified Pools is powered by Coinbase’s scalable Layer-2 network, Base, and is built on the Uniswap v4 protocol. Coinbase also partnered with Gauntlet, a leading risk modelling and economic optimization provider, which will optimize liquidity pool configurations and maintain overall liquidity pool health to ensure liquidity. Recognizing that institutional investors, traders, and liquidity providers have long battled to participate in on-chain trading with enhanced security standards, Coinbase delivered Verified Pools to ease their way into it. Institutions gain numerous benefits with Verified Pools, including: “Concentrated Liquidity: Liquidity providers can specify a price range for their capital, enhancing capital efficiency and earning potential. Controlled Access: Coinbase Verifications provide the onchain credentials required for access to Verified Pools liquidity. This ensures that only verified users can supply or interact with liquidity. Autonomy: Verified Pools are non-custodial which allow you to maintain control and ownership over your assets.” How to Access Verified Pools Verified Pools are connected through Coinbase’s “institutional-grade” Prime Onchain Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, or any third-party wallet with Coinbase Verification credentials. Users must complete Coinbase’s KYC-procedure to join the initiative and address the necessary compliance concerns associated with the DeFi sector. Verified Pools are available in the US, Singapore, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Channel Islands. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

New Hampshire’s House passed its Bitcoin reserve bill, HB302, in a 192-179 vote on April 10 which will now head to the Senate. The state is now the fourth to pass a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve bill through one chamber, joining Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma. If HB302 clears New Hampshire’s Senate and Governor Kelly Ayotte signs it into law it would allow the state’s treasurer to use 10% of the state’s general fund and other authorized funds to invest in precious metals and certain digital assets. The bill also sets out how they should be custodied. The bill specifies that only cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $500 billion would be eligible for investment, a criteria that only Bitcoin currently meets. New Hampshire’s House votes to pass HB302, the state’s Bitcoin reserve bill. Source: New Hampshire House of Representatives In a debate prior to the vote, Democrat Representative Terry Spahr argued that the bill is unnecessary and could undermine the future security of the state’s digital assets stockpile. “Unbeknownst to the committee and to the sponsor the treasurer testified that they already have that authority,” Spahr said. He added that cryptocurrency is “constantly shifting and changing, and it’s sort of dangerous to be kind of locked into certain types of security measures, and I think that bill does this.” Republican Representative Jordan Ulery countered that the bill was necessary as it could create the “potential for a large amount of money being earned by the state in these investments.” New Hampshire has two other blockchain-related bills working their way through the legislature — HB310, which covers stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization (RWA) and HB 639, which deals with blockchain regulation and dispute resolution. Florida House Committee passes Bitcoin reserve bill Meanwhile on April 10, Florida’s House Insurance and Banking Committee passed the state’s Bitcoin reserve bill , HB487, with a unanimous vote. The bill has three committees to clear before it progresses to Florida’s House.

Webster Barnaby pic.twitter.com/myAlNvtFl9 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) April 10, 2025 Similar to New Hampshire’s bill, HB487 would allow Florida’s chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of certain state funds — including the General Revenue Fund and the Budget Stabilization Fund — into Bitcoin. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Representative Webster Barnaby pleaded with the Committee before the vote “to vote up on this very important bill” which he claimed would “put Florida in the leading edge of this very new technology.” Related: US federal agencies to report crypto holdings to Treasury by April 7 Florida’s bill gives the state’s financial chief the ability to invest in digital assets directly, through certain qualified custodians, or through exchange-traded products and details security and custody requirements. According to Bitcoin Laws, which tracks the progress of digital assets legislation, Arizona is currently leading the race to become the first US state to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Source: Bitcoin Laws On March 24, two digital assets reserve bills, SB1373 and SB1025, cleared Arizona’s House Rules Committee and are now headed to the state’s House for a full floor vote. If passed by the House, the bills would then need the signature of Arizona’s Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs to become law.

This dramatic development, revealed by Helium founder Amir Haleem on X, marks a significant shift in the ongoing saga between crypto innovators and regulatory bodies. But what exactly does this mean for Helium, for the broader landscape of crypto regulation , and for investors holding HNT and other related tokens? What Sparked the SEC Lawsuit Against Nova Labs? Earlier this year, the SEC initiated legal action against Nova Labs, alleging that the company had been offering and selling unregistered securities . The core of the SEC’s argument revolved around the assertion that Helium’s native token, HNT, along with MOBILE and IoT tokens, qualified as securities under U.S. law. The SEC further claimed that Nova Labs had misled investors regarding the nature and risks associated with these digital assets. To recap the SEC’s accusations: Unregistered Securities Sales: The SEC contended that Nova Labs had sold HNT, MOBILE, and IoT tokens without proper registration, violating securities laws. Misleading Investors: The lawsuit suggested that Nova Labs had not been transparent enough about the risks and nature of these crypto assets, potentially misleading investors. Helium (HNT) Community Celebrates a Major Victory The news of the SEC withdrawing its lawsuit has been met with jubilation within the Helium community. For months, the legal cloud cast a shadow over the project, creating uncertainty and potentially hindering growth and adoption. With the lawsuit now dropped, Helium HNT and its ecosystem can breathe a collective sigh of relief and refocus on its mission of building a decentralized wireless infrastructure. The dismissal is widely seen as a significant win for Nova Labs and a potential indicator of shifting winds in the regulatory approach towards certain types of crypto projects. It raises questions about the SEC’s criteria for classifying digital assets as securities and whether this case signals a more nuanced perspective. Impact on Crypto Regulation and the Industry This development arrives at a crucial juncture for the cryptocurrency industry, which has been grappling with regulatory ambiguity and increased scrutiny from agencies like the SEC. The decision to drop the SEC Lawsuit against Nova Labs could have several broader implications: Precedent Setting? While each case is unique, this withdrawal might suggest a re-evaluation within the SEC regarding enforcement actions against certain crypto projects, particularly those focused on utility and decentralized infrastructure rather than pure financial speculation. Clarity on Token Classification: The lawsuit’s dismissal could prompt further discussion and hopefully, clearer guidelines on when a digital token is deemed a security. The industry has long called for more explicit rules to foster innovation while ensuring compliance. Investor Confidence Boost: The resolution of the lawsuit could inject renewed confidence into the crypto market, particularly for projects operating in the decentralized infrastructure space. It demonstrates that regulatory challenges can be overcome and that constructive dialogue is possible. What’s Next for Nova Labs and Helium? With the legal hurdle cleared, Nova Labs can now fully concentrate on expanding the Helium network and fostering its ecosystem. The project has ambitious goals for providing decentralized wireless coverage and enabling a range of IoT applications. The lawsuit’s dismissal allows them to move forward without the distraction and burden of costly litigation. Key areas of focus for Helium moving forward could include: Network Expansion: Continuing to grow the global network of Helium hotspots, enhancing coverage and capacity. Ecosystem Development: Encouraging more applications and use cases to be built on top of the Helium network, driving demand for HNT and network usage. Community Engagement: Further strengthening the Helium community, which is a vital component of its decentralized model. Navigating the Complexities of Unregistered Securities in Crypto The core issue in the SEC’s lawsuit was the classification of HNT and other tokens as unregistered securities . This remains a central challenge for many crypto projects. Understanding what constitutes a security under the Howey Test and other legal frameworks is crucial for projects operating in the U.S. market. Here are some key takeaways for crypto projects regarding securities compliance: Aspect Consideration Token Utility Demonstrating genuine utility beyond just investment can strengthen arguments against security classification. Decentralization A higher degree of decentralization in governance and operations may be viewed more favorably by regulators. Disclosure Transparency and clear communication with investors about risks and tokenomics are essential. Legal Counsel Seeking expert legal advice early on is crucial to navigate the complex regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Ray of Hope for Crypto Innovation? The SEC’s decision to drop the lawsuit against Nova Labs is undoubtedly a positive development for Helium and the wider crypto space. While it doesn’t necessarily signal a complete shift in regulatory stance, it does offer a glimmer of hope that regulators may be adopting a more nuanced approach, considering the unique characteristics of decentralized technologies and their potential benefits. For now, the Helium community and crypto enthusiasts alike can celebrate this victory and look forward to continued innovation in the decentralized wireless space.

This legislation, which has passed through both the Senate and the House, aims to prevent the IRS from enforcing tax reporting requirements on DeFi protocols. The move is seen as a key development in crypto regulation. Donald Trump Signs First Crypto-Related Bill Into Law According to ex-Fox journalist Eleanor Terret, the US president Donald Trump has signed the resolution into law imminently. Two sources familiar with the matter said President Donald Trump has signed the resolution, with Senator Ted Cruz attending the event as its lead sponsor in the Senate. SCOOP: President Trump is expected to sign Congress’s joint resolution to overturn the IRS DeFi broker rule into law imminently, according to two people familiar with the plans. @SenTedCruz , who introduced the joint resolution in the Senate, is expected to be present at the… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 10, 2025 The bill marks the first time a US president will sign a crypto-related bill into law. It comes after weeks of legislative activity, during which both chambers of Congress passed versions of the resolution with broad bipartisan support. The Senate passed the final version of the bill on March 26 with a 70–28 vote after the House approved it on March 11. Overview of the Repealed IRS Rule The IRS DeFi broker rule, introduced during the Biden administration, was designed to expand existing tax reporting requirements to DeFi platforms. Consequently, these platforms are required to report gross proceeds from crypto transactions and provide identifying details about the parties involved. The rule was part of a broader effort to close tax gaps and improve oversight in the cryptocurrency sector. However, the rule drew criticism from the crypto industry and some lawmakers. Opponents argued that the decentralized structure of DeFi protocols makes it difficult or impossible to gather user data or file tax reports. Many, however, said that enforcing such requirements would hinder development and discourage innovation in the blockchain space. Congressional Action and Political Support The resolution to overturn the IRS rule passed with broad support in both chambers of Congress. Although a similar resolution passed in the Senate earlier in March, a revised version originated in the House due to rules governing tax-related legislation. The final Senate vote on March 26 completed the process and sent the resolution to President Donald Trump. Senator Ted Cruz, who introduced the resolution, stated that the IRS rule was “an attack on emerging technologies that could transform financial systems.” As a result, the legislation received support from lawmakers who emphasized the need for clear, innovation-friendly policies on crypto regulation. David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto advisor, confirmed President Donald Trump supports eliminating the rule. Sacks said the administration aims to protect decentralized technologies from what it sees as overregulation. Implications After Donald Trump Sign Once signed into law by Donald Trump, the resolution will exempt DeFi platforms from complying with certain IRS tax reporting obligations. This will, as a result, give developers and operators of decentralized protocols more freedom to operate without facing regulatory penalties for noncompliance with rules they cannot practically follow. The repeal also signals a shift in how federal policymakers view crypto technologies. With this bill, US President Donald Trump will formalize a new stance on crypto regulation that emphasizes technological growth and decentralized innovation. Industry groups like the DeFi Education Fund have supported the resolution and called it a step toward more practical crypto policy in the United States.

43196201,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148496,1744341057,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Fusion: Google DeepMind to Merge Gemini and Veo Models,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gemini-veo-ai-models-fusion/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts and tech aficionados! Google DeepMind is about to unleash a game-changer in the AI world. Imagine a future where AI not only understands text and images but also grasps the nuances of the physical world through video. That future is inching closer as Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently unveiled plans to combine their cutting-edge Gemini and Veo AI models . Why Merge Gemini and Veo? Unveiling the Vision In a fascinating discussion on the “Possible” podcast, Hassabis articulated Google’s ambitious vision for a “universal digital assistant.” This isn’t just about creating another chatbot; it’s about building an AI that can truly assist you in the real world. The key to this? Multimodal AI . Gemini , designed from the ground up to be multimodal, is poised to become even more powerful by integrating with Veo , Google’s advanced video-generating model. Here’s a breakdown of the core idea: Enhanced World Understanding: By combining Gemini with Veo , Google aims to equip Gemini AI models with a deeper understanding of the physical world. Veo’s video processing capabilities will enrich Gemini’s knowledge base beyond text and images. Universal Digital Assistant: The ultimate goal is to create an AI assistant that’s not limited to digital interactions but can bridge the gap between the digital and physical realms, offering more comprehensive and context-aware support. The Rise of Omni Models: This move aligns with the broader industry trend toward “omni” models – AI systems capable of processing and generating various media formats. Google, alongside competitors like OpenAI and Amazon, is pushing the boundaries of what AI can do. Veo’s Secret Weapon: YouTube’s Vast Video Data Where does Veo get its incredible ability to understand the physical world from video? The answer, according to Hassabis, lies in YouTube. Google’s ownership of YouTube provides a massive trove of video data, which is crucial for training Veo . Hassabis hinted that Veo 2 learns “the physics of the world” by watching “a lot of YouTube videos.” This raises some interesting points: Data is King: Training these advanced AI models requires enormous datasets of diverse media – text, images, audio, and especially video. YouTube’s vast library is a significant asset for Google in this AI race. Ethical Considerations: Google has acknowledged using “some” YouTube content for training, adhering to agreements with creators. However, the scale of data usage for training omni models raises ongoing discussions about data privacy and creator compensation in the age of AI. Competitive Advantage: Access to YouTube’s video data gives Google a distinct advantage in developing video-understanding AI models compared to companies without such a vast video platform. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? While the immediate impact on the cryptocurrency world might not be direct, the advancements in AI models like Gemini and Veo have broader implications: Smarter Applications: More sophisticated AI models can lead to smarter applications across various sectors, including potentially impacting how blockchain technology is used and developed. Imagine AI-powered tools for analyzing crypto market trends or enhancing blockchain security. Increased Efficiency: As AI models become more adept at understanding complex data, they can drive efficiency gains in various industries, potentially including the crypto space. New Possibilities: The development of omni models opens up entirely new possibilities we haven’t even imagined yet. From enhanced virtual experiences to more intuitive human-computer interactions, the future powered by advanced AI models is brimming with potential. The Road Ahead for Gemini and Veo The integration of Gemini and Veo is not just a minor upgrade; it’s a strategic move by Google DeepMind to push the boundaries of AI models . As the industry moves towards more comprehensive and versatile AI, Google’s approach highlights the importance of multimodal capabilities and access to vast datasets. This fusion promises to deliver: More Context-Aware AI: Gemini will be able to understand and respond to user queries with a richer understanding of the real world, gleaned from video data. Enhanced Creative Tools: Imagine the creative possibilities when a powerful language model like Gemini is combined with a video generation model like Veo . Content creation could reach new heights of sophistication and efficiency. A Leap Towards General AI: While still far from general artificial intelligence, these advancements represent incremental steps toward creating AI that can reason and understand the world in a more human-like way. In conclusion, Google DeepMind’s plan to combine Gemini and Veo is a significant development in the AI landscape. It underscores the industry’s focus on creating multimodal AI that can understand and interact with the world in more comprehensive ways. As these AI models evolve, we can expect to see even more transformative applications across various sectors, paving the way for a future where AI plays an increasingly integral role in our lives.

According to an Apr. 10 press release statement from Rep. Mike Carey (R-Ohio), who introduced the bill alongside Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the president’s signing of the bill marks a major legislative win for the crypto industry and its advocates in Congress. The bill repeals an IRS DeFi broker rule finalized at the end of 2024 that expanded the definition of “broker” to include decentralized finance platforms and other non-custodial digital asset services. The rule would have required DeFi platforms, wallet providers, and front-end protocol interfaces to collect user information and report crypto transaction data using Form 1099. “This is the first cryptocurrency bill ever signed into law and the first tax-related Congressional Review Act of Disapproval signed into law,” Rep. Carey said in a statement. He added that the rule “needlessly hindered American innovation” and would have overwhelmed the IRS with compliance demands it is unequipped to handle. “By repealing this misguided rule, President Trump and Congress have given the IRS an opportunity to return its focus to the duties and obligations it already owes to American taxpayers instead of creating a new series of bureaucratic hurdles.” — Mike Carey, Ohio Congressman You might also like: OpenSea pushes SEC to drop exchange, broker designation for NFT marketplaces The resolution, known as H.J.Res.25, passed the Senate on Mar. 4, 2025, and the House on Mar. 11. Due to its budget-related implications, the bill required a final Senate vote , which occurred on Mar. 26, before being sent to the president’s desk. Trump’s signature ensures the rule “shall have no force or effect,” and prevents the IRS from issuing a similar rule without explicit Congressional approval under the CRA. The White House had already voiced support for the resolution, calling the rule a “midnight regulation” introduced during the final days of the Biden administration. The signing comes amid a wider regulatory shift in Washington. In recent months, the Securities and Exchange Commission under acting chair Mark Uyeda dropped lawsuits against firms like Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. On Apr. 8, the Department of Justice also disbanded its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, citing strategic missteps. In another major development, Paul Atkins, a long-time SEC commissioner and crypto advocate, is set to officially take office as the new SEC chair after Senate confirmation . With Atkins in office, industry insiders expect the agency to shift focus away from enforcement towards a more supportive environment for crypto innovation.

The move marks a major rollback of a Biden-era tax reporting measure and further signals Trump’s alignment with the crypto industry. Finalized in late 2024, the IRS rule was meant to clarify that new broker reporting requirements also applied to DeFi platforms. The rule was not yet in force but was scheduled to take effect in 2026. It aimed to ensure crypto users paid taxes on asset sales. The Treasury estimated that billions in crypto-related taxes were going uncollected each year. HISTORY MADE Just now, @POTUS signed my bill to repeal to the IRS DeFi Crypto Broker Rule. This is the first cryptocurrency bill EVER signed into law by a president. @HouseGOP is working to keep America as the crypto capital of the world! — Congressman Mike Carey (@RepMikeCarey) April 10, 2025 Regulators Face Resistance After Expanding Broker Scope to DeFi The rule drew sharp criticism from the digital asset industry. DeFi platforms, unlike centralized exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, do not act as intermediaries. They also lack access to user identities. Executives and developers said the rule was technically impossible to follow and legally risky. They warned it placed unworkable burdens on protocols built to be permissionless. Industry lobbying intensified after the IRS expanded the definition of “broker” to include software-based DeFi tools. Crypto advocates called the move government overreach, warning it would push development overseas. Republicans backed their concerns and moved to block the rule using the Congressional Review Act. Trump Backs Crypto Industry in Reversing DeFi Tax Mandate In March, both chambers of Congress passed the resolution with a simple majority . The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that repealing the rule could cost the government nearly $4b over ten years. Despite the projected loss, lawmakers supporting the repeal argued that privacy, technical feasibility and innovation were more important. Rep. Mike Carey said: “The DeFi Broker Rule needlessly hindered American innovation, infringed on the privacy of everyday Americans, and was set to overwhelm the IRS with an overflow of new filings that it doesn’t have the infrastructure to handle during tax season.” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith added that with Trump’s signature, Congress had reaffirmed its authority to write tax law rather than leaving it to regulators. Trump has positioned himself as a strong supporter of the crypto industry, pledging to make the US a global hub for digital assets. His administration quickly moved to establish a federal working group on crypto regulation and announced a national Bitcoin reserve strategy within weeks of his inauguration.

In an Apr. 11 blog post on its official Medium page, Helium called the outcome “a major win for Helium ( HNT ) and The People’s Network.” The dismissal resolves long-standing uncertainty about the regulatory status of its three main tokens, HNT, IOT, and MOBILE. The SEC has agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning the agency cannot pursue the same charges again in the future. Helium credited the agency’s new leadership for bringing clarity to crypto infrastructure projects, which has helped close a chapter that had created uncertainty for the wider Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network sector. According to Helium , this legal outcome provides clarity that selling hardware and distributing tokens to promote network growth does not automatically classify them as securities under U.S. law.

According to court documents reviewed by Yahoo Finance, Nova Labs agreed to pay the SEC to settle civil securities fraud charges over allegedly misleading investors during a fundraising round in 2021–2022. The SEC accused the company of exaggerating partnerships with Nestle, Lime, and Salesforce to attract investment at a $1 billion valuation. Nova Labs did not admit or deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The SEC originally filed the lawsuit in January, shortly before former Chair Gary Gensler stepped down. Since then, under the new Trump administration, the SEC has dropped several high-profile cases against crypto firms including Coinbase, Kraken, and Consensys. In addition, Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly regulator and advocate, was confirmed as the new SEC chairman on Apr. 10. Atkins is expected to steer the agency towards clearer digital asset rules that promote innovation.

This Undervalued DeFi Coin Might Be the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/this-undervalued-defi-coin-might-be-the-best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-now/,"The post Next Crypto to Hit $1? This Undervalued DeFi Coin Might Be the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto market steadily recovers and interest in smaller-cap tokens grows, a handful of projects are beginning to attract serious attention from analysts and early investors alike. One of the latest names to spark conversation is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a relatively new decentralized finance protocol that some believe is quietly setting itself up to be the next crypto to hit $1. Currently priced at $0.025 during its presale, MUTM is already gaining traction among those looking for value-driven opportunities in the DeFi crypto space. So what’s fueling the confidence behind this price target? A combination of real world utility, well-structured tokenomics, increasing investor interest, and a product launch timeline that adds momentum to the outlook. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What makes Mutuum different from many other emerging tokens is its clear focus on solving an actual problem. The platform offers a decentralized, non-custodial system where users can lend or borrow digital assets through smart contracts. This includes both pooled lending, where users earn passive yield by providing liquidity, and peer-to-peer agreements for more tailored loan terms. When lenders deposit assets into the protocol, they receive mtTokens in return, which accumulate interest automatically. Borrowers, meanwhile, can access liquidity by locking up collateral, giving them access to funds without selling their underlying holdings. This kind of structure puts Mutuum in line with other working DeFi crypto models but with a few key updates that improve usability and transparency. With over $6.4 million already raised and thousands of users joining the presale, MUTM is already showing signs of strong early adoption. Unlike tokens that rely on hype, Mutuum’s steady growth has been driven by functionality, roadmap clarity, and growing confidence from both retail investors and crypto investment analysts. The protocol’s total token supply is capped at 4 billion, offering a clear sense of structure for future valuation. With the token priced at just $0.025 in the current presale phase, a move to $1 would represent a 40x return. While that may sound ambitious, analysts point to a number of factors that make this target plausible within a reasonable timeframe. For example, an investor putting in $1,000 at the current presale price would receive 40,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $1, that same position would be worth $40,000 — a significant return made possible by entering early in a project with measurable fundamentals and market potential. Unlike many presale projects that take months or even years to deliver a product, Mutuum is preparing to launch a beta version of its platform around the time the token goes live. This means users will be able to engage with the core protocol features almost immediately, rather than speculating on future development. Access to a working product from day one can play a major role in supporting early token demand. Users will be able to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral as soon as the platform is live, tying MUTM’s value directly to real world utility and platform activity. Another component analysts are watching closely is the way revenue generated by the platform is tied to MUTM’s token economy. A portion of the interest paid by borrowers is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market. These are then distributed to holders of mtTokens, introducing consistent buy pressure and providing rewards for those who engage with the platform. This built-in feedback loop encourages long-term participation and helps stabilize token demand as usage grows. As more borrowers use the platform, more revenue flows back into MUTM, supporting price growth in a measurable way. Why $1 Isn’t Out of Reach With all of these elements in place, the $1 target is beginning to look less like speculation and more like a strategic milestone. From its current presale price, it would only take modest adoption and platform engagement to justify a climb to that level — especially with the protocol’s low market cap and focused use case. Early-stage tokens often see dramatic appreciation once they reach public markets and begin generating real activity. For Mutuum Finance, the presence of a functioning protocol, combined with strong tokenomics and increasing visibility, creates a pathway that analysts believe makes the $1 mark achievable, not aspirational. Many are beginning to see MUTM as the next big cryptocurrency, backed by infrastructure and demand rather than narrative alone. For those still considering whether to participate, the current presale window may be one of the last opportunities to get in before exchange listings and product rollout begin to change the pricing floor. In short, Mutuum Finance isn’t trying to sell hype. It’s building infrastructure that works — and that’s exactly what long-term crypto investment seekers are starting to notice.

He used a UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart to map out the price XRP holders acquired their coins. According to Martinez, the data points to key support zones at $1.39 and $1.67, with major resistance forming at $2.04 and $2.38. $XRP key support levels sit at $1.67 and $1.39, while major resistance stands at $2.04 and $2.38! pic.twitter.com/VpmCwaU9tK — Ali (@ali_charts) April 9, 2025 Realized Price Distribution Reveals Holder Behavior The URPD chart shows the volume of XRP moved at different price levels, providing insight into where investors may become active again. At the $1.39 level, roughly 1.29 billion XRP were last moved, while $1.67 accounts for over 1.15 billion. These prices mark significant cost bases and could act as support as investors look to defend those positions. On the resistance side, $2.04 and $2.38 stand out. More than 1.12 billion XRP were moved at $2.04, and $2.38 is even more substantial, representing 2.13 billion XRP, making it the largest concentration in the higher price range. Following the digital asset’s recent decline , Martinez’s post highlights crucial levels to watch as it attempts to recover. These levels suggest where sell pressure may increase as XRP approaches previous break-even zones. Large Accumulation Below $1 While Martinez focused on upper-level price zones, the chart also reveals a large cluster of transactions in the $0.44–$0.57 range. One bar in this region shows over 6 billion XRP moved, the highest on the chart. Though not highlighted as immediate support, this accumulation is a broader structural base and reflects strong historical buying interest at lower levels.

Each bar represents how much XRP moved at specific price levels, and higher bars indicate a stronger potential influence in future price action. While he avoided direct predictions, his use of the URPD data presents a more grounded approach to determining support and resistance based on actual market behavior. The asset’s low price also presents a good buying opportunity, as one expert recently described buying now as a no-brainer . XRP is trading at $1.99 after a 13.15% increase from yesterday. With the digital asset trading between large clusters of realized volume, price movement through or rejection at these key levels may determine the next trend, and the next crucial level to watch is $2.04.

Despite this plunge in spot trading volume, the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has continued to lead other platforms, with its share of spot volume increasing by the end of the first quarter. Binance Leads Spot Volume Market According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, bitcoin’s spot trading volume on exchanges fell from a high of $44 billion on February 3 to $10 billion by the end of Q1. Likewise, the total altcoin spot trading volume on crypto trading platforms plummeted from $122 billion to $23 billion within the same period. While total spot trading volume generally declined, Binance saw more trading activity compared to other crypto exchanges. This indicates that trading volumes on other exchanges reduced much faster than on Binance and that the world’s leading crypto platform became the largest liquidity venue during periods of higher market volatility. From February 3 to the end of Q1, Binance’s share of total Bitcoin spot trading volume rose from 33% to 49%, while that of altcoins spiked from 38% to 44%. Binance now accounts for almost 50% of total crypto spot trading volume. Largest Liquidity Venue During Volatility Substantiating the claim that Binance becomes the venue for the largest trading liquidity in times of high volatility, CryptoQuant revealed that the exchange’s spot trading volume surpassed that of all other platforms combined between February 24 and 26, when BTC plummeted from $96,000 to $90,000. Bitcoin’s decline during those two days triggered a substantial correction in the crypto market, affecting other coins; however, Binance’s altcoin spot trading volume rose to 64%, adding a total of $18 billion. In addition, CryptoQuant discovered that some altcoins have shown relatively high spot trading volumes despite the overall market correction. Market participants are trading large-cap assets like Binance Coin (BNB), Toncoin (TON), and EOS (EOS) with relatively high activity on Binance, regardless of the decline in crypto volumes. Meanwhile, Binance is planning to delist several altcoins on April 16, including Badger (BADGER), Balancer (BAL), Beta Finance (BETA), Cream (CREAM), Cortex (CTXC), aelf (ELF), Firo (FIRO), and Kava Lend (HARD). The delisting follows a collective decision by users via the exchange’s Vote to Delist mechanism.

CryptoQuant analysts said in an April 10 markets report that if Bitcoin ( BTC ) “continues to rally,” it could hit resistance around the $84,000 price level, but if it breaks through, it could soar before its next resistance level of $96,000. Bitcoin’s previous support levels are now resistance “These price levels have acted as price support during this bull cycle but can now act as price resistance if bullish conditions don’t continue to improve,” CryptoQuant said in its report. “This has been the case in past bearish cycles.” Bitcoin was trading at $79,474 at the time of publication, down 3.5% over the past day, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 2.24% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap April has been a volatile month for Bitcoin. US President Donald Trump ramped up global tariffs on April 2, which triggered fear in financial markets, before later abruptly pausing them for 90 days and softening the bearish momentum. Bitcoin briefly rose above $85,000 on April 1, but it pulled back to around $76,000 by April 8 due to uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff plans. CryptoQuant said prices recovered “most of the lost ground” on April 9, after Trump announced the 90-day pause on tariffs to all countries except China, which have now been ramped up to 145%. Bitcoin may first find resistance at $84,000 and then at the $96,000 area. Source: CryptoQuant After Trump’s tariff pause announcement on April 9, both the crypto and broader financial markets saw a wider surge. Bitcoin surged by approximately 9%, reversing most of the losses it incurred earlier in the week, to retest $83,000. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest public US companies , closed 9.52% higher, its third-largest single-day gain since World War II. The Nasdaq 100 posted a 12.02% gain over the trading day. Abra Global CEO Bill Barhydt said in an April 10 X post that it may only be a matter of months before Bitcoin sees its price go almost 29% above its $109,000 all-time high set in January. “Bitcoin is a levered bet on tech stocks, and all of it is going up and to the right,” Barhydt said, adding that Bitcoin may go as high as $130,000 to $140,000 by late June.

CryptoQuant said that of the ten bull signals it tracks in its Bull Score Index, only one is still active, with Bitcoin trading above its 365-day moving average.

She said that without appropriate safeguards, the “unchecked proliferation of digital assets” undermines US dollar dominance, weakens national security due to criminal activity, and “undermines the stability of financial markets.” Unregulated crypto also subjects investors to “price manipulation and rigged markets,” facilitates fraud that “drains billions of dollars from hardworking Americans, and extracts assets and investments from the American economy,” she said. An excerpt of James’ letter to Congress. Source: Office of the New York State Attorney General James made a number of recommendations and pushed Congress for legislation that would require stablecoin issuers to have a US presence and regulatory oversight and mandate backing stablecoins with US dollars or treasuries. She also wants regulations that require platforms to work only with anti-money laundering-compliant entities, establish registration requirements for issuers and intermediaries, protect against conflicts of interest and promote price transparency and require fraud prevention measures. No crypto assets in pension funds The New York’s top lawyer also aired her concerns about including crypto in pension funds. “Digital assets are uniquely unsuitable for retirement savings due to their high volatility,” she said, claiming that they have no value. “The underlying value of cryptocurrency is unpredictable and not determined by true price discovery because they have no intrinsic value on which their prices are based.” James also urged against retirement funds investing in crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds, stating that “unlike traditional exchange-traded funds backed by stocks and bonds, cryptocurrency held to back cryptocurrency ETFs are at risk of permanent theft.” Related: US lawmaker will reintroduce crypto retirement bill to help Trump agenda “As Congress takes the mantle to propose legislation governing the cryptocurrency industry, we hope it also takes action to mitigate the risks posed by the industry to America’s national security, financial stability, and citizens,” James said.

The macro uncertainty and Trump tariff war escalation have cast dark clouds on the crypto space, impacting XRP equally, despite key developments in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit. XRP Price In A Make It or Break It Position XRP price has been flirting at a crucial support of $2.0, and any directional move can decide the next market action. In the last 24 hours, the Ripple cryptocurrency has bounced back once again from the $1.9 levels and is currently trading at $2.0. However, the daily trading volumes have crashed 51% to $4.21 billion. Although the bounce back has been sharp, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that XRP needs to surge past this breakout zone to continue with the rally. As shown in the image below, XRP price is forming a head and shoulders pattern. Also, the immediate support is $1.80, while the gates of a 40% drop to $1.20 are still open. Source: Ali Martinez However, if the Ripple cryptocurrency manages to roar back above $2.0, it can chart its path for an upside breakout to $22, $30, and beyond. Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto cited the multi-year time-frame, stating that the breakout on a multi-year timeframe can lead to a strong breakout on the upside. The analyst noted: “I’m looking at the last pump from the 2017 cycle, which was an incredible 2,600%! Starting from $1.20, if we see a retracement back to the edge of the triangle, then $30 is definitely within reach!” Source: EGRAG Crypto On-Chain and Ripple Lawsuit Developments XRP’s on-chain metrics highlight huge growth for the Ripple blockchain. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez reports that over 6.26 million addresses now hold at least one XRP, marking a record high for the network. This milestone highlights strong investor confidence despite ongoing market volatility. At the same time, talks of a spot XRP ETF are also on the rise amid positive developments in the Ripple lawsuit, which can be a catalyst to XRP price upside. On Thursday, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs have jointly filed a pivotal motion following their settlement of the XRP lawsuit .

However, this upward momentum was short-lived as Trump’s rapid imposition of tariffs introduced new uncertainty, triggering volatility and a pullback in trading activity, according to blockchain analytics firm Kaiko’s Q1 2025 report. Kaiko reported that weekly trading volumes for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the top 10 altcoins fell by 30% compared to pre-election levels observed in November 2024. Average weekly volume stood at $266 billion in Q1. The decline was primarily due to the decline in demand for altcoins and cautious risk appetite, especially on offshore exchanges. “Altcoin volatility has soared in early 2025, reaching multi-year or all-time highs for select tokens, most notably Cardano (ADA),” Kaiko analysts wrote, adding that “Bitcoin’s volatility has also increased sharply, rising from 34% in February to 51% in March.” This widening volatility gap between Bitcoin and altcoins has made some investors more risk-averse and discouraged entry into altcoin markets amid broader macroeconomic concerns. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance, it was not immune to market turbulence in Q1. BTC lost 12% during the quarter, its worst performance since 2018, and is currently trading around 25% below its January peak. It still outperformed most altcoins, especially tokens in the AI and memecoin sectors, which have seen average losses of over 50%. “While expectations for U.S. rate cuts have increased, this is not the kind of dovish turn markets were hoping for,” said Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert. “Risk-off sentiment has weighed on both equities and crypto assets.” Related News: Grayscale, Managing Billion Dollars, Said ""Tariffs Will Benefit Bitcoin"", Explained The Reason Despite a shaky first quarter, analysts believe that Q2 could bring new momentum. Historically, crypto markets tend to outperform in Q2, and several upcoming catalysts could support this pattern. Kaiko’s Adam McCarthy cited Bitcoin’s institutionalization as a key driver, noting that altcoins could benefit in a similar way if exchange-traded products (ETPs) gain regulatory approval. Currently, more than 40 crypto-related ETF applications are awaiting review by new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and his team. “If there is going to be a bull run in the second half of 2025, altcoins will need to see similar uptake,” McCarthy said, adding, “The introduction of ETFs and other investment products could significantly increase demand.” The expanding stablecoin ecosystem is another promising signal, with the total stablecoin supply increasing by 33% since late 2024 to surpass $230 billion. Kaiko noted that growth in this segment, dominated by USDT and USDC, often precedes rallies in the broader crypto markets. Kaiko analysts concluded that continued policy clarity and macroeconomic downturn, as well as a potentially weaker US dollar, could help Bitcoin decouple from traditional assets in the coming months. *This is not investment advice.

President Donald Trump paused his administration's hefty reciprocal tariffs until July 8, but kept a minimum 10% tariff on most countries bar China, which had its rate hiked to 145%. Hashlabs CEO Jaran Mellerud told Cointelegraph that while the 10% levy is much lighter than the initial tariffs, US miners are still at a “clear disadvantage” when it comes to purchasing mining machines compared to competitors abroad . He said the baseline US tariffs aren’t enough “to make mining in the US unprofitable, but it definitely raises capital expenditure and will impact the long-term viability of new investments.” “We expect to see a short-term spike in machine imports as miners rush to get ahead of potential future tariff hikes,” Mellerud added. Source: Jaran Mellerud A price hike on crypto mining rigs is already happening, Luxor Technology’s chief operating officer Ethan Vera told Cointelegraph. “US miners are still looking to purchase machines ahead of the potential further increase in 90 days. In addition, US-landed machines have run up in price, as have contracts with onshore assembly.” On April 2, Trump’s hiked tariffs placed levies on Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia — countries home to three of the largest mining rig manufacturers — at respective rates of 36%, 32% and 24%. Tariff instability will stunt US Bitcoin mining growth Mellerud said in an April 8 report, before the pause on the hiked tariffs, that Trump’s levies could collapse US demand for mining rigs, to the benefit of non-US mining operations, as manufacturers will look outside the US to sell their surplus inventory for cheaper. He told Cointelegraph the now-lowered tariffs would offer some relief for US miners, but imposing the tariffs and then suddenly pausing them only added uncertainty to US Bitcoin mining firms looking to plan and scale. “What miners need is predictability and stable rules — not policy whiplash every few months.” Luxor’s Vera said that the policy changes “will certainly hurt growth” in the US. Related: Bitcoin hashrate tops 1 Zetahash in historic first, trackers show Vera said Luxor has even been forced to rethink its strategy and consider expanding into international markets for future expansion. Trump pledged during his presidential campaign that he wanted all the remaining Bitcoin ( BTC ) to be “made in the USA.” Several members of Trump’s family have also partnered with Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 to lead Bitcoin mining venture “American Bitcoin” late last month. The venture aims to build the world’s largest Bitcoin mining firm with strategic reserves. While the tariffs are broad in nature, the crypto mining industry simply isn’t a “high priority” for the Trump administration, Vera said. Trump’s tariffs have shaken up almost every market, including the crypto markets and Bitcoin, which is down 1.2% over the last 24 hours to $80,555, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now 26% off the $108,786 all-time high it set on Jan. 20 — the same day that Trump returned to the White House. Asia Express: Illegal arcade disguised as … a fake Bitcoin mine?

But interestingly, the news didn’t come from the SEC — it was Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse who confirmed that the long-running legal battle is nearing its end. That’s left many in the XRP community feeling frustrated and a bit skeptical, as they wait for something more official from the SEC. In the latest twist, both Ripple and the SEC have filed a joint motion asking the court to pause the appeal. This is based on their agreement to settle the case — although the settlement still needs to be formally approved by the SEC. Because of this, there won’t be a legal brief filed on April 16th as originally planned. Paul Atkins To Decide What’s Next? Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel weighed in, suggesting that the delay may have something to do with the recent leadership change at the Commission. “Presumably the SEC wanted Atkins at the helm for the vote,” he said, referring to the newly appointed commissioner. “Having him vote on his first day would’ve looked bad — not that his support for the settlement isn’t likely.” He also said that this move avoids any risk of Ripple pulling back from submitting a brief and potentially derailing the process. Attorney Bill Morgan also chimed in with a question that’s on a lot of minds: does the mention of an “indicative ruling” mean the judge is just finalizing the settlement? And does that include removing the injunction against Ripple, which hasn’t been mentioned yet? JUST IN: In a 52-44 vote, the Senate has confirmed Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. https://t.co/jNY1C66FE4 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 9, 2025 Fagel responded, saying we’re in uncharted territory here. He interpreted the language to mean the settlement is contingent on Judge Torres revisiting the injunctive order. If she refuses to modify it, then the appeal — and possibly Ripple’s cross-appeal — could still move forward. All in all, while this case seems to be nearly over, a few key pieces still need to fall into place. Until the SEC signs off and the court weighs in, Ripple supporters will be watching closely — hoping this really is the end of one of crypto’s biggest legal battles.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 05:10:35

The filing signals a possible end to a high-profile dispute that has gripped the payments upstart industry since December 2020 for its sale of XRP tokens , which the SEC alleged were unregistered securities. The case has been a focal point for debates over the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies in the United States, with Ripple arguing that XRP is a currency, not a security, and thus outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. Ripple and the SEC have reached an “agreement in principle” to resolve all outstanding issues, per a post shared by attorney James Filan. This includes not only the SEC’s appeal of the district court’s final judgment but also Ripple’s cross-appeal and the claims against Ripple founders Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. The motion requests that the court hold the appeals process in abeyance — effectively pausing it — while the parties hammer out the final terms of the settlement, which still requires formal approval from the SEC’s commissioners. This follows a similar request from the SEC and Gemini in early April , where the two parties requested the court approve a two-month pause to finalize a deal to close their long-running legal dispute over Gemini's Earn program.",Policy|XRP|Ripple|SEC,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-11 05:20:39

Now, its dismissal with prejudice confirms the SEC cannot revisit the charges. Meanwhile, the SEC recently issued new guidance to provide some more clarity on crypto disclosures, but it stopped short of defining what constitutes a security. While the lawsuits against other crypto companies were dropped, Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. settled with New York regulators for $40 million over Cash App compliance failures. SEC Ends Legal Battle With Helium The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially dropped its lawsuit against Nova Labs, the company behind the decentralized wireless network Helium. This is according to a blog post that was published by Helium on April 10. The suit was originally filed in January of 2025, and it alleged that Nova Labs issued unregistered securities when it launched its native token, Helium (HNT), in 2019. However, the SEC’s dismissal of the case “with prejudice” means the agency cannot pursue similar charges against the company again. This was one of the last enforcement actions that was initiated under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who resigned after the inauguration of President Donald Trump on Jan. 20. The agency's decision to drop the case coincided with Paul Atkins, a Trump nominee and known crypto-friendly policymaker, officially taking over as SEC Chair. Helium stated that the outcome of the case confirms the legality of its operations, particularly the distribution of HNT, IOT, and MOBILE tokens, as well as the sale of Helium-compatible Hotspots. The company believes that the SEC's decision affirms these tokens are not securities and that hardware distribution for network expansion does not automatically fall under securities law. HNT’s market cap since launch (Source: CoinMarkletCap ) The Helium network enables people to build and operate decentralized wireless infrastructure, and currently hosts around 375,000 active hotspots. While HNT’s market capitalization sits near $506 million, it is still far from its all-time high of over $5 billion from November of 2021. The SEC’s retreat from aggressive crypto enforcement signals a sharp pivot in regulatory policy since Trump assumed office. Under Gensler, the agency launched more than 100 enforcement actions targeting crypto firms. But since January, the SEC dropped cases against several high-profile entities including Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, and Uniswap. Trump made his pro-crypto stance very clear, and vowed to turn the US into a global crypto hub. Despite this shift, not all industry participants are optimistic. Some executives worry that Trump’s other policies, like newly announced tariffs on US imports, could ultimately hinder the industry’s growth despite the new regulatory relief. SEC Staff Offers Crypto Firms Clarity The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance recently issued a staff statement offering some guidance on how federal securities laws might apply to the crypto industry. While the statement holds no legal force, it was made to clarify disclosure expectations for companies issuing or dealing with digital assets that could be considered securities. The Division clarified that its views are based on observations from past disclosures and feedback from market participants. Part of the SEC’s staff statement (Source: SEC ) According to the SEC staff, crypto firms have typically shared various details about their operations, like the nature of their business, the functionality of their tokens, and how they plan to generate revenue. The guidance suggests that companies should also disclose whether they intend to stay active in a blockchain network or application after its launch and identify any successors who may assume operational responsibilities. The staff further recommended that disclosures should include technical specifics about the underlying blockchain, including whether it uses proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, block size, transaction speed, incentive structures, network security features, and whether the code is open-source. These elements help paint a clearer picture of the project for regulators and investors. While the guidance reiterated that tokens not classified as securities or part of an investment contract are not subject to registration requirements, it did not provide concrete criteria for determining what qualifies as a security. Despite this omission, legal experts like Joe Carlasare welcomed the statement as a positive move toward more predictable and consistent regulation. He believes that following these guidelines could help firms position themselves more favorably with regulators. (Source: SEC ) The SEC also urged crypto companies to disclose all relevant risks, including price volatility, cybersecurity concerns, custody arrangements, and standard business and legal risks. The guidance stated that issuers should provide a “materially complete description” of any token considered a security. This includes how dividends or distributions are handled, voting rights, and who holds the authority to change smart contracts or protocol code. Firms should also disclose whether such smart contracts have undergone third-party security audits. Additionally, the Division recommended that firms specify whether a token has a fixed supply, how and when it was or will be issued, and who the key executives or major employees are. The SEC plans to build on this initiative by organizing a series of roundtables through its Crypto Task Force to engage with the industry on issues including crypto trading, custody, tokenization, and decentralized finance. Block Settles for $40M Over Cash App Violations While Helium is now off the hook with the SEC, Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. recently agreed to a $40 million settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services over allegations related to compliance failures in its Cash App platform. According to Bloomberg , which reviewed the consent order, the settlement follows an investigation into Cash App’s anti-money laundering and crypto compliance practices. Regulators concluded that Block allegedly failed to meet consumer protection requirements, did not perform adequate due diligence on its customers, and was slow to report suspicious transactions involving high-risk Bitcoin activity. Although Block confirmed it worked with the NYDFS to resolve the matter, it did not admit to any wrongdoing. The company stated that the settlement primarily relates to legacy compliance issues. The agreement is the second major fine Block faced this year already, after an earlier $80 million settlement with multiple state regulators over similar AML concerns. Despite these regulatory setbacks, Block’s financial performance stayed very resilient through the end of 2024. The company reported a 4.5% increase in year-over-year revenue, reaching $6.03 billion, while earnings per share jumped by 51% to $0.71. Merchant gross payment volume also grew by 10%, totaling $61.95 billion. Cash App, which is the central driver of Block’s business, recorded $1.38 billion in gross profit during the fourth quarter and maintained a strong user base of over 57 million monthly transacting users in early 2024. Cash App has supported Bitcoin purchases since 2018 and has taken steps to improve its crypto functionality, including a 2023 integration with TaxBit to simplify crypto tax reporting for users.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|HNT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-11 05:22:47
43199916,https://nulltx.com/?p=147908,1744349031,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Bitcoin Losses Shift to Older Cohorts, Indicating Broadening Capitulation",https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-losses-shift-to-older-cohorts-indicating-broadening-capitulation/,"The past few months have seen Bitcoin’s price shifts trigger a really big shift in the pattern of realized losses that affect us all. And what is that pattern? We now have a pretty solid transition from younger to older coins when it comes to shelling out and accepting realized losses. You used to be able to count on the fact that if someone was going to go out and realize a loss on their Bitcoin, it was likely going to be someone who had just acquired it. But not anymore. Seems like a lot more people are giving up. So, who exactly is giving up? Our main suspects are people who have held their coins for three to six months. The change in loss realization is quite pronounced, showing that even mid-term holders—who usually have a long-term outlook and can tolerate some amount of market volatility—are now bailing on their positions. This could be read as a sign of market weakness and an intensifying sense of uncertainty that has even experienced holders selling at a loss. The Evolution of Loss Realization Throughout 2025 In the early part of the year, the realized losses from Bitcoin sell-offs were largely coming from the younger coins. Most of these losses were coming from people who had recently bought their Bitcoin (either last month or three months ago). By February 27, for instance, when the price dropped to $86.7k, the total realized losses hit $51 million. The groups that were mostly selling were the ones that had held their Bitcoin for either one week to one month or one month to three months. They accounted for over 50% of these losses. Meanwhile, the next group up (three months to six months) was hardly selling at all and only accounted for 0.8% of those losses. This is how the losses were shared on February 27: – Price of Bitcoin: $86.7K – Total realized losses: $51M – 1 week–1 month cohort: $13.1M (25.7%) – 1 month–3 months cohort: $14.4M (28.2%) – 3 months–6 months cohort: $0.4M (0.8%) By then, it was evident that the losses were occurring among coins that had been recently bought. This indicated that newer holders were the ones reacting to price dips that were clearly short-term in nature. The reason for this part of the selling seemed to be the same as for the earlier part: fear, and possibly panic. The Shift Begins: Older Holders React to Market Pressure By the next day, February 28, 2023, (in 2023, beginnings are visible) a change compositionwise in the losses taken was already visible. While the price of Bitcoin had slipped a little to $83.7k, the losses being borne by the cohort of holders aged 3 to 6 months had surged nearly fivefold from the previous day. This was potentially the first sign of something worth noticing in all of this: older holders, who in most cases seem to be enduring price swings in the expectation of long-term gains, started to take some action in response to a downturn. On the 28th of February, the following losses were realized: – Price of Bitcoin: $83.7k – Overall losses taken: $51.1M – Losses from the 1w–1m cohort: $16.9M (33.1%) – Losses from the 1m–3m cohort: $12.3M (24.0%) – Losses from the 3m–6m cohort: $1.9M (3.8%) Here, the 1w-1m cohort’s share of losses surged to 33.1%, signaling that some short-term holders were still under pressure, while the 3m-6m cohort’s share grew to 3.8%. This shift in the loss composition suggested that the pain was spreading beyond the more recent investors, with mid-term holders starting to feel the strain. Broadening Capitulation: April 2025 Data Shows Even Split April 7 generated what are hopefully the final data to show how even the losses on Bitcoin are becoming. With the price of Bitcoin at $78.9k, total realized losses dropped to a low of $34.4 million. Yet, the composition of those losses is pretty interesting. Just about as many mid-term holders (holding for 1 month to 1 year) are cashing out and taking losses as are short-term holders (holding for 1 week to 1 month). Additionally, even more long-term holders (holding for 3 to 6 months) seem to be taking losses. This last point is particularly serious. It indicates that more and more people who bought Bitcoin last fall are shaking it off. Also, this seems to be a shift from the typical As of April 7, the losses were broken down as follows: – Bitcoin price: $78.9k – Total realized losses: $34.4M – 1w–1m cohort: $8.2M (23.8%) – 1m–3m cohort: $6.5M (18.9%) – 3m–6m cohort: $6.7M (19.4%) An even split between short-term and mid-term holders, with the 3m–6m cohort now accounting for 19.4% of total realized losses, suggests that the market is seeing a broadening of capitulation. This is often a precursor to a market bottom. The increase in losses from older cohorts indicates that more holders are choosing to sell and lock in their losses rather than wait for a market recovery. They seem to be acting on what is now a fairly consensus opinion among traders that the near-term price outlook is pretty dismal. In comparison to previous large #Bitcoin sell-offs YTD, losses are now spreading to older coins – especially in the 3m–6m group, whose share in loss realization jumped from 0.8% to 19.4% of total losses since Feb 27: pic.twitter.com/cShuvGCuLz — glassnode (@glassnode) April 9, 2025 What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Price Outlook? The market is receiving a very important signal from the change in loss acceptance from younger Bitcoin holders to older Bitcoin holders. This is such a clear and compelling signal that I believe it deserves a section of its own to discuss what it might imply for the price of Bitcoin going forward. The first thing to understand is that the kind of signal this loss acceptance shift is broadcasting is very similar to the type of signal that is often seen at the tail end of a market correction: This data may provide a possible buying chance for investors keeping an eye on the market, particularly if they think the present sell-off is approaching its conclusion. Otherwise, if things keep getting worse in the broader market, there’s definite downside risk for any buying we’re doing at this point. Moving deeper into 2025, it is vital to keep an eye on whether this surrender trend goes on and how it could influence the price of Bitcoin in the long run.

This inordinate amount of whale action points to a market under pressure, with long-term holders apparently capitulating. If this development sent a chill up your spine, freeze it. Ethereum remains a fine accumulation candidate, with an impending 2.0 upgrade allowing it to usurp the market share of Bitcoin (BTC) and potentially everyone else. Whales have moved over 530,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past week! pic.twitter.com/ecIDbvcSEi — Ali (@ali_charts) April 9, 2025 Right now, the Ethereum market seems to be moving toward a key price area—one that, in the past, has indicated the market was nearing a bottom and has provided strong buying opportunities. When you look at this recent price action and the fact that large holders are taking profits and/or adjusting positions, you have to ask: does this situation spell impending bottom for the Ethereum market? Or is it more likely that we are going to see further price weakness in the near future? Ethereum OG Sells 10,702 ETH After Two Years of Dormancy A recent development that is worth talking about came from a person who is considered to be one of the original Ethereum investors. This individual sold 10,702 ETH—which was worth about $16.86 million at around $1,576—just a few days ago. This is a significant development not just because of who it is, but also because this individual held this Ethereum for a very long time. Supposedly, this person held the Ethereum since 2016, when it was worth just $8. This sale’s timing is interesting. Even though Ethereum hit over $4,000 during the 2021 bull market, this investor did not choose to sell then. Instead, the dip that is now signaling a bear market saw this investor finally executing their option to sell. Why would an attractive asset holder sell at what seems to be a low point? This action seems to fly in the face of conventional market wisdom. An Ethereum OG dumped 10,702 $ETH ($16.86M) at $1,576 again after 2 years of dormancy. He received the $ETH as early as 2016, when the price was just $8. Interestingly, he never sold when $ETH was above $4,000 — but always chose to sell during major dips.… pic.twitter.com/YZrLWT5exF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 10, 2025 Ethereum’s durability through extended slumps implies that numerous holders are maintaining a long-term perspective on the asset, looking for greater valuations. Nonetheless, this most recent broad-based liquidation seems to suggest that a number of investors might be shifting their outlooks, potentially in response to worries about more pronounced downside risks developing in the near term. Ethereum ETFs Face Continued Outflows Amid Market Uncertainty The market sentiment surrounding Ethereum appears to be under pressure. On April 9, a total net outflow of $11.19 million left Ethereum spot ETFs, marking yet another day that they did not enjoy any inflows. Of the nine Ethereum ETFs, none experienced net inflows, which could indicate a lack of institutional confidence in the current Ethereum marketplace. On April 9, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $127 million, marking the fifth consecutive day of net outflows. Ethereum spot ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $11.1873 million, with none of the nine ETFs experiencing any net inflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 10, 2025 The consistent outflows from Ethereum ETFs could be a sign of institutional interest that is not as strong as it once was—or possibly of market conditions that make institutional interest less likely. The sentiment expressed by ETF investors is being tested by a number of external factors, including regulatory uncertainty, that are affecting the whole market—Bitcoin, for instance, is not doing any better, and is also seeing outflows from its own ETF. Despite this, I’m still kind of optimistic about Ethereum. Currently, these outflows cast a spotlight on the deliberate and prudent path taken by institutional investors. They do not appear to be running back into the arms of the crypto markets yet. And in contrast to retail investors, institutional investors take a lot of time to make decisions. Yet, in their defense, institutional investors command a lot of capital. So their re-entry and exit can make waves in the crypto market. Is This the Right Time to Accumulate Ethereum? As Ethereum nears a support zone that many analysts regard as crucial, the longer-term forecast for the asset remains unclear. Whales have been on the move, transferring large swaths of E T H to various new addresses. The signals from these big holders, however, are far from straightforward. One key long-term holder has recently sold a sizable amount of E T H, dumping it during a market dip instead of at what many would call a more favorable price point near the recent top. Long-term holders throwing in the towel seems to be a potentially ideal situation for contrarian investors to start accumulating. We’ve historically seen that when the widespread fear and uncertainty of a market bottom leads to a sharp recovery, it’s because attractive buying opportunities present themselves at risk-reward ratios that make sense. And right now, if you’re a contrarian investor, the setup seems to be ideal. Long-term #Ethereum $ETH holders have entered ""capitulation"" mode. For contrarians, this could signal a prime accumulation zone from a risk-reward standpoint.

The token has been bouncing around a well-defined support level and has offered significantly better returns than the overall crypto space since the middle of June. Still, ample warning signs and indicators suggest that these bounces—and any potential gains realized by retail investors—are likely to be sold into by Ethereum’s large and deep investor base. In the end, the next couple of weeks will be very important in deciding whether Ethereum holds the currently critical support levels or whether a continuing price slide tests the faith of even the most loyal holders. From the perspective of anyone looking at this market over the long haul, the appearance of Ethereum’s cryptographic money in our world is hard to see as anything but a net positive. Its foundational strength, in both the architecture of its underlying blockchain and the well-nigh irresistible decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built upon that blockchain, seems to make it a good bet. At the very least, it should be a doubly good bet when it is available at a price reduced from its previous highs. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Simultaneously, Cardano founder and Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson has projected that Bitcoin could skyrocket to $250,000 by the end of the year, citing a combination of regulatory clarity, growing adoption by tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, and shifting global economic dynamics. With both miners and thought leaders signaling confidence, the stage appears set for a transformative year in the digital asset space. Charles Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $250K by 2025 as Tech Giants and Regulatory Clarity Fuel Crypto Revival Despite recent market turbulence, Charles Hoskinson , the blockchain pioneer behind Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, believes that Bitcoin is on track for an explosive resurgence — potentially reaching $250,000 as early as this year. Speaking to CNBC during a recent episode of the Beyond The Valley podcast , Hoskinson laid out a bullish forecast fueled by tech adoption, macroeconomic shifts, and impending regulatory breakthroughs. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency market has been in flux. Bitcoin temporarily dropped below the $77,000 threshold, spooked by US President Donald Trump's aggressive ”reciprocal tariff” policy targeting multiple countries in a broad escalation of trade tensions. However, a temporary 90-day reduction of these levies to 10% — designed to create space for new negotiations — triggered a swift rebound in crypto, with Bitcoin surging back above $82,000. Still, the market remains well below its all-time high of over $100,000 in January. That hasn’t shaken long-term optimism among industry leaders like Hoskinson, who believes the pullback is only a pause before the next major leg upward. Hoskinson, who also serves as CEO of Input Output Global (IOHK), painted a scenario in which multiple global catalysts converge to reignite Bitcoin’s price. “By the end of this year or next year,” we’ll see Bitcoin at $250,000, he said. ”The markets will stabilize a little bit, and they'll get used to the new normal, and then the Fed[eral Reserve] will lower interest rates, and then you'll have a lot of fast, cheap money, and then it'll pour into crypto,” he added. Three Mega Forces Poised to Drive the Next Crypto Boom Hoskinson cited three key factors that he believes will fuel Bitcoin's surge: Explosive User Growth: According to data from Crypto.com, the global number of cryptocurrency users grew by 13% in 2024 to a total of 659 million. With nearly one in ten people on Earth now owning some form of digital asset, the market is nearing a tipping point in mainstream adoption. Geopolitical Decentralization: Hoskinson pointed to a world increasingly governed by power politics rather than treaties and institutions. Impending US Crypto Legislation: The potential passage of two key regulatory proposals — stablecoin legislation and the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act — could establish clearer rules of the road for digital assets. This legal certainty, Hoskinson argued, is vital for institutional adoption and market stability. Perhaps the most intriguing part of Hoskinson’s forecast is his prediction that major technology firms — specifically the so-called “Magnificent 7” (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla) — could become direct players in the cryptocurrency market. With clearer stablecoin regulations in place, Hoskinson believes these firms could begin integrating crypto into their platforms. For example, stablecoins could enable Apple or Amazon to pay workers across borders or facilitate microtransactions that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive using traditional payment rails. Timeline for the Next Wave Hoskinson isn’t predicting an immediate skyrocket. Instead, he sees a short-term period of stagnation — followed by an intense speculative push. ”[The crypto market] will stall for probably the next three to five months, and then you'll have a huge wave of speculative interest come, probably [in] August or September, into the markets, and that'll carry through probably another six to 12 months,” Hoskinson said. If his forecast proves accurate, that speculative wave could begin right as interest rates begin to drop, regulation firms up, and tech giants announce stablecoin integrations — setting the stage for a historic bull market. Top Bitcoin Miners Generate $800M in Q1 2025 as Industry Rides High on BTC Price Surge In related news, Bitcoin mining firms have kicked off 2025 with remarkable momentum, generating close to $800 million in mined BTC during the first quarter alone — a signal of renewed strength in the sector as Bitcoin prices remain close to their all-time highs. The largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies produced a combined 9,746 BTC in Q1. This extraordinary output comes as miners ramp up production to capitalize on favorable market conditions and prepare for the anticipated effects of the upcoming halving event. Largest Bitcoin miners by market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap) Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest Bitcoin mining company by market capitalization, led the industry with a staggering 2,285 BTC mined in Q1 — valued at roughly $186 million. The company’s production trajectory has been steadily rising, culminating in a 17.4% month-over-month increase in March when it mined 829 BTC. This also represents a 10.5% increase compared to January, suggesting an aggressive scale-up in hash rate and operational efficiency. The mining giant has long pursued a high-capacity growth strategy, and its recent performance suggests that it remains the dominant force in industrial-scale Bitcoin mining heading into the midyear. CleanSpark, the second-largest producer in Q1 by volume, mined 1,950 BTC worth nearly $160 million. The firm reported a 13.4% increase in its March production compared to February, reflecting consistent operational expansion. Iren (formerly known as Iris Energy), came in third with 1,513 BTC mined in Q1, valued at approximately $124 million. Its March output of 533 BTC represented a 16.1% increase from February, underlining the company’s push to regain market share after a relatively modest 2024. Despite being ranked sixth by market capitalization, Iren’s production figures place it among the most efficient miners in terms of hash rate output per dollar of market cap. Riot Blockchain and the Quiet Climb Riot Blockchain, the second-largest company in the sector by market capitalization, mined 1,428 BTC — about $117 million — making it the fourth-largest producer this quarter. In March, Riot matched Iren’s monthly output of 533 BTC, marking a 13.4% increase from the previous month. The mining firm has been relatively quiet on major expansion announcements this quarter but remains a central player in the North American mining landscape. While Hut 8 Mining had the smallest production volume among the top players — mining 199 BTC worth roughly $16 million — it recorded the highest growth rate across the sector. In March, Hut 8 mined 88 BTC, marking a 91% surge from its 46 BTC production in February. Hut 8’s performance spike coincided with a groundbreaking partnership announcement on March 31: the company has teamed up with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to launch a new mining venture dubbed “American Bitcoin.” The project aspires to become the “world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner,” and its alignment with the Trump family signals a strong political dimension to the firm’s strategy, particularly in light of growing regulatory scrutiny in the US. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot emphasized this strategic pivot in a prior interview, stating that the firm is determined to “build one of the largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms rooted in American soil.” Industry Trends and What Lies Ahead The Q1 production figures reflect a broader theme in 2025: industrial Bitcoin mining is maturing. The largest players continue to consolidate their position with greater operational efficiency, tighter integration with energy providers, and increased political engagement. Bitcoin’s elevated trading range is providing strong tailwinds for miners. At the same time, growing anticipation around the next halving event, expected in early 2026, is prompting firms to expand capacity now to maximize profitability before rewards are reduced. Additionally, with US lawmakers moving closer to passing key digital asset legislation and stablecoin regulation, publicly traded miners are beginning to factor regulatory clarity into their long-term capital planning — potentially setting the stage for new entrants and more institutional investment.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-11 05:30:00

Even at the local price lows of this week, over 85% of Bitcoin holders are sitting in the black. This is a stat that reveals the underlying strength of the market structure and the long-term accumulation trend of this asset. This degree of profit, even when the markets are pulling back, reflects a major change in how investors are interacting with Bitcoin in this cycle. Even at this week's lows, more than 85% of Bitcoin holders remained in profit, underscoring its resilience amid tariff concerns. The chart below shows how Bitcoin’s overall profitability has changed over time. Where do you think the market is heading next? pic.twitter.com/3rgB17Wowd — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 10, 2025 Even when the price has fallen, most investors have seen it go up enough that they’ve made profit since buying at lower prices. And with the way the price has moved lately, you can’t say that this is some kind of fantastic new high that is just mesmerizing to altcoin and stockholders. We’re not going back to the $20,000 price point at this level. Yet, with the price at around $11,000, these must be tough times if you’re holding Equities or some kind of altcoin. Bitcoin is doing better than both at this point. Rising DeFi Adoption Among Bitcoin Holders One of the more interesting trends this year is the integration of Bitcoin with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. Currently, over 234,000 BTC have been deployed on EVM-compatible chains, a nearly 10% jump since the start of 2025. Currently, more than 234,000 BTC are deployed on EVM chains, a figure that has grown by around 10% since the start of the year. This trend highlights how Bitcoin holders are increasingly turning to DeFi mechanisms, such as Bitcoin staking, to earn yield on their assets. pic.twitter.com/6oLZrYF2pq — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 10, 2025 This movement underscores what seems to be an increasingly common desire among Bitcoin holders to earn yield on their assets through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. We are witnessing Bitcoin being used in a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that were until recently the exclusive domain of Ethereum-based assets. Wrapped Bitcoin and synthetic Bitcoin allow users to access DeFi primitives on Ethereum, and this is a pretty big deal. It reflects the maturation of cross-chain infrastructure and speaks to Bitcoin’s evolving utility. This shift toward yield-bearing strategies may also help to explain the high percentage of holders in profit. Not only have many entered at lower price points, but they’re now able to generate passive income through smart contract-based applications, providing yet another layer of incentive to hold rather than sell. Key Price Levels: Support, Resistance, and Long-Term Targets Technical analysis concludes that Bitcoin possibly is entering a decisive stage in its current cycle. The Mayer Multiple, a favored indicator that relates the current price to the 200-day moving average, suggests that Bitcoin may find strong support around $69,500. This zone has a rich history of providing reliable bases during times of market uncertainty and consolidation. Based on the Mayer Multiple, #Bitcoin $BTC could find solid support around $69,500. And, a breakout above $86,900 might set the stage for a market top near $208,550. pic.twitter.com/aoLK9F4vrI — Ali (@ali_charts) April 10, 2025 Optimistically, forthcoming resistance is seen coming in around $94,500, based on multiple key pricing tiers. A sustained break above this level could trigger a major upswing, almost certainly taking us toward some of our longer-term price targets. One of those targets, derived from historical breakout structure, is just about reading 2-and-change times higher from this level, our apparent uptrending target near $208,550, likely the top price for this cycle, if the current rally gathers any momentum. As #Bitcoin $BTC rebounds, the next immediate resistance stands at $94,500, according to pricing bands. pic.twitter.com/pObd0IXAsW — Ali (@ali_charts) April 10, 2025 Short-term headwinds still exist, though. On April 9, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net outflow of $127 million, the fifth day in a row of outflows. This apparently signals declining institutional interest in the near term, but the ETFs’ price impact has been pretty mild so far. That suggests that retail and on-chain investors, the true backbone of Bitcoin’s current strength, have been absorbing the selling. On April 9, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $127 million, marking the fifth consecutive day of net outflows. Ethereum spot ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $11.1873 million, with none of the nine ETFs experiencing any net inflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 10, 2025 These outflows may be due to more general market problems, rather than any change in Bitcoin’s fundamentals. At the moment, investors have a lot to juggle. And the basic narrative they are constructing is that, when there’s a lack of clarity around monetary policy, and certainly when there’s heightened geopolitical risk, like there is right now, investors tend to pull back from riskier assets, which would include Bitcoin. What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin With macro uncertainty at play and important price levels close at hand, the question now is: Where does Bitcoin go from here? On-chain data suggests that long-term holders are still confident, despite the ETF outflows. The profitability of wallet addresses is consistent; DeFi engagement across EVM chains is rising; and the reactions to negative headlines have been relatively minor. All this suggests that Bitcoin’s current structure is still something you would characterize as bullish. Should Bitcoin manage to take back the resistance close to $94,500, the road toward the $100,000 psychological mark—and even higher—might become much more clear. Till then, the support area around $69,500 will be key in deciding whether the ongoing consolidation is a prolonged healthy breather or the onset of a more serious downward adjustment. At present, Bitcoin is still confidently asserting its strength. The wider market, in contrast, appears to be searching for a definite way forward. And in a segment of the investment world increasingly animated by on-chain usefulness and worldwide interest, Bitcoin’s bullish behavior might well be the signal—not the noise.

Since Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, the seven-day realized volatility of the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, has surged from an annualized 50% to 169%, according to data from TradingView. That's the highest level since the coronavirus crash in 2020. BTC's seven-day realized volatility has doubled to 83%, yet it remains significantly lower than the S&P 500, hinting at the cryptocurrency's possible evolution as a low-beta hedge against stocks. The cryptocurrency also looks significantly less volatile than the S&P 500 on a 30-day basis. ""Equity markets [have] experienced a dramatic spike in volatility—surpassing that of Bitcoin, which is currently seeing a decline in volatility. This raises the question: should investors place their trust in assets that are highly susceptible to political influence and human error, or in a mathematical framework and emerging store of value that is more resilient to such risks?"" CoinShares' Head of Research James Butterfill said in an email. Investors dump U.S. assets The S&P 500 has cracked 14% in less than two months, largely due to trade war fears that have recently come true. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average have suffered similar losses alongside increased volatility in global equity markets. Risk aversion of such magnitudes has historically seen investors park money in Treasury notes, which underpin the global financial system, and the U.S. dollar, the global reserve currency. But since last Friday, investors have aggressively dumped Treasury notes, driving yields higher, and the dollar index has tanked. The so-called benchmark 10-year bond yield has surged by 62 basis points to 4.45% since last Friday and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, has extended its first quarter swoon to 100, the lowest level since late September. Currencies typically appreciate when their national bond yields rise unless markets are worried about the country's debt situation, in which case investors pull money out of the bond markets, leading to a spike in yields and a concurrent currency depreciation. The Global South witnessed this in 2018. ""Yields higher, currency lower is common in EM. We saw this in the UK during the Truss debacle. But it is highly abnormal for the US: there are only four other episodes in the last 30 years in which the dollar depreciated more than 1.5% with the 30-year yield up more than 10bp,"" Evercore ISI said, according to Wall Street Journal's Chief Economic Correspondent Nick Timaros.

43200225,https://nulltx.com/?p=147911,1744349615,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Flows Back Into Memecoins as Net Inflows Turn Positive,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-flows-back-into-memecoins-as-net-inflows-turn-positive/,"On April 9, 2025, on-chain data shows a sharp increase in smart money entering the memecoin sector, with net inflows positive across the entire space. The capital markets, as a whole, aren’t exactly doing well—with most crypto assets in the red. However, when it comes to memecoins, this seems to be an area where some investors are regaining confidence. As per analytics from blockchain, inflow amounts to $5.26 million, while outflow amounts to $3.78 million. The net volume is $1.48 million, which is a positive sign and seems to indicate that the overall sentiment is bullish. The trading volume is $9.04 million, which also seems to be a positive sign and indicates that the querulous level of activity is still very much alive. Spotlight on Key Movers: Inflows Lead the Way Some of the tokens that saw most significant inflows from smart money involved a mixture of established digital assets and viral memecoins. This indicates a bifurcated strategy among experienced investors—one in which they express a preference for both liquidity and high-risk, high-reward plays. Wrapped Bitcoin ($WBTC) was at the head of the inflow pack with net purchases of $469,000. Although it isn’t a traditional memecoin, its presence in the data suggests smart traders either hedging or rebalancing their exposure as they start to invest in the market again. WBTC’s presence is especially interesting because it shows that, when positioning around memecoins, traders are pairing that with safer, blue-chip collateral. Next is RFC, which raised $505,000. Although it is not as much in the spotlight as some other viral coins, RFC seems to be getting some traction and maybe even some attention from whales and experienced DeFi players for whom the coin is an asymmetric bet. TITCOIN—an extremely controversial but very popular memecoin—received $249,000 of inflows. This niche following for TITCOIN is really hard to explain. Its relentless meme-driven marketing and the highly active community around it are almost its only defining features. That said, these two areas have led to a rather remarkable rise in the price of TITCOIN. POPCAT was another unexpected line item; it showed up on both sides of the ledger — $147,000 coming in and $196,000 going out, for a net outflow of $49,000. The mixed behavior around POPCAT reflects divided sentiment: Some traders seem to be taking profits after a recent run-up, while others continue to accumulate, perhaps in anticipation of a community-driven push or rebound. LUCE, a relatively obscure memecoin, garnered $108,000 in investments. While this amount may appear trifling next to the investments found in major cryptocurrencies, LUCE’s incoming capital is noteworthy, indeed, for what it could signal: the early stages of accumulating this asset. In the world of memecoins, where even the smallest projects can gain significant traction because of internet virality, this accumulation pattern is a sign that people in the know are betting on LUCE. Profit-Taking and Rotations: Outflows Tell Their Own Story Although the general market flow was positive, some tokens experienced significant capital outflows. This appears to be either profit-taking or a shift in sentiment toward those tokens. FARTCOIN took the lead on the outflow side, with $256,000 exiting the protocol. Its slapstick branding and momentary viral appeal aside, FARTCOIN has been unable to maintain the excitement it generated in its initial hype cycle. This recent outflow, however, may be more indicative of FARTCOIN’s holders rebalancing into other, newer plays or perhaps just a signal that market enthusiasm is cooling and that we’re all more responsible with our coins than we were a few months ago. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 09/04/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $5.26M Outflow: $3.78M Volume: $9.04M Net Volume: $1.48M There was inflow into: $WBTC ($469K) #TITCOIN ($249K) $RFC ($505K) $POPCAT ($147K) $LUCE … pic.twitter.com/aZJNyXziID — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 10, 2025 As noted earlier, POPCAT also experienced outflows of about $196,000, which was almost a match for its inflows. These two activities point to trading rather than holding in these tokens with a high degree of conviction. On the other side of the picture, GIGA, GOAT, MPLX, and USDS all saw outflows in the moderate five- and six-figure range. These outflows may signify either a loss of confidence or a shift toward tokens with more solid short-term upside potential, especially in a sector where sentiment and virality drive more than fundamentals. Outlook: Smart Money Paints a Cautiously Optimistic Picture In conclusion, April 9 was a relatively positive day for the memecoin market. It had inflows of $1.48 million and some movement in our interest across select assets; the data suggests traders are becoming more comfortable re-entering the space, though it appears they are still being selective. As is always the case with memecoins, their prices and the sentiments around them can change suddenly and severely. However, if today’s trends hold, they could signal the start of yet another wave of capital rotation into the most meme-able parts of the crypto world.

However, a look at TVL efficiency — the average capital allocated per protocol — reveals a different sort of story about ecosystem health and user conviction. DeFi may be the narrative driver, but from a basic investment allocation perspective, average capital efficiency is a better metric of ecosystem health. The most recent data show that the TRON network is currently the leader in total value locked (TVL) per protocol, with an average of $131 million per protocol. This is significantly ahead of all the other major blockchain ecosystems. In second place is Bitcoin, with an average of $83.4 million per protocol. Ethereum, despite having the most protocols by a large margin, comes in third with an average of only $33.7 million per project. And in a distant fourth is Solana, with an average of $29.0 million. TRON and Bitcoin lead in average TVL per protocol @trondao leads with $131M in TVL per protocol, followed by #Bitcoin , averaging $83.4M. @berachain also shows notable capital concentration, with $48.6M across its 53 protocols. @ethereum ecosystem, with 1,322 protocols, averages… pic.twitter.com/0Xvvl1Rneg — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 9, 2025 This commonly ignored metric provides a clear image of capital efficiency, user distribution, and the selectivity with which funds are being deployed across ecosystems. Capital Efficiency Shifts the Narrative TRON’s outstanding status in average TVL per protocol is particularly remarkable, especially in light of the widespread belief that DeFi development is centered in Ethereum. Indeed, Ethereum is not only the leading DeFi network in terms of TVL but also in terms of the number of protocols built on it. Yet, spread across these 1,322 DeFi projects, Ethereum’s capital concentration is not nearly as great as that of TRON. And it’s not as if TRON has a massive number of protocols just sitting there. In fact, like many blockchains outside of Ethereum, TRON has a far smaller number of protocols, which means a far smaller number of DeFi projects. This indicates a DeFi landscape that is clearer and more concentrated on TRON, where a small number of very successful protocols generate a lot of liquidity. By contrast, the DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum is enormous. Its sheer size and the number of different types of projects across its many layers means that the average protocol on Ethereum has a much lower total value locked down in it than the average protocol on TRON. What gives? The second place of Bitcoin in the ranking may surprise some, as the network is classically not seen in the same light as Ethereum or Solana when it comes to DeFi. But recent activity around layer-2 solutions for Bitcoin and the development of DeFi protocols that operate directly on the Bitcoin blockchain have led to substantial inflows of capital. With relatively few of these types of platforms currently live and operational on the Bitcoin network, the really astounding thing is the average total value locked (TVL) per platform — about $83.4 million. Berachain, an up-and-coming player that has yet to leave the testnet phase, is already showing burgeoning signs of capital concentration. The project boasts a striking 53 protocols in its ecosystem. On average, those protocols hold a total value locked of $48.6 million each. If you look only at Berachain’s mainnet preparation, this number looks even better. Solana and Ethereum: Broad But Shallow? Although Solana’s throughput and popularity are high, its overall average total value locked (TVL) is not, landing at $29.0 million across its 210 protocols. And although Solana, like its predecessor Ethereum, has a wide assortment of applications that might suggest otherwise (everything from social dApps to DeFi to NFTs is being built on Solana), the reality is that TVL on Solana, on average, is locked in very few protocols.$ The low figure of TVL per protocol isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it can also be seen as an experimental ecosystem that’s rich and vibrant. Yet it’s hard to not think of it as questioning the balance between breadth and depth. Protocols with a low TVL run the risk of negotiating their way through a liquidity trap and retaining their users in times of hardship. At $33.7 million per protocol, Ethereum is just above Solana. This number still reflects a good amount of capital deployed and is an efficient capital use. But the amount deployed across the prototypes also shows the challenges that these upstream developers face in capital efficiency. What TVL Per Protocol Really Tells Us In the end, the metric that is average total value locked per protocol serves as quite a fresh angle to assess blockchain systems. TRON and Bitcoin tally up high averages and with them a very handful, indeed concentrated, assembly of projects that are purportedly receiving a strong commitment of capital. By contrast, Ethereum and Solana have on board swathes of fans, and they muster almost an entire army of developers in Ecosystem Land. People who invest in and develop DeFi are starting to look more closely at not just total capital but at how effectively that capital is being used. We hear a lot these days about efficiency, concentration, and protocol-level traction. These things are said to matter just as much, if not more, than TVL itself.

43200328,https://nulltx.com/?p=147913,1744349918,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Rising Open Interest and Negative Funding Point to Growing Short Pressure in Select Altcoins,https://nulltx.com/rising-open-interest-and-negative-funding-point-to-growing-short-pressure-in-select-altcoins/,"A recent change in the derivatives landscape is bringing a possibly bearish altcoin setup to light. Why? Because open interest is rising—and it’s now being paired with negative funding rates. These two together signal that not only is the market being forced to short, but also that the shorts are being put on with some serious size. And when you open a short in the types of products that really give you the edge in crypto , you’re kind of signaling to the market that you expect prices to go down. On this front, several assets are raising red flags, with Zcash ($ZEC) being the most prominent case. It is a privacy coin that is now under suspicion and has been flagged by multiple sources as possibly non-compliant with SEC regulations. Some other tokens, like $NEO, $FET, and $AIOT, are also starting to show the early signs of compliance issues. These assets moving in a certain non-compliant direction could serve as the directional impetus for any spots and derivatives to now also make a non-compliant move. Zcash Leads the Pack in Bearish Sentiment Zcash ($ZEC) currently stands out as the asset with the most extreme divergence between rising leverage and bearish positioning. Over the past 24 hours, open interest on ZEC futures has surged by 35.5%, a significant uptick that typically indicates increased trader engagement. However, this rise in leverage is occurring alongside a deeply negative funding rate of -0.17% — the most negative across the observed assets. Several assets are seeing rising open interest paired with negative funding – suggesting a concentration of short positioning despite increasing leverage: $ZEC: OI +35.5%, Funding -0.17% pic.twitter.com/Qz1Zlen535 — glassnode (@glassnode) April 9, 2025 Funding rates show the cost of holding long versus short positions in the perpetual futures market. When the rate is negative, it means that the short traders are paying the long traders; in other words, most traders in the market are shorting the asset. ZEC saw a very large increase in OI, or open interest, over the past week. At the same time, the funding rate is sharply negative and getting more so, which suggests that traders in this market are very aggressively building short positions. This dynamic can create a feedback loop in thin or illiquid markets. When a lot of traders are going short, even small negative price movements can lead to more unwinding of positions, which means that we could see a downside move that is faster than what we might expect in a normal market condition. But we could also see a fast, upside reversal if sentiment changes to the bullish side or if selling pressure just dries up. NEO and FET: Rising Leverage, Flat Price Action Though ZEC’s situation is the most extreme, $NEO and $FET are also showing signs of potential directional stress. NEO’s open interest has jumped 47.8%, the largest increase in this group by far. Despite this increase, however, price action for NEO has remained stagnant and even slightly bearish, which suggests that this increase in OI is not a function of bullish longs driving the price higher, but rather an influx of shorts driving the price lower. NEO’s funding rate has dipped into negative territory at -0.045%, which supports the notion that most recent traders are shorting the asset. Open interest is also up for FET (Fetch.ai). However, since the funding rate is also at -0.045%, any recent price moves that have possibly occurred for FET should not be credited with shoring up the asset’s funding rate. Yet another slow day for FET shows it is not earning strength from traders who are willing to bet on a price increase. Both assets may be at heightened risk of volatility for two reasons: -Traders may start unwinding short positions in both assets if they begin to move up in price. -Even if traders maintain short positions, they could be at risk of having those positions move against them if some market catalyst leads to a decline in the prices of the safe-haven assets they’re using as proxies. AIOT: Falling OI and Mildly Bearish Funding Interestingly, not all assets are seeing rising leverage. Open interest for AIOT has dropped a considerable 25.1%, and still AIOT has a mildly negative funding rate of -0.060%. Given that this is a funding rate that’s not actually that crazy in the negative, it suggests, to me at least, that traders are decreasing risk as they get ready for whatever is coming next in AIOT. While the funding stays negative, the mix of declining open interest and a relatively small amount of money suggests that bearish pressure is either dissipating or that traders are still too tentative to re-short the market aggressively. Conclusion: Market Poised for Volatility Data taken together depicts a picture of a derivatives market that is increasingly one-sided, at least in the short term. Open interest across multiple assets is rising. But when you pair that with funding rates that are down across the board, it suggests that the market is betting on a downward movement. Yet, when markets become too one-sided, they become fragile. With so many traders packed into short positions, the risk of a short squeeze — a sudden, sharp upward move that forces shorts to close — also increases. And the more we crowd into our safe spaces, the bigger and more violent the resultant move when the inevitable unwind occurs. These setups should be watched closely by traders. They are closely correlated to many of the setups we just discussed. Trading them means you think either current sentiment is about to continue or that a violent reversal is in the works.

The pole position in this ecosystem is occupied by eETH, Ether.fi’s flagship liquid restaking token (LRT), which represents Ethereum that has been both kind of “staked” to the Ethereum Beacon chain and “restaked” on EigenLayer, the not-so-long-ago showered-in-glory infrastructure given to Ethereum for pooled security. eETH’s rapid ascent in DeFi strategies—especially in leveraged staking loops—has made it a foundational block in many portfolios. Yet, with that increasing centrality comes a deep need to understand and manage risk. Events that could test liquidity, the behavior of validators, and the threat of slashing in EigenLayer all have our attention, and new monitoring tools are beginning to provide much-needed clarity into the slightly uncomfortable fragility underneath the surface. Watching the Pulse: Why Validator Exit Times Matter At its most fundamental, eETH is a tokenized representation of staked ETH that is additionally restaked to EigenLayer through the Ether.fi network of validators. This double-layer construction not only increases the potential yield and utility of eETH but also adds quite a few more moving parts — and therefore risk vectors — than plain vanilla liquid staking protocols. One of the primary indicators of possible strain in the Ether.fi system is the validator exit time average. If this figure starts to rise sharply, it could mean that validators are starting to pull out of the network or that queue congestion is rising because of some external market stress. In either instance, such a spike in exit times can act as a leading signal for liquidity pressure. When users notice this bottleneck, they may hasten to unload their eETH or weETH (wrapped eETH) tokens in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs), which is bound to push the price down and might even trigger a depeg from ETH. 1/ With ~2.5M ETH in TVL, @ether_fi is the largest liquid restaking platform in DeFi, powered by their eETH LRT. As a core component of DeFi strategies like leveraged staking, it is critical to monitor risks that can impact eETH pic.twitter.com/vsmHcS3fUn — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 9, 2025 Now it is possible to monitor these real-time dynamics through Risk Pulse alerts, which give early warnings connected to validator activity and exit patterns. When the pulse begins to spike, that’s when we start to look deeper into the complementary metrics shared on the Risk Radar (like the peg monitor and slippage indicator). These tools assist traders and protocol designers in evaluating not simply if a depeg is occurring but also to gauge its severity and to gauge the market’s response in terms of liquidity depth, spreads, and the overall user sentiment. Slashing Ahead: New Frontier in LRT Risk Management Presently, risks associated with liquidity and the exit queue are well understood. Yet, the next big layer of risk is coming into play with slashing on EigenLayer. Slashing is the nasty mechanism that reduces a validator’s stake if they misbehave or fail to perform as promised. But slashing won’t be targeting just validators of Ethereum’s mainchain; it will also be applied to those validators who are restaking assets like eETH on EigenLayer. If these validators misbehave, then the capital we thought was secured in restaked eETH is actually at risk. The liquid staking sector now faces a seismic shift that until now had not threatened the most restaked positions within it with slashing. Ether.fi is an example of a platform integrated with EigenLayer that will need to bolster its monitoring and protection mechanisms, at both the protocol and user level, if it is to keep those parts of its service from slashing. To prepare for this, new risk alerts and indicators are being developed to track slashing-related data. The idea is to give users much earlier visibility into the kinds of operational risks that, while theoretical for now, will soon become a part of the everyday reality of using Ethereum 2.0. DeFi’s Core Infrastructure Faces a Stress Test As DeFi amplifies and Ether.fi’s eETH becomes intertwined in complex DeFi plays, the risk profile of eETH is increasingly taking on the appearance of a traditional financial instrument — complete with embedded, layered risks that are difficult (and in some cases, impossible) to assess. This is not staking anymore; this is not risk-free yield. This is complex finance. And the part of it that concerns me the most is that the validator network isn’t doing anything very interesting. Having approximately 2.5 million ETH at stake and wider integrations with lending protocols, yield aggregators, and restaking products, Ether.fi is now a central figure in DeFi. Its core infrastructure—like any central piece in a system—will set the tone for the rest of the assemblage. And if it, or any other central part, is to fail, the whole system can only wobble. Currently, the tools are enhancing, the dangers are being outlined, and the closely observing market awaits. The core test of the liquid restaking thesis will be whether Ether.fi can steer through the next phase—especially slashing—without event-driven turmoil.

The downturn followed confirmation from the White House that cumulative tariffs on Chinese imports have climbed to 145%, deepening fears of a prolonged trade war. Gold surged past $3,200 per ounce on Friday, hitting a fresh record, supported by a weaker US dollar and rising safe-haven demand amid escalating US-China trade tensions. For the week, gold is on track for its best performance since last November. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 4.26% tumbled on Friday. The Japanese yen strengthened past 144 per dollar on Friday, hitting a six-month-high.

This first overseas trip of 2025, as reported by state media, is designed to bolster ties with crucial Southeast Asian neighbors. China, Japan, and South Korea held talks in Malaysia to discuss the impact of U.S. tariffs on global and regional economies. The talks were part of the ASEAN+3 Finance and Central Bank Deputies' Meeting. The three countries also discussed economic trends and ways to strengthen regional financial cooperation, with the People's Bank of China reaffirming its commitment to a moderately loose monetary policy. Traders are bracing for China’s March trade data, due over the weekend, amid concerns that exports and imports may start to feel the strain from rising tariffs. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.92% to 20,575 in early Friday, snapping three-day gains as U.S. futures slumped and tensions with China escalated. India ( SENSEX ) rose 1.78% to 75,165 in morning trade on Friday, rebounding from losses in the prior session as trading resumed after the Mahavir Jayanti holiday. Traders welcomed a 90-day suspension of an additional 26% tariff on India, while also engaging in short-term profit-taking ahead of another market closure on Monday for the Ambedkar Jayanti holiday. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 1.39% fell sharply on Friday as global trade concerns rattled investor sentiment. The Australian dollar rose to around $0.625 on Friday, marking its third consecutive gain In a speech in Melbourne, Bullock stated that it is “too early” to determine how U.S. President Trump’s trade war will impact interest rates in the coming months, while downplaying expectations of a double rate cut in May. She added that the market turmoil caused by the trade conflict is not as severe as the 2008 global financial crisis. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended in red reversing some of the previous day’s historic rally as renewed fears over escalating trade tensions between the US and China shook investor confidence. U.S. stock declined on Friday, capping off a turbulent week dominated by sharp market swings amid ongoing trade uncertainty: Dow +0.03%; S&P 500 +0.11%; Nasdaq +0.05%.

This week’s event is pretty similar to previous weeks , where derivatives trading has been somewhat muted, so the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal. Markets have been extremely volatile this week, dumping to a five-month low before bouncing back on the Trump administration’s global trade tariff flip-flops. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.88, meaning that the short and long contract sellers are pretty closely matched. There is also a max pain point of $82,000, which is where most losses will be made. Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $70,000 strike price, with just over a billion dollars in open contracts betting that Bitcoin will fall further. However, there is a similar amount of OI at the $100,000 strike price as the bulls are maintaining their positions, according to Deribit. Options Expiry Alert At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $2.59B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $2.32B notional | Put/Call: 0.97 | Max Pain: $82K $ETH : $270M notional | Put/Call: 0.91 | Max Pain: $1,750 With recent market volatility and ongoing tariff… pic.twitter.com/2OywATV66o — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) April 10, 2025 Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was “cautiously bullish” after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, “though many remain skeptical this rally will be sustained,” it added. “Key levels being watched are $85K as a near-term target and $100K as a longer-term resistance, with traders debating whether this news-driven pump will eventually be faded.” Greeks also commented that several traders noted this was a “clear case of insider knowledge” as heavy buying occurred in the $75,000 to $77,500 range hours before the 90-day tariff pause announcement. In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, there are around 183,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $283 million, a max pain point of $1,750, and a put/call ratio of 0.92. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.5 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto market capitalization is back in the red, having lost 3.6% over the past 24 hours and declined to $2.65 trillion. After reclaiming $83,000 on Thursday, Bitcoin sank back below $79,000 in late trading in reaction to lower-than-expected CPI figures before recovering marginally to reach $80,000 during Friday morning trading in Asia. Zooming out, the asset has been steadily downtrending since mid-January, having declined 26% from its all-time high. Ethereum is still in bear market territory , having slumped 4% on the day in a fall to $1,540. However, the rest of the altcoins were mixed with minor daily gains for Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Hedera (HBAR).

They’ve evolved. What started as dog-themed internet banter is now a full-blown financial movement. Whether you love ‘em, hate ‘em, or just missed the boat on the last one, you must admit that these digital misfits have made real people real money. Some even changed their zip codes. Imagine if you could rewind the clock and catch Doge before Elon tweeted about it. Or hop on Shiba Inu when everyone thought it was just another rug waiting to happen. That’s the zone TrollerCat ($TCAT) is in right now. And no, this isn’t just another token with a furry face and no future. Trollercat is flipping the meme coin game on its head—hard. It’s smart, it’s spicy, and it’s making serious waves before it even drops. If you’ve been lurking, waiting for the one , this is your shot. But you’ve gotta move fast. Troller Cat’s whitelist is open, and once the crowd catches on, it’s game over for latecomers. Let’s break down why this isn’t just another presale and why getting in now could be one of the smartest plays you make in 2025. Troller Cat: A New Breed of Meme Coin Enter Troller Cat, a meme coin that’s not just riding the wave but is set to make its splash. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Troller Cat combines humor, community engagement, and strategic tokenomics to create a compelling investment opportunity.

The Advantages of Joining the Whitelist Joining the whitelist for Troller Cat’s presale offers several compelling benefits: Early Access to Tokens: Whitelist members gain priority access to purchase $TCAT tokens before the general public. This early entry allows investors to acquire tokens at lower prices, maximizing the potential for returns once the coin hits the broader market. Exclusive Rewards: Joining the whitelist isn’t just about purchasing tokens—it’s about being part of a community. Whitelist members are privy to exclusive rewards, including staking opportunities and early access to Troller Cat’s upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) games. These rewards are designed to enhance the overall value proposition for early supporters. Influence on Project Development: Early investors often have a say in the project’s direction. By joining the whitelist, you’re not just a passive investor but an active participant in shaping the future of Troller Cat. This level of engagement fosters a sense of ownership and community, making your investment experience more fulfilling. The Buzz Around Troller Cat’s Presale The excitement surrounding Troller Cat’s presale is palpable. Investors are closely monitoring the project’s developments, eager to secure their spot before the presale opens to the public. The potential for significant returns is a major draw, with some speculating that early investors could see gains reminiscent of those who invested in Dogecoin or Shiba Inu at their inception. The Rumored High Staking Rewards While details are still under wraps, there’s talk of Troller Cat offering impressive staking rewards for early adopters. Staking allows investors to earn passive income by locking up their tokens to support the network’s operations. High staking rewards can significantly enhance the value of your investment, providing a steady income stream while you hold your tokens. If these rumors hold true, early investors stand to benefit substantially. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center: A Game-Changer Another exciting aspect of Troller Cat is the rumored Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center. This feature is expected to gamify the investment experience, allowing token holders to earn rewards through gameplay. The P2E model adds an entertainment factor and introduces a deflationary mechanism to tokenomics. As players engage with the games, tokens may be burned, reducing the overall supply and potentially increasing demand. This innovative approach could set Troller Cat apart from other meme coins, offering utility and fun. The Power of Community in Meme Coin Success The success of meme coins is heavily reliant on community support. A strong, engaged community can drive awareness, adoption, and sustained growth. Troller Cat understands this dynamic, placing a high emphasis on building a vibrant community.

The current assets that are over-collateralized do not seem to be affecting the intended value that sUSD should hold. The asset dipped as low as $0.869 and now hovers at about $0.908. The mechanism that maintains the value seems to be undergoing a transformation that has some asking if the underlying setup can maintain the sort of peg seen in typical stablecoins. sUSD continues to depeg, with its price dropping as low as $0.869 and currently trading at $0.908. Previously, Synthetix founder Kain stated that the sUSD peg restoration mechanism is undergoing a transition. He also revealed that he has sold 90% of his ETH holdings and increased… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 10, 2025 The dip marks one of the most significant instances of sUSD losing its peg in recent memory and comes at a sensitive moment for Synthetix. The community and team behind the protocol have acknowledged that the stablecoin is in a “transitional period” as it shifts away from the debt-burning model that previously helped keep the peg stable. Attracting attention currently is the Synthetix ecosystem, where instability exists. And major players in Synthetix, including its founder, Kain Warwick, are very much involved and making headlines. Warwick recently revealed to the Synthetix community via a video that he has sold 90% of his ETH to buy Synthetix and double his exposure to the protocol’s native token, SNX. A Transition in Motion: From Debt-Burning to the 420 Pool In recent weeks, the Synthetix community has been open about the developing mechanics under sUSD’s peg. Per a detailed post in the official sUSD Discord, the old model— which required burning debt to maintain the peg— is being retired. In its place, the 420 pool and an upcoming mechanism for liquidity pool management are expected to step in as the primary means of restoring and maintaining sUSD peg stability over the long term. The change has briefly disconnected sUSD from its dollar equivalence. sUSD has De-pegged Synthetic USD ( #sUSD ) is going through a Transition Period, possibly involving hormones. Will the PulseChain Pioneers build a nice Decentralised Stablecoin called #pDAI ? From the Synthetix sUSD Discord: ""We're in a transitionary period… pic.twitter.com/FXGTwmrNKw — yourfriendSOMMI (@yourfriendSOMMI) April 10, 2025 “We’re in a transitionary period where maintaining the peg no longer burns debt effectively,” the post states. “The 420 pool will eventually lead to sUSD being designed in a way so that it is more efficient in the long term and much more effective at maintaining the peg with the dollar.” The current main problem is surplus supply. With the previous stabilization mechanisms now defunct and the new system still being rolled out, the market is flooded with sUSD. This excess is creating downward price pressure and making it difficult for sUSD to achieve the necessary demand to maintain its dollar peg. Even though the protocol states that sUSD is still healthily over-collateralized, many in the crypto community now question whether any stablecoin can be trusted if the collateral it is backed by has been deemed by the market as having lost its value. sUSD was down 1.3% to $0.9860 at the time of writing. Short-Term Incentives, Long-Term Vision In reaction to the depegging, Synthetix is implementing initiatives to reinforce confidence and liquidity in the short term. These consist of: upping the ante for Curve liquidity pools — in which sUSD is paired with other stablecoins — and extending the Infinex deposit campaign. The campaign invites users to stake sUSD in exchange for rewards, effectively and temporarily helping to remove the excess supply from the market. The team is also working on something else that could change the demand dynamics for sUSD, and that’s something we call “snaxchain,” which is an initiative of ours that we hope will allow for a lot more utility in the sUSD space. What is snaxchain? It’s not so much a project as it is a rethinking of sUSD and the spaces in which it can be used and work. We have a lot of fun ideas, and some of them are quite wild. Discord message emphasized the criticality of the sUSD peg for the success of the 420 pool—”The sUSD peg is critical to the success of the 420 pool,” the Discord message stated. On the same day, another Discord message made clear the Plan B being acted upon. We will maintain incentives for a stable sUSD price during this transition towards longer-term solutions. Expected in the coming weeks are additional announcements that will outline further measures intended to stabilize sUSD. The market, until then, will remain in this holding pattern, with sUSD trading at a decent, if not too concerning, discount in comparison with the US dollar and SNX volatility reflecting the sort of concern mixed with hope that it has recently reflected. Though the current depeg is noteworthy, it is not the first instance of an algorithmic stablecoin having structural issues. What makes Synthetix distinct is its clear and forthright operation, along with its exhibited flexibility—both of which might help restore not just confidence in sUSD, but also in stablecoins as a whole. Even so, the clock is ticking. Stablecoins depend on stability — and getting back to the peg is now more than just a technical must. It’s a test of whether the trust that users place in stablecoins can be regained. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a post shared on X, Farina stated that he was frustrated by the apparent lack of price movement following major developments related to Ripple. He referenced Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition and expressed that, under fair market conditions, the price of XRP should have “skyrocketed.” He noted that various external narratives appear to be holding the price back. Not going to lie, today I was frustrated with the markets. In a fair market, XRP's price should’ve skyrocketed after today’s news about Ripple’s $1.25B acquisition. But, as always, there’s a narrative to suppress the price. whether it’s the lawsuit, the SEC’s war on crypto,… pic.twitter.com/aMfFQ7rkzK — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 8, 2025 These include the ongoing lawsuit involving Ripple, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s broader regulatory stance on the crypto industry, President Trump’s trade tariffs, and the recent Bitcoin crash. Farina insisted that if not for these factors, XRP would already be trading well above $100 without question. He closed his message by encouraging holders to remain patient and committed, asserting that “our time is coming.” Details of Ripple’s Acquisition According to a recent Times Tabloid article, Ripple has completed a record-breaking $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road, a global prime brokerage firm. The deal marks a significant expansion for Ripple, positioning it as the first crypto firm to own and operate a multi-asset global prime broker. Hidden Road’s existing infrastructure offers services in foreign exchange, digital assets, and other derivatives markets, and the acquisition is expected to enhance Ripple’s offerings in these areas. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The report notes that this strategic move aligns with Ripple’s broader goal of bridging traditional and blockchain-based financial systems. It also underscores Ripple’s commitment to expanding its presence in key financial jurisdictions, with Hidden Road already having regulatory footprints in North America, Europe, and Asia. With this acquisition, Ripple aims to streamline institutional access to digital assets through a regulated and comprehensive brokerage framework. Community Reactions and Broader Sentiment Farina’s comments echoed the sentiments of other XRP community members who were also surprised by the market’s muted reaction to the acquisition. One user, Atom XRPL, wrote , “Seriously it’s like XRP’s stuck in the mud sometimes… this acquisition was massive, it should’ve pumped like crazy! but!!! our time will come.” This perspective highlights a broader concern among XRP supporters that the asset’s price performance does not always correlate with Ripple’s business achievements or long-term prospects. Despite the frustration expressed by Farina and others in the XRP community, there remains a persistent belief that XRP’s value will eventually reflect its underlying fundamentals and Ripple’s expanding role in the financial sector.

CryptoPunk #3100, one of just nine Alien Punks in the original 10,000-piece collection, was sold for 4,000 Ethereum ( ETH ), worth about $6.07 million at the time of sale, according to an Apr. 10 transaction flagged by Arkham on X. The art brokerage firm Fountain reportedly brokered the sale, which was finalized through a private offer on the CryptoPunks marketplace.

But with Ethereum’s price down roughly 56% over the past year, the seller’s 500 ETH loss turned into a net $10 million hit in dollar terms.

At that time, ETH was trading at around $3,500, placing the floor price above $400,000 compared to just $65,900 at press time. As NFTs’ popularity and asset prices continue to fall , the industry has been facing significant pressure. In Q1 2025, NFT trading volume fell to $1.5 billion, a 24% decrease from Q4 2024, according to DappRadar’s Q1 report . Despite only a slight drop in trading activity, the steep drop in volume indicates fewer high-value transactions rather than a decline in users. CryptoPunks still commands a sizable share of the market, making up 23% of the $2.7 billion global NFT market capitalization.

43200636,https://nulltx.com/?p=147916,1744350523,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Altcoin Unlocks Near Completion: Market Still Sleeping on Fully Circulating Supply,https://nulltx.com/altcoin-unlocks-near-completion-market-still-sleeping-on-fully-circulating-supply/,"While the overall crypto market is dealing with ups and downs dictated by macroeconomic events and is undergoing a sector-wide re-pricing, one key storyline hasn’t really been told: Many of the altcoins that make up this market are getting set to unlock the vast majority of the tokens they hold by the end of 2025. Surprising as it may seem, this pivotal narrative isn’t quite grabbing the attention it probably should. Historically, token unlocks have been linked to price risks, with the locked supply gradually coming into the market. In contrast, the almost total unlocking of certain tokens eliminates this persistent overhang. This change has big implications. We’re in a space where Fully Diluted Valuations (FDVs) often cast shadows over market caps and make it hard to see genuine supply-demand dynamics. With only a few months left until full circulation for many major altcoins, traders and investors might be forgetting about an important inflection point: these projects will soon clear away supply-side uncertainty, probably making the pricing in these markets much cleaner and organic demand much more apparent. The Final Stretch: What’s Unlocking and When Upon looking closely, one can see that there are several altcoins whose total token supply is already more than 95% in circulation. Moreover, the remaining portion is set to unlock well before 2025. Here’s some more information about them and some of the main players in this area. Biconomy ($BICO) – Left to Unlock: 4% – Last Unlock Date: September 2025 – Fully Diluted Valuation: $89.1 million – Upcoming Allocation: Community Biconomy is a protocol that is simplifying Web3 interactions. It is in the last phase of its token distribution journey, with only 4% of its total supply left to unlock. This supply is earmarked for the community. Consequently, any sell pressure resulting from the allocations that are yet to unlock is minimal, and community-targeted allocations tend to be slower and more cautious in hitting the market compared to investor-and team-targeted allocations. This stroke of allocation luck makes the event relatively low-risk. Dodo (DODO) – Percent Remaining to Unlock: 5% – Total Unlock Date: July 2025 – Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV): $48.3 million – Allocated to: Community A decentralized exchange using Proactive Market Making (PMM), Dodo occupies a similar place. There, too, only 5% of the supply remains to be unlocked and the fully diluted valuation (FDV) is just 83.7 million—not much and certainly not large in comparison to some figures that are tossed around at the present time. Most of the dilution is already done there as well, and when 5% does unlock on Dodo, the community-targeted allocation will again help to soften the impact. Gelato ($GEL) -Left to Unlock: 3% – Last Unlock Date: September 2025 – FDV: $19.1 million – Planned Future Allocation: Team & Foundation Gelato, a Web3 automation layer, has just 3% of its tokens left to unlock. Unlike BICO and DODO, the tokens going to the team and foundation might introduce more risk. Still, the relatively small FDV limits the downside, especially if the unlock is gradual and transparent. Cartesi ($CTSI) – Left to Unlock: 3% – Last Unlock Date: Dec. ’25 – FDV: *$49.5 mil – Awaiting Allocation: Reserves Cartesi makes it possible to scale smart contracts based on Linux and also sits near the completion of its token unlock cycle. The final 3% is set to go into reserves — an allocation that often stays off the market for long periods — which suggests low immediate risk. VVS Finance ($VVS) – Unlocking Remains: 3% – Concluding Unlock Date: November 2025 – FDV:* At $209 million – Moneys Awaiting Allocation: Team VVS Finance is one of the higher-FDV projects on this list. Its team allocation is worth monitoring. Team unlocks can create sell pressure. But much of the supply is already in circulation, which helps balance concerns. These tokens will be fully unlocked by 2025 — and the market isn’t pricing it in. While many altcoins still carry unlock overhangs, these tokens are nearing 100% circulating supply, removing a key source of supply-side risk. Check: – Remaining % to unlock – Final unlock date -… pic.twitter.com/00pDXH6o7e — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) April 9, 2025 Coin98 ($C98) – Unlocking Remaining: 5% – Unlock Date Final: June 2025 – Valuation in USD at Full Unlock: 49.7 million department: Pending Allocation: Community, Treasury, Team. The unlock saga of Coin98 is more intricate, with the leftover tokens divided among the community, treasury, and teams. Depending on how these groups manage their tokens, there could be varied levels of impact. But with just 5 percent of the tokens left to unlock, the worst is clearly over. 1inch (1INCH) – Unlocking Remaining: 8% – Final Unlocking Date: December 2025 – Fully Diluted Valuation: $242 million – Allocation Pending: Team & Investors 1inch is the farthest from full circulation on this list, with 8% of the supply still locked and destined for insiders. This could create more volatility, especially considering its larger FDV and investor allocation. Still, the unlock horizon isn’t long, and the worst might already be priced in. Unlocking Opportunity in a Mispriced Market Despite the market being caught up in macro narratives and the meme coin frenzy, the upcoming full unlocks in a few select digital assets present something of an opportunity for those investors plugged into the real story. Unlike the typical offer that comes with an initial coin offering (ICO), where tokens are doled out in stages with no expectation that they will be for sale until the offer is exhausted, the day after defined unlock periods end, in this case, defined by the time on the digital clock in the upper right corner of an asset’s UI in its blockchain environment. In a crypto world where attention and liquidity are everything, projects that have fully circulating supplies and low FDVs may reemerge as the ones allocators like to talk about. The problem is the allocators never seem to talk about them until the market is aware they have been unlocked. This prompts a question: Is the market aware of what it has anyway? As of now, the clock appears to be ticking, and the opportunity to front-run the entire supply realization may be coming to an end. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In an April 10 letter to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Senators said the decision to disband the department’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team was a “grave mistake” that would support “sanctions evasion, drug trafficking, scams, and child sexual exploitation.” Senators Richard Durbin, Mazie Hirono, Sheldon Whitehouse, Christopher Coons and Richard Blumenthal signed the letter in addition to Warren. On April 7, Blanche shuttered the DOJ’s crypto enforcement team, saying in a memo that “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator.” The senators claim that the decision gave a “free pass to cryptocurrency money launderers” and claimed that crypto mixing services — used to obfuscate blockchain transactions — are “go-to tools for cybercriminals.” “It makes no sense for DOJ to announce a hands-off approach to tools that are being used to support such terrible crimes,” the letter said. An excerpt of Democrat’s letter to the DOJ. Source: US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs The senators also questioned why the Justice Department had decided not to prosecute a “host of crimes involving digital assets, including violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.” They claimed that this creates a “systemic vulnerability in the digital assets sector,” which “drug traffickers, terrorists, fraudsters, and adversaries” will exploit on a large scale. The lawmakers requested a staff-level briefing no later than May 1, providing “detailed information on the rationale behind these decisions.” Targeting Trump family crypto endeavors The letter also took a swipe at the Trump family’s crypto projects , suggesting potential conflicts of interest. Related: SafeMoon boss cites DOJ’s nixed crypto unit in latest bid to toss suit A press release accompanying the letter stated that the senators are raising concerns about the “potential connections” between the DOJ’s actions and the crypto ventures of President Donald Trump and his family. The Trumps have an interest in and have backed the crypto platform World Liberty Financial along with its token. The platform is also planning to launch a stablecoin while President Trump’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are working to launch a crypto-mining company called American Bitcoin. “Your decisions give rise to concerns that President Trump’s interest in selling his cryptocurrency may be the reason for easing law enforcement scrutiny,” the Democrats stated. In a memo announcing the crypto enforcement team’s disbandment, Blanche accused the Biden administration of using the Justice Department to “pursue a reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution.” Magazine: Illegal arcade disguised as … a fake Bitcoin mine?

The decision, delivered in typical Trumpian flair, has ignited a wave of optimism among investors and traders who were growing weary of relentless trade uncertainty. After the announcement, the U.S. and crypto markets rebounded sharply, taking back the direction they had been heading in for the past week—one filled with confusion, misinformation, and sell-off panic that had so many investors deciding to divest. On the day of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price leapt to $82,600, Ethereum’s value jumped to $1,650, the S&P 500 stock index surged 8.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw a stunning one-day surge of 10%.

This positive news (albeit a temporary alleviation to a still… pic.twitter.com/zOWbDZflml — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 9, 2025 The shift, although it is transitory and affects just a select few, has been enough to bring bullish sentiment back into a market that has become highly reactive—if not downright jumpy—to anything related to the trade war. From False Alarms to FOMO Today’s market activity couldn’t be any more different from what we saw just 48 hours ago. On Monday, traders were sent scrambling by a misreported story that was doing the rounds. It had us believing we were on the verge of a tariff pause — something we’ve all been waiting for. Of course, the story turned out to be wrong, and when traders realized we were still on the verge of tariff hell instead, prices corrected right back to where they’d been just before the rumor broke. Adding insult to injury, Tuesday then hit us with the news that we were slapping China with a new massive 104% tariff hike. Ouch! The present, definitively declared notification has altered the atmosphere, albeit for now. The primary distinction? At last, the cessation is endorsed—applying to all countries save China. Yet this exempting of China hardly resolves the wider issue of global trade turbulence. Still, it is more than enough to set can’t-sit-still investors, who have been abiding in sidelined status, in a FOMO frenzy. And signal it did. The markets wasted no time in pricing in the optimistic signals. Bitcoin, which had taken a beating during the false start earlier in the week, rebounded swiftly, now bolstered by a surge in risk appetite and a renewed narrative that it is a potential inflation hedge. Ethereum followed, although its gains were more muted, reflecting a continued divide in confidence between the top two cryptocurrencies. In the stock market, the rally was even more marked. The S&P 500 had its best single-day gain in recent memory, rising 8.1% as big investors and individual traders piled in. The Nasdaq, always more reactive to shifts in economic policy, leaped even more at 10%, as tech companies continued to benefit from the renewed hope of a somewhat improved global trade situation—not that anyone’s counting on it in the long term. Caution Beneath the Euphoria Even with all the excitement, market fundamentals are still as unclear as ever. A 90-day tariff truce is still just a truce. It doesn’t repair the harm done over years of back-and-forth trade battles, and with China still the main target, the largest and most prolonged uncertainty remains utterly unresolved. One trader observed, “Lately, the market compass has been greed and fear, and the crowd has been most accurate at indicating where the market is heading. And this bounce we’re seeing? It’s really about sentiment — not substance.” Traders who bought the dip in the past week, especially after Tuesday’s tariff shock, have received handsome rewards. But that could change just as quickly if the story shifts again — something that has become all too common in today’s markets, which seem more directed by emotional whiplash than by any grounded assessment of fundamentals. Indeed, the current market climate feels more like a narrative-driven soap opera. At present, the signal is clear: the market is very sensitive to news about tariffs, whether it is real news or just rumors. In these times of heightened volatility, even a short-term delay can set off a big market reaction. But just as easily, a single tweet or casual comment could send the market back down.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Boston Fed President Susan Collins made important assessments on interest rates, inflation and trade tariffs. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated that the course of the economy should be monitored before taking a new step in interest rate policies. “Right now, the Fed’s threshold for policy changes is quite high,” Goolsbee said, adding that all policy options should be kept on the agenda. Goolsbee said current tariffs will increase inflation and negatively impact economic growth in the short term. Describing the tariff system as a “major scenario,” Goolsbee said that although the Trump administration has suspended some measures, current levels are above most scenarios. Despite the previous sell-off in the bond market, Goolsbee said the strong 10-year Treasury note auction eased market concerns, adding that these sales were not limited to the U.S. Noting the difficulty of measuring financial conditions, Goolsbee avoided speculation on how the Fed would respond to market stress. Related News: Rumors Are Spreading About The Next Big US Move In The US-China Trade War - Here's The Leaked Information Noting that employment data remains strong, Goolsbee said he prefers to rely on market inflation expectations rather than survey data. Boston Fed President Susan Collins said the current interest rate policy is well positioned and that holding steady seems like the best option. Collins said there is still room for a rate cut in 2025, but that rising price pressures could delay that cut. Collins said the tariffs would put upward pressure on inflation and slow economic growth, warning that this could push core inflation well above 3% this year. Collins also said it was critical to keep inflation expectations steady. *This is not investment advice.

Thielen said in an April 11 markets report that credit spreads continue to widen, indicating that “recessionary concerns may be seeping deeper into the economy.” “Expecting a bullish impulse is too early,” he said. Bitcoin may face short-term headwinds While the long-term effects of a recession could be bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) — due to the monetary easing that typically follows US Federal Reserve rate cuts — Thielen warned that Bitcoin may face headwinds before gaining bullish momentum. “Normally, Bitcoin first sells off when China devalues or the Fed cuts, as the first cut might not be so impactful and also confirms economic weakness,” Thielen told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin is trading at $80,620 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks said in an April 10 X post that it is “time for a rate cut” after the core Consumer Price Index increased 2.8% year-by-year for March, the lowest it has been since March 2021. CME Group’s FedWatch Tool shows a 64.8% chance of no rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s May Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Traders typically see interest rate cuts and monetary supply expansions as positively affecting asset prices, especially Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, Thielen said that historically, when year-over-year credit spreads “begin to widen,” Bitcoin often faces more downside pressure and takes longer to recover. Related: Bitcoin ‘significantly de-risked here’ as nearly 80% of cyclical price correction is done — Analyst “This pattern suggests that while a longer-term opportunity may emerge, Bitcoin could still face pressure in the near term,” Thielen said. He added that currency devaluations have also historically been bearish for markets in the short term before being bullish in the long term. It comes amid growing concern among market participants over the weakening US dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is sitting at 100.337, down 2.92% over the past five days, according to TradingView data. The DXY is sitting at 100.337 at the time of publication.

The NY AG urged saying, lawmakers should mandate that crypto companies register with a federal regulatory agency. The firms must register to establish minimum listing standards for crypto tokens, she added. The letter comes as Congress prepares to pass GENIUS Act – a bipartisan step to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoin payments. Besides, James noted that lawmakers should require stablecoin issuers to have a U.S. presence. Onshoring stablecoins would help protect the U.S. dollar and the treasuries market, James noted. Source: ag.ny.gov Bitcoin Threat to Dollar Dominance The NY AG highlighted fraud risks and Bitcoin’s challenge to the U.S. dollar’s dominance. She noted that the growing crypto influence specifically Bitcoin, could undermine the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the global financial system. James also stressed that the displacement of the USD’s dominance by Bitcoin would weaken the dollar and “the ability for America to enforce its interests globally and to finance a robust economy.” Increasing Crypto Fraud Activities Need to Be Under Check: NY AG AG James called for stronger federal regulations to protect investors from increasing fraud and criminal activity within the digital asset space. She noted: “Countless New Yorkers invest in cryptocurrency and digital assets, and more must be done to protect them and their money. Thousands of investors in New York and across the country have lost millions of dollars to cryptocurrency scams and fraud that could be prevented with stronger federal regulations.” New York lawmakers already introduced a new bill on March 5 aimed at combating cryptocurrency fraud, particularly rug pulls. The proposal came at a time when several high-profile incidents were reported involving meme coins.

Despite opposition from Democrats and strict republicans, the bill still made it through. Notably, the budget is a crucial part of Trump’s policy goals which he calls ‘a big, beautiful bill’. He views it as a major win for his administration and supporters. After a narrow 216-214 bill House vote on Thursday, Trump shared in a social media post – “ Congratulations to the House on the passage of a Bill that sets the stage for one of the Greatest and Most Important Signings in the History of our Country.” House Plan Includes Bigger Cuts, $5T in Tax Breaks The House and Senate have passed different versions of the bill and now they need to merge them together into one final version which Trump can sign. The process is called ‘Reconciliation’. Notably, the House’s version includes bigger spending cuts and proposes around $5 trillion in tax cuts. But this could increase the national debt by about a whopping $5.7 trillion over 10 years. With the US government currently owing around $36 trillion, this plan could significantly add to the debt unless other savings or revenue sources are found. Initially, some staunch Republicans opposed the bill over rising US debt concerns demanding bigger spending cuts. Earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the vote fearing it would not pass due to the slim Republican majority. Only two republicans voted against it by Thursday. The Senate’s version of the bill passed on Saturday includes at least $4 billion in spending cuts which is far less than the $1.5 trillion in cuts proposed by the House. The Senate Republicans note that the $4 billion is just the minimum figure and they will do everything they can to be as aggressive as possible. Critics Warn This Could Worsen US Debt Trump’s new budget bill proposes major spending cuts and big tax breaks including cuts on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. While supporters claim that it will boost the economy, critics warn that it could worsen US debt. White House believes that higher tariffs will cover up the losses, but experts warn that fewer imports could lead to lesser revenue. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent praised that the bill shows the administration’s commitment to growth. The Congress may have to soon raise the US’ debt ceiling again. While the House passed the bill, Democrats call it reckless due to the proposed cuts to medicaid and are determined to fight harder in Congress. The fight within the party comes as Trump’s tariffs have led to global market chaos. Lawmakers are concerned that a slowed economy due to trade war could result in lower tax revenues. White House Slams Insider Trading Claim The White House criticised the accusations by Democrats who questioned whether some lawmakers knew in advance of Trump’s surprise Tariff pause, which triggered a sharp stock market rally. After dropping for four days, markets surged on Trump’s 90-day delay on steep tariffs for countries other than China. Besides, Trump’s advisor Peter Navarro dismissed concerns that the sudden tariff pause caused lasting economic damage. Instead he said that it was just ‘a normal pullback’ and no big deal. He also claimed that the media outlets were exaggerating and turning the situation into political “spin.”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 06:13:28

The drop follows a steep decline in recent days, with the token down over 30% in the last 14 days and more than 80% below its February 26th peak. The price pressure comes as a massive token unlock continues to unfold. According to PiScan, more than 119 million Pi tokens are expected to enter circulation this month alone, with 1.4 million already unlocked on April 11 alone. The remaining tokens will be released gradually throughout the rest of the month. Community Frustration Grows Over Delays and Lack of Transparency As prices tumble, discontent within the Pi Network community is reaching new highs. Recetly, Pi Network Turkey, the project’s largest community group in the region, issued a strong statement criticizing the core team’s handling of the project. The group accused Pi Network developers of adopting a top-down management style, ignoring community feedback, and straying from the platform’s original decentralized vision. “What we once eagerly anticipated has now turned into disappointment,” the statement read, stressing broken promises, lack of transparency, and indefinite delays to the Open Mainnet launch. The group also pointed to unclear financials, vague details on partnerships, and little visibility into the actual number of live decentralized applications (dApps) on the network. Is Pi Network Losing Trust? Some analysts believe the sharp decline in Pi’s value is being driven not only by token unlocks but also by widening skepticism about the project’s long-term vision and deliverables. As concerns mount over whether Pi Network is truly building a meaningful Web3 ecosystem — or simply riding the crypto hype — the project’s credibility appears to be at risk.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 06:14:18

In a big win for the crypto community, President Donald Trump has officially signed off on the repeal of the controversial IRS “DeFi Broker Rule.” This marks the first time a crypto-related bill has ever become law in the United States — a significant milestone that reflects the changing attitude toward digital assets at the federal level. Crypto Czar David Sacks credited Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Carey, and Bryan Steil for pushing the resolution through Congress. UPDATE: As promised, President Trump has signed the bill to repeal the DeFi Broker Rule. Congratulations to @SenTedCruz , @RepMikeCarey , and @RepBryanSteil for steering the resolution through Congress. https://t.co/SugdszjIPp — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) April 11, 2025 What Was the DeFi Broker Rule? Originally introduced during the Biden administration , the DeFi Broker Rule was set to take effect in 2027. It aimed to expand IRS reporting requirements by forcing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to report details about crypto transactions, including the gross proceeds and user information, similar to traditional brokers reporting stock trades. Supporters of the rule claimed it would help prevent tax evasion, especially among the wealthy. However, critics said it would impose impossible demands on decentralized systems that don’t have centralized operators or user databases. Why It Was Repealed Trump’s repeal of the rule came after heavy criticism from lawmakers and crypto advocates who believed it would stifle innovation and overwhelm the IRS with data it’s not equipped to process. Representative Mike Carey, one of the key backers, said the rule would have hurt everyday Americans’ privacy while creating chaos during tax season. HISTORY MADE Just now, @POTUS signed my bill to repeal to the IRS DeFi Crypto Broker Rule. This is the first cryptocurrency bill EVER signed into law by a president. @HouseGOP is working to keep America as the crypto capital of the world! — Congressman Mike Carey (@RepMikeCarey) April 10, 2025 Crypto lobby groups like the Blockchain Association even filed lawsuits calling the rule an “unconstitutional overreach.” Their CEO, Kristin Smith, celebrated the repeal, stating that crypto innovators could “breathe again” and that the rule would have destroyed the U.S. crypto industry. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : House Approves Trump’s Budget Bill with Trillion-Dollar Tax Cuts and Big Spending Cuts , How It Happened The resolution to repeal the rule moved quickly through Congress. It passed the House in March and the Senate shortly after. Trump’s signature on April 10 officially turned it into law. According to reports, Trump was expected to support the move, especially after his crypto advisor David Sacks confirmed the President’s favorable stance toward crypto policies. The repeal of the DeFi Broker Rule sends a strong message that the U.S. may be shifting toward more crypto-friendly regulations. Under Trump’s administration, the SEC has already begun to roll back aggressive enforcement actions taken under Gary Gensler, signaling a new approach that leans more toward innovation than regulation. Overall, this could mark the beginning of a much-needed regulatory reset for the crypto industry. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43201498,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148539,1744352391,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,North Carolina’s Revolutionary Bill: Legalizing Bitcoin as Payment – A Crypto Breakthrough?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/north-carolina-bitcoin-legal-payment/,"Is North Carolina about to become a beacon for Bitcoin adoption in the United States? A groundbreaking new bill, the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act, has been introduced, and it’s sending ripples of excitement through the cryptocurrency community. Could this be a pivotal moment for Bitcoin and digital assets in the state and beyond? Let’s dive into what this bill entails and what it could mean for you. What’s Brewing in North Carolina? The Push for Bitcoin as Legal Payment Representative Neal Jackson is spearheading a legislative effort that could redefine how digital assets are perceived and utilized in North Carolina. The proposed North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act isn’t just another piece of legislation; it’s a bold step towards acknowledging the legitimacy and utility of decentralized cryptocurrencies, specifically those resembling Bitcoin . At its core, the bill seeks to recognize certain decentralized digital assets as lawful methods of payment within the state. But what exactly does this mean? Here’s a breakdown: Legal Tender Recognition: The bill aims to classify digital assets that meet specific criteria as legal forms of payment. This means businesses and individuals could legally use these assets for transactions, including paying taxes to the state. Specific Criteria for Recognition: The bill isn’t opening the door to every cryptocurrency out there. It sets forth stringent requirements for a digital asset to qualify, including: Proof-of-Work Mechanism: Assets must operate on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, a hallmark of Bitcoin’s security and decentralization. Capped Supply: A limited, or capped, supply is another key criterion, mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity and predictable monetary policy. Significant Market Capitalization: The asset must boast a market capitalization exceeding $750 billion. This benchmark effectively points directly to Bitcoin , as it is currently the only cryptocurrency that consistently meets this massive valuation. Implicit Bitcoin Focus: While the bill doesn’t explicitly name Bitcoin , the criteria are so narrowly defined that it strongly suggests Bitcoin is the intended beneficiary of this legislation. Following the CBDC Ban: Interestingly, this bill emerges shortly after North Carolina’s 2024 ban on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This sequence of events could indicate a clear preference within the state legislature for decentralized, permissionless cryptocurrencies over centralized, government-controlled digital currencies. Why is North Carolina Considering This Move? Unpacking the Benefits of Legalizing Bitcoin So, why is North Carolina potentially paving the way for Bitcoin to become a recognized form of legal payment ? Let’s explore the potential advantages: Economic Innovation and Attractiveness: Embracing digital assets can position North Carolina as a forward-thinking, innovative state, attracting businesses and individuals within the burgeoning cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. This could lead to economic growth, job creation, and increased investment within the state. Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can offer alternative financial avenues for individuals who are unbanked or underbanked. By recognizing Bitcoin as legal payment , North Carolina could promote greater financial inclusion and accessibility for its residents. Reduced Transaction Costs: Cryptocurrency transactions can often have lower fees compared to traditional banking systems, especially for international transfers. This could benefit businesses and consumers alike. Enhanced Privacy and Control: Decentralized cryptocurrencies offer users greater control over their funds and potentially enhanced privacy compared to traditional financial systems. Tax Revenue Opportunities: By formally recognizing Bitcoin for tax payments, the state could streamline tax collection processes for cryptocurrency holders and potentially tap into a new revenue stream. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead for Crypto Regulation While the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act presents exciting possibilities, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Here are some key points to ponder regarding crypto regulation : Challenge Description Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are known for their price volatility. This can pose challenges for businesses accepting Bitcoin for payments, as the value of the asset can fluctuate significantly in short periods. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving both at the state and federal levels. Navigating these uncertainties and ensuring compliance will be crucial. Consumer Education and Protection Widespread adoption of Bitcoin as legal payment will necessitate robust consumer education initiatives to ensure users understand the risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies. Consumer protection measures will also be vital to safeguard users from fraud and scams. Infrastructure and Adoption For Bitcoin to function effectively as a legal payment method, the necessary infrastructure for seamless transactions needs to be in place. This includes payment processors, point-of-sale systems, and widespread merchant adoption. Environmental Concerns Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin , have faced criticism regarding their energy consumption. Addressing environmental concerns and promoting sustainable cryptocurrency practices will be important for long-term acceptance. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you’re a cryptocurrency enthusiast, a business owner in North Carolina, or simply curious about the future of finance, this bill warrants attention. Here’s what you can consider: Stay Informed: Keep track of the progress of the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act. Follow legislative updates and news from reputable sources like Cointelegraph to understand how this bill is developing. Engage with Policymakers: If you’re a resident of North Carolina, consider contacting your representatives to express your views on this legislation. Your voice can influence the direction of crypto regulation in your state. Prepare Your Business: If you own a business in North Carolina, start thinking about the potential implications of Bitcoin becoming a legal payment option. Explore payment processing solutions and consider how you might integrate cryptocurrency payments into your operations. Educate Yourself on Bitcoin: Whether or not this bill passes, understanding Bitcoin and other digital assets is becoming increasingly important in our rapidly evolving financial landscape. Take the time to learn about the technology, its potential benefits, and associated risks. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future? North Carolina’s proposed bill is undoubtedly a significant development in the ongoing conversation about cryptocurrency adoption and crypto regulation in the United States. By aiming to recognize Bitcoin -like assets as legal payment , North Carolina is not just following a trend; it’s potentially setting a precedent. This legislative push could ignite further discussions and actions in other states, accelerating the integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. The journey towards widespread cryptocurrency adoption is complex and multifaceted, but initiatives like the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act signal a compelling shift towards a more digitally inclusive financial future. The world is watching to see if North Carolina will indeed become a pioneer in this exciting new era.

Hailing the move, Congressman Mike Carey posted “HISTORY MADE,” saying the law removes an undue burden from decentralized finance. What Was the IRS DeFi Broker Rule and Why Was It So Opposed? This rule came from Infrastructure Act changes, expanded the definition of a “broker” to include anyone transferring digital assets for a fee. Critics argued that applying the rule to self-hosted or non-custodial wallets and decentralized protocols was impossible to comply with and clearly aimed to stifle innovation.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-entering-grinding-phase-after-boredom-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto market analyst Egrag Crypto has shared a new technical outlook for XRP, indicating that the asset has transitioned from what he previously described as the “boredom phase” into a new phase he calls the “grinding phase.” In a tweet accompanied by a detailed chart, Egrag emphasized that the next movements for XRP may be slow and difficult in the short term, but he reaffirmed confidence in a longer-term breakout scenario , provided a critical support level holds. #XRP – After Boredom: Entering the Grinding Phase! Many of you remember that boredom phase I talked about it. We just came out of now and we’re in the Grinding Phase! Honestly, the yellow formation, blue formation, or any of the hundreds of formations don’t concern me in the… pic.twitter.com/9o69HaLLix — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 9, 2025 Support Line Becomes the Crucial Technical Marker The chart posted by Egrag outlines a falling wedge formation, typically considered a bullish reversal pattern when occurring in a downtrend. The chart shows XRP trading just above a yellow descending support trendline. This trendline appears to be acting as the lower boundary of the wedge pattern, and Egrag underscores its importance with the statement: “Lose this support line, we’re fooked.” This line currently sits just under the $1.80 region. Short-Term Movements Unclear, Structural Completion Preferred According to the analysis, Egrag sees two possible short-term trajectories within the wedge. The chart displays a yellow and a blue path, each illustrating a prolonged consolidation within the formation before a potential breakout. The blue path appears to track a more volatile grind within the formation, while the yellow suggests a lower low might form before a reversal occurs. Egrag suggests he would prefer this lower low form, as it would better complete the wedge pattern structurally and potentially set up for a stronger upside move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite the short-term uncertainty, he maintains that XRP is positioned for a significant breakout. He identifies the primary resistance zone at approximately $2.73 and sets a measured move target at $4.00, aligning with the height of the wedge projected from the breakout point. While not specifying a timeline for this potential surge, the chart projection shows a steep move upward taking place sometime in the third quarter of 2025. Long-Term Outlook Remains Firm Despite Near-Term Volatility In his commentary, the analyst downplays the significance of various short-term formations, suggesting that the focus should remain on the long-term structural setup. “Honestly, the yellow formation, blue formation, or any of the hundreds of formations don’t concern me in the short term,” he wrote, pointing to the integrity of the support line as the primary technical priority. He concludes his tweet with encouragement directed at the XRP community, reinforcing his long-term optimism: “My long-term targets remain intact, so don’t get rattled!” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 892,000 YouTube subscribers that if Bitcoin falls below $69,000, a bear market phase may ensue. “In the short term for Bitcoin, the good news is that we’ve maintained above the 2024 high; we maintained above that. And that’s a good thing. And I still think that Bitcoin could go all the way down to $69,000 and the structure of the market stay intact. But below that, I would not be as optimistic. Okay, I wouldn’t be. This is the zone [between $73,617 and $69,048] where you really would want to see the bulls come to the table and hold support because if they don’t, and if it comes down here [below $69,000], that’s probably it.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $79,752 at time of writing, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours. Cowen also believes that either US President Donald Trump or the Fed will take action in the coming months to counter drastic downward moves in the stock market as Trump keeps his tariff war going. “I think there are levels in the market where the powers that be will try to step in and try and encourage market participants to take on risk and to get more exposure. And I think there is a chance here that we just figured out where that is for the President, and it’s a 20% drawdown in the S&P or potentially the 10-year yield skyrocketing. Now, we don’t yet know… where the Fed will then come to the rescue. We don’t know that yet…. So it’s one of those things where, if the President steps in and reduces some of the uncertainty, then the Fed might not have to do anything, but if he continues on with it, then we’ll figure out where the Fed put is. If we get out into July and all this tariff stuff just comes right back, then we might figure out where the Fed will actually start to try to intervene. But I thought that this was the level that the President decided it was time to try to intervene and figure something else out.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to data from Solid Intel, the number of publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin (BTC) has soared to 100! This landmark figure signals a growing acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into traditional corporate treasury strategies. But what does this mean for the crypto market, for these companies, and for you as an investor? Let’s dive deep into this exciting development and uncover the implications of this institutional Bitcoin adoption. Why Are Public Companies Embracing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The decision for public companies to allocate a portion of their treasury to Bitcoin is not taken lightly. It’s a strategic move driven by a confluence of factors, reflecting a fundamental shift in how businesses view and manage their assets. Let’s explore some key drivers behind this institutional Bitcoin adoption : Hedge Against Inflation: With fiat currencies facing inflationary pressures, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a viable hedge. Its limited supply of 21 million coins contrasts sharply with the potentially unlimited supply of government-issued currencies, making it an attractive store of value in times of economic uncertainty. Diversification: Smart financial management emphasizes diversification. Holding Bitcoin allows companies to diversify their treasury beyond traditional assets like cash and bonds, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Yield Enhancement: In a low-interest-rate environment, Bitcoin presents an opportunity for yield enhancement. While volatile, Bitcoin’s potential for significant price appreciation can outperform traditional low-yield assets over the long term. Technological Disruption and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin can be viewed as a forward-thinking move, aligning companies with technological innovation. It signals an understanding of the evolving financial landscape and positions them to benefit from the potential of blockchain technology and digital assets in the future. Following Market Leaders: The early adoption of Bitcoin by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla has paved the way and provided a degree of validation for other public companies. Seeing successful examples reduces perceived risk and encourages others to explore similar strategies. What are the Benefits for Public Companies Holding Bitcoin? Beyond the motivations, what tangible benefits do public companies expect to gain from including corporate Bitcoin holdings in their portfolios? The advantages are multifaceted and can impact various aspects of their business. Enhanced Investor Appeal: In today’s market, showing innovation and embracing future-oriented technologies can attract investors. Companies holding Bitcoin may be seen as more progressive and forward-thinking, potentially boosting investor confidence and stock valuations. Improved Balance Sheet Performance: If Bitcoin appreciates in value, it directly impacts the company’s balance sheet, increasing its asset value. This can lead to stronger financial metrics and improved credit ratings over time. Brand Differentiation: Being among the first in a traditional sector to adopt Bitcoin can create a unique selling proposition and differentiate a company from its competitors. It can attract customers and talent who value innovation and technological advancement. Access to New Markets and Demographics: Cryptocurrency adoption is particularly strong among younger demographics and in emerging markets. Holding Bitcoin can signal to these groups that the company is attuned to their preferences and potentially open up new market opportunities. Potential for Future Integration: As the crypto ecosystem matures, companies holding Bitcoin are better positioned to integrate it into their operations, whether for payments, supply chain management, or other innovative applications. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the potential benefits are compelling, navigating corporate Bitcoin holdings is not without its challenges. Public companies must carefully consider several factors before venturing into this space: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is perhaps the most significant concern. Dramatic price swings can impact a company’s balance sheet and financial reporting, requiring robust risk management strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies must navigate complex and often unclear regulations related to accounting, taxation, and compliance, which vary significantly across jurisdictions. Security and Custody: Securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust custody solutions and cybersecurity measures. Companies must choose reputable custodians and implement best practices to protect their digital assets from theft or loss. Accounting and Reporting Standards: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings is not straightforward. Current accounting standards may not perfectly align with the nature of digital assets, requiring careful interpretation and potentially impacting financial reporting. Operational Complexity: Integrating Bitcoin into treasury operations requires new expertise and processes. Companies need to develop in-house capabilities or partner with specialists to manage Bitcoin transactions, custody, and reporting effectively. Public Perception and ESG Concerns: Bitcoin’s energy consumption and environmental impact are subjects of ongoing debate. Companies must be prepared to address potential public perception issues and consider sustainable practices in their crypto strategies, especially given increasing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scrutiny. Examples of Public Companies with BTC on Balance Sheet The list of public companies with BTC on balance sheet is growing, representing diverse sectors and geographical locations. Here are a few notable examples: Company Ticker Sector Estimated BTC Holdings MicroStrategy MSTR Software ~190,000+ BTC Tesla TSLA Automotive ~9,720 BTC (as of reports, may vary) Marathon Digital Holdings MARA Bitcoin Mining ~17,631 BTC Hut 8 Mining Corp HUT Bitcoin Mining ~9,110 BTC Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN Cryptocurrency Exchange ~9,000+ BTC Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors? The increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption has significant implications for both retail and institutional investors: Increased Market Maturity: More institutional involvement generally leads to greater market maturity, potentially reducing volatility over the long term and increasing market liquidity. Validation of Bitcoin as an Asset Class: When public companies allocate treasury to Bitcoin, it reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a recognized and investable asset class, further driving mainstream acceptance. Potential for Price Appreciation: Increased demand from institutional buyers can contribute to upward price pressure on Bitcoin, potentially benefiting existing Bitcoin holders and attracting new investors. Exposure to Bitcoin Through Traditional Investments: Investors can gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements by investing in the stocks of public companies that hold BTC. This can be an alternative or complementary approach to directly holding Bitcoin. Due Diligence is Still Key: While institutional adoption is a positive sign, investors should still conduct thorough due diligence before investing in Bitcoin or companies holding Bitcoin. Understand the risks involved and align investments with personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin and Corporate Finance? Reaching the milestone of 100 public companies holding Bitcoin is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of a fundamental shift in corporate finance and investment strategies. This explosive growth signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a key component of a diversified treasury. While challenges remain, the trend is clear: institutional Bitcoin adoption is accelerating, potentially paving the way for a new era where digital assets play an increasingly prominent role in the global financial landscape. As more companies explore and embrace Bitcoin, the implications for the crypto market and the broader economy are likely to be profound and transformative. The journey of Bitcoin into the heart of corporate treasury is just beginning, and the next chapter promises to be even more compelling.

Florida is the latest U.S. state to make strides toward adopting Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a strategic reserve asset, as its House Bill 487 (HB 487) passed through the House Insurance and Banking Subcommittee with unanimous support on April 10 hearing . The bill , titled “Investments of Public Funds in Bitcoin,” proposes allowing Florida’s Chief Financial Officer and State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of key public funds — including the General Revenue Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund — into Bitcoin. It outlines strict custody, security, and compliance protocols, and also enables Bitcoin held by the state to be loaned out or used in exchange-traded products. Having cleared the first of four committees, HB 487 must still pass through the Government Operations Subcommittee, the Ways & Means Committee, and the Commerce Committee before heading to the full House for a vote. If passed by the House, the bill will move to the Senate for consideration and, ultimately, the governor’s desk.

According to Bitcoin Laws, Arizona appears to be leading the legislative race. As of late March, its Senate Bills 1373 and 1025 — both related to digital asset reserves — have passed through the Senate and cleared the House Rules Committee. These bills are now headed for a full House vote. If successful, they would only require Governor Katie Hobbs ’ signature to become law, making Arizona the first state to officially adopt a Bitcoin reserve policy. Source: Bitcoin Laws Meanwhile, New Hampshire has also advanced its Bitcoin reserve bill (HB 302), which passed the full House in a 192-179 vote and is now under Senate review. The bill would allow the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of authorized funds into Bitcoin and precious metals, but only assets with a market cap exceeding $500 billion — a threshold currently met only by Bitcoin — would qualify.

The largest altcoin struggles against its top rivals like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL), which are gradually eating into its market share. Ethereum’s struggle follows reduced utility for ETH due to the prominence of layer 2 networks and lack of demand. Amid this shift, will Ethereum be the next Nokia and Solana the next Apple? Let’s find out. Ethereum Price Mirrors Nokia Downfall According to Crypto Curb, Ethereum price performance in the last four years looks similar to the rise and fall of Nokia. Just like Nokia, ETH has hit two main peaks in its history before crumbling to the present range lows. At press time, Ethereum struggled at two-year lows . This highlights failure to sustain high demand after its initial hype. Ethereum vs. Nokia CryptoCurb went ahead and added that Ethereum’s main competitor is Solana, which will likely displace it just like Apple did Nokia. His analysis adds to the years-long discussion within the Solana community on when SOL will flip Ethereum price and market cap to become the largest altcoin. The comparison of Ethereum and Nokia is based on several similarities. Just like Nokia, ETH saw much adoption, usage, and demand in its early years. However, it failed to evolve as fast as the dApp market grew, which created a gap that Solana filled with its low fees and fast speeds. Ethereum Market Share Under Threat From Rival Solana CryptoCurb’s analysis further noted that Solana is currently a third of the Ethereum market cap of $186 billion. The next target for SOL is to attain half of the market cap, which will place it on the path to overtake ETH. Solana vs. Ethereum Market Cap He added that there was a minimal chance that the Ethereum price would recover due to weak fundamentals and being overpriced. Per CryptoCurb “At some point, you have to look at the fundamentals over the technicals – ETH is still overpriced in comparison with its competitor (ETH at 3x the MC of SOL).” However, other analysts defended Ethereum , adding that the altcoin still has room to recover. Cryptobetzzz noted, “Comparing it to Nokia is just a little interesting. It’s a bit of a stretch but I do believe that it’s a scenario however an unlikely one.” Into The Cryptoverse CEO Benjamin Cowen also slammed Solana maxis saying they failed to acknowledge that SOL is also headed for the same downfall as Ethereum. Per Cowen’s bearish Ethereum price prediction , SOL/BTC is following ETH/BTC , which recently reached a five-year low. Ethereum Price Technical Analysis Ethereum price is under intense bearish pressure and selling activity. The RSI on the weekly chart has made several lower lows. At the same time, the AO bars show that bears are gaining strength. The only chance that this altcoin has to trigger a bullish Ethereum price forecast is if it bounces from the current demand zone between $1,500 and $1,600. Once it does this, it could pave the way for the next rally higher and possibly extend its gains past $2,000. ETH/USDT: 1-Week Chart To sum up, Ethereum price has a negative outlook as depicted by the similarities between its performance and that of Nokia. As Solana gains market share due to its advantages over ETH, Ethereum could be displaced and lose its status as the largest altcoin.

43203114,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148572,1744355721,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Relief for Crypto: Trump Vetoes IRS Broker Reporting Rule in Landmark Victory,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-vetoes-irs-crypto-rule/,"In a significant win for the cryptocurrency industry, former U.S. President Donald Trump has signed a joint resolution to repeal a contentious Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule targeting crypto brokers. This move, championed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mike Carey, effectively nullifies the “DeFi Broker Rule,” a regulation that had sparked considerable debate and opposition within the digital asset space. The repeal marks a pivotal moment, hailed as the first crypto-related legislation ever signed into law, signaling a potential shift in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States. What is the IRS Crypto Rule and Why Was it Controversial? The now-repealed IRS crypto rule, officially known as the “DeFi Broker Rule,” aimed to impose stringent data collection and reporting obligations on entities deemed “custodial brokers” within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. But what exactly did this entail, and why did it face such strong headwinds from the crypto community? Broad Definition of Broker: The core issue lay in the expansive definition of a “broker” under the proposed rule. Critics argued that it could encompass not just centralized exchanges, but also decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, miners, and even software developers who might not traditionally be considered brokers. This broad interpretation raised concerns about overreach and impractical implementation. Data Collection Burden: The rule mandated “custodial brokers” to collect and report extensive information on their users, including transaction details and counterparty information. For DeFi protocols and decentralized entities, this posed a significant technical and operational challenge, as these platforms are often designed to minimize data collection and operate without intermediaries. Privacy Concerns: The crypto industry voiced strong privacy concerns, arguing that the rule could lead to excessive surveillance and erode the fundamental principles of decentralization and financial privacy that underpin many cryptocurrencies. Innovation Stifling: Many in the crypto space feared that the burdensome reporting requirements would stifle innovation and drive crypto businesses and users away from the United States to more favorable regulatory jurisdictions. Essentially, the crypto industry viewed the “DeFi Broker Rule” as a misguided attempt to apply traditional financial regulations to a nascent and fundamentally different technological paradigm. The industry argued for a more nuanced and tailored approach to crypto regulation that acknowledges the unique characteristics of digital assets and fosters innovation rather than hindering it. Trump’s Intervention: A Victory Lap for Crypto Advocates? President Trump’s decision to sign the joint resolution is being celebrated as a major victory by crypto regulation advocates. The resolution, introduced by crypto-friendly lawmakers Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mike Carey, gained bipartisan support in Congress, highlighting a growing recognition of the need to address the concerns of the crypto industry. Representative Carey emphasized the historic nature of this event, noting it as the “first crypto-related legislation ever signed into law,” signaling a potential turning point in how the U.S. government approaches digital asset policy. Key Benefits of Repealing the IRS Crypto Rule: Reduced Regulatory Burden: The repeal immediately alleviates the regulatory burden on crypto businesses, particularly DeFi platforms, miners, and smaller entities that would have struggled to comply with the complex reporting requirements. Encourages Innovation: By removing the threat of overly burdensome regulations, the repeal is expected to foster innovation and growth within the U.S. crypto industry, encouraging entrepreneurs and developers to build and operate within the country. Protects Privacy: The repeal addresses privacy concerns by preventing the potentially excessive data collection that the “DeFi Broker Rule” could have enabled. Global Competitiveness: A more favorable regulatory environment could enhance the United States’ competitiveness in the global crypto landscape, attracting investment and talent. Crypto Broker Reporting : What Happens Next? While the repeal of the “DeFi Broker Rule” is a significant victory, it doesn’t mean the end of crypto broker reporting discussions. It is more likely a reset, prompting regulators and lawmakers to reconsider a more balanced and informed approach to crypto regulation. Here are some potential next steps and considerations: Revised Regulatory Framework: The IRS and other regulatory bodies may now need to develop a revised regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies that is more tailored to the specific characteristics of digital assets and DeFi. This could involve engaging with the crypto industry to understand its nuances and challenges. Clarity on Broker Definition: A crucial aspect of future regulations will be to establish a clearer and more precise definition of “broker” in the context of cryptocurrencies, ensuring that it targets genuine intermediaries without inadvertently capturing decentralized protocols or non-custodial entities. Focus on Risk-Based Approach: Future crypto regulation might adopt a more risk-based approach, focusing on areas where consumer protection and financial stability are most at risk, such as centralized exchanges and illicit activities, rather than imposing blanket rules on the entire crypto ecosystem. International Coordination: Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, international coordination on regulatory standards will be increasingly important to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure a level playing field. IRS Crypto Rule : A Look at the Road Ahead The journey of IRS crypto rule development is far from over. While the current rule has been repealed, the need for regulatory clarity and oversight in the crypto space remains. The repeal provides an opportunity for a more constructive dialogue between regulators, lawmakers, and the crypto industry to forge a path forward that balances innovation, consumer protection, and responsible growth. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The key challenge will be to strike the right balance between fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving crypto space and implementing necessary regulations to mitigate risks and protect consumers. Enforcement and Compliance: Even with a more tailored regulatory framework, effective enforcement and compliance will be crucial. This may require new tools and approaches to monitor and regulate decentralized and global crypto activities. Education and Understanding: Policymakers and regulators need to deepen their understanding of cryptocurrency technology and its implications to create informed and effective regulations. Industry Collaboration: Ongoing collaboration and dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry are essential to ensure that regulations are practical, effective, and do not stifle innovation. Trump Crypto Move: What Does it Mean for the Future? Donald Trump’s decision on the crypto broker reporting rule is being interpreted by many as a positive signal towards the crypto industry. While the long-term implications remain to be seen, this move could indicate a growing political willingness to accommodate and support the growth of the cryptocurrency sector in the United States. It also highlights the increasing political salience of crypto as a topic that can attract bipartisan attention and action. Actionable Insights for Crypto Participants: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of evolving regulatory developments in the crypto space, both in the U.S. and globally. Engage in Advocacy: Participate in industry advocacy efforts to shape future regulations and ensure that the crypto industry’s voice is heard. Prepare for Future Regulations: While the current rule is repealed, it is likely that new regulations will emerge. Crypto businesses should proactively prepare for future compliance requirements. Focus on Compliance and Best Practices: Even in the absence of specific regulations, adhering to best practices in security, transparency, and user protection is crucial for building trust and long-term sustainability in the crypto space. Conclusion: A Sigh of Relief, But the Journey Continues President Trump’s signing of the resolution to repeal the IRS “DeFi Broker Rule” represents a significant relief and a notable victory for the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the growing influence of the crypto lobby and signals a potential shift towards a more balanced regulatory approach. However, the journey of crypto regulation is far from over. The industry must remain vigilant, proactive, and engaged in shaping the future regulatory landscape to ensure that innovation thrives alongside responsible growth and consumer protection. This repeal is not the finish line, but rather a crucial milestone in the ongoing evolution of crypto in the United States.

Although the bulls have not been favoring the market, this meme-themed crypto is booming with gains from pure hype and technical factors. Interestingly, the experts anticipate it to surge higher due to the same hype. Is the next target $1? Let’s discuss this. Why is the Solana Meme Coin Fartcoin Price up 20% Today? Fartcoin is one of the most popular Solana meme coins , and its unique name has caught investors’ attention. While the rest of the crypto market is crashing, especially the meme-themed ones, the Fartcoin price is up 20% today. More importantly, its price has surged nearly 80% over the week, currently trading at $0.8416 with a market capitalization of $841.89M. This happened as the investors’ interest returned in the token, as explained by the rising open interest. More importantly, the majority of the capital is placed in long positions, revealing investors’ confidence in the asset for further rise. At the same time, shorts are liquidating, resulting in the traders rebuying the asset and pushing the price. Interestingly, a surge in all the Solana coins, including Bonk, Dogwifhat, and others, is noticed today. The crypto community anticipates that this marks the recovery of investor interest in these struggling digital assets. Fartcoin Price Prediction: Will it Hit $1 Next? As the Coinglass liquidation data hints at a further rise, various crypto analysts anticipate this Solana meme coin’s further rise. The token has previously achieved a high of $2.61 three months ago, so a $1 target is feasible. However, uncertainty still exists as the Trump trade war influences investors’ sentiments. Despite the odds, crypto analysts like Bitcoinconseus and others predict a $1.2 target. According to their analysis, the Fartcoin price chart is forming a bullish reversal pattern, where the horizontal resistance is already broken. The token can surge to $1.2 or higher if the bullish momentum continues amid high volume. Crypto General, an analyst even anticipates that it will hit $10 in the long crypto bull run, claiming that Fartcoin has bottomed out and consolidated above the breakout level. Another breakout from here would result in a $10 milestone.

The decline of the greenback triggered a flight to other currencies and assets, including the Swiss franc, Japanese yen, euro, and gold, all surging in a week of ups and downs. The Dollar Index (DXY), a benchmark that measures the US currency against a basket of six major peers, fell 0.85% on Friday to 100.009. The index briefly dipped below the psychological 100 level for the first time since July 2023. Over the past month, DXY has shed 3.48%, down 5.66% over the last year. According to Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, markets witnessed a “pronounced ‘sell USD'” sentiment, and capital was “migrating away from Ground Zero.” “ The USD is losing the safe-haven bid ,” Weston remarked. Dollar struggles create demand for other currencies, gold Data from TradingEconomics show the greenback dropped as much as 1.2% against the Swiss franc to 0.81405, the lowest since January 2015. It also slipped 1.1% against the yen to 142.88, marking its weakest since September 30. Against the Canadian dollar, the US currency slumped 0.5% to a five-month low of C$1.3910, while the euro rallied 1.7% to $1.13855, a level last seen in February 2022. Investors fleeing US assets drove up demand for gold, which climbed to a record $3,219.96 per ounce this week. Since the start of 2025, the precious metal has gained more than 22%, tracking its benchmark price on CFD markets. “ We are entering a pure ‘sell USD’ regime. Rate differentials are losing their sway over the USD for the first time in my life ,” reckoned Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra Markets. Markets were jolted a few times this week, and the frenzy continued after President Donald Trump abruptly announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs on Wednesday for dozens of US trading partners. The unexpected reversal came after the US administration was bombarded with criticism from policymakers, who feared Trump was leading America into a recession. Yet, the stubborn POTUS did not extend the pause to China. Trump increased import duties to an effective 145%, which escalated the already tense economic standoff between Washington and Beijing. On Thursday, the White House clarified that a new 20% levy had been added to the initial 125% duty on Chinese imports. The tariff spike had caused the Chinese yuan to tumble to an all-time low in offshore trading. However, the currency recovered in subsequent sessions, ending the day at 7.3211 yuan per dollar and up 0.1% on Friday’s pre-market sessions. Wall Street reverses relief rally Markets initially reacted positively to Trump’s tariff pause, which started a brief relief rally that pushed the S&P 500 index past the 5,000 mark on Wednesday after falling to a 2025 low. But sentiment soured rapidly, and Wall Street stocks plunged again yesterday. According to Yahoo Finance data, the S&P 500 fell nearly 3.5% at Thursday’s market close, while the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC), dominated by tech stocks, sank 4.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also tanked by around 1,000 points, or approximately 2.5%. “ People were getting a little queasy ,” Trump acknowledged on Wednesday, referring to the selloff in US Treasuries. The president admitted watching the bond market closely as investor nerves frayed. On the US debt side, the benchmark 10-year yield surged nearly 10 basis points on Friday to 4.488%, its steepest weekly rise since 2001. The 20-year bond yield climbed to 4.941%, continuing a month-long uptrend. The unusual tandem drop in both stocks and bonds triggered alarm. During periods of crisis, investors flock to Treasuries for safety. But this week, they fled from them, reportedly rattling the White House. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed the tariff retreat had been planned to lure nations back to negotiations. “ The bond market spooked the president ,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN. “ Bond vigilantes were screaming that they weren’t happy…and there was a potential for a recession.” Mohit Kumar, chief economist at Jefferies, called Trump’s change of “a blink” forced by markets. “ The reversal is in sharp contrast to the fanfare with which Trump unveiled his tariff policy just a week ago ,” he noted.

The ever-turbulent world of politics is once again intertwining with the digital finance realm, and this time, the spotlight is on former U.S. President Donald Trump. A fascinating new analysis from South Korea’s NH Investment & Securities suggests that the very risks associated with Trump’s political maneuvers could act as a potent catalyst, potentially unleashing a significant surge in crypto value . Let’s dive deep into how ‘Trump risks’ might just be the unexpected tailwind that propels cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, to new heights. Decoding Trump Risks: How They Fuel Crypto Value NH Investment & Securities, a prominent financial institution based in South Korea, has released an insightful analysis highlighting a counter-intuitive connection: political and economic uncertainties stemming from Donald Trump could inadvertently boost the appeal and, consequently, the crypto value . Their report, featured in Asia Business Daily, points to a weakening dollar influence as a key consequence of these ‘Trump risks’, creating a fertile ground for alternative assets like cryptocurrencies to flourish. But what exactly are these ‘Trump risks’ that could trigger such a shift? According to the analyst at NH Investment & Securities, the concerns are multifaceted and deeply rooted in potential policy shifts and economic strategies under a Trump administration. These risks are not just abstract political chatter; they have tangible implications for the global financial landscape. Key Trump Risks & Their Crypto Value Impact: Debt Ceiling Standoffs: Trump’s history includes aggressive negotiation tactics, particularly when it comes to the U.S. debt ceiling. Failure to reach a swift agreement could rattle global markets and erode confidence in the dollar. In such scenarios, investors often seek refuge in decentralized and independent assets like Bitcoin, driving up its crypto value . Treasury Debt Restructuring: The mere suggestion of restructuring U.S. Treasury debt – considered a bedrock of global finance – sends shivers down the spines of traditional investors. Such a move would be unprecedented and could severely damage the dollar’s reputation as a safe haven asset. Cryptocurrencies, seen as an alternative to traditional financial systems, could become increasingly attractive. Threats to Federal Reserve Independence: A recurring theme in Trump’s rhetoric has been criticism of the Federal Reserve and its monetary policy. Any perceived threat to the Fed’s independence could destabilize the dollar and push investors towards decentralized digital currencies, impacting crypto value positively. The Specter of a Third Trump Term: The possibility of another Trump presidency introduces policy uncertainty. His past actions and pronouncements on trade, international relations, and economic policy create volatility, which can be beneficial for alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Trade Wars and Deficit Reduction: Trump’s protectionist trade policies and focus on reducing trade deficits could lead to global economic friction and dollar weakness. In an environment of trade tensions and currency fluctuations, the fixed supply and borderless nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become compelling features. Bitcoin: The Apex Beneficiary of Dollar Doubt? The NH Investment & Securities analysis specifically highlights Bitcoin’s potential to benefit from these ‘Trump risks’. Why Bitcoin? Because Bitcoin, since its inception, has been envisioned as a digital gold, a decentralized alternative to fiat currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. The analyst suggests that Trump’s policies, whether intentionally or unintentionally, might be accelerating the very scenario Bitcoin’s creators foresaw: a weakening of the dollar’s global dominance. Bitcoin ‘s inherent characteristics position it uniquely to capitalize on dollar uncertainty: Decentralization: Unlike the dollar, which is controlled by the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, free from government or central bank influence. This makes it less susceptible to political and policy risks. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a stark contrast to fiat currencies, which can be printed at will. This scarcity is a core value proposition, especially during times of inflation or currency devaluation. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin transactions are borderless and permissionless. In a world potentially fractured by trade wars and geopolitical tensions, this global accessibility is a significant advantage. Store of Value Narrative: Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value, akin to gold, gains traction when traditional safe-haven assets like the dollar face headwinds. Dollar Influence Under Scrutiny: A Crypto Springboard? The report emphasizes the weakening dollar influence as a crucial factor. For decades, the U.S. dollar has reigned supreme as the world’s reserve currency. However, geopolitical shifts, rising national debts, and alternative financial systems are challenging this dominance. ‘Trump risks’, in this context, could be seen as accelerating an existing trend of diversification away from the dollar. If the dollar’s influence wanes, investors and nations alike may seek alternative stores of value and mediums of exchange. Cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the charge, are increasingly being viewed as viable alternatives. This shift in perception can have a profound impact on the long-term crypto value and adoption rates. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors While the analysis suggests a potential upside for cryptocurrencies from ‘Trump risks’, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this landscape: Insight Actionable Step Stay Informed Keep abreast of geopolitical developments, U.S. economic policy announcements, and expert analyses of ‘Trump risks’. Diversify Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio and consider a mix of asset classes. Manage Risk Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Crypto investments should be part of a well-rounded financial strategy. Long-Term Perspective Focus on the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies rather than short-term market fluctuations driven by political events. Due Diligence Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency before investing. Understand the technology, use cases, and market dynamics. Conclusion: Trump Risks – A Double-Edged Sword for Crypto? The analysis from NH Investment & Securities presents a compelling, albeit nuanced, perspective. ‘Trump risks’, while potentially disruptive to traditional markets, could paradoxically serve as a catalyst for cryptocurrency adoption and value appreciation, particularly for Bitcoin. The weakening dollar influence , driven by these risks, creates an environment where decentralized, alternative assets become increasingly attractive. However, it’s vital to approach this potential upside with caution and a thorough understanding of market volatility and risk management. The intersection of politics and crypto is rarely predictable, but it certainly makes for fascinating times in the world of digital finance.

Good news for the crypto market?,https://crypto.news/trump-seeks-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell-via-the-supreme-court-good-news-for-the-crypto-market/,"The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been named one of the unluckiest Fed chairs as he has to deal with a terrible mess created by Donald Trump’s tariffs policy. Since Powell ignored Trump’s urges to cut interest rates, Trump decided to fire him via the Supreme Court. Let’s dive deeper into the nature of this conflict and figure out if Powell’s resignation would be good for crypto. What led to the conflict? First off, the Powell-Trump conflict is not new. The consistent leaning of Powell’s Fed towards keeping interest rates high to keep inflation in check has always been a problem for Trump. However, in December 2024, Trump said he would not try to make Powell go. However, it seems Trump has had enough this time. Tariffs deployed on trading with dozens of countries on the so-called Liberation Day on Apr. 2, 2025, have seriously shaken the stock market around the globe. The crypto markets responded with 10 to 20 percent downfalls on Apr. 7. The same day, many stock markets saw the worst drops in value in decades. Crypto liquidations reached around $888 million on that day. American markets saw lower declines. Partly, this can be explained by the rumors of a possible 90-day pause on tariffs. The White House rejected the news as fake news, but later, it turned out that it was true, except for China. Instead, the U.S. deployed even harsher tariffs on China, raising it to 145% as of press time. The media called tariffs a “shock” for the economy and the markets. Read more: Markets close lower as Trump notes tariff problems and Fed flags recession risk The fear greed index has reached a strong “extreme fear” point following the Liberation Day and the following week. The situation began to look threatening for small businesses in the U.S., as Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman vividly outlined in an X post shown below. Our stock market is down. Bond yields are up and the dollar is declining. These are not the markers of successful policy. I am receiving an increasing number of emails and texts from small business people I do business with or have invested in, expressing fear that they will… — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) April 9, 2025 Donald Trump expressed no regrets about bombing the markets. In February, he even warned the public about the “pain” that tariffs may bring to Americans. He suggested that it is a reasonable price for the golden age of America to come. Nevertheless, the 90-day pause and the openness for negotiations with many countries, including China, changed the vibe. Some think that Trump deliberately wanted to scare other countries to make them negotiate on America’s terms. Others believe Trump capitulated to angered billionaires and investors. Either way, many don’t understand how the hurdles set for American companies with manufacturing operations in China can help America thrive. Indeed. I’d go so far as to say that the US is now viewed as an extremely unreliable trading partner by the rest of the world. Whilst some may hope to lessen any short-term shocks to their economies, they’ve all learned about the danger of dealing with a country that can change… — Andy (@andyturner) April 10, 2025 On Apr. 10, it was revealed that the inflation rate in the U.S. dropped. Although Trump reacted to the news of declining inflation positively, he sought the interest rate cut as a remedy to the market’s shakeup. The decision should be made by the Fed, which is an independent agency. Jerome Powell, a chair of this independent agency, showed reluctance to cut the rates. https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1910329551772623311 Powell vs. Trump According to a recent WSJ article, Powell is facing a no-win situation in which he cannot make a perfect decision whether to cut the rates or not. Either way will cause harm to the economy. Rate cuts will unleash inflation while keeping the rates as they are ignoring the slowing down economy and letting the labor market fall, which in turn will cause inflation to surge anyway. Huh? Powell said on Friday that the Fed won't cut until the economic results of the tariffs are reflected in the data. You can't possibly say that today's data includes tariff pressure. The tariff wars just started last week. Moreover, @APompliano is arguing that the data lags… — David D. Tawil (@DavidDTawil) April 10, 2025 Yet, Powell sees no reason to cut the rates and sticks to holding down inflation and tamping down the risks for the economy. On Apr. 4, he said that central banks should first assess the high-paced trade policy changes unleashed by Trump. Seemingly, Donald Trump is not impressed with this contrariness, so he allegedly seeks to oust Powell through the Supreme Court. According to the Bloomberg report, Trump petitioned the Supreme Court to fire high-profile officials from two independent agencies. This could be a potential attack on Powell, who recently admitted that he would not resign until the end of his term. If the Supreme Court dismantles the 1935 precedent set by Humphrey’s Executor vs. the United States case, Powell may end up being fired. The precedent increases the protection of his current position and saves him from firing by executive power. However, the precedent may be seen as conflicting with Article II of the Constitution, which Trump can use as legal grounds to terminate Powell. Such an approach may be seen as Trump’s stunt to concentrate much power in his hands and decrease decentralization in the government. On the other hand, investors wishing for rate cuts may praise the move if it actually takes place. Would the crypto market benefit from Powell’s resignation? In December 2024, Powell announced a low interest rate cut, reversing the crypto bull run that was in full swing at that time. He was hardly seen as a crypto ally at that time. On other occasions, though, Powell has been supportive; for instance, he critiqued the debanking of the crypto clients by financial institutions. Earlier, the Fed signaled its intention to cut the rates in 2026, which would have paved the way for further Bitcoin adoption in the future. Trump may try to nominate a more pro-crypto Kevin Warsh as Powell’s successor or find someone more submissive, who will cut the rates every time when he wants it. Lower interest rates may trigger inflation, which plays out well for Bitcoin in the short term. However, Trump’s overall crypto-friendly policies are already a bullish factor for Bitcoin, and bothering the Supreme Court to terminate Powell, who has been doing his work pretty well, just to cut the interest rates may not be a good move. Powell’s term ends in May 2026. Let’s just see what happens.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is captivating top analysts and early investors with its real-world lending infrastructure, advanced automation, and radically accessible yield mechanics. Phase 4 of the presale has already launched giving investors optimism. Over $6.5 million has been accumulated and 8100 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 8100 investors put $6.5 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $5 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering a $100,000 giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. While giants like Tron (TRX) and Chainlink (LINK) continue to make their mark, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself to not only challenge but potentially surpass these established players in the DeFi space. With a unique dual-lending system, stablecoin innovation, and a growing community of over 8,100 investors, MUTM is rapidly gaining momentum. Its presale, now at $0.025, offers investors the chance to secure a 140% return before the project launches at $0.06, with analysts predicting potential growth to $5.

According to a recent report by Coinpost, the country’s Financial Services Agency has asked for public feedback regarding a discussion paper titled “Verification of the state of the system related to crypto assets.” The financial watchdog will be collecting opinions on the new cryptocurrency framework introduced through the discussion paper until May 10, 2025. The paper presents a dual-approach to regulating crypto, by dividing crypto assets into two different categories based on how funds are distributed. The first category is called Type 1, which encompasses crypto assets used for business purposes or to generate funding for the parent project. These include altcoins from emerging projects that still need community funding to keep growing. While the other category, Type 2, includes crypto assets that are more decentralized or more established by nature. Type 2 cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), which do not issue tokens to raise funds for business purposes. These tokens are called “non-fundraising or non-business crypto.” Depending on which category the virtual assets fall, they are subject to a different set of crypto regulations, adjusted to suit each type’s characteristics. Japan’s FSA stated that with Type 1 crypto assets, regulators feel a strong need to push for more transparency from projects to disclose information to prospective traders about what the funds would be used for. Read more: Japan’s crypto reform bill headed to National Diet after cabinet approval Therefore, the Type 1 token issuers would need to disclose detailed information about the purpose of their funding, project details and risks associated to investing in the project among others. They will be expected to comply to regulations from the Japanese FSA, which include occasional disclosure obligations. The regulations for Type 1 crypto would come into effect once the project has garnered a large number of general investors. The FSA stated that it will also be considering whether certain Type 1 projects fall under security token regulations. On the other hand, the FSA will not be dealing directly with issuers of Type 1 crypto projects. This is because the financial agency believes it is difficult to identify a specific issuer and impose obligations on them. Thus, they will enforce regulations regarding Type 2 cryptocurrencies on exchange platforms. Under this framework, crypto exchange firms would be required to provide the FSA information on Type 2 crypto’s significant price fluctuations that impact the market. “There is a possibility that correspondence will mainly be done through exchange companies,” stated the FSA in the policy outline. According to CoinPost, the committee plans to take into account regulatory trends in other countries and public feedback before finalizing the crypto regulatory framework. As previously reported by crypto.news, the FSA declared that it would be revising the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The agency aims to submit the changes to parliament as early as 2026. Under the revision, cryptocurrencies will no longer be seen as payment tools, but rather as its own financial product category.

The state Senate recently passed the Bitcoin Mining Rights Bill (HB 2342), signaling a powerful stance in favor of technological advancement and economic diversification. This decisive legislative action is poised to reshape the landscape for Bitcoin mining and other digital asset operations within the state, potentially setting a precedent for other regions to follow. Why is Arizona Championing Crypto Mining? Arizona’s move to protect crypto mining operations stems from a broader understanding of the economic and technological potential of digital assets. By proactively establishing a regulatory framework that fosters innovation rather than hindering it, Arizona is positioning itself as a forward-thinking state ready to embrace the future of finance and technology. The Bitcoin Mining Rights Bill is not just about facilitating Bitcoin mining ; it’s about creating an environment where digital asset technologies can thrive, attracting investment, and generating high-tech jobs. Let’s break down the key aspects of this groundbreaking legislation: Protection from Local Bans: The core of HB 2342 lies in its provision to prevent local municipalities from imposing zoning restrictions or outright bans on individuals and businesses engaged in crypto mining or operating nodes. This ensures a consistent and predictable regulatory environment across the state. Safeguarding Individual Rights: The bill explicitly safeguards the rights of individuals to operate nodes and mine digital assets, recognizing these activities as legitimate and valuable contributions to the digital economy. Promoting Innovation: By removing the threat of localized prohibitive regulations, Arizona is sending a clear message that it welcomes innovation in the digital assets space. This can attract entrepreneurs, developers, and investors to the state. Economic Growth: Crypto mining and related industries can contribute significantly to the state’s economy through job creation, infrastructure development, and increased tax revenue. This bill is a strategic step towards harnessing this economic potential. What are the Benefits of Protecting Bitcoin Mining and Digital Assets? The Arizona Senate’s decision to advance the Bitcoin Mining Rights Bill unlocks a plethora of benefits, not just for the crypto mining industry but for the entire state and potentially the broader digital economy. Benefit Description Economic Diversification Attracting crypto mining and digital assets businesses diversifies Arizona’s economy beyond traditional sectors, making it more resilient and adaptable to future technological shifts. Job Creation The crypto mining industry and its ecosystem create high-paying jobs in technology, engineering, operations, and related fields, boosting employment opportunities for Arizonans. Technological Advancement Fostering Bitcoin mining and digital assets innovation encourages technological advancements in areas like energy efficiency, hardware development, and blockchain technology, positioning Arizona at the forefront of these fields. Increased Investment A favorable regulatory environment for crypto mining attracts significant investment from both domestic and international companies, injecting capital into the state’s economy. Energy Sector Innovation Crypto mining operations can incentivize the development and utilization of renewable energy sources and more efficient energy management solutions, driving innovation in the energy sector. Are There Any Challenges or Concerns? While the Bitcoin Mining Rights Bill is largely seen as a positive step, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and address concerns proactively. Energy Consumption: Crypto mining , particularly Bitcoin mining , can be energy-intensive. It’s crucial to ensure that mining operations are encouraged to adopt sustainable energy practices and explore renewable energy sources to mitigate environmental impact. Community Impact: While the bill prevents local bans, it’s important to consider the potential impact of large-scale crypto mining operations on local communities, including noise levels and infrastructure demands. Responsible mining practices and community engagement are essential. Regulatory Clarity: While HB 2342 provides clarity on local bans, ongoing dialogue and collaboration between state and local authorities, as well as the digital assets industry, are necessary to ensure comprehensive and adaptable regulations as the industry evolves. What’s Next for Arizona and Crypto Mining? With the Bitcoin Mining Rights Bill passing the Senate, it now awaits the governor’s signature to become law. If signed, Arizona will solidify its position as a leader in supporting crypto mining and digital assets . This legislation could inspire other states to adopt similar measures, creating a more unified and supportive regulatory landscape for the digital asset industry across the United States. For the Bitcoin mining and broader digital assets community, this development in Arizona is a significant win. It represents a growing recognition of the legitimacy and potential of these technologies by policymakers. It also underscores the importance of proactive engagement and education to shape favorable regulatory outcomes. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Businesses Here are some actionable insights based on Arizona’s pro- crypto mining stance: Explore Opportunities in Arizona: For crypto mining businesses and individuals, Arizona is becoming an increasingly attractive location to set up operations. The clear regulatory framework and supportive environment can provide a stable foundation for growth. Advocate for Similar Legislation: The success of HB 2342 in Arizona can serve as a model for advocacy efforts in other states. Engage with your local representatives and educate them about the benefits of supporting digital assets and crypto mining .

This helped shift the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from “Extreme Fear” to “Fear.” Despite the rebound, investors continue pulling out of crypto ETFs—Ethereum funds saw $11.2 million in outflows, even though ETH outperformed Bitcoin with an 8.1% gain. The overall crypto market is recovering, but institutional confidence remains shaky. Sentiment Turns Bearish as ETH Underperforms According to recent santiment data , lately, the sentiment around Ethereum has turned increasingly negative. Since December 2021, ETH has dropped over 77% in value against Bitcoin and still trades far below its all-time high in dollars. Many smaller altcoins have outperformed it, leading to frequent comparisons with low-value “shitcoins.” This consistent underperformance has left long-term holders frustrated, and even some institutional investors have started doubting Ethereum’s ability to keep pace with the rapidly changing crypto market. What Went Wrong for Ethereum? The market’s frustration with Ethereum comes down to a few key issues. While its move to faster Layer-2 networks was a smart upgrade, it ended up splitting user activity. On top of that, Ethereum’s upgrades have been slow and complicated, making it hard for regular investors to keep up, especially compared to Bitcoin’s simplicity or Solana’s speed. With unclear regulations and no strong story to tell, Ethereum now feels like it’s stuck in the middle, not leading the way in innovation and not seen as the safest bet either. Behind the Scenes, Ethereum Keeps Building Despite the criticism, Ethereum has continued to grow behind the scenes. It switched to Proof-of-Stake in 2022, cutting energy use and reducing new ETH supply. In 2023, it allowed users to withdraw staked ETH, and more upgrades are coming to make transactions on Layer-2 even cheaper. However, Ethereum still leads in DeFi and on-chain identity and gained more trust from institutions with the launch of Ethereum Futures ETFs. Liquid staking platforms like Lido and cbETH have also helped expand the ecosystem, showing that Ethereum’s foundation remains strong for the long term. Is Ethereum Setting Up for a Comeback? Ethereum is still the 2nd largest crypto, trading around $1,540 well ahead of Tether. While many people are feeling negative about it, that kind of extreme bearish mood often shows a trend reversal could be near. Ethereum might not be making big moves right now, but it’s steadily improving. With all the work being done behind the scenes, it could be one of the most underrated assets as we move into 2025.",News|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 07:40:04

As the crypto community eagerly awaits the XRP lawsuit’s settlement, the lawyer uncovers potential developments that could determine the case’s outcome. According to Fred Rispoli, the XRP lawsuit will reach a significant milestone on April 16, 2025 (Wednesday), the scheduled date for Ripple’s appellate brief. Let’s discuss the attorney’s thoughts on the possible developments and potential settlement of the Ripple case. Ripple SEC Case Update: What To Expect on April 16? In a recent X post, lawyer Fred Rispoli predicted a significant development in the Ripple SEC case, anticipating a crucial turn on April 16, when Ripple is set to file its appellate brief. As per his statement, this potential moment could shed new light on the case and possibly influence its outcome. Notably, the lawyer emphasized that there’s no possibility of an extension for Ripple’s appellate brief, making April 16 a critical deadline. Thus, Ripple is expected to take one of two actions: either file its brief as scheduled or issue a notice indicating a settlement or withdrawal from the appeal. This binary outcome has significant implications for the SEC vs Ripple case. Ripple’s Binary Choice Rispoli’s prediction presents a binary choice for Ripple next Wednesday. These options include Ripple filing its appellate brief with a 10% chance and the case’s settlement or withdrawal notice with a 90% likelihood. This stark contrast highlights the high probability of a resolution, according to the lawyer’s assessment. XRP Lawsuit Settlement Discussions Prevail Though the US SEC has reportedly dropped its appeal following which Ripple withdrew its cross-appeal , the final resolution of the case remains uncertain. This sparks multiple interpretations and widespread anxiety within the community. Previously, Fred Rispoli highlighted that the Ripple SEC case is likely to end within two months. However, a mysterious filing that popped up recently has added further ambiguity to the case’s conclusion.

In an Apr.11 post on the Ethereum Magicians forum, the Ethereum ( ETH ) co-founder explained how wallets and developers could take small but meaningful steps to protect users without waiting for long-term upgrades to the core protocol. Buterin’s post stresses the need to integrate privacy tools, like Railgun and privacy pools , directly into existing wallets. Instead of building separate apps, the goal is to make privacy a natural part of how users send and receive funds. Wallets could include shielded balances and allow users to send transactions privately by default. To support this, the roadmap includes a call to adopt FOCIL and EIP-7701, two technical upgrades that make it easier to run privacy protocols like Tornado Cash and Railgun without needing centralized relayers. Another part of the plan builds on privacy at the UX level, encouraging users to use a separate wallet address for each app they interact with. This would make it harder for outside observers to link someone’s actions across different platforms. You might also like: Ethereum price rally stalls as economist maintains recession odds at 60% The proposal also touches on improving privacy when apps connect to the Ethereum network. For now, trusted execution environments could help protect user data. But in the future, Buterin suggests switching to private information retrieval, a more secure solution that’s not yet efficient enough for use. Buterin’s proposal doesn’t require changes to Ethereum’s base layer, making it easier to adopt. However, some of these changes would come with trade-offs in user experience and convenience, which may slow adoption. This proposal comes at a time when Ethereum’s market performance is under pressure. As of Apr. 11, Ethereum is trading at around $1,547, a 20% decline in the past two weeks, as per crypto.news price tracker . The cryptocurrency closed Q1 45% down. In addition, it has lost 77% against Bitcoin since December 2021, according to Santiment data. 📊 Ethereum has been the source of humor for many top cap crypto traders, with the $ETH / $BTC ratio now down a massive -77% since December, 2021. But should its long-term slump make it an automatic write-off by now? Absolutely not. Read our deep dive. 👇 https://t.co/JoK5GnI7Dm — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 11, 2025 One Santiment analyst noted that new updates are making it harder for average investors to understand the project’s roadmap. While many altcoins have outperformed it, Ethereum’s growth has slowed, partly due to constant changes and unclear messaging. The analyst also pointed out the growing competition from newer, simpler blockchains as among the reasons for Ethereum’s falling price.

43203978,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148611,1744357557,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming DOJ Decision: Senators Blast Shutdown of Key Cryptocurrency Enforcement Unit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/senators-slam-doj-crypto-enforcement/,"In a startling turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, a group of U.S. Senators, spearheaded by prominent crypto critic Elizabeth Warren, have voiced strong disapproval of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) recent decision to dismantle its specialized crypto enforcement team. Is this move a calculated risk or a dangerous gamble that could embolden illicit activities in the digital currency space? Let’s delve into the heart of this controversy and understand what it means for the future of cryptocurrency enforcement . Why are Senators Furious About Crypto Regulation and Enforcement? Six U.S. Senate Democrats have penned a sharply worded letter to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, expressing deep unease about the DOJ’s choice to shut down the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), as reported by CoinDesk. Their primary argument is that by dissolving this dedicated unit, the DOJ is inadvertently signaling a lax approach to crypto regulation , potentially handing a “free pass” to those who seek to exploit digital currencies for illegal purposes, particularly crypto money laundering . Here’s a breakdown of the senators’ key concerns: Weakened Federal Oversight: The senators believe that disbanding the NCET will significantly diminish the federal government’s ability to effectively monitor and regulate the complex and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Increased Risk of Illicit Activities: They warn that this decision could make it considerably easier for criminals involved in serious offenses like drug trafficking, terrorism financing, and fraud to exploit loopholes within the crypto ecosystem. Erosion of Trust: Such a move, according to the senators, could erode public trust in the cryptocurrency sector and potentially hinder its responsible growth and adoption. The letter underscores a palpable fear that dismantling a specialized unit dedicated to cryptocurrency enforcement is a step backward in the fight against financial crime in the digital age. The DOJ’s Stance: A Shift in Crypto Regulation Strategy? The DOJ’s decision to disband the NCET comes with a concurrent announcement that it will no longer pursue legal action against developers of crypto regulation tools like mixers and wallets when these tools are incidentally used for illicit activities. This policy shift suggests a potential change in the DOJ’s strategic approach to crypto regulation and enforcement. But what are the implications of this change? Here’s what we know about the DOJ’s evolving perspective: Focus on Intent: The DOJ seems to be moving towards a framework that emphasizes the intent behind the use of crypto tools. Instead of automatically penalizing developers for misuse, the focus might shift to targeting individuals who intentionally use these tools for criminal activities. Resource Reallocation?: It’s possible that the DOJ is reallocating resources from a centralized unit to a more distributed model, embedding crypto expertise within various existing law enforcement agencies. However, this is speculative and has not been explicitly stated. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: This decision could also reflect an attempt to strike a balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and implementing necessary regulations. Overly strict enforcement against tool developers could stifle technological advancements. However, critics argue that this shift could be misinterpreted as leniency, potentially emboldening bad actors who seek to exploit the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities like crypto money laundering . Elizabeth Warren’s Crypto Criticism: A Consistent Voice Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent signatory of the letter, has long been a vocal critic of the cryptocurrency industry. Her involvement in this initiative is hardly surprising, given her consistent stance on the need for stricter crypto regulation and oversight. Elizabeth Warren crypto positions have often been characterized by a cautious, and at times, skeptical view of digital currencies. Warren’s concerns regarding crypto often revolve around: Consumer Protection: She has repeatedly raised concerns about the risks that cryptocurrencies pose to retail investors, particularly regarding volatility and lack of investor safeguards. Financial Stability: Warren has expressed worries about the potential impact of cryptocurrencies on the broader financial system, especially in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins. Illicit Finance: Combating crypto money laundering and the use of crypto for illegal activities has been a consistent theme in her criticisms. Her participation in this letter further solidifies her position as a leading voice advocating for robust crypto regulation and stringent enforcement measures within the U.S. Senate. The Looming Threat of Crypto Money Laundering: Is it About to Get Worse? The senators’ letter paints a concerning picture of a potential surge in crypto money laundering if the DOJ’s decision is not reconsidered. Their argument is rooted in the understanding that the NCET played a crucial role in deterring and investigating crypto-related financial crimes. Disbanding it, they contend, sends the wrong message. Why is crypto money laundering such a significant concern? Anonymity and Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies, by their nature, can offer a degree of anonymity and operate outside traditional financial systems, making them attractive for money laundering activities. Cross-Border Transactions: The ease and speed of cross-border crypto transactions can complicate efforts to track and intercept illicit funds. Growing Crypto Adoption: As cryptocurrency adoption increases, so does the potential scale of illicit activities that can be conducted using these digital assets. The senators fear that without a dedicated unit like the NCET, the DOJ will be less effective in combating crypto money laundering , potentially leading to a rise in financial crimes and undermining the integrity of the financial system. Navigating the Future of Cryptocurrency Enforcement: What’s the Way Forward? The debate surrounding the DOJ’s decision highlights the ongoing challenges in effectively regulating and enforcing laws within the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. Finding the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks is a complex task. Moving forward, several questions remain unanswered: Will the DOJ reconsider its decision? The senators’ letter puts significant pressure on the DOJ to justify its actions and potentially reverse course. What alternative strategies will the DOJ employ? If the NCET is indeed disbanded, what new mechanisms will be put in place to ensure effective cryptocurrency enforcement ? How will this impact the crypto industry? The DOJ’s decision and the ensuing debate could significantly influence the regulatory landscape and the future trajectory of the cryptocurrency industry in the United States. The coming months will be crucial in observing how this situation unfolds and what steps the DOJ and lawmakers take to address the concerns raised about cryptocurrency enforcement and crypto regulation . Conclusion: A Crossroads for Crypto Enforcement? The U.S. Senators’ forceful criticism of the DOJ’s decision to disband its crypto enforcement team underscores a critical juncture for cryptocurrency enforcement in the nation. The move has ignited a fierce debate about the best approach to regulate and oversee the burgeoning digital asset space. While the DOJ’s intentions remain somewhat opaque, the senators’ alarm bells are ringing loud and clear: weakening specialized crypto enforcement could have serious repercussions, potentially paving the way for increased illicit activities and undermining the responsible development of the crypto industry. The future of crypto regulation hangs in the balance, and the world is watching to see how this pivotal moment will reshape the landscape of digital finance.

The financial world is buzzing with excitement as the spot gold price has just shattered records, soaring past the $3,200 per ounce mark for the very first time. According to Goldprice.org , the precious metal is currently trading at a staggering $3,207.91. This monumental leap has investors and economists alike scrambling to understand the forces driving this golden surge. Are you wondering what’s behind this incredible rally and what it means for your investments? Let’s delve into the heart of this golden phenomenon. Unprecedented Surge in Spot Gold Price: A New Era? The news is official: spot gold price has reached uncharted territory. Hitting $3,207.91 is not just a minor fluctuation; it’s a significant milestone that signals potentially transformative shifts in the global economy and investor sentiment. This dramatic increase begs the question: Is this a temporary spike, or are we witnessing the dawn of a new era for gold? Let’s break down what this historic moment means: Record High: For the first time in history, the spot price of gold has exceeded $3,200 per ounce. This is a purely symbolic but psychologically important barrier that has now been decisively broken. Market Reaction: The immediate market reaction has been one of heightened interest and speculation. Investors are keenly watching to see if this rally has staying power and what factors are contributing to it. Economic Implications: A rising gold price often reflects broader economic anxieties. It can be an indicator of inflation concerns, geopolitical instability, or a lack of confidence in traditional financial assets. Decoding the Golden Rally: What’s Fueling the Price Surge? Several factors are likely contributing to this remarkable ascent of the gold price . Understanding these drivers is crucial for investors trying to navigate the current market landscape. Here are some key elements at play: Inflationary Pressures: Globally, inflation remains a persistent concern. As the cost of goods and services rises, investors often turn to gold as an inflation hedge . Gold has historically maintained its value during periods of inflation, making it an attractive store of wealth when fiat currencies are losing purchasing power. Geopolitical Uncertainty: The world stage is fraught with geopolitical tensions, from ongoing conflicts to trade disputes. Such uncertainty tends to drive investors towards safe haven assets like gold. When geopolitical risks escalate, gold’s appeal as a stable and reliable investment increases significantly. Dollar Weakness: The strength of the US dollar often has an inverse relationship with the gold price . If the dollar weakens, gold, which is priced in dollars, becomes cheaper for investors holding other currencies, potentially increasing demand and pushing prices higher. Central Bank Buying: Central banks around the world have been increasing their gold reserves. This buying activity adds to the overall demand for gold and can contribute to price appreciation. Some central banks view gold as a strategic asset to diversify their holdings and reduce reliance on any single currency. Increased Investor Demand: Beyond central banks, individual and institutional investors are also flocking to gold. Concerns about economic slowdown, stock market volatility, and bond yields are prompting investors to seek the perceived safety and stability of gold investment . Gold Investment: Is it Really a Safe Haven in 2024? The term “safe haven asset” is frequently associated with gold, especially during times of economic turmoil. But does gold investment truly live up to this reputation in today’s complex financial world? Let’s examine the role of gold as a safe haven: Aspect Gold as a Safe Haven Considerations Historical Performance Historically, gold has performed well during economic downturns and periods of high inflation. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Market dynamics can change. Store of Value Gold is considered a store of value, maintaining its purchasing power over long periods. Gold doesn’t generate income like stocks or bonds. Its returns are primarily based on price appreciation. Diversification Benefit Gold often has a low or negative correlation with other asset classes like stocks and bonds, providing diversification benefits to a portfolio. Correlation can fluctuate, and during extreme market events, correlations can converge. Inflation Hedge Gold is widely regarded as an effective inflation hedge , preserving wealth when inflation erodes the value of fiat currencies. The effectiveness of gold as an inflation hedge can vary depending on the type and duration of inflation. While gold has strong safe haven characteristics, it’s important to remember that no investment is entirely risk-free. The gold price can be volatile in the short term, and its performance is influenced by a multitude of factors. However, in the context of long-term wealth preservation and portfolio diversification, gold continues to hold a significant place for many investors. Navigating Gold Investment Opportunities: How to Get Involved? If you’re considering capitalizing on the rising gold price and exploring gold investment , you have several avenues to choose from. Each option comes with its own set of advantages and considerations: Physical Gold: This includes gold bars, coins, and jewelry. Investing in physical gold provides tangible ownership and can be a traditional way to hold gold. However, storage, security, and insurance need to be considered. Gold ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): Gold ETFs are investment funds that track the price of gold. They offer a convenient and liquid way to invest in gold without the complexities of physical ownership. Examples include GLD and IAU. Gold Mining Stocks: Investing in companies that mine gold can provide leverage to the gold price . Mining stocks can potentially offer higher returns than physical gold or ETFs, but they also come with company-specific risks and market volatility. Gold Futures and Options: These are derivative instruments that allow investors to speculate on the future price movements of gold. Futures and options are complex instruments and are generally more suitable for experienced traders due to their higher risk and leverage. Gold Mutual Funds: Gold mutual funds are professionally managed funds that invest in a portfolio of gold-related assets, such as gold mining stocks and ETFs. They offer diversification and professional management. Choosing the right gold investment strategy depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. It’s always advisable to conduct thorough research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. Challenges and Considerations in the Golden Market While the allure of rising gold price and its safe haven status is strong, it’s crucial to be aware of the potential challenges and considerations associated with gold investment : Volatility: Despite being considered a safe haven, the gold price can be volatile, especially in the short term. Market sentiment, economic news, and geopolitical events can all trigger price swings. No Yield: Unlike stocks or bonds, gold does not generate any income in the form of dividends or interest. Returns are solely dependent on price appreciation. Storage and Security (Physical Gold): Storing physical gold securely can be challenging and costly. You need to consider secure storage facilities, insurance, and potential transportation costs. Market Manipulation: Like any market, the gold market is not immune to potential manipulation, although regulatory oversight aims to minimize this risk. Opportunity Cost: Investing in gold means allocating capital that could potentially be invested in other asset classes with higher growth potential during certain market cycles. Understanding these challenges is essential for making informed decisions about gold investment . A balanced perspective, considering both the potential benefits and risks, is key to successful gold investing. Conclusion: Riding the Golden Wave or Watching from the Shore? The surge of the spot gold price to over $3,200 is a watershed moment, reflecting a confluence of economic anxieties, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical uncertainties. Gold’s enduring appeal as a safe haven asset and inflation hedge is once again in the spotlight. Whether this rally is a fleeting spike or the beginning of a sustained uptrend remains to be seen. However, the underlying factors driving demand for gold – inflation, uncertainty, and the search for stability – are likely to persist in the foreseeable future. For investors, this record-breaking gold price presents both opportunities and questions. Is now the right time to increase your gold investment ? Should you diversify your portfolio with gold to mitigate risks? The answers depend on your individual circumstances and investment strategy. However, one thing is clear: gold has once again proven its relevance in the global financial landscape, captivating investors and reminding us of its timeless value as a precious metal and a store of wealth.

Since reaching its all-time high of $109,000 in January, bitcoin (BTC) has declined approximately 26%. When compared to the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, bitcoin’s drawdown sits right in the middle, signaling its growing maturity as an asset. Tesla (TSLA) is currently the worst performer, down nearly 50% from its peak. NVIDIA (NVDA) follows with a 31% drop. Apple (AAPL), Bitcoin, Meta (META), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have all declined around 26%, while Microsoft (MSFT) stands out with a relatively modest 18% drawdown. To highlight bitcoin’s resilience in this current 3-month correction, is to compare it to a similar period during its 2021 downturn—from November 2021 to February 2022—when it plummeted 45% from $69,000 to $38,000. At that time, bitcoin was the worst performer among major tech names, though Tesla also suffered significantly.

Recent data reveals a noteworthy trend that has investors and analysts on high alert: Bitcoin ETF outflows are mounting. For six consecutive days, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced net withdrawals, culminating in a significant $149.66 million outflow on April 10th. This data, spotlighted by crypto analyst Trader T on X, raises critical questions about investor sentiment and the short-term trajectory of Bitcoin. Why are Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Causing Concern? ETF outflows , especially sustained ones, can indicate a shift in investor sentiment. When investors pull money out of Bitcoin ETFs, it suggests a reduced appetite for Bitcoin exposure through these investment vehicles. Let’s break down why these outflows are generating buzz and what they could mean for the broader crypto market: Demand Indicator: ETF flows are often seen as a barometer of institutional and retail demand for Bitcoin. Consistent outflows can signal weakening demand, which can exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Market Sentiment Shift: A prolonged period of cryptocurrency outflows from ETFs might reflect growing uncertainty or bearish sentiment among investors regarding Bitcoin’s near-term performance. Potential Price Impact: While not the sole determinant, significant and continuous BTC ETF outflows can contribute to negative price movements in the Bitcoin market as ETF providers may need to sell off Bitcoin holdings to meet redemption demands. Understanding the Numbers: $149.66M Outflow Breakdown The headline figure of $149.66 million in ETF outflows is substantial, especially when it marks the sixth day in a row. To put this into perspective, consider the following points: Metric Value Total Net Outflow (April 10) $149.66 million Consecutive Days of Outflows 6 Data Source Trader T (via X) This consistent pattern of withdrawals suggests more than just a single day’s fluctuation. It points to a trend that requires closer examination. Are investors reallocating capital, taking profits, or reacting to broader market signals? Spot Bitcoin ETF: What Are They and Why Do Outflows Matter? For those new to the crypto ETF landscape, understanding what a spot Bitcoin ETF is crucial to grasping the significance of these outflows: Direct Bitcoin Exposure: Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin. This direct exposure is what many investors prefer as it closely tracks Bitcoin’s price movements. Accessibility and Regulation: Spot ETFs offer a regulated and accessible way for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin within traditional investment accounts. Impact on Market Liquidity: Due to their holdings of actual Bitcoin, significant inflows and outflows from spot Bitcoin ETF products can directly influence Bitcoin’s market liquidity and price discovery. Therefore, when we observe substantial Bitcoin ETF outflows , it’s not just an isolated financial event; it’s a potential indicator of broader market shifts and investor sentiment towards Bitcoin. Analyzing Potential Reasons Behind the Cryptocurrency Outflows Several factors could be contributing to the recent cryptocurrency outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. While pinpointing the exact cause is challenging, here are some plausible explanations: Profit Taking: After a period of price appreciation in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, some investors may be taking profits, leading to ETF redemptions. Market Correction Anticipation: Concerns about a potential market correction could be prompting investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like Bitcoin, resulting in ETF outflows . Macroeconomic Factors: Changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate expectations or inflation concerns, can influence investor appetite for different asset classes, including Bitcoin. Alternative Investment Opportunities: Investors might be reallocating funds to other asset classes perceived as more attractive in the current market environment. Specific ETF Dynamics: It’s also possible that outflows are concentrated in specific ETFs due to fund-specific factors rather than a broad market trend. However, a six-day consecutive outflow across multiple ETFs suggests a more widespread sentiment shift. Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Outflow Landscape: What’s Next? For investors and market participants, monitoring Bitcoin ETF outflows remains crucial. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Track Daily Flows: Keep an eye on daily ETF flow data to identify whether the outflow trend continues or reverses. Analyze Market Context: Consider these outflows in the context of broader market movements, Bitcoin price action, and macroeconomic news. Assess Investor Sentiment: Look for other indicators of investor sentiment, such as on-chain metrics, futures market data, and social media sentiment, to get a comprehensive picture. Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts for expert opinions and deeper insights into market dynamics. Conclusion: Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Signal The $149.66 million Bitcoin ETF outflow , marking the sixth consecutive day of withdrawals, is a significant data point that warrants attention. While it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on short-term trends, these ETF outflows serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the ever-shifting sentiments of investors. By staying informed, analyzing data in context, and understanding the underlying factors at play, you can navigate the complexities of the crypto market with greater clarity and make more informed decisions. The trend of spot Bitcoin ETF movements will undoubtedly continue to be a key indicator for the health and direction of the Bitcoin market in the days and weeks to come.

Major Bitcoin wallets sprang into action, triggering movement not seen in years. The numbers paint a picture of quiet accumulation following market turbulence. Strategic Buying On April 9, accumulation addresses received a whopping 48,575 BTC. This was the largest single-day inflow since February 1, 2022, according to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant. The move, which is worth approximately $3.6 billion, coincided with a sharp market dip triggered by escalating trade tensions following US President Donald Trump’s renewed tariff policies against China. Notably, a similar $3.6 billion BTC inflow occurred on February 1, 2022, when Bitcoin was priced near $38,400 – compared to the current $80,000. Historically, accumulation addresses have shown a pattern of strategic buying during macroeconomic stress, often scooping up large volumes during dips. This recent influx highlighted renewed institutional or long-term holder confidence, as these wallets had previously seen only modest and steady increases. The near-identical USD values of these two massive inflows, spaced three years apart, suggest a recurring accumulation behavior during critical market moments – a development experts say is worth watching closely. Santiment also observed a similar motion. Following the announcement of a 90-day pause on new tariffs, on-chain data revealed a sudden uptick in Bitcoin accumulation by large holders on the same day. In fact, the number of wallets holding 10 or more BTC has grown by 132 in just 24 hours – a notable spike that suggests rising confidence among crypto’s key stakeholders. These “whale” and “shark” wallets are often seen as strategic investors, and their activity is closely monitored for signs of market sentiment. The timing of this growth, immediately after the tariff pause, indicates that macro-political relief may be fueling renewed optimism in digital assets. Experts Take on Bitcoin’s Trajectory With this accumulation trend in mind, industry leaders are doubling down on their optimistic Bitcoin predictions. This week, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said that he is bullish on Bitcoin and even predicted a potential surge to $250,000 by the end of this year or next. His outlook is based on several factors like increasing global crypto adoption, growing institutional interest, as well as regulatory reforms. Hoskinson also highlighted geopolitical instability and expected lower interest rates as major catalysts for Bitcoin’s rise. While he anticipates a temporary slowdown in the coming months, he predicts a strong rebound beginning around August or September, which could set the stage for a meaningful rally fueled by improved investor sentiment and macroeconomic shifts. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan also said that Bitcoin is poised to “return to new all-time highs and beyond” once the market volatility stabilizes.

Notably, ETH has declined by more than 21% over the past two weeks. Ethereum About To See Trend Reversal? Ethereum may soon witness a relief rally, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap nears a key demand zone that has historically marked market bottoms and offered strong buying opportunities. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Repeating Its 2020 Trend Reversal? Analyst Predicts ETH To ‘Explode’ In Q2 2025 Sharing his analysis, Martinez posted the following chart, illustrating how ETH is likely approaching the -1 standard deviation pricing band based on Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands. According to the chart, the -1 standard deviation pricing band lies around $1,387, while ETH’s realized price hovers around $2,005. The last time ETH touched this band – back in July 2022 – it marked a local market bottom. For the uninitiated, MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands are on-chain metrics that help identify potential market tops or bottoms by measuring how far ETH’s current market value deviates from its realized value. These bands highlight historically significant overvalued or undervalued zones, often aligning with periods of extreme investor sentiment or price reversals. As ETH nears the -1 standard deviation pricing band, it suggests the asset may be significantly undervalued at its current price. Fellow crypto analyst TraderPA appears to support Martinez’s view. In an X post, TraderPA shared a weekly Ethereum chart showing that ETH’s price decline aligns with a low Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) value – indicating the cryptocurrency may be oversold following the recent sell-off. The Stochastic RSI is a momentum indicator that applies the stochastic oscillator formula to RSI values rather than price, making it more sensitive and responsive to short-term movements. Unlike the standard RSI – which ranges from 0 to 100 – the Stochastic RSI ranges between 0 and 1, helping traders identify overbought or oversold conditions. Whales Losing Confidence In ETH While Martinez and TraderPA’s analyses suggest ETH may be undervalued, recent whale activity points to a possible loss of confidence. A previously dormant ETH whale dumped 10,702 ETH after nearly two years of inactivity, signaling weakening conviction among large investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Sentiment Dips Among Retail Investors, Yet A Breakout Looms Interestingly, the whale had originally received ETH back in 2016, when it was valued at just $8. Despite holding through the 2021 peak near $4,000, the recent price drop seems to have triggered a significant sell-off. Additionally, Martinez’s latest analysis suggests that ETH could drop to $1,200, as the asset continues to break below multiple key support levels. At press time, ETH trades at $1,553, up 5.5% in the past 24 hours.

The SEC is urging crypto companies to be more transparent especially those involved with tokens that could be considered as securities. ‘Material Aspects’ to Be Disclosed The SEC requires companies to clearly explain the material aspects of their business. The statement was released ahead of its upcoming roundtable on crypto trading. The agency has emphasized that firms need to clearly explain their business models and provide detailed disclosures . Although this is not legally enforceable, but it’s part of a broader effort to clarify how US securities law applies to crypto assets. The recommendations here are based on past filings, however it has not clarified which tokens count as securities or when clearer rules will be announced. The statement remarked that “These offerings and registrations may involve equity or debt securities of issuers whose operations relate to networks, applications, and/or crypto assets. These offerings and registrations also may relate to crypto assets offered as part of or subject to an investment contract (such a crypto asset, a ‘subject crypto asset’),” the statement said. The SEC’s guidance is intended to provide clarity on how these requirements apply to equity and debt securities associated with crypto assets. Risk Factors It also requires to specify the risk factors relating to issuers business operations and disclosures over its security, volatility, liquidity, and supply. Technical details over crypto assets divisibility and whether it uses smart contract are also included. The SEC has reviewed past disclosures of crypto companies which often includes information like whether they are building a blockchain network, their progress, the network usage details and the technology behind it. The companies have also disclosed token holder rights and how the tokens function. The agency also made it clear that its corporate finance division is just sharing its views ahead of the new crypto task force round table. The statement is not formal guidance or rulemaking which has no legal effect. Commisioner Hester Pierce Supports The SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce shared in an X post that the SEC is not classifying the crypto assets as securities right now as they are still working on it. But if they are considered as securities or the business operates in crypto, the SEC is offering guidance on disclosure requirements to comply with federal securities laws.

Recently, a fascinating transaction caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike. As Ethereum (ETH) experienced another dip in its price, a brand-new crypto wallet emerged, not to panic sell, but to strategically accumulate Ethereum . This wasn’t just any purchase; it was a calculated maneuver involving crypto lending to acquire a substantial $14.54 million worth of ETH. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing play and understand the implications for the broader crypto market. Decoding the Smart DeFi Strategy : Borrowing to Buy the Dip According to on-chain analytics firm Spot On Chain, approximately seven hours prior to their report, a newly created crypto wallet executed a series of transactions that demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of decentralized finance (DeFi) and market dynamics. Here’s a breakdown of their strategic approach: Kraken Withdrawal: The wallet initiated its operation by withdrawing a significant 5,000 ETH from the popular cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken. This withdrawal itself signals an intention to move these assets off-exchange, often for DeFi activities or longer-term holding. Spark Protocol Collateral: These 5,000 ETH were then strategically deposited into Spark, a well-known crypto lending protocol. By using ETH as collateral, the wallet unlocked the potential to borrow other digital assets. USDS Borrowing: Leveraging the collateralized ETH, the wallet proceeded to borrow 7 million USDS. USDS, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, provided the necessary liquidity for their next move – purchasing more ETH. ETH Acquisition at Market Dip: With the borrowed USDS in hand, the wallet executed a purchase of 4,610 ETH at an approximate price of $1,518 per ETH. This is the crux of the strategy: buying ETH when the price is down, capitalizing on the ETH market dip . This series of actions reveals a calculated bet on Ethereum’s future. By borrowing against existing ETH holdings to acquire even more ETH during a price dip, the wallet effectively amplified its position in anticipation of a potential price rebound. This is a classic example of a leveraged long position in the crypto market. Why This Ethereum Wallet Activity Matters The activity of this new wallet is more than just an isolated transaction; it offers valuable insights into current market sentiment and emerging DeFi strategies . Here’s why this ETH accumulation is noteworthy: Confidence in ETH: Such a significant investment, especially using borrowed funds, suggests strong confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. The wallet is essentially betting that ETH’s price will recover and likely surpass the purchase price, making the leveraged position profitable. Strategic Market Timing: Buying during a dip is a fundamental investment principle. This wallet’s actions underscore the importance of identifying and capitalizing on market downturns. It highlights a proactive approach rather than reactive selling during periods of price decline. DeFi Lending in Action: This transaction showcases the practical application of crypto lending protocols like Spark. DeFi platforms enable users to leverage their existing crypto assets to access liquidity and engage in further investment opportunities without selling their initial holdings. Market Signal: Large transactions like these can sometimes act as a signal to the broader market. While not always predictive, they can indicate where smart money is flowing and potentially influence market sentiment. Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Crypto Lending for Investment While the wallet’s strategy appears astute, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with crypto lending and leveraged positions. Here’s a balanced perspective: Benefits of Crypto Lending for Investment Challenges and Risks Amplified Returns: Leverage can magnify profits if the asset price moves in the anticipated direction. In this case, if ETH’s price rises significantly, the returns on the accumulated ETH will be amplified due to the borrowed capital. Amplified Losses: Conversely, leverage also magnifies losses. If ETH’s price continues to decline, the wallet would not only see the value of its holdings decrease but also face the obligation to repay the borrowed USDS, potentially leading to liquidation if collateral value drops too low. Capital Efficiency: Investors can utilize existing crypto holdings to access additional capital without selling their assets, maintaining exposure to potential future price appreciation. Interest Rate Risk: Borrowing involves interest payments. Fluctuating interest rates on lending platforms can impact the profitability of the leveraged position. Strategic Flexibility: DeFi lending provides tools for sophisticated investment strategies, allowing users to react to market opportunities dynamically, as seen in this ETH accumulation example during a dip. Smart Contract Risk: DeFi protocols, while innovative, are still relatively new and carry smart contract risks. Bugs or vulnerabilities in the protocol could lead to loss of funds. Potential for Passive Income: Beyond borrowing, crypto lending also offers opportunities to earn passive income by lending out crypto assets. Liquidation Risk: If the value of the collateral (ETH in this case) decreases significantly, the lending protocol may automatically liquidate the collateral to cover the borrowed amount, resulting in forced selling at potentially unfavorable prices. Actionable Insights: Learning from the Smart Wallet’s Move During the ETH Market Dip What can the average crypto investor learn from this strategic maneuver? Educate Yourself on DeFi: Understanding DeFi protocols like Spark and crypto lending mechanisms can open up new avenues for managing and growing your crypto portfolio. However, always prioritize thorough research and understand the risks involved. Strategic Dip Buying: Consider adopting a strategy of accumulating your preferred cryptocurrencies during market dips. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into assets you believe in can be a less risky approach to capitalize on price volatility. Risk Management is Key: If considering leveraged positions, thoroughly assess your risk tolerance and understand the potential for both gains and losses. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially when using leverage. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends and on-chain data. Following analysts and platforms like Spot On Chain can provide valuable insights into market activities and potential opportunities. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Strategic Crypto Investing The recent activity of this new wallet, strategically borrowing to accumulate a significant amount of Ethereum during a market dip, serves as a compelling case study in modern crypto investing. It highlights the potential of DeFi tools and the importance of strategic thinking in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While such leveraged strategies are not without risk, they exemplify the innovative approaches investors are taking to maximize opportunities in the digital asset space. This bold move underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the ever-evolving strategies employed by its participants. As the crypto landscape matures, expect to see more sophisticated financial maneuvers like this, shaping the future of finance.

With Solana currently ranking as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, any sudden rise in available tokens could impact its price movement. SOL Price Holds Strong at Key Support After FTX unstaked a large amount of Solana (SOL), many investors started selling in fear. However, the price of SOL is still holding steady around $116 , showing a 1% increase, with a total market value of $60 billion. Looking at the charts, Solana has been moving in a downward trend since March 2025. But there is a strong support level at $110, which could help the price bounce back. If buyers step in, SOL could first rise to $127 this week. If it stays strong, it might even reach $145 soon. On the other hand, if selling pressure increases, SOL could drop back to $110.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 08:05:51
43204515,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148703,1744358763,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,From $60 to $190: Unveiling Solana’s Price Surge and Future Outlook,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/from-60-to-190-unveiling-solanas-price-surge-and-future-outlook/,"Solana utilizes a unique consensus mechanism, a single-chain Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) protocol combined with Proof of History (PoH) technology that enables it to achieve scalability far beyond most of its competitors. The Solana network can currently process up to 65,000 transactions per second, with average transaction fees as low as $0.00025. This exceptional performance makes Solana an ideal foundation for decentralized applications (dApps), NFT marketplaces, and DeFi platforms. Solana is also known for its openness and developer-friendly environment, with a rapidly growing ecosystem. From blockchain-based games and decentralized exchanges to on-chain social platforms, Solana is steadily building out a comprehensive Web3 world. Solana Price Analysis: Market Trends and Performance As of April 2025, according to Gate.io, Solana price has stabilized between $170 and $195 after a strong rally at the end of 2024. Over the past year, the price of SOL surged from around $60 to its current level, marking a growth of more than 200%, making it one of the best-performing mainstream tokens. Several factors have contributed to this rise in SOL’s price: Institutional Capital Inflows : Multiple Solana ecosystem projects have secured funding—such as the NFT platform Magic Eden and the DeFi protocol Marinade Finance—which has boosted institutional confidence in the Solana network. Expanding Developer Ecosystem : The Solana Foundation has continuously invested in ecosystem development, attracting a growing number of developers and driving the proliferation of dApps. Increasing On-Chain Activity : On-chain data shows a consistent increase in the number of active daily wallets on Solana, reflecting higher user engagement and network utilization. However, Solana has not been without its challenges. In 2022 and 2023, the network faced criticism due to multiple outages. Nevertheless, ongoing upgrades and improvements in network stability have significantly addressed these concerns. Solana Price Prediction: Outlook for 2025 and Beyond For investors, Solana’s future price trajectory is a key point of interest. According to multiple market analysis institutions, combined with on-chain data and sentiment analysis, the short- to medium-term outlook for SOL remains optimistic. Gate.io data shows that Solana price prediction $1,000 mark in 2025, a projection that reflects the market’s confidence in Solana’s sustained growth. However, actual price movements are subject to numerous influencing factors. As of April 9, 2025, Solana’s market capitalization stands at $53.1 billion, representing 2.2151% of the total cryptocurrency market. Despite this, Solana has experienced a 47.23% decline over the past 90 days, underscoring ongoing market volatility. It’s worth noting that in early April, SOL’s price dropped by approximately 4%, mainly due to the unlocking of $200 million worth of tokens and whale sell-offs. These short-term fluctuations serve as a reminder that investors should closely monitor market developments. Some optimistic forecasts suggest that if Solana can maintain network stability and increase its presence in the DeFi and NFT sectors, its price could reach $400–$500 by 2026. However, such predictions remain highly dependent on broader crypto market trends, global macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments. How Should Investors Approach Solana? For investors who believe in the long-term potential of blockchain infrastructure, Solana is undoubtedly a project worth watching. It offers not only cutting-edge technical capabilities but also a growing developer community and an increasingly mature ecosystem. In addition, the Solana Foundation’s continued efforts to improve network stability have significantly enhanced its reliability compared to earlier phases. That said, investors must also be aware of the risks involved, including shifting market sentiment, potential technical vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainties. A prudent approach, such as maintaining appropriate position sizing, setting clear stop-loss and take-profit points, and staying informed about project developments, is essential to making sound investment decisions with Solana. Conclusion Solana, as a high-speed, low-cost, and scalable blockchain platform, is redefining the infrastructure of the Web3 era. With more and more projects selecting Solana as their preferred public blockchain and its price performance trending upward, the SOL token continues to gain the trust of a growing number of investors. Whether you are a developer exploring technical innovation or an investor seeking long-term opportunities, Solana undoubtedly deserves your continued attention.",Crypto News|Press Release|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-11 08:06:03

On April 10, both New Hampshire’s House and Florida’s House Insurance and Banking Committee advanced bills that, if passed into law, would allow state treasuries to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Crypto-Fueled Treasuries New Hampshire’s House narrowly passed its proposal, HB302, in a 192–179 vote. The bill will now move to the state Senate, making New Hampshire the fourth state to get this far in the legislative process—joining Arizona, Texas, and Oklahoma. If it clears the Senate and is signed by Governor Kelly Ayotte, the bill would empower the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of the general fund and other authorized reserves into Bitcoin and precious metals. But the bill doesn’t throw the door open to all cryptocurrencies. Only digital assets with a market cap exceeding $500 billion would be eligible—meaning only Bitcoin currently qualifies. The bill also outlines custody protocols to protect these holdings, a point of contention during House debate. Democratic Representative Terry Spahr questioned the need for the bill, pointing out that the state treasurer already possesses the authority to explore such investments. “Crypto is constantly evolving, and locking us into a fixed security framework may do more harm than good,” he warned. But Republican Representative Jordan Ulery defended the move, arguing that Bitcoin reserves offer “the potential for a large amount of money being earned by the state.” Florida Unanimously Backs Bitcoin Reserve Bill Further south, Florida’s HB487 made its way through the House Insurance and Banking Committee with unanimous support. Like New Hampshire’s bill, it would authorize state financial leaders to invest up to 10% of certain state funds into Bitcoin . The bill’s sponsor, Representative Webster Barnaby, made an impassioned plea before the vote, urging lawmakers to embrace the future: “Let’s put Florida on the leading edge of this very new technology.” The bill still faces two additional committee approvals before it can be voted on by the full House. HB487 also provides the option to invest via qualified custodians or Bitcoin-based exchange-traded products and mandates security standards for storing the digital assets. Arizona remains the frontrunner in the state-level Bitcoin reserve race. Two of its Bitcoin treasury bills—SB1373 and SB1025—cleared the House Rules Committee on March 24 and await a floor vote. All eyes are now on which state will be the first to officially hold Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/interesting-development-in-the-ripple-sec-case-both-sides-made-a-common-request-here-are-the-details/,"In a potential breakthrough moment for the crypto industry, Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have jointly filed a motion to pause their ongoing appeals, signaling that a deal could soon end their years-long legal battle. Ripple and SEC Move Towards Settlement, File Joint Motion to Pause Objections The petition, filed in U.S. District Court on Thursday, requests that the appeals process be put on hold while both sides finalize the terms of a potential deal — a move that could mark the end of one of the most closely watched legal disputes in crypto history. After Years of Legal Tension, a Reconciliation is in Sight The SEC first filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that the payments technology company conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP tokens. Ripple has long disputed the claim, arguing that XRP is a currency, not a security, and therefore falls outside the SEC's jurisdiction. The case has become a key test for crypto regulation in the US and has sparked widespread debate over how digital assets should be classified. According to court documents and a post by attorney James Filan, Ripple and the SEC have reached an “agreement in principle” to resolve all outstanding matters. This includes not only the SEC’s appeal of the district court’s ruling, but also Ripple’s cross-appeal and separate claims against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. The joint petition asks the court to suspend the appeals process — essentially halting any further proceedings — to give the parties time to negotiate the final details of the settlement. The SEC would need formal approval from its commissioners before any settlement could be finalized. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Interesting Development in the Ripple-SEC Case!

The Ethereum Foundation, a key player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, has made another significant move to bolster its community. Recent reports indicate a substantial transfer of 1,000 ETH, valued at approximately $1.53 million, earmarked for grant distributions. This development, spotlighted by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on X (formerly Twitter), underscores the Foundation’s ongoing commitment to nurturing growth and innovation within the Ethereum network. Let’s dive into what this generous ETH grant means for the future of Web3 and the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum Foundation’s Commitment to Web3 Growth The Ethereum Foundation has consistently demonstrated its dedication to the long-term health and expansion of the Ethereum blockchain. Grant programs are a cornerstone of this commitment, acting as vital catalysts for innovation. These grants provide crucial financial support to developers, researchers, and community members working on projects that contribute to the advancement of Ethereum and the broader Web3 space. This latest transfer of 1,000 ETH is not just a monetary transaction; it’s a powerful signal of the Foundation’s unwavering belief in the potential of its ecosystem and its proactive approach to fostering its development. Here’s why these grants are so important: Fueling Innovation: Grants empower developers to pursue groundbreaking ideas and build novel applications on Ethereum, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with blockchain technology.

Fostering a Collaborative Ecosystem: Grant programs encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing within the Web3 community, accelerating the collective progress towards a decentralized future. This recent ETH grant distribution is a testament to the Ethereum Foundation’s long-term strategy of investing in the very foundation of Web3, ensuring its sustainable and impactful growth. Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto Grant Distribution While the benefits of cryptocurrency grants are clear, the process of distributing them effectively also presents certain challenges and opportunities. Ensuring fairness, transparency, and optimal allocation of funds is crucial for maximizing the impact of these grants. Challenges: Due Diligence: Thoroughly vetting grant applicants and their projects to ensure legitimacy and potential for success is a complex task. Impact Measurement: Quantifying the impact of grants and tracking their long-term outcomes can be challenging but essential for evaluating program effectiveness. Decentralization of Grant Decisions: Striving for a decentralized and community-driven grant allocation process to avoid biases and ensure diverse perspectives are considered. Sustainability: Ensuring the long-term sustainability of grant programs and their funding sources in the fluctuating cryptocurrency market. Opportunities: Enhanced Transparency: Leveraging blockchain technology itself to create transparent and auditable grant distribution processes. Community Involvement: Increasing community participation in grant proposal reviews and decision-making through decentralized governance mechanisms.

Stay Updated on Ethereum News and Grant Opportunities Keeping abreast of Ethereum news , particularly developments related to funding and grants, is vital for anyone involved or interested in the Web3 space. Platforms like Lookonchain, along with official Ethereum Foundation channels, are excellent sources for staying informed about these crucial updates. Actionable Insights for Web3 Developers Seeking Funding: Monitor Grant Programs: Regularly check the Ethereum Foundation’s website and other relevant organizations for announcements of new grant opportunities. Network and Engage: Connect with the Ethereum community, attend events, and engage in online forums to learn about potential funding avenues and build relationships. Develop a Strong Proposal: Craft a compelling grant proposal that clearly articulates your project’s goals, methodology, impact, and team expertise. Seek Feedback: Share your proposal with mentors or experienced individuals in the space to get feedback and refine your application. Be Patient and Persistent: The grant application process can be competitive, so be prepared to iterate and persist even if your initial applications are not successful. Conclusion: A Bright Future Fueled by Ethereum Grants The Ethereum Foundation’s latest 1,000 ETH transfer for grant distribution is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful injection of resources into the heart of the Web3 revolution. These cryptocurrency grants are essential for fostering innovation, attracting talent, and building the decentralized future we envision. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and mature, the Foundation’s commitment to supporting its community through these initiatives will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of Web3 for years to come.

Ripple acquired Hidden Road for $1.25B and made progress on the legal front with the SEC. XRP’s price struggles to reclaim $2, while Standard Chartered predicted a massive surge to $12.50 in the next few years. DOGE slid 4% in the past seven days to $0.15. Whales dumped over 1.3 billion tokens earlier this week, which could lead to a further slide. Where’s PI Headed Next? The native token of Pi Network witnessed massive volatility in the past week, with its price ranging between $0.40 and almost $0.75. Currently, it trades just south of $0.60 (per CoinMarketCap’s data), representing an 8% weekly increase. However, the asset remains in a massive downtrend since the all-time high of nearly $3 registered in February. Despite the overall slump, some market observers remain optimistic that PI could chart new solid gains in the near future . Earlier this week, the X user MOON JEFF noted the coin’s resurgence following Donald Trump’s 90-day suspension on most new tariffs, envisioning the formation of a V-shaped curve that might result in a pump above $2.50. On the other hand, the analyst warned about the increased number of PI tokens scheduled for an unlock later this month. As CryptoPotato recently reported , the total number of tokens released throughout the month will be over 160 million. Almost 10 million PI are set to be freed up on April 18 , marking the record day. The substantial unlock this month could lead to a price drop if holders choose to sell their long-awaited assets. PI’s current circulating supply is around 6.86 billion tokens, but more than 5.1 billion are still locked as mining rewards. Recent Ripple Developments On April 8, the company behind XRP announc ed a whopping $1.25 billion deal to acquire the leading brokerage firm Hidden Road. “With the acquisition, Ripple becomes the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. Hidden Road is one of the fastest-growing prime brokers around the world, offering institutions a one-stop-shop of advanced services, including clearing, prime brokerage, and financing across foreign exchange (FX), digital assets, derivatives, swaps, and fixed income,” the company’s official disclosure reads . Ripple has also made progress on the legal front, recently shaking hands with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to hold the appeal and cross-appeal on their lawsuit. The company will not file its appellate brief on April 16 (as previously expected), while many industry participants believe the development is the final step before the official conclusion of the case. XRP experienced little to no volatility on the latest update, and as of this writing, it trades just below the psychological level of $2. The asset has been the subject of numerous bullish forecasts over the past few days , with Standard Chartered projecting a surge to $5.50 this year and $12.50 by the end of 2028 (just before the end of Trump’s presidential term). Meanwhile, Ali Martinez recently estimated that “the XRP network is growing stronger,” with the total number of addresses holding at least one XRP hitting an all-time high of 6.26 million. The growth suggests rising adoption and investor confidence. It also indicates that more individuals or entities are accumulating in anticipation of a potential price rise. How’s DOGE Doing? The biggest meme coin has underperformed in the past week, with its price dipping by 4% to $0.15. The latest actions of large investors signal that a further slump might be on the way. Earlier this week, whales offloaded over 1.3 billion DOGE in 48 hours. Such a selling spree increases the token’s circulating supply and could be followed by a price decline (if demand doesn’t react accordingly). It may trigger panic within the community, prompting smaller investors to sell and add further downward pressure on the valuation.

However, although the number seems big, it appears that the ongoing DOGE price surge is less likely to be sustained ahead. Despite that, some of the recent market trends hint that the meme coin may gain more exposure in the market due to soaring institutional interest. Dogecoin price has mitigated some of its recent losses and traded at $0.157. Notably, it comes as the digital assets space stayed in the red, with the global crypto market losing 0.25% to $2.58 trillion. Ethereum was one of the top laggards among the top 10 coins, losing nearly 3% over the last 24 hours. However, despite the recent gains, DOGE price has lost more than 6% in the weekly chart, while touching a 24-hour high and low of $0.158 and $0.1494. Besides, a total of 6.96 billion tokens were traded in the last 24 hours, totaling $1.09 billion. Despite that, the one-day trading volume was down more than 45%, suggesting a volatile period ahead. Besides, CoinGlass data showed that DOGE Futures Open Interest fell 1% to $1.43 billion, reflecting the still gloomy sentiment hovering in the market. For context, if high prices are not being supported by soaring trading volumes, it signals a concerning trend for the asset. This disparity can be a warning sign that the uptrend is weakening or a reversal is imminent. Having said that, Dogecoin’s current low volume indicates a lack of broad market support, leaving the price vulnerable to a decline. With fewer traders actively buying, the top meme coin may be due for a correction. Recent Trends Suggests Otherwise: Dogecoin (DOGE) Price To Rally? One of the most recent positive developments on the meme coin is the 21Shares filing for DOGE ETF with the US SEC. The asset manager has revealed this significant step towards launching the investment instrument by filing the S-1 form with the US SEC on April 9. Meanwhile, this move makes 21Shares the third company, after Grayscale and Bitwise, to seek approval for a DOGE ETF. The next step involves filing the 19b-4 form, which will officially start the approval process. If approved, the ETF would provide investors with a new way to gain exposure to Dogecoin, potentially increasing its mainstream acceptance and market accessibility. Besides, 21Shares has also planned to launch DOGE ETP in Europe through a partnership with the House of Doge. However, despite these bullish developments, investors should exercise due diligence before entering the market in this volatile scenario. For context, a recent Dogecoin price prediction indicates that the crypto might hover near the $0.1499 mark through April. Having said that, it appears that the crypto might hover near the flatline in the coming days unless any major catalyst boosts the market sentiment further.

In a recent Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Hoskinson disclosed that the airdrop would be distributed among 37 million users across various blockchain networks. Let’s discuss the key details around the airdrop, NIGHT token, and its potential price at launch. Midnight Airdrop Listing Details: Launch Date, Eligibility & More to Know Midnight Network is a privacy-focused blockchain developed by the same team that worked on Cardano. Interestingly, the project is working on providing a way to handle users’ information securely, whether it’s sensitive, personal, or commercial. More importantly, to do this while maintaining regulatory compliance. Interestingly, they are launching their own crypto with one of the biggest crypto airdrops in 2025. “Midnight is the single best economic event for the Cardano ecosystem in its history. It’s is going to airdrop to more than 100 million people and build bridges with all the blockchain networks,” said Cardano founder in an old X post. The official announcement reveals that Midnight users are automatically eligible for the airdrop. More importantly, the Cardano founder has disclosed that the BTC, ETH, ADA, XRP, SOL, and other top crypto token holders are also eligible for 37M airdrop. However, the listing date, airdrop allocation, and other crucial details are not publicly available. Interestingly, the blockchain project will be launching two crypto tokens. The first one is NIGHT, which is the native or governance token of the Midnight ecosystem and has limited supply. Interestingly, investors anticipate a bullish price performance of NIGHT with Cardano’s connection. The second is DUST, a non-transferrable token. DUST will be used within the privacy layer for shielded transactions What Will be the NIGHT Token Price at Launch? The key details around the Midnight token launch and airdrop remain missing, including the NIGHT token price. As it is the primary token, investors anticipate a bullish beginning. However, without the circulating supply, tokenomics, and other details, it is hard to conclude the potential launch price. Investors must await further details on the launch to determine a price.

Conor McGregor’s staking-enabled memecoin explained Conor McGregor, also known as “Notorious,” is an Irish mixed martial artist born in Dublin on July 14, 1988. He is renowned for his achievements in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he became the first fighter to simultaneously hold titles in two weight classes — featherweight and lightweight. Beyond his fighting career, McGregor ventured into entrepreneurship, in 2018 launching his whiskey brand, Proper No. Twelve, named after his Dublin roots. He leveraged his UFC fame to market the triple-distilled blend. In 2021, McGregor sold a majority stake to Proximo Spirits for an estimated $600 million, while retaining a significant role. In April 2025, McGregor ventured into the crypto market by introducing a memecoin named “REAL.” Promising to change the crypto world, the digital token was launched through a sealed-bid auction to prevent interference from bots and snipers. Developed in collaboration with the Real World Gaming (RWG) decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) , the REAL memecoin offers holders staking rewards and voting rights within its ecosystem. What happened during REAL memecoin fundraising? With the REAL memecoin, McGregor aimed to make a big impact in the crypto world. However, things didn’t go as planned. McGregor partnered with RWG, a decentralized autonomous organization, to raise funds for the project with a minimum goal of $1,008,000. But during the 28-hour presale, the DAO collected $392,315 in USDC ( USDC ) from 668 contributors, only 39% of its target. RWG acknowledged that the auction failed to hit the minimum raise, stating that they would fully refund all the bids. McGregor himself endorsed the announcement. For the fundraising, the REAL token was sold through a sealed-bid auction on Axis Finance. Users privately submitted bids specifying the quantity and price they desired, and tokens were allocated to the highest bidders at a single clearing price. After deliberating where they went wrong, RWG is now looking to relaunch the fundraising . The team hasn’t yet provided a date for the relaunch. McGregor has remained outspoken, characteristically announcing or endorsing project updates with his signature line, “Ladies and gentlemen, this is REAL!” The team plans to reshape the token’s purpose and possibly modify its fundraising approach for a more successful relaunch. Did you know? Memecoins often rise in value due to community hype and viral trends, not technical innovation. While they lack strong fundamentals, social media buzz and celebrity endorsements can drive massive short-term gains, making them popular among high-risk, high-reward investors. Reasons for REAL memecoin’s fundraising failure RWG’s attempt to launch the REAL memecoin faced multiple challenges, leading to the DAO’s failure to meet fundraising goals. Several factors contributed to this outcome: Market timing: The launch coincided with a downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Major cryptocurrencies, including Ether ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ), faced sharp declines. Only Bitcoin ( BTC ) was an exception, as investors viewed it as a value holder . Memecoins faced almost a 60% decline after Dec. 24, except GHIBLI. Such a gloomy environment wasn’t conducive for the launch of yet another memecoin. Economic conditions: The world economy is going through a phase of reconstruction due to the Trump administration's reorganization of tariffs . This resulted in a US stock crash of about $5 trillion, more than the total market cap in crypto. (Though the crash happened after the fundraising failure, the story was in the making). The tariffs led to uncertainty in the world economic system, which also impacted the crypto market. Recession fears and substantial losses in US equities made investors more cautious. Scams surrounding memecoins: In 2024, over $500 million was lost to memecoin rug pulls and scams, as reported by Merkle Science, fostering significant distrust toward memecoins. One instance involved hackers compromising Kylian Mbappe’s X account to promote a fraudulent memecoin that reached a $460 million market cap before a rug pull. Similarly, Wiz Khalifa’s 35.7 million X followers were targeted with a fake WIZ token that briefly hit a $3.4 million market cap before collapsing. This decline in investor confidence likely affected the REAL token’s reception. ​Nansen Research’s Nicolai Sondergaard noted that experienced traders were quickly taking profits. Misinterpretation of the token’s objective: Despite McGregor’s assertions that REAL was a legitimate project with real-world applications, many perceived it as another celebrity-endorsed memecoin. This misunderstanding may have undermined the token’s credibility and deterred potential investors. Investor skepticism toward celebrity tokens: The crypto community has grown wary of celebrity-backed tokens , especially after several high-profile failures. Even tokens tied to Donald Trump and Melania declined sharply , causing investors significant losses. Other known celebrity token failures include Hawk Tuah (HAWK) by Haliey Welch and Daddy Tate (DADDY) by Andrew Tate. Several celebrities associated with crypto earned a bad name for themselves. Davido, a popular Nigerian Afrobeat star, launched his memecoin Davido (DAVIDO) and made money using pump and dump . These incidents caused investors to view memecoins with suspicion. McGregor’s image: While central to his success in the UFC, Conor McGregor's brash persona worked against him in the crypto world. His history of controversies and impulsive behavior undermined trust in the project’s legitimacy. His image raised red flags , especially in a space already plagued with scams. Did you know? Some memecoins have sparked real-world donations and activism. Dogecoin’s community once raised over $50,000 to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the 2014 Winter Olympics, showing that memecoins can fuel fun and philanthropy. Purpose and tokenomics of REAL memecoin The purpose of REAL is to facilitate functions like staking, governance, and utility, as well as a real-world MMA fight simulator and future business integrations. Its tokenomics , however, have come under criticism. According to the RWG team, the REAL memecoin tokenomics model was designed for transparency and community engagement, as 32% of the total supply was allocated to the DAO treasury to support ecosystem growth, while 17% was distributed to the community to incentivize participation. To earn governance rights and rewards, tokenholders could stake the coin; 10% was reserved for the development team. The model aimed to fund sports and gaming startups, blending hype with practical utility. Critics found flaws in the tokenomics, and many regard that as a reason for the poor show in fundraising. They were particularly harsh on the token's 12-hour unlock window. This allowed investors to sell their tokens shortly after the acquisition and make profits, even while the price declined. Several projects had used such a structure earlier for pump and dump , which created a bad precedent. This deterred long-term investors seeking sustainable growth. The project’s marketing strategy also raised concerns, as many felt the project added no real value and was just an attempt to take advantage of a celebrity’s name. The use of third-party logos on its website led to accusations of misleading promotional tactics, undermining the project’s credibility and deterring potential investors. ​And the lack of a clear roadmap for REAL only amplified investor skepticism. Broader risks of celebrity-backed tokens The fate of McGregor’s REAL memecoin fundraising highlights the broader risks of celebrity crypto endorsements. While celebrities bring attention and massive followings, their involvement often lacks substance, long-term commitment or technical understanding of the projects they promote. Celebrity-backed tokens often ride on hype rather than real value, leading to pump-and-dump scenarios where early investors benefit while latecomers suffer losses. The credibility of the crypto industry suffers when such projects collapse, reinforcing public distrust. The way REAL’s fundraising event turned out serves as a warning that fame doesn’t equal a project’s credibility. Regulators also scrutinize such endorsements more closely, potentially bringing legal consequences for misleading promotions. For the crypto space to mature, projects must prioritize transparency, utility and experienced leadership over viral marketing. The REAL memecoin fundraising failure emphasizes that genuine trust and long-term vision are more valuable than celebrity clout in crypto fundraising. Did you know? Shiba Inu, launched in 2020 by “Ryoshi,” was dubbed the “Dogecoin killer.” With a quadrillion-token supply and a vibrant “Shib Army” community, it hit a $40 billion market cap in 2021. What can investors learn from the failure of REAL memecoin fundraising? Investors in the crypto space can learn many lessons from the failed fundraising of REAL memecoin. First and foremost, hype is not a substitute for value. Relying solely on celebrity influence without understanding the fundamentals of a project can lead to poor investment decisions. REAL also revealed how quickly investor sentiment can shift. Initial excitement turned into skepticism as users noticed the lack of community involvement and utility behind the token. McGregor’s limited engagement and controversial public image further fueled doubts, proving that star power doesn’t guarantee project longevity or trustworthiness. Investors need to recognize the importance of doing their own research (DYOR). Just because a celebrity backs a token doesn’t mean it is credible. Checking for real-world use cases, developer activity, tokenomics and community feedback is essential. Finally, the collapse of REAL fundraising highlights the need for regulatory clarity in celebrity endorsements. Without it, misleading promotions will continue to hurt retail investors and ultimately undermine the credibility of the crypto industry.",Conor McGregor|REAL,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-11 09:25:00

The event, with over 200 attendees and 35 speakers, is happening on April 11-13, at the Ark Village, which Sun intends to attend in person to show Tron’s full support for the initiative. “I personally, and the Tron team also, support this anniversary,” Justin said during the speech, referring to the event as a priority. The information comes from a full transcript of the Liberland Congress meeting provided by Liberland’s official channels, detailing Tron’s involvement, including their tech team already collaborating with Liberland’s blockchain engineers on EVM compatibility. Integrating EVM will make it easier for users to interact with Liberland’s blockchain infrastructure and it will open up access for broader crypto communities. “We are going to be EVM-compatible, which will get more users exposure to the infrastructure,” Justin said. He stressed that it would allow more people to start using the Liberland governance protocol directly. The US visit and Government Meetings in May The agenda for the second quarter of 2025 has also been announced, revealing early talks and close cooperation through “multiple channels with the U.S. government” to advance Liberland’s interests. Mr. Sun also spoke about the need to bring in more students, government representatives, and international participants to recognize and engage with Liberland as a country. The vision, according to Justin, is to build a functioning crypto-backed nation with on-chain governance, decentralized law systems, and real-world infrastructure. Liberland’s On-chain Government Model Attracts Global Crypto Players Liberland’s 10-year anniversary event is expected to draw more than 200 people, including 35 speakers, making it the largest event in the country’s history so far. The program will feature conferences focused on decentralized governance models, interactive workshops, local Liberlandian cuisine, wine tasting, and a barbecue at Jefferson Square, located in the territory claimed by Liberland between Croatia and Serbia. President Vít Jedlička, who founded Liberland on April 13, 2015, said the weekend is about pushing the country forward, not just celebrating past milestones. “This anniversary isn’t just about reflecting on our achievements—it’s about building the future of Liberland together,” Vít said. “It’s a moment to strengthen our community and create new opportunities for all.” Technology is a central part of Liberland’s structure. Vít said that up to 90% of bureaucratic processes in the republic can be automated using blockchain and artificial intelligence. He questioned why nations still pay for massive administrative overhead when machines can handle the same tasks faster and without bias. The weekend event will feature a wide cast of crypto advocates, with U.S. Senator Rand Paul and entrepreneur Brock Pierce both confirmed to speak. Rand is expected to discuss policy and legal structures for emerging governments, while Brock will focus on how blockchain communities can build national-level institutions. The two join a growing list of global figures engaging with Liberland not just as a concept but as a real political project with its own land, governance structure, and development goals. One of those figures is blockchain expert Mr. KEY (Karnika E. Yashwant), who was just elected into Liberland’s Congress to help build its decentralized and innovation-driven government.

While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain staples, a lesser-known altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is quietly gaining traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being hailed by experts as the next big thing in the crypto world. Mutuum Finance tokens available during their Phase 4 presale which are priced at $0.025. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 8100 buyers who have raised $6.5 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 4 token purchase earn 140% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates in Phase 4 The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale is in progress while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 4 of the presale has surpassed $6.5 million total shares and attracted more than 8100 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.025 during Phase 4 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 4 obtained 140% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. Furthermore analysts predict MUTM will reach $4 upon listing. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 5 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.03. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive. The referral system within Mutuum Finance provides users with rewards for bringing new members into the platform which helps the community to expand while accelerating its growth naturally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has positioned itself as a promising player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, offering innovative solutions and significant growth potential. The strong investor interest during its Phase 4 presale, raising over $6.5 million from more than 8,100 buyers, highlights the confidence in the platform’s future. To get involved and secure your stake in this rising project, join the ongoing presale before the next price increase and take advantage of the $100,000 giveaway and community incentives.

On one front, HashKey has become one of the first exchanges in Hong Kong to receive regulatory approval to offer Ether (ETH) staking services, a move that could transform how institutions engage with proof-of-stake assets. Meanwhile, in the United States, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart suggests that staking may soon be permitted for Ether ETFs, potentially as early as May, following the SEC’s recent approval of options contracts tied to spot ETH funds. HashKey Secures Regulatory Greenlight for Staking Services in Hong Kong, Paving the Way for ETH ETF Yield Strategies Hong Kong-based exchange HashKey has received regulatory approval to offer staking services, marking a critical leap forward for investors seeking passive yield opportunities from digital assets such as Ether (ETH). The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) granted approval on April 10, following new regulatory guidance on staking services for Licensed Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs) and authorized funds. HashKey made the announcement via social media, emphasizing its new role as “one of the first regulated Hong Kong exchanges” to provide such offerings. This development comes at a pivotal time, as institutional interest in crypto products continues to evolve from pure exposure vehicles to more advanced, yield-generating strategies. By introducing regulated staking options, Hong Kong becomes the first major financial jurisdiction to offer spot Ether ETFs with integrated staking opportunities. The SFC’s approval was bolstered by support from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which recognized the broader implications of crypto staking for blockchain security and investor participation. According to a translated version of an announcement posted by PANews, the CSRC sees staking as a mechanism that “enhances the security of blockchain networks and allows investors to earn returns from virtual assets in a regulated market environment.” This marks a notable evolution in the regulatory perception of staking, particularly in a region often viewed as cautious about digital assets. The endorsement from both the SFC and CSRC not only signals regulatory clarity but also an intent to position Hong Kong as a hub for compliant and sophisticated crypto investment vehicles. Spot Ether ETF Staking: The Institutional Catalyst With this new approval, HashKey is set to lead the charge in bridging spot Ether ETFs and staking—a combination that has yet to materialize in more restrictive markets like the United States. “In the near future, investors will not only be able to hold Ether ETFs to obtain staking income but also directly hold ETH and obtain additional income through our staking services,” said Terence Pu, Managing Director at HashKey, in a translated statement. Pu hinted at a dual-access model, where ETF investors and direct holders alike can participate in network validation while earning yield. Hong Kong approved its first spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in April 2024. These ETFs are structured around in-kind subscription models, enabling direct interaction with the underlying assets—a crucial factor in allowing for integrated staking mechanisms. With Asia, and specifically Hong Kong, now rolling out these services in a regulated environment, pressure may mount on US policymakers to keep pace or risk ceding institutional capital to more progressive markets. The staking approval also aligns with HashKey Capital’s broader thesis. The firm has recently emphasized its bullish stance on DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) and Real World Assets (RWAs), both of which rely on staking and tokenized yield models to incentivize network participants. Staking Services for US Ether ETFs May Launch by May, Bloomberg Analyst Says In related news, Ether-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States could soon offer staking rewards to investors as well, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, potentially unlocking a critical revenue stream for institutional holders of Ethereum (ETH) and marking a watershed moment in the evolution of regulated crypto investment products. Following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) April 9 decision to authorize options trading on spot Ether ETFs, Seyffart believes staking approval could follow as soon as May, though he cautions that final approval may take until the end of October 2025. “It's possible they could be approved for staking early, but the final deadline is at the end of October,” Seyffart posted on X. “Potential intermediate deadlines before the final approval (or denial) are in late May & late August.” A Turning Point for Ether ETF Utility Ether ETFs were officially launched in June 2024, following the SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier that year. However, while Bitcoin products gained widespread traction, Ethereum funds have lagged in adoption, largely due to the absence of staking yields—a core value proposition of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) architecture. According to Farside Investors , Ether ETFs have brought in $2.4 billion in net inflows as of April 10, a fraction of the $35 billion seen by their Bitcoin counterparts. Ethereum ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors) This underperformance has been a cause of concern among fund managers, who argue that staking is a crucial mechanism for unlocking Ethereum’s full investment potential. In March, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, publicly stated that Ether ETFs are “less perfect” without staking, adding, “A staking yield is a meaningful part of how you can generate investment return in this space.” Staking, a process native to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, involves locking up ETH to help validate network transactions. In return, participants earn staking rewards, creating an opportunity for passive income akin to earning interest in traditional finance. Allowing ETFs to participate in staking would enable funds to generate yield directly from the underlying ETH , boosting total returns for institutional and retail investors alike. In contrast, options contracts, which the SEC has now approved for Ether ETFs, give investors the right—but not the obligation—to buy or sell shares at specific prices within set timeframes. While options increase flexibility and allow for advanced trading strategies like hedging and speculation, they do not generate passive returns like staking. Regulatory Momentum Builds The approval of Bitcoin ETF options in September 2024 and now Ether ETF options in April 2025 represents a clear evolution in the SEC’s stance on crypto investment products. Analysts and fund managers alike see these developments as stepping stones toward broader functionalities, including in-kind redemptions and staking. Asset managers have been actively lobbying the SEC for more comprehensive permissions. Requests to permit in-kind creations and redemptions, which would allow ETF issuers to swap crypto assets directly rather than converting them to cash, are still pending. If staking is approved, it would signal the most transformative leap yet for Ether ETFs. As Bitwise Invest’s head of alpha strategies Jeff Park noted in a prior post, the development of ETF options and staking mechanisms represents a “monumental advancement” that creates “extremely compelling opportunities” for investors. Outlook and Industry Reactions With Seyffart’s timeline suggesting possible regulatory clarity as soon as late May, ETF issuers like BlackRock, Bitwise, and Fidelity are preparing for a pivotal moment. The ability to add staking to their Ether products could catalyze a second wave of ETF adoption, especially among yield-hungry institutions. If approved, staking would provide a dual benefit for Ether ETF holders: price exposure to ETH and passive yield through staking rewards, making the investment product more competitive with decentralized staking platforms and more appealing than their Bitcoin counterparts, which do not offer staking opportunities.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-11 09:30:00

Despite the 4.1% gain over the past day, the asset remains more than 25% below its all-time high of over $109,000 set in January. One of the latest developments influencing the current sentiment came from US President Donald Trump, who posted, “This is a great time to buy,” shortly before a 90-day suspension on new tariffs was announced. The pause led to a sharp reaction across financial markets. Bitcoin jumped over 10%, while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ saw daily gains exceeding 11% and 14%, respectively. According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, this development mirrors a similar episode in 2009 when then-President Barack Obama encouraged long-term stock investments amid a market downturn. That historical parallel saw the S&P 500 begin a multi-year rally, raising the question of whether Trump’s second term might trigger a similar bullish cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ownership Patterns Shift Amid Price Correction Historic Parallels and Their Potential Impact on Bitcoin Maartunn emphasized the potential for policy-driven sentiment shifts to play a role in Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Drawing comparisons to the market response following Obama’s 2009 comments, the analyst suggests that investor psychology, coupled with fiscal strategy, could significantly affect market direction. The implications are not just isolated to equities but also extend to crypto markets, as demonstrated by Bitcoin’s strong correlation with traditional financial indices during major policy shifts. While no trajectory is guaranteed, the market’s reaction to political cues highlights Bitcoin’s growing entrenchment in broader macroeconomic trends. Maartunn wrote: Could the remainder of Trump’s second term mirror Obama’s first, when the market surged roughly 75% over four years? The parallels are there—but nothing is guaranteed. This chart will be one to watch closely in the coming months. Hashrate Hits Record as Fundamentals Strengthen Separately, CryptoQuant analyst Yonsei Dent pointed out an important underlying development. Despite Bitcoin’s decline from its $109K peak to around $80K, both the network hashrate and mining difficulty have reached all-time highs. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s network security and miner confidence remain strong, even during price drawdowns. While increased mining difficulty implies greater costs for miners, it also reflects heightened participation and belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The network’s resilience in the face of price volatility may offer a stabilizing factor as market sentiment continues to fluctuate. Dent cited CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju who noted that Bitcoin’s hashrate could serve as a proxy for its intrinsic value. He posited that, based on current mining trends, Bitcoin’s potential market cap could reach as high as $5 trillion. Notably, with the asset currently holding a $1.6 trillion valuation, Bitcoin’s upside remains considerable should fundamentals continue to align with investor confidence.

In a recent post shared on the decentralized social media platform Warpcast, Buterin responded to the Ethereum ( ETH ) community’s concerns regarding the protocol’s latest upgrade , EIP-7702. One user shared a statement from X user @nftchance, who pointed out the “non-viability” of EIP-7702. The user pointed out that the wallet blocks websites that are not suspicious. However, it still allows delegations for potentially fraudulent contracts to pass through, which could leave users vulnerable to potential security breaches like phishing and other cyber hacks. “Meanwhile they’re going to allow arbitrary delegation that can result in complete portfolio loss in one signature,” stated the user on X. Upon seeing this critique, Vitalik Buterin offered advice on how to mitigate risks associated with the new upgrade. He stated that the right way to use the EIP 7702 upgrade was to only delegate audited contracts to prevent security exploits. “The right way to use [EIP] 7702 is to delegate exactly one contract that is well reviewed by the wallet team and the Ethereum community, and have that contract implement the remaining logic in a safe way,” said Buterin in his recent Warpcast post. You might also like: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade on Sepolia encounters issues EIP-7702 introduces a new type of transaction feature, which allows for Externally Owned Accounts or EOAs to temporarily function as smart contract accounts during a single transaction. With the new feature, users can carry out more advanced transactions such as gas sponsorships, batch transactions, and custom logic execution without having to convert EOAs into smart contract accounts. After the transaction is processed, the EOA returns to its original state, enabling complex operations without permanently altering the account structure. Although the new upgrade aims to simplify account abstraction and create more flexibility for users, many have pointed out how it also introduces potential security risks. For instance, attackers could exploit it by creating contracts that seem safe under normal conditions, but could be hiding security loopholes activated under specific circumstances. Ultimately, users grow weary that they could fall victim to phishing attacks under the new upgrade if the system gets tricked into delegating control to fraudulent contracts. Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7702 is part of the broader Pectra upgrade, which was originally set to officially launch on the Ethereum mainnet on May 7. However, according to the results of the latest Ethereum Execution Layer Core Developers Meeting, the Pectra client upgrade is expected to launch on April 21. The upgrade would add EIP-7702 for delegated state to JSON-RPC. Vitalik Buterin co-authored EIP-7702 with Ansgar Dietrich, Matt Garnett, and Sam Wilson to offer better synergy with smart contract capabilities.

The analysis was prompted by a question directed to Grok3 and connected to Ripple’s recent acquisition of Hidden Road , a move seen as potentially increasing XRP’s financial infrastructure exposure. The tweet aimed to assess how daily liquidity injections of such magnitude might influence XRP’s valuation, using a combination of economic modeling and publicly available data. I asked Grok3: Based on the new Hidden Road acquisition. How much would XRP be worth with $10 billion in daily inflows. https://t.co/9Px9Xihjy0 Predicting the exact effect of $10 billion in daily inflows on XRP's price is complex and depends on multiple factors, including XRP's… — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) April 9, 2025 The tweet says XRP’s price is approximately $1.88, with a circulating supply of about 58.27 billion tokens. This puts its market capitalization at roughly $109.55 billion. Digital Perspectives explored scenarios to model how consistent daily inflows might affect price, depending on how the capital interacts with market dynamics. In the first layer of analysis, a direct addition method is used. If the $10 billion were entirely used to purchase XRP and thus fully absorbed into market capitalization, the new market cap would be $119.55 billion. Dividing this figure by the token supply yields a new theoretical price of $2.05, a 9% increase from the current level. This scenario assumes pure buying pressure without significant offset from sell-side liquidity. Transaction Velocity and Utility-Based Usage The tweet then explores a more nuanced perspective, recognizing XRP’s transactional design. XRP is known for high transaction velocity. This means the same units can be reused multiple times a day. Digital Perspectives notes that in cases of 100x velocity, only a fraction of actual XRP is needed to facilitate $10 billion in transactions It would require just over 53 million tokens, a small fraction of the total supply At current prices. Under this condition, if inflows represent utility-based use rather than speculative holding, the immediate price impact could be minimal. However, market behavior often deviates from this theoretical minimum. The tweet references investor and institutional behavior, where participants accumulate excess liquidity to avoid volatility and slippage. In such cases, demand may surpass the bare minimum required for transactions, driving price upward more significantly. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Multiplier Effects and Longer-Term Projections Further into the post, Digital Perspectives references multiplier effects. Specifically, it cites models such as the Bank of America (BoA) multiplier, often discussed on X, which suggests that each inflow dollar could add multiple dollars to market cap due to recursive trading dynamics and investor expectations. With a 10x multiplier, the first day’s inflow could push XRP’s market cap to over $209 billion and its price to approximately $3.60. Extended over 10 days, the same trend could theoretically drive the market cap above $1 trillion, raising the XRP price to nearly $19.04. This optimistic view is tempered by realistic considerations. The tweet acknowledges that rapid price appreciation often triggers selloffs from long-term holders, including Ripple’s own escrow reserves . Ripple controls a significant share of the XRP supply, which could re-enter the market gradually and affect pricing. Additionally, regulatory factors, such as the ongoing SEC litigation and broader sentiment in the crypto market, are noted as variables that could slow or reverse price growth. In more moderate scenarios, a multiplier of 2x to 5x is used. Under a 3x multiplier, the market cap would increase by $30 billion after one day, lifting XRP’s price to around $2.39—a 27% rise. According to the tweet, these figures reflect a more balanced interpretation that accounts for supply absorption inefficiencies and partial market impact. Digital Perspectives concludes the thread by summarizing that while the exact price effect of $10 billion in daily inflows cannot be determined with precision, a range of $2.05 to $2.39 per XRP is reasonable for a one-day reaction. With continuous inflows and increasing adoption scenarios—whether through RippleNet expansion, financial institution involvement, or broader use cases—price targets as high as $20 are theoretically possible over time. The post cautions, however, that outcomes will depend on the specific allocation of those inflows between transactional utility and speculative demand.

Analysts are now exploring the impact if even a modest portion of Hidden Road’s daily financial flows were to be processed through XRPL. Just a 10% Shift Could Trigger a Major Market Impact Ripple CTO David Schwartz emphasized the game-changing nature of this acquisition , noting that Hidden Road currently manages over $10 billion in liquidity and processes upward of 50 million financial transactions each day. Most of these settlements experience significant delays — often up to 24 hours — due to traditional clearing systems. Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is a defining moment for the XRP Ledger and XRP. The prime broker clears upwards of $10B and processes over 50M transactions a day on various traditional rails, waiting up to 24 hours for those transactions to settle. Now imagine even a portion… https://t.co/xiHdyy30Sm — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 8, 2025 With Ripple’s technology in place, these operations could shift to blockchain rails, particularly the XRP Ledger , enabling near-instant settlements. If this happens, the ripple effect (pun intended) on the token’s usage and value could be dramatic. Analyst Breakdown: What If XRPL Gets a Share of the Action? Crypto analyst and influencer Zach Rector examined various adoption scenarios, from conservative to aggressive, modeling how XRP might respond if 10%, 30%, or even 50% of Hidden Road’s daily transactions flowed through XRPL. These figures represent $1 billion, $3 billion, and $5 billion in daily value respectively. Rector pointed out that an annual flow of $300 billion via XRPL, stemming from just a 10% shift, was once seen as wishful thinking. Now, it’s being actively discussed as a tangible possibility, given the scale and reach of Hidden Road’s institutional clients. Modeling XRP Demand in Institutional Settlement To estimate the possible effect on XRP’s price , the AI language model ChatGPT was consulted for a utility-driven scenario. It explored what would happen if XRP served as either the settlement token or collateral within these blockchain-based transactions. Assuming that 10% of the $1 billion in daily XRPL volume requires XRP to settle — about $100 million per day — the system would need approximately 50 million XRP tokens daily at a $2 token price. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As XRP sees more institutional settlement usage, demand will naturally begin to rise. Institutions could start setting aside XRP reserves to guarantee fast and consistent access to liquidity, effectively reducing the amount of XRP available on the open market. Reduced Circulating Supply Could Drive Price Up If, for instance, institutions collectively held 5 billion XRP in reserves, the active supply would shrink. This drop in available tokens, paired with rising daily utility, would likely exert upward pressure on the price. In such conditions, buyers may be forced to pay higher prices — possibly $3 to $5 — to gain access to liquidity pools. As daily settlement demand climbs to $200 million or more, XRP prices could escalate even further. Estimates suggest that at $200 million in demand, XRP could trade between $5 and $10, and with $500 million daily liquidity needs, the token could potentially soar to $10–$20 or beyond. Hidden Road Deal: A Ticking Time Bomb for XRP Valuation? The true impact of Ripple’s Hidden Road acquisition might not be visible immediately. However, as infrastructure integrations take shape and institutional volume begins flowing through the XRPL, a new era of XRP utility could emerge — one where token demand is tied directly to the backbone of global brokerage activity. For now, XRP’s price sits below $2, but the seeds for a much larger role in global finance may have just been planted.

At this point, while uncertainty continues in the crypto market as in global markets, 10X Research founder Markus Thielen warned about the decline, stating that the BTC price is facing pressure in the short term, although he expects an increase in the long term. Markus Thielen said that it may be too early for Bitcoin investors to start being optimistic about the effects of a possible recession on Bitcoin's price and to be bullish on BTC. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is facing pressure in the short term as recession fears grow. “It's too early to expect bullish momentum in Bitcoin.” Pointing to widening credit spreads as a sign of growing economic concerns, the analyst argued that a possible future recession and possible interest rate cuts by the Fed could benefit BTC in the long run. However, Thielen said that according to historical data, Bitcoin has faced short-term sales before those periods arrive. “Historically, when annual credit spreads start to widen, Bitcoin usually faces more downward pressure and takes longer to recover. These periods present a longer-term opportunity for BTC. However, it may face headwinds before gaining upward momentum.” Thielen lastly referred to the Chinese currency, the Yuan, and said, “Currency devaluations have historically been bearish for markets in the short term and bullish for markets in the long term.” *This is not investment advice.

XRP Price Prediction for April 11,https://coingape.com/markets/xrp-to-2-6-today-xrp-price-prediction-for-april-11/,"XRP price is showing a mixed outlook today, April 11. CoinMarketCap data shows Ripple has posted a slight 0.7% gain in 24 hours but trading volumes are down by 52%. Top 10 Crypto Amid today’s slight uptick in price, the weekly, daily, and four-hour timeframe charts highlight several bullish scenarios for XRP that could precede a bullish breakout to $2.60 XRP/USDT Weekly Chart XRP price is looking bullish on its weekly chart. It formed a Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) at $1.77 amid an intense selloff caused by the ongoing US-China trade war . After Ripple dropped to this multi-week low, it quickly swept liquidity before bouncing back, suggesting aggressive buying pressure at this level. This week’s green candlestick also shows a resumption of buying activity. As long as Ripple holds above the SFP, it reinforces the bullish thesis and the likelihood it will extend its gains. The main level that traders need to watch is $2.59, which is the critical weekly support and resistance. If Ripple makes a decisive close above 2.59 today, it will shift the trend to bullish and open the door for the XRP price to trade above $2.60. XRP/USDT: 1-Week Chart XRP/USDT Daily Chart The XRP daily price chart also strengthens the probability of a rally towards $2.60. Ripple has bounced from a Selling Climax above $1.80. This makes $1.80 a crucial support zone, and as long as XRP trades above it, it has a chance to recover. The immediate resistance level for Ripple on the daily chart is $2.40. This is the Point of Control where most trading volumes have occurred in the past. This also makes it a key magnet for price, and if marks a strong buy zone for Ripple , it supports a bullish XRP price prediction and increases the likelihood of a bounce above $2.60. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart XRP/USDT 4-Hour Chart The lower timeframe also highlights a bullish XRP price prediction. For weeks. Ripple has been forming a series of lower highs, which often signals bearish momentum and seller dominance. However, it recently broke out of this pattern with a Break of Structure to form a higher low. This shift suggests that the market sentiment is changing. If it maintains this structure and forms a series of other higher lows, it will kickstart a bullish reversal. However, forming another lower high might trigger an XRP price decline . However, for Ripple to form a short-term bullish structure and rally to $2.60 today, it needs to form a sequence of higher lows, which will push the price to the next resistance level of $2.59. These higher lows may be sparked by developments in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit . XRP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart To sum up, the XRP price needs to defend the crucial support level of $1.80 to rally to $2.60. However, to maintain the bullish trajectory, it needs to form a series of higher lows on the lower timeframe and flip $2.40 where a lot of trading volumes are present. To reach $2.60 today, Ripple also needs a surge in buying pressure. The post XRP to $2.6 Today?

The SEC and Ripple agreed to put their appeals in “abeyance,” meaning the proceedings are now paused pending an anticipated settlement of the XRP ( XRP ) case. “An abeyance would conserve judicial and party resources while the parties continue to pursue a negotiated resolution of this matter,” the parties jointly stated in an April 10 court filing. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously announced the end of the XRP case on March 19, and the new filing hints that the SEC is ready to settle once nominated and approved Chair Paul Atkins takes office, according to some community speculation. The filing cancels Ripple’s April 16 brief deadline According to Ripple’s defense attorney, James Filan, the new filing supersedes the April 16 deadline for Ripple to respond to the SEC’s brief filed in January. “The settlement is awaiting commission approval. No brief will be filed on April 16,” Filan wrote in an April 10 X post. Some legal observers suggested the SEC’s willingness to pause the proceedings indicates that the agency may be prepared to drop the case after Atkins assumes office.

Solana Whales Ignite Accumulation Spree According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, a Solana whale bought 32,000 tokens worth about $3.72 million. The move comes six months after his last purchase of 39,310 tokens. The crypto bull has constantly backed Solana across many price cycles. The whale stunned the community after he purchased 30,541 SOL three years ago. At the time, the asset traded at $216, costing him $6.6 million. It should be noted that the holder did not sell his assets when SOL recorded a sharp drop. His trading pattern shows that the whale buys rising prices, which points to a potential market recovery. In the last 24 hours, several bulls have picked up Solana assets after President Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause. Crypto prices soared alongside stock as trillions flowed into the U.S. markets. The renewed demand for whales has turned the tide for SOL charts, with long-term holders signaling a $150 price. Several community leaders noted that the rollout of confidential balances, apart from whale purchases, aided the asset’s positive traction. “ Confidential Balances is a set of three token extensions on Solana that enable configurable privacy, such as: – Encrypted balances & transfers – Mint/burn ops w/ discrete total supply – Discrete fee handling… Secured with ZK proofs & ElGamal encryption. Confidential Balances are implementation-ready for:- Server-side Rust backends – WaaS integrations for custodial solutions,” the network disclosed on X. Institutional Investors Are Back Institutional demand for crypto assets surged hours after the macro events’ turnaround. Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows, as did major crypto purchases, setting the tone for the second quarter. Institutional investors have their gaze fixed on numerous spot altcoin ETFs, which will boost market participation. At the time of writing, SOL’s price stands at $111.8, and its market cap is above $57.3 billion. While Solana’s rebound sparked wider interest, XRP dominated altcoin gains in the last 24 hours. The asset posted a massive 10% recovery in hourly trading data.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-11 09:42:39

The firm announced that it had forged a partnership with the House of Doge to debut funds endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation. 21Shares Joins DOGE ETF Race On April 10, 21Shares filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. If approved, the proposed investment vehicle would offer investors direct exposure to the price of DOGE without having to purchase the crypto. As part of the filing, the Switzerland-based crypto asset manager teamed up with the Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, which will help market the product to ” reinforce [the token’s] role in mainstream finance.” “Registered investment vehicles are essential for broadening access to digital assets, and Dogecoin’s growing adoption underscores its significance in the crypto ecosystem,” 21Shares President Duncan Moir posited in an official statement. “By partnering with the House of Doge, we are taking a pivotal step in bringing transparent and institutional-grade investment options to the market.” Dogecoin is deemed the original meme coin and has a market cap of $22.9 billion, making it the eighth biggest crypto by that measure. Coinbase Custody will custodie 21Shares’ DOGE ETF. The fee, ticker symbol, and US stock exchange where the fund will be listed will be announced later. The filing comes a few weeks after the House of Doge created a reserve of 10 million DOGE, valued at around $1.5 million as per today’s price. According to House of Doge, the reserve would act as liquidity for international transactions denominated in DOGE to boost wider adoption. DOGE ETF Craze Builds As SEC Turns Pro-Crypto Last month, the SEC postponed deciding on multiple proposals regarding Dogecoin, Litecoin, Solana, and XRP ETFs. Industry observers at the time were not surprised by the move, given that the U.S. Senate had not confirmed Trump’s SEC chair pick, Paul Atkins. As ZyCrypto reported earlier, the Senate has approved Atkins’ nomination as the next SEC chairman. The former SEC veteran is considered crypto-friendly, especially compared to his predecessor, Gary Gensler. 21Shares joins Bitwise and Grayscale , who have also previously applied to offer similar Dogecoin-based investment products in the United States. Bloomberg ETF analysts said in February that there is a 75% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Dogecoin ETF before the end of this year. At press time, Dogecoin was priced at $0.15, down 5.5% over the past 24 hours, according to data provided by CoinGecko. The asset is down from a three-year-high price of $0.475 last November, when long-time DOGE proponent Elon Musk teased the Department of Government Efficiency, which shares the token’s ticker.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-11 09:46:02

Albert Saniger, founder and then-chief executive of the company, faces one count each of wire fraud and securities fraud. The announcement was made by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on April 9 , in a parallel civil action filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Saniger is charged by authorities with lying to investors that Nate was a computerized, artificially intelligent shopping assistant capable of making online purchases automatically without any human involvement. The Illusion of AI Nate rolled out in 2020 and positioned as an “AI-powered universal shopping cart.” In real life, the DOJ only claims the app’s main function — purchasing — was manually carried out by a team of Filipino-based contractors. Saniger is only accused of hiring hundreds of staff members, referred to as “purchasing assistants,” who personally carried out customer purchases, despite positioning only as fully automated. $40M Raised on False Promises The scam, it is alleged, helped Saniger to raise over $40 million in capital from venture capital firms. Prosecutors say he instructed employees to hide the human element from investors and the public at large. “This type of fraud not only victimizes unsuspecting investors, it diverts capital away from legitimate startups,” said Acting US Attorney Matthew Podolsky. Shutdown and Legal Fallout During the 2021 holidays, Saniger supposedly instructed his engineers to develop bots to add to the pool of human labor. But authorities claim the app’s level of automation remained notional at zero. Nate ceased in January 2023 when the press began questioning its assertions. Saniger subsequently let go of all staff. He could receive up to 20 years for each charge if he’s convicted. The SEC is also seeking to have him prohibited from serving as an officer or director of any public company and to disgorge investor funds. Nate was unavailable for a comment request.

However, on-chain data shows that investors’ interest in the Pi Coin is waning quickly, with daily trading volumes dropping another 44% to $158 million. Analysts point out that the increasing supply of PI tokens at the exchanges can further dampen the upside and could put the ecosystem growth in the shadows. Why Is Pi Network Investor Sentiment Down Pi Network community member Edycabas recently shared his take on the collapse of transaction activity on the blockchain. He noted that the Pi blockchain is underwhelming, reportedly processing less than one transaction per second, despite years of promotion suggesting thousands of transactions per block during its Open Mainnet phase. Source: Edycabas Responding to this, another community member, Dr Altcoin, noted that the blockchain itself remains operationally robust, boasting a 99.5% transaction success rate and averaging 20 transactions per block. “The real issue lies in transparency concerns surrounding the co-founders, which continue to deter major investors and centralized exchanges (CEXs),” he said. Besides, Dr Altcoin also shared aspirations for the Pi Network price to reach a minimum token value of $10, which, as per the analyst, would significantly boost engagement with decentralized applications (DApps) and broader adoption. Dr Altcoin has also previously suggested for Pi token burns to boost the Pi Coin price higher. Pi Coin Core Team Lacks Transparency Dr. Altcoin has also questioned the Pi Network co-founders’ reluctance to engage publicly, urging them to address the community and investors. “Why do the co-founders avoid interviews?” Dr. Altcoin asked, adding that the “Pi Community has kept this project alive for years, and it deserves greater recognition”. Dr. Altcoin stressed that co-founders Nicolas Kokkalis and Chengdiao Fan must step up to showcase the project’s potential to prevent the token from declining further, warning of a possible Pi Coin price dip below $0.30 in the coming week. Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin has issued a statement predicting significant activity on centralized exchanges (CEXs) as unlocked Pi tokens flood the market. Starting next week, an average of 134 million Pi tokens will reportedly enter circulation monthly.

43207645,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104827,1744365072,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Binance Announces LDUSDT Token to Combine Passive Income with Futures Market,https://zycrypto.com/binance-announces-ldusdt-token-to-combine-passive-income-with-futures-market/,"Binance is launching a new token, with the symbol LDUSDT, a reward-bearing asset for their futures platform, allowing customers to convert their USDT into LDUSDT, enabling them to trade on futures markets. In contrast, the token is locked with the Simple Earn Flexible platform. This way, customers can conduct futures trading while earning a passive income. Binance first created a reward-bearing asset in 2024 called BFUSD, but it did not have the added functionality of futures trading. LDUSDT, moreover, provides an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 1.5%, which Binance guarantees will never drop below zero. LDUSDT builds off the success of BFUSD, particularly with the use of APY to earn an income from various investment strategies. The financial innovations form a new product line from Binance, with various latest technologies being developed to offer customers more investment options. Particularly, customers enjoyed using the first reward-bearing asset, BFUSD, and it was this feedback that Binance wanted to build off. Jeff Li, Binance VP of Product, said the goal was to increase customer utility, with LDUSDT providing both passive income and market liquidity on futures. Binance allows customers to swap their Simple Earn Flexible Product USDT to LDUSDT. The customer can then use the LDUSDT as margin while simultaneously receiving APR rewards. LDUSDT also asked for the use of Multi Asset Mode while trading. The new product, including the app, will be available in Binance soon. Binance’s Simple Earn Tether (USDT) is the first port of call for customers wishing to use LDUSDT. Usually, the USDT would be locked while earning passive rewards. However, now, traders of USDT can earn rewards by using the token to trade futures. The customer, therefore, can utilise their tokens more fully by doubling their utility. This fits in with Binance’s goal of increasing utility within its ecosystem. They’re also adding value to cryptocurrency, transforming the market from a treasury strategy to a functioning currency. BFUSD, the precursor to LDUSDT, uses delta hedging between spot and futures markets. The customer can earn rewards from staking. BFUSD supports USDC and USDT, but users must redeem these tokens before accessing rewards. LDUSDT, however, simplifies the process greatly by skipping the delta hedging method and focusing instead on the pre-existing Simple Earn USDT Flexible Product, building off this and simply adding the ability to trade futures markets. Binance remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume, boasting a $16.5 billion trade volume in just 24 hours. In contrast, Binance’s rival, Bitget, only traded $5 billion in 24 hours. Reward-bearing assets may boost Binance’s ability to market passive and active trading products. This way, customers can ‘have their cake and eat it’, enjoying the conservative benefits of Simple Earn while also having access to futures markets. The ability to earn passive income and then use those earnings to trade in a futures market makes new products highly attractive.",Cryptocurrency|News|Binance|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-11 09:51:12

But the Pi team, including co-founder C. Fan and developer John Lang, is asking the community to stay calm, calling it just a short-term dip. They’ve rolled out updates like better mobile features, KYC, and tools for games and services. Analysts are also suggesting ways to boost the price, like burning extra tokens. While some still believe Pi could reach $3 if global conditions improve, the project’s future depends on strong community support and steady progress. Pi Coin Riding the Storm – Will Pioneers Hold On to the $3 Dream? Once hailed as a revolutionary way to mine crypto through mobile devices, Pi Network is now facing its toughest challenge yet. The price of Pi recently dipped close to $0.30, shaking the confidence of many… pic.twitter.com/xb7INGdMdj — Cryptoleakvn (@cryptoleakvn) April 10, 2025 Despite its active community, the Pi Coin has struggled to gain traction due to a lack of exchange listings and high token supply. Now, the team is introducing a token burn mechanism, a move aimed at reducing supply and potentially stabilizing or boosting the price. But is this enough to bring Pi back to its launch hype? Understanding the Token Burn Plan Token burning is like removing extra coins from the system forever. Pi Network made a lot of tokens early to reward mobile users, but now there are too many, which makes it hard for the price to go up. To fix this, the team is planning to destroy some tokens so there are fewer available. Hence, they’re looking at different ways to do this, like burning coins regularly, based on activity, or even letting the community help decide. The hope is that with fewer tokens, the price will have a better chance to rise. Why Challenges Still Remain While the token burn could help limit the supply, it’s not a guaranteed fix. Pi Coin is still not listed on major exchanges, meaning it lacks the liquidity and exposure most cryptocurrencies need to grow. Investors also remain cautious, as the network still has limited real-world use and utility. Without a working ecosystem or a clear project roadmap, interest may fade before the effects of token burning take hold. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: 119 Million Tokens to Be Released by Month-End , Current Price Outlook According to the latest Pi/USDT chart, the coin recently found strong support in the $0.43–$0.46 zone after a steep drop. A brief spike pushed it above $0.75, but resistance quickly forced it back down. At the time of writing, Pi Coin trades around $0.5974, fluctuating between support at $0.55 and resistance at $0.60. The momentum remains slightly bullish but not strong enough to suggest a clear breakout yet. The token burn has sparked new conversation around Pi, but it won’t be a game-changer on its own. For Pi Coin to truly recover and aim for higher price levels, such as the previously seen $3 mark, it needs better market access, real-world use, and long-term transparency from the team. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In an X post on April 10, John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger bands volatility metric, revealed good news in progress for Bitcoin bulls. Bollinger bands %b metric teases BTC price comeback Bitcoin may already be establishing a long-term bottom, the latest Bollinger bands data suggests. Analyzing weekly timeframes, Bollinger himself drew attention to one of his proprietary indicators, known as “%b,” which offers further clues about market trend reversals. %b measures an asset’s closing price relative to Bollinger band position, employing standard deviation around a 20-period simple moving average (SMA). Among its insights is the “W” bottom formation, where a first low beneath zero is followed by a higher low retest later — something that could now be in play for BTC/USD. Bollinger confirmed to X followers: “Classic Bollinger Band W bottom setting up in $BTCUSD. Sill needs confirmation.” BTC/USD 1-week chart with Bollinger bands data. Source: John Bollinger/X On both weekly and daily timeframes, Bollinger bands show no trend shift has taken place yet. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the daily chart continues to walk down the lower band, with the middle SMA acting as resistance. BTC/USD 1-day chart with Bollinger bands data. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Turning to stocks, with which BTC/USD has become increasing correlated, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, drew similar conclusions. “Revisiting the Bollinger Bands, we have gone from 2 standard deviations above-trend to on-trend to now almost 2 standard deviations below-trend,” he noted about the S&P 500 on April 9. “Again, oversold but not at an historic extreme.” Bitcoin bounce may follow 10% Nasdaq plunge As Cointelegraph continues to report , BTC price bottom targets increasingly center around the $70,000 mark.

As the asset perceived to be at the top of the risk pyramid, I would expect NASDAQ to rally first, and then Bitcoin. Just something to look for,” he revealed this week. “But I think NASDAQ has another -10% to fall.” Bitcoin vs. Nasdaq comparison.

Block, formerly called Square, is owned by co-founder Jack Dorsey. New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) cited money laundering flaws, know-your-customer gaps, and issues relating to the Bank Secrecy Act. In January, the company agreed to pay a fine of $80 million to multiple states for similar problems. The DFS argued that Block did not have adequate risk assessments regarding the nature of their transactions, allowing gaps for illegal transactions such as terrorism funding. Cash App began offering Bitcoin transactions in 2018 and, according to the DFS, did not create enough oversight to monitor the types of transactions being processed. Cash App has experienced exclusive growth since that time, making it a particularly vulnerable platform for money laundering. Block has been ordered to seek outside help to monitor its transactions on Cash App and improve its service. The DFS concludes that Block had loose transaction standards and that, as a result, anonymous transactions were being processed regularly. “This marks the resolution”, said Block spokeswoman, “of all previously pending state money transmission license matters. The department has acknowledged that Cash App has devoted significant financial and other resources to compliance remediation and enhancements. We share the department’s dedication to addressing industry challenges and remain committed to investing across our operations to help promote a safe and healthy financial system”. Adrienne Harris, DFS superintendent, announced the $40 million fine against Block for its anti-money laundering procedures and virtual currency compliance deficiencies. The fines relate to the Cash App platform, owned by Block. Harris points out that the company failed to monitor transactions adequately and had no procedure to identify customers properly. As part of the settlement with Block, the company must hire an external monitor to help it overcome these issues. There has also grown a large backlog of issues due to the company’s rapid growth. Block has responded to the charges and states that they disagree with the verdict but are committed to improving their service. The DFS reported that between 2018 and 2021, Cash App had accumulated many backlogs. In 2020, the number of logs grew to over 169,000. Response times were especially dismal, with some alerts taking over a year for Cash App to respond. DFS also had an issue with Block’s annotation of transactions. Block would label transactions associated with mixers as medium risk. Meanwhile, the DFS believes those transactions should be labelled as high risk.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|Jack Dorsey,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-11 09:58:13

As a result, demand for safe-haven assets like gold is soaring. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant Verified Author Alex Adler Jr points Bitcoin’s growing interest as “digital gold.” With a 16% gain this year, Bitcoin is emerging as another hedge against economic uncertainty. U.S. Tariffs on China Reach 145% Analyst Alex Adler believe that the latest price jump follows an aggressive tariff hike by the U.S. government to impose an additional 125% tariff on Chinese imports, raising the total duty to 145%. While the administration also announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most other countries, the focus on China has shaken the global markets. Gold surged past the $3,200 per ounce mark, setting a new record amid a weakening U.S. dollar and growing demand for safe-haven assets as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensified.

Gold Shines as a Safe-Haven Asset Gold has historically been viewed as a hedge against inflation, making it a top choice for investors during market turmoil. Since the start of the year, its price has jumped over 20% , mainly due to strong buying from foreign central banks. With the dollar weakening and fears of an ongoing trade war growing, the precious metal’s demand has surged. Analyst Axel AdlerJr, suggests that if the trade war escalates, gold prices could climb even higher. Bitcoin The “Digital Gold” While gold is making headlines, Bitcoin, often called “digital gold, ” is also seeing gains. Over the past year, BTC has surged by 16%, showing strong growth despite market uncertainties. As of now, Bitcoin is showing a slight rise, with its price trading around $81,910 , though still down from its ATH of $109k.

What would that do for Bitcoin, bonds, stocks, and gold?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bank-of-japan-to-cut-interest-rates-today/,"The Bank of Japan is expected to cut interest rates as soon as today or tomorrow, as pressure builds from inside the country and chaos mounts globally. Inflation expectations in Japan rose again in the past three months, according to a BOJ survey published Friday, with 86.7% of households now predicting prices will go up within a year. That’s the highest number since June 2024, and it’s higher than the 85.7% figure from December. These expectations are one reason the central bank had been leaning toward more hikes, not cuts. But that’s not happening anymore—not right now. BOJ may have to cut rates by noon — zerohedge (@zerohedge) April 11, 2025 The same survey shows companies in Japan are finally starting to raise wages and prices, which the BOJ had been waiting years to see. The data shows the conditions for more interest rate hikes were starting to appear. Trump’s tariffs stall BOJ hikes while inflation rises in Japan But analysts say another factor is now standing in the way: Mr. President Donald Trump, who is back in the White House, launched a new round of tariffs, and that has reignited fears of a global recession. That fear is one big reason the BOJ is now expected to cut rates instead of hiking them again, which you might recall crashed every single market on that fateful day of August 5th, 2024. And right now, stocks and crypto are all down thanks to Trump. Bitcoin is still struggling to reclaim $100,000 and the S&P 500 keeps adding and wiping out trillions in minutes almost every market session. But interestingly enough, the stock market actually staged a historic performance on Wednesday, the second-best day in history. Meanwhile, gold was out here breaking records amid the crash, but even it got a bit wobbly after Trump hit China with 125% tariffs, the largest ever. Naomi Muguruma, chief bond strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, explained that she’s now pushing back her forecast for the next BOJ rate hike by six months—to January 2026. The BOJ had already started pulling back on its massive bond buying program last year. That program used to fund more than $10 billion a year for the Japanese government. Now that those purchases are being cut, the Ministry of Finance is being forced to hunt down new buyers to plug the gap—and they’re looking outside the country to do it. Foreign buyers inch in while BOJ cuts bond purchases The BOJ has been moving away from quantitative easing ever since Kazuo Ueda replaced Haruhiko Kuroda. Ueda raised rates for the first time in 17 years and announced that the central bank would start reducing its bond holdings. In July 2024, the bank said it would cut bond buying by ¥400 billion every quarter, which would lower total holdings by about 7% to 8% by early 2026. These cuts focus mostly on bonds with maturities of ten years or less. Last month, for the first time, the BOJ said it would also start reducing its purchases of super-long bonds. A full review is coming in two months to see how the cuts are going. Bond yields have reached levels that haven’t been seen since the 2008 financial crash, and that’s attracting some new attention. But if the Bank of Japan does cut rates soon, that will almost certainly bring a much-needed relief rally to stocks, bonds, cryptos, and gold. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Retail enthusiasm has increasingly gravitated toward alternative digital assets, while Bitcoin has been bolstered primarily by institutional investment through U.S. spot ETFs. Notably, while both Bitcoin and XRP have delivered similar overall performance since 2022, each trading approximately 5 to 6 times above their cycle lows, their growth trajectories tell vastly different stories. Bitcoin’s climb has followed a steadier path marked by strategic catalysts like the launch of spot ETFs and developments surrounding U.S. elections. In contrast, XRP traded sideways until November 2024 before experiencing an explosive upward surge of over 400%, behavior more characteristic of speculative retail interest. As per the firm, this retail-driven momentum has translated into substantial capital inflows for XRP, with its Realized Cap nearly doubling from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion. “Close to $30B of this increase came from investors deploying capital within the last six months, highlighting the short concentration of this retail-led rally.” The firm noted. Adding to XRP’s appeal is the newly launched RLUSD stablecoin, which has been integrated into Ripple’s payment systems to enhance cross-border transactions. According to Santiment analysts, RLUSD has experienced an 87% increase in adoption and has crossed $10 billion in trading volume on platforms like Kraken, further cementing institutional interest in Ripple’s infrastructure. However, onchain data suggests that speculative enthusiasm around XRP may be fading. Since late February 2025, capital inflows into XRP have noticeably slowed, aligning with a shift in profit-taking behavior that raises red flags. “Combined with high retail involvement, the rapid increase in new holders is a warning sign,” Glassnode noted . “ Many of these investors are now exposed to downside volatility, given their elevated cost basis.” That said, while Bitcoin consolidates above the $81,000–$85,000 demand zone following its correction from the $109,114 all-time high, XRP has also demonstrated resilience, rebounding above the key support level at $1.95. Analysts forecast that a bullish breakout could push XRP above its all-time high. Conversely, a failure to hold support may trigger a 40% correction, completing a potential head-and-shoulders pattern.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-11 10:03:27

Ripple and SEC File Joint Motion to Stay the Appeal,https://cryptopotato.com/settlement-in-sight-ripple-and-sec-file-joint-motion-to-stay-the-appeal/,"The years-long lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may finally be coming to an end, for real. A motion filed on Thursday revealed that the duo has jointly requested a pause on their individual appeals case. This latest move comes days after back-and-forth efforts to prolong the lawsuit. Still, the case awaits the Commission’s approval. The Final End? Since December 2020, the SEC has repeatedly claimed that Ripple’s XRP token offering classifies as an unregistered securities offering. Hence, the blockchain payment company must be penalized. Regarded as a high-profile case, the outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC case potentially sets a precedent for crypto regulation in the country and beyond. After the lawsuit seemed to have concluded , evidence showed that the financial agency was not ready for a final settlement. Talks about a possible continuation of the case caused onlookers to expect the submission of briefs on April 16th. However, current developments suggest that the lawsuit may finally be ending. Defense lawyer James K. Filan shared a document showing that the SEC had agreed to discontinue its appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal. It also covered claims against Ripple’s founders, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. The joint motion was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit yesterday. Filan stressed that the latest motion means no briefs will be filed on April 16th, as previously expected. It is worth noting that the outcome of this agreement is subject to the Commission’s endorsement. If the deal is approved, the SEC and Ripple Labs can draft the final settlement terms to settle a lawsuit that began nearly five years ago. Impact on XRP’s Performance Following the joint motion from the SEC and Ripple Labs, XRP’s price failed to impress. On-chain data shows that the digital asset’s price sharply declined from $2.022 to $1.93 within the past 24 hours. However, its price had rebalanced at $2 at press time, representing a mild 0.65% increase over the past 24 hours. Its traded volume had also dropped significantly by 51% to $4.07 billion.

The pre-launch phase introduces several changes, including to the token pricing mechanism. The price of the HINU token increases every two days until it sells out under the new pricing mechanism. The Pre-Launch Phase The pre-launch phase will empower the community and ensure early backers can benefit from favorable pricing. The phase began when markets were being battered by uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs. However, the markets have recovered, with Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens posting strong rallies. The Husky Inu team recently announced several updates, revealing the official launch dates of the HINU token and the Earn App. According to the team, the pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy, rewarding early adopters and project supporters while maintaining growth and transparency. With the pre-launch phase underway, the HINU token’s price will increase every two days, following a compounded growth model until the tokens are sold or reach their presale target. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends once all the HINU tokens are sold out. HINU Token Price Increases To understand how the price increase works, we must understand how the new pricing mechanism works. The mechanism is explained below. The starting price of the HINU token at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000. This price will increase every two days until all the HINU tokens have been sold out. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. The table below highlights the projected price if the presale continues uninterrupted. The token price was $0.00015000, and increased to $0.00015043 on day 2. Similar price increases followed on day 4 and day 6. HINU is currently priced at $0.00015130 with the next price increase set to occur in 1 day and 19 hours. Day Token Price 0 $0.00015000 2 $0.00015043 4 $0.00015087 6 $0.00015130 8 $0.00015174 10 $0.00015217 …. Compounded …. Compounded If the project reaches its fundraising goal, the price of the HINU token will jump to the next “Big Phase” stage. The Big Phase stages will see prices at $0.0000175 at Stage 5, $0.000200 at Stage 6, $0.000250 at Stage 7, and $0.000335 at Stage 8. All the price points during the “Big Stage” are fixed price points. Husky Inu has raised $737,226 from its stated goal of $1.2M.

Price Analysis and Insights,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/is-bitcoin-btc-forming-a-bottom-price-analysis-and-insights,"With global markets still in turmoil over the Trump tariffs, and the ongoing tit-for-tat punitive counter-tariffs between the US and China, Bitcoin may be forming a bottom after a more than 30% correction. Could a breakout take place soon? Trump tariffs will be negotiated On the one hand, things are looking bleak for Bitcoin as the economic and geopolitical environments remain uncertain and counter productive to any kind of market recovery. On the other hand, with the 90-day pause for countries that have had tariffs imposed upon them, this provides a window for some negotiated deals that could reduce the number of countries on the Trump administration’s tariff list. Of course, there is still China, the one country that still has tariffs imposed upon it, and with no 90-day let up. The US imposed an eye-watering tariff of 125% on Wednesday, and the White House clarified that this was actually 145% if the tariffs imposed during Trump’s first term were included. China has responded by upping its tariffs on US goods to 125%. As things stand, there appears to be no end in sight. That said, some kind of a coming together is needed in order to avoid a meltdown in world trade. Could the two presidents get together and pull off a deal? The market would be likely to reignite on such news. $BTC makes a higher low Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC shows that the price is still meandering within the descending channel. The important support at $80,000 did break down and confirm below, but Wednesday’s announcement of the 90-day suspension of tariffs on all countries except China, resulted in the price getting back above. Friday morning is witnessing a strong upward movement so far. $BTC is up 3.4% on the day. A very important thing to notice is at the end of the downswing early on Wednesday, the price did not quite come down to the previous low, meaning that a higher low has been made. It now remains for the bulls to push the price up through the top of the channel and get above the last swing high at $88,700. This could be the start of a trend break. Bollinger sees Bitcoin bottom Source: TradingView John Bollinger, legendary technical analyst, and inventor of the Bollinger Bands indicator, recently posted a chart on X that suggests that a W bottoming pattern is forming for Bitcoin. He says that the pattern still needs to confirm. This would be extremely bullish for Bitcoin if it does. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The new phase introduces several changes and benefits for users. The most prominent change is to the pricing of the HINU token. During the pre-launch phase, the HINU token price will increase every two days until they sell out. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the Husky Inu community, ensuring early project backers can benefit from favorable pricing. The HINU token price has already undergone one increase and is set to witness another price jump in 18 hours and 59 minutes. The Pre-Launch Phase The Husky Inu team recently announced several updates, revealing the official launch dates of the HINU token and the Earn App. According to the team, the pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy, rewarding early adopters and project supporters while maintaining growth and transparency.

The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. Adverse Market Conditions The pre-launch phase begins in extremely adverse market conditions, with major cryptocurrencies in the red. After a brief recovery on Tuesday, markets were back in bearish territory on Wednesday, with volatility also experiencing a substantial uptick. Despite bearishness, BTC has climbed above $80,000 as markets plot yet another recovery. However, the recovery’s sustainability depends on the market’s reaction to China’s announcement that it is increasing tariffs on all imported US goods to 84%. The Chinese embassy in the US announced the decision on X, stating, “China will raise tariffs for all imported US goods from 34% to 84% on April 10.” The move comes after the US increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%. “The US increased the tariff rates to 104 percent on China, which fueled the uncertainty among the market participants, as expected. Bitcoin price slumped hard and is about to drop below $75,000 for the second time this week, raising alarms over the entire crypto market. Market sentiments become extremely fearful, hinting towards a potential bear market.” Meme Coins Rally Meanwhile, meme coins have rallied as market sentiment improves, with top tokens trading in positive territory over the past 24 hours, although they remain in the red over a weekly timeframe. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 10%, crossing $0.150 and trading at $0.156. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up over 8% and Pepe (PEPE) is up a staggering 14%. Bonk (BONK) is up almost 13%, while Floki (FLOKI) and Dogwifhat (WIF) are up 11.97% and 11.44%.

How Will The Pre-Launch Phase Work? The Husky Inu team describes the pre-launch phases as a progressive token pricing strategy designed to reward early adopters while promoting transparent growth.

The pre-launch phase picks up where the Husky Inu presale left off, continuing the project’s fundraising as it approaches its launch date. The pre-launch phases are the next strategic steps in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, marketing initiatives, platform improvements, and broader ecosystem announcements. Big Phase Stage If and when Husky Inu reaches its fundraising goal or the presale tokens are sold out, the price of the HINU token will jump directly to the next Big Phase stage, the next official stage in the Husky Inu roadmap. The Big Phase stage comprises four states, each with a fixed price point. Earlier prices will no longer be available once the project moves to the next stage.

The project also issued an update about the Earn App and plans for a May launch. While the updates have generated considerable excitement in the Husky Inu community, they come at a trying time for the broader crypto market. State Of The Markets The crypto market is back in bearish territory as BTC, ETH, and other altcoins plunged into the red after President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs against almost all trading partners. As a result, the crypto market faced considerable volatility, while traditional stocks plummeted as economic uncertainty and recession fears gripped investors. Nasdaq saw its largest selloff since COVID, plunging over 5.5%. Meanwhile, the crypto market cap fell to $2.64 trillion as cryptocurrencies registered heavy losses. Bitcoin (BTC) went from $88,000 to $82,000 within a few hours, while ETH fell below $2,000 and then $1,800 as selling pressure intensified following Trump’s Liberation Day speech. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), and Toncoin (TON) also registered substantial declines over the week. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Action Bitcoin (BTC) entered the weekend on a bearish note, dropping over 3% on Friday and over 2% on Saturday to settle at $82,704. Price action remained bearish on Sunday as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $82,404. The current week began with a marginal increase as BTC moved past $82,500. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 3% and moved past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $85,150. BTC surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it lost momentum and plunged over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $82,525. BTC recovered on Thursday, rising almost 1% and settling at $83,199. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action Ethereum (ETH) dipped below the 20-day SMA on Friday and remained in the red over the weekend, falling below $2,000 and settling at $1,807 by Sunday. The price recovered on Monday, registering a marginal increase and settling at $1,822. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH rose almost 5% and settled at $1,905. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping nearly 6%, slipping below $1,800 and settling at $1,794.

The Trump administration introduced new tariffs and expanded existing ones, which resulted in increasing trade tensions among major partners like China, the European Union, and Mexico. Global financial markets are significantly impacted by these actions, which causes increased economic uncertainty and volatility. These tariffs are aimed at a range of products, from aluminium and steel to cars and various electronic components. Unsurprisingly, some countries have responded with counter-tariffs on US exports, which could potentially trigger a big trade war. You might also like: Trump’s trade war: Tariffs, recession risks, and crypto volatility | Opinion This back-and-forth has resulted in increased trade barriers, which are slowing down economic growth—a trend that’s evident in recent macroeconomic indicators, including the Conference Board consumer sentiment index. Consequently, forecasts for US GDP growth have been adjusted downward due to the impact of these tariffs. The automotive sector, which relies heavily on imported parts, is also feeling the pinch, with Ford Motor Co. recently announcing a significant cut in expected dividends. How trade barriers are turning Bitcoin into a global safe haven Donald Trump’s recent actions prove that his attitude towards his tariffs is very consistent and goal-oriented, which has sparked a ‘contrarian’ positive outlook for cyclically resistant investment assets, where Bitcoin ( BTC ) occupies a special position. With rising tariffs and inflation worries, more people are turning to alternative, discorrelated assets, which are broadly viewed as a safeguard against both inflation and impending economic instability in general. Historically, Bitcoin has proven to be quite resilient during tough economic times. For instance, during market upheavals—like the banking sector turmoil we saw in 2023 following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank—Bitcoin evidently experienced price surges, hinting at a “flight to safety” trend being formed robustly and meaningfully. However, to date, such trends remain mostly perceptional and, therefore, unfortunately, hard to quantify and algorithmize. Having said that, the fact that the US is still at the forefront of various innovative efforts in cryptocurrency and AI somewhat mitigates the broader implications of the tariff situation. Recently, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) put forth a legislative proposal suggesting that the US should acquire one million BTC, representing about 5% of the total fixed supply. This initiative is expected to spark a new wave of significant activity in the crypto market. The combination of supportive government policies for crypto and the expectation of more tariff actions will likely create a complex but potentially very favorable market sentiment for Bitcoin. Once again, investors, swayed by these developments, are starting to see Bitcoin as a safe haven with the potential for sustained growth in a post-tariff landscape. The current market vibe, shaped by Trump’s tariff strategies and the prospect of long-term shifts, makes Bitcoin look like a low-downside-high-reward investment opportunity. AI and robotics: Winners in the tariff war Meanwhile, AI-aided automation and robotics are on the rise as increasing import costs from China push American manufacturers to cut labor costs. Similarly, countries like Vietnam and India are reaping the benefits as global companies relocate their manufacturing operations from China to avoid tariff-related expenses. Additionally, I see a lot of promise in sectors like AI, nuclear energy, and other manufacturing industries, which have the chance to set up operations in the United States. Integrating AI and automation within manufacturing industries can drive greater adoption of Bitcoin as a secure and efficient method of financial transactions, incorporated into metaverse and web3 ecosystems. Furthermore, the demand for AI technologies to support automated processes will likely surge, presenting new investment opportunities in the AI sector. Most importantly, the synergy between AI-aided automation, robotics, Bitcoin, and AI investments has the potential to reshape the future of the manufacturing and technology industries, which will drive even more attention to Bitcoin. Tariffs, trade wars, and rising risks: What investors should watch out for Trade barriers may—at least initially—disrupt certain supply chains, increase business costs, and reduce export demand due to retaliatory tariffs. Instability in one major market or economy due to trade tensions can spill over to other countries and regions, creating a global ripple effect. This can lead to lower investment, reduced hiring, and overall slower economic expansion, potentially even triggering a recession where gold and alternative assets like Bitcoin would definitely play special risk aversion roles, making their increasingly anti-correlative Betas more and more attractive for ordinary investors to “join the club.” It is important to keep the focus on the long term and invest in industries with high potential, such as AI, nuclear energy, healthcare, and rare earth metals. There may be some transitory, recoverable meltdown because the market is overvalued due to years of way-too-buoyant liquidity and overrated optimism. Still, if companies decide to quickly move to make production in the US and replace costly outsourcing, they have a great future due to the huge domestic market in this world’s largest economy. To navigate the challenges of this shaky market, both private investors and institutions can use a variety of diversification strategies. One effective approach is asset class diversification, which involves spreading investments across different types of assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and certainly alternative options like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it’s important to consider both developed and emerging markets while using various investment strategies—like value investing, growth investing, or dividend investing—which normally yield different results in different market conditions. Final words Currently, the market’s reaction to Trump’s tariffs suggests that Bitcoin is becoming more discorrelated to broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors and, hence, more appealing regarding both asset-protection and investment portfolio hedging purposes. Historically, Bitcoin demonstrated notable resistance to economic cycles and episodes of banking system instability. Now, it offers a legitimate test of its suitability as a risk aversion tool for real-world economic troubles. Its inclusion in the U.S. strategic reserve further underpins this thesis.

In light of this, the Internet of Things (IoT) has transitioned into the Internet of AI Agents (IoAA), a decentralized network that connects artificial intelligence systems. It is emerging as a transformative force in the world of artificial intelligence, but critical concerns related to centralization, security, and scalability remain. HyperCycle, an open network infrastructure, is a suitable solution for secure and efficient IoAA systems with applications in smart supply chains, healthcare, business, finance, and more. AI agents in warehouses, trucks, ports, and factories can coordinate in real time and handle route optimization, customs clearance, predictive maintenance, and demand forecasting, reducing delays and logistics costs. In healthcare, they can manage patient records, recommend treatments, schedule appointments, and even detect anomalies from wearable data. This will alleviate the administrative burden, speed up diagnosis, and enable more personalized care. Developers can leverage the decentralized marketplaces created by HyperCycle to build innovative applications using agents’ collective intelligence. These applications are likely to attract users and enhance revenue. HyperCycle integrates global intelligence to ensure its AI systems continuously improve. Once linked, one AI can monetize expertise by offering services to other AIs. Centralized systems create a single point of failure Before these ambitious transformations, AI networks must start operating within a decentralized framework. Each centralized system has a single point of failure and increases vulnerabilities to technical issues or cyberattacks, which can have dire consequences, such as halting operations and inflicting losses. Many companies rely on centralized AI services like OpenAI API, Azure AI/ML services, and others hosted on centralized cloud infrastructure. Imagine, for a second, if you will, a cyberattack or outage of Microsoft Azure’s data centers impacting GPT-based customer support agents, model training environments, or API rate-limiting systems. Financial companies that use AI for algorithmic trading will miss crucial signals, leading to financial losses. Marketing teams that rely on content generation will face delays, and developers using AI code will see their output plummet. These failures mean tanking stocks due to service unreliability and panicked investors or direct revenue loss for firms that rely on AI automation. There’s no need to stretch your imagination. In 2023, Azure’s API rate-limiting problems led to project delays and frustrated developers. A developer deployed Azure OpenAI service with a token limit of 1,000 a minute, and his first request used just 223 tokens, but subsequent ones triggered error messages. The reason was that his requests had been too frequent, exceeding the limit for the respective pricing level. He was invited to upgrade his account and received other equally frustrating suggestions. Apart from intermediaries introducing vulnerabilities and inefficiencies, they’re much more expensive to secure and transmit transactions through than the micro-transactions themselves. Currently, systems charge more than $0.01 per transaction, but AI services often cost fractions of a cent, making micropayments prohibitive and unfeasible. A decentralized, secure, and scalable framework as a solution HyperCycle’s decentralization and innate scalability empower firms and developers to unlock AI’s full potential. Among other things, it achieves these through a technology known as “Network Node Factory,” which allows anyone, anywhere, to take part in AI-driven wealth creation. This is mainly due to the nodes’ independence, autonomy, and self-governance. They eliminate third parties, and the decentralized node network on which HyperCycle operates minimizes the risk of a single point of failure and deters attacks on the system. AI agents communicate directly and operate in the AI machine’s network node. HyperCycle’s nodes scale effortlessly, with the “unlocking” process ensuring demand of any degree is sufficiently met. One HyperCycle node unlocks into two, then four, and so on. A single node can multiply into 1,024 over time, as unlocking can occur up to ten times. The exponential growth makes sure the network can handle higher loads and maintain top performance while accommodating as many agents as needed. HyperCycle’s clients don’t compromise on security because the platform uses cryptographic proofs to protect transactions and interactions between AI agents. Its ledgerless architecture offers superior performance to traditional ledger-based systems and reduces vulnerabilities. By using cryptographic proofs instead of a distributed ledger, it mitigates vulnerabilities such as double-spending (when an entity spends the same cryptocurrency twice by exploiting the delay in transaction confirmation on the blockchain) and 51% attacks (an entity controls more than half of a blockchain’s mining hash rate, allowing it to censor transactions, rewrite parts of the blockchain, etc.) Last but not least, HyperCycle agents continuously learn about new threats and adapt to them more easily. They can communicate and collaborate despite differences in their source or design. New and accessible opportunities to monetize the Internet of AI Agents The IoAA presents numerous opportunities for monetization, but they remain theoretical in the absence of secure and decentralized platforms. HyperCycle capitalizes on this emerging ecosystem through AI service marketplaces, AI-driven solutions, infrastructure and support services, and reduced developer costs, among others. Marketplaces are decentralized platforms where AI agents can offer translation, data analysis, image recognition, and other services. In business, decentralized AI agents can autonomously handle customer interactions across platforms, learning and adapting to each user’s preferences. This enables real-time personalization, faster response times, and service continuity even if one node fails. In transport, they can optimize route planning, traffic management, and logistics, improving efficiency and reducing costs. Decentralized AI agents can independently coordinate with vehicles, traffic systems, and local data sources to optimize routes in real-time without needing a central control hub. This allows for faster, more adaptive rerouting in response to traffic, weather, or accidents, improving efficiency and reducing delays. AI agents can also collaborate to provide real-time financial analysis, risk assessment, and investment recommendations, enhancing the accuracy and speed of financial decisions. Decentralized AI agents can analyze market data locally and collaborate to detect trends and anomalies without the risk of centralization-induced bottlenecks. This enables faster financial insights, even at times of high volatility and perhaps especially then. HyperCycle users can develop and sell AI-driven solutions based on the network’s collective intelligence. For example, an AI agent can combine insights from various sources to provide companies with predictive analytics. One infrastructure and support service that facilitates IoAA operation involves providing secure transaction processing and communication channels. Developers can access AI services on decentralized marketplaces without incurring additional costs. While this doesn’t automatically mean higher profitability, at least there is no risk of fees eating into profit. HyperCycle Is The Gateway To A Decentralized Future HyperCycle’s authentic peer-to-peer network enhances users’ AI capabilities, offering an innovative and surprisingly affordable way to tackle complexities. Each activated Node Factory expands the network’s reach and unlocks advanced computational layers. The nodes within the HyperCycle ecosystem facilitate the generation of short- as well as long-term wealth, like a business whose value increases over time. Optimally managed nodes accumulate worth and offer a sustainable route to financial growth. Beyond a viable solution, HyperCycle is a gateway to a safer, decentralized, and more intelligent future. Enhanced security, scalable intelligence, peer-to-peer collaboration, and boundless autonomy help individuals and organizations build sustainable value.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 11:24:30

The bill , known as the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act (SB1797), introduces one of the most comprehensive frameworks in the United States for digital asset businesses. Illinois aims to not only protect consumers by delineating oversight responsibilities and imposing stringent operational, cybersecurity, and disclosure requirements. Source: ilga.gov SB1797 also empowers the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) as the key regulatory authority overseeing digital asset activity. The bill applies to all individuals and entities conducting digital asset business with or on behalf of Illinois residents unless otherwise exempted by federal law or specific provisions of the Act. Strengthening Consumer Protections and Market Trust SB1797 introduces an extensive array of consumer protection mechanisms designed to increase transparency and accountability in digital asset transactions. Illinois State Senator Mark Walker’s Crypto Fraud Bill advances through Senate committee, moving closer to full legislative approval. #CryptoRegulation #DigitalAssets https://t.co/5Di0vXDH0G — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 4, 2025 Before any transaction is initiated, covered entities are required to provide comprehensive, clear, and conspicuous disclosures to Illinois residents. These disclosures must include details on fees, transfer irreversibility, insurance or lack thereof, liability for unauthorized transactions, rights related to error resolution, and important information on service outages and transaction timing discrepancies. The bill also mandates that digital asset service providers deliver transaction confirmations, either individually or through daily summaries, with specific details such as transaction type, value, time, and associated fees. Exchanges are additionally required to disclose their conflict of interest policies and conduct risk assessments that include analysis of cybersecurity threats, potential code defects, and market volatility. Notably, exchanges must certify their compliance to the Department unless the digital asset has already received approval by the New York Department of Financial Services. In regards to asset custody, the Act enforces segregation between customer funds and company holdings. Covered persons must not use client assets without explicit authorization, and digital assets held for clients cannot be claimed by the company’s creditors. Furthermore, a toll-free hotline and live customer support system are mandated, alongside procedures for dispute resolution and unauthorized transaction reporting. The Department is also authorized to develop rules enhancing these protections and ensuring that customer assets are not only held securely but are transparently managed. Rigorous Oversight, Registration, and Enforcement Framework Illinois’s approach to regulating digital asset activity goes far beyond surface-level compliance. SB1797 establishes a robust framework for the registration, supervision, and potential enforcement against bad actors in the space. All individuals and entities engaging in digital asset business activity must be registered with the IDFPR unless explicitly exempted. Applications must include comprehensive background and financial information, including audited financial statements for high-revenue applicants, insurance coverage, legal and disciplinary history, and risk management plans. Applicants are required to pay a non-refundable registration fee of $5,000 or an amount deemed necessary by the Department to cover the cost of application review. Registrations must be renewed annually, and failure to comply with renewal requirements can trigger enforcement actions. Notably, registrations are non-transferable, ensuring that accountability remains tied to specific entities. To ensure financial resilience and operational integrity, registrants are obligated to maintain a surety bond or trust account, as well as minimum capital and liquidity thresholds based on risk assessments. The IDFPR is granted sweeping investigative powers under Article 20 of the Act. It can examine books, records, and facilities of registrants without prior notice and compel the production of documents and testimony. In sum, SB1797 represents a decisive move by Illinois to bring the crypto business out of the shadows and under regulatory scrutiny. This particularly came at a time when the state is changing its earlier strict approach to crypto regulation following the victory of the current administration, as evident by the recent lawsuit dropped against Coinbase .

In a letter dated April 10 and addressed to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the senators blasted the DOJ’s decision to dismantle the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), calling it a dangerous retreat that could embolden criminals and foreign adversaries. “The decision to shutter this team is a grave mistake,” the senators wrote, warning that the move could allow “sanctions evasion, drug trafficking, scams, and child sexual exploitation” to flourish unchecked in the digital asset space. Warren was joined by Senators Richard Durbin, Mazie Hirono, Sheldon Whitehouse, Christopher Coons, and Richard Blumenthal. Blanche, in a memo dated April 7, had stated that the DOJ “is not a digital assets regulator,” signaling the department’s intent to scale back crypto-specific prosecutions. But the senators argue this step signals weakness at a time when blockchain-enabled crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated and borderless. Mixing Services and Legal Blind Spots The lawmakers voiced concern that crypto mixing services — platforms that anonymize blockchain transactions — remain largely unchecked, becoming “go-to tools for cybercriminals.” They claimed the DOJ’s sudden shift essentially gives a “free pass to cryptocurrency money launderers.” Perhaps more concerning, the senators said, was the DOJ’s apparent decision not to pursue prosecution in a number of cases involving violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and other financial crimes tied to digital assets. Such inaction, they argued, creates “systemic vulnerabilities” ripe for exploitation by bad actors. The letter demands a full staff-level briefing before May 1 to explain the rationale behind the DOJ’s pivot, and questions whether political motivations may be at play. Trump Family Crypto Ventures Beyond law enforcement concerns, the senators raised eyebrows at what they suggest may be a conflict of interest: the Trump family’s increasing ties to crypto ventures . President Donald Trump and his sons are backing initiatives such as World Liberty Financial — a platform developing a stablecoin — and American Bitcoin, a new mining operation. The senators hint at a potential link between the DOJ’s softened stance and these political investments. “Your decisions give rise to concerns that President Trump’s interest in selling his cryptocurrency may be the reason for easing law enforcement scrutiny,” the letter stated. While the DOJ has yet to formally respond, the tension underscores the deep political divide over how the U.S. should navigate its future in crypto.

Despite this achievement, ICP’s price was volatile. After the announcement, the price fell but then rose to over $15 in December. By January 29, 2025, it had dropped to about $8.80. Analysts predict ICP’s price could range between $5.54 and $8.30 by the end of 2025. For 2026, predictions are $4.27 to $6.40, and by 2030, between $1.57 and $2.36. Internet Computer aims to decentralize the internet. Founded in 2016, it allows people to build decentralized apps using its own blockchain. Its cryptocurrency, ICP, rewards those who operate the network and lets holders vote on proposals. ICP’s vision to transform the internet offers significant potential. While prices have fluctuated, its technology makes it an interesting prospect in the current market. Those interested in long-term blockchain innovation may watch ICP’s progress with keen interest.

Its growth reflects strong positioning in AI and decentralized infrastructure sectors. Looking ahead, some forecasts suggest RNDR could surpass previous highs, potentially reaching $17 to $38 by 2028. While speculative, these predictions show confidence in Render’s role amid growing AI demands and decentralized trends. In 2025, Render stands at the crossroads of AI expansion and decentralized networking. Its innovative approach to GPU sharing offers mutual benefits to users. While future price movements are uncertain, Render’s technology and market position make it a project to watch in the current cycle.

In 2028, HBAR is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.6162, with an average price of $0.634. By 2031, HBAR could trade between $1.84 and $2.24, with an average price of $1.89 Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) cryptocurrency is one of the altcoins that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force in the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR’s price rise again? Despite the overall bear market, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing at a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we might see a bullish scenario happening sooner: perhaps a retest of its all-time high. Overview Cryptocurrency Hedera Hashgraph Ticker HBAR Current Price $0.1723 Market Cap $7.31B Trading Volume (24Hr) $197.41M Circulating Supply 50B HBAR All-time High $0.5701 on Sep 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.01001 on Jan 03, 2020 24-hour High $0.1771 24-hour Low $0.1659 HBAR price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.83% 50-day SMA $ 0.197328 200-day SMA $ 0.188116 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 39 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) price analysis HBAR shows signs of a recovery on both the 1-day and 4-hour charts with price action holding above support Indicators such as RSI and MACD suggest bullish momentum is building while bearish pressure is weakening If current momentum continues HBAR may retest resistance levels between 0.18 and 0.20 in the short term HBAR price analysis 1-day chart HBAR/USD chart. Image Source: Trading view Based on the 1-day chart on April 11, HBAR (Hedera Hashgraph) is exhibiting early signs of a potential recovery after an extended downtrend. The price has moved slightly above the middle Bollinger Band, suggesting a tentative bullish shift. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at approximately 48.71, nearing neutral territory, which reflects improving momentum. Additionally, recent green candlesticks indicate buyer activity near the lower Bollinger Band, often interpreted as a support zone. However, the price still remains below the upper band and prior resistance near $0.20. If momentum continues, a short-term push to $0.18–$0.20 is plausible, though sustained breakout confirmation is needed. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBAR/USD chart . Image Source: Trading view Based on the 4-hour chart, HBAR (Hedera Hashgraph) is exhibiting a cautiously bullish setup with early signs of momentum recovery. The price has consistently closed above the middle Bollinger Band, suggesting improved trader confidence. Additionally, the MACD line remains above the signal line, albeit with narrowing separation, reflecting ongoing but tentative bullish sentiment. The Balance of Power at 0.24 underscores a modest tilt toward buyers. Immediate resistance lies around $0.179, with support forming near $0.160. If bulls maintain pressure and RSI (not shown but likely near mid-range) supports, a short-term rally may test the upper Bollinger Band and challenge recent highs. What can you expect from the HBAR price analysis next? Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is showing early signs of a potential recovery. On the 1-day chart, the asset has gained upward traction, closing above the mid-Bollinger Band while the RSI hovers just below neutral at 48.71, signaling waning bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart confirms bullish pressure with the MACD maintaining a positive crossover and the Balance of Power leaning in favor of buyers. The price has sustained levels above immediate support around $0.16. If bullish momentum continues, HBAR could aim to retest the resistance zone between $0.18 and $0.20 in the short term.

Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2025? By 2025, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.34 How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth $2.10 Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching $20 would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly unlikely in the near future. For context, with HBAR’s current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to $660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $2.23 and $2.65, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.34 by 2025 and $0.50 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support. Recent news/opinion on HBAR Nasdaq has applied to list an ETF holding Hedera’s HBAR token. This follows multiple filings by exchanges and asset managers seeking altcoin-based ETFs. The SEC must approve the listing before trading begins. In November, Canary Capital filed for its Canary HBAR ETF to provide investors exposure to Hedera’s native currency. Hedera Hashgraph price prediction April 2025 The Hedera Hashgraph price prediction for April 2025 suggests a consistent projection, with potential prices ranging from a low of $0.1583, an average of around $0.1731, to a high of $0.1781.

Price trends fluctuated significantly throughout 2019, dropping to $0.01 by the end of 2019. HBAR opened the year 2021 at $0.03, remaining steady for the first few days. The price significantly increased to $0.1 by the first week of February 2021, driven by the continuous network efforts of early January. HBAR started 2024 modestly, surging in April to a high of $0.1793 before stabilizing around $0.110 in May and dropping to $0.051 by September. November saw a rebound, with HBAR reaching $0.3012 and $3.34B in trading volume, closing the year near $0.29 after peaking at $0.30 in December. In January 2025, HBAR is trading between $0.30 to $0.31. However, the closing price for HBAR in January was $0.3. As of February 2025, HBAR is trading between $0.25 and $0.26.

ADA has presented a roadmap towards $10 by 2030 for Cardano, which is currently priced at $0.63 due to scalable upgrades, such as Leios. Shiba Inu (SHIB), flagging near $0.0000121, may skyrocket 550% if some key resistance is cleared. At least, not until the most underrated contender in the race for 2025 emerged: Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol currently in its fourth presale stage. Having raised $6.5 million and sold over 396 million tokens, MUTM’s presale momentum indicates a change in investor priorities to those of real utility and instant returns. Cardano’s Long-Term Uptrend in Question Cardano has seen developments in its blockchain infrastructure, with a forecast price of $2.11 in 2025. This forecast is backed by technical improvements such as smart contract upgrade and ecosystem growth. But its trajectory of growth stretches out over years: $10 targets are affixed to 2030 — a horizon that’s left short-term investors hungry for quicker returns. While ADA’s systematic buildup appeals to long-term holders, the extended timeline is in stark contrast to other projects offering near-term catalysts. This ensures instant ROI with launch for projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and others, filling the gap created by a gap in sentiment. The Surge of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu on the verge of both breakout and breakdown Analysts point to a bullish triangle formation indicating a 550% rally to $0.0000155 which mirrors its breakout 2021. But falling burn rates and a shrinking meme coin market cap — down $8 billion month over month — raise skepticism. SHIB’s dependence on speculative trends leaves it vulnerable to extreme volatility — a danger not found in platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Gears Up for Exchange Launch As Presale Proceeds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already in its fourth presale phase, selling tokens for $0.025. Those who participated early and locked their positions now will make a 140% profit when it hits the exchange at $0.06. The next stage is priced at $0.03, 20% higher than the previous stage, and creates a sense of urgency with limited allocations. MUTM’s post-launch projections suggest tectonic growth beyond presale gains. And within months of its release, analysts expect it to climb to $3.50—making a 13,900% leap from the current stage! Such optimism results from the innovative mechanics of Mutuum Finance. Value of the mtTokens has been constantly accruing as users earn interest on their deposits, and the platform implements a buy-and-distribute system that feeds revenue into token buybacks. This demand remains constant as they are repurchased and redistributed to stakers. This, along with overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending characteristics, creates a self-sustained ecosystem for the protocol. Security is still a top priority, with Mutuum Finance completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts. The anticipated results will be disseminated through established official channels promoting transparency. More than 8,100 holders have already switched on, grabbing the early bird presale prices and dodging the subsequent step-up between price tranches. 2025 Memo on Mutuum Finance As Cardano and Shiba Inu each have their own narrative, so does Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Its presale — that has raised $6.5 million — is a testament to the confidence in a model bringing DeFi utility and investor incentives together. Unlike speculative rivals, the project’s emphasis on lending, borrowing and yield generation provides protection against market volatility. The $0.025 entry point for Phase 4 comes before not only a 20% rise in the next round, but also a listing on an exchange. A small cohort of early participants are set to multiply their investments manifold, a prospect dimming the gradual gains found elsewhere. MUTM’s credibility grows, attracting institution while pending Certik audit The message for portfolio rebalancing investors that put their trust in the fundraising class is that Mutuum Finance offers a unique combination of accessibility, innovation, and growth potential. The opportunity for purchase tokens at presale prices shrinks close each day—wait too long, risk missing out on the defining altcoin story of 2025.

In an April 10 court filing , both parties requested that the case be held in abeyance for 60 days, citing ongoing settlement discussions. “An abeyance would conserve judicial and party resources while the parties continue to pursue a negotiated resolution of this matter,” the filing stated. Ripple CEO’s March Remarks Foreshadow Pause in SEC Case Proceedings The pause in proceedings follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s recent remarks in March, suggesting the case was nearing its end. The timing of the filing has fueled speculation that the SEC may be waiting for its incoming chair, Paul Atkins, to officially assume office before finalizing a settlement. Ripple defense attorney James Filan confirmed that the abeyance request overrides the previous April 16 deadline for Ripple to respond to a brief the SEC filed in January. “The settlement is awaiting commission approval. No brief will be filed on April 16,” Filan stated on X. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The parties have filed a joint motion to hold the appeal in abeyance based on the parties’ agreement to settle. The settlement is awaiting Commission approval. No brief will be filed on April 16th. pic.twitter.com/OVKPCIh43H — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) April 10, 2025 The SEC’s willingness to pause appeals has been interpreted by some legal commentators as a signal that the agency may be preparing to drop the case under new leadership. One community member noted that a settlement led by Atkins would mark a “huge win” and potentially reset the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation. Atkins was confirmed by the Senate as SEC Chair on April 9, but it remains uncertain when he will be officially sworn in. For context, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler assumed office three days after his confirmation in 2021, suggesting Atkins could take over as soon as April 12. The XRP case, which began in December 2020, has been one of the most closely watched legal battles in the crypto industry. Trump-Era Shift Signals SEC Reassessment of Crypto Regulation The SEC’s recent shift in tone under President Donald Trump reflects a broader effort to reevaluate the agency’s approach to digital assets. SEC’s Mark Uyeda announced on April 5 that, in line with Trump’s deregulation agenda and guidance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk, the SEC is reviewing seven staff-issued statements—five of which concern cryptocurrencies. Statement from Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda: Pursuant to Executive Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation, together with recommendations from DOGE, I have requested Securities and Exchange Commission staff promptly to review the following staff statements. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) April 5, 2025 Among those under review is a 2019 framework from the SEC’s FinHub that assessed when digital asset sales could qualify as investment contracts under the Howey test. Other documents being reconsidered include statements from the Divisions of Investment Management, Corporation Finance, and Examinations, particularly those addressing risks tied to Bitcoin futures, crypto custody, and industry-wide bankruptcies during 2022. As reported, the SEC announced new guidelines on April 4 , stating that certain fiat-backed stablecoins will be classified as “non-securities,” thereby exempting them from transaction reporting requirements.

While Bitcoin fell to $74,000, altcoins suffered more damage from the tension between the two countries. However, the analyst argued that it may be time to invest in altcoins, stating that the market, which has been trading in the red zone for several weeks, is showing signs of a great opportunity for altcoin investors. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared a chart showing altcoin trading volumes, a suitable tool for determining ideal periods for altcoin trading. This chart compares the total 30-day average trading volume of altcoins to their yearly averages. At this point, the analyst said that the 30-day trading volume average in altcoins has recently fallen below the annual volume average, and this decline has historically been a good time to buy altcoins. At this point, the analyst stated that it is time to start a dollar cost averaging (DCA) strategy on altcoins. According to the analyst, it may be a good time to start buying altcoins. Finally, the analyst noted that these levels in altcoin trading volume were last reached in September 2023, just after the end of the bear market, and reminded that altcoin prices started to rise after this date. “Currently, the 30-day moving average is below the 365-day moving average in terms of the altcoin volume indicator, and we have historically entered a buy zone. Interestingly, the last time we reached these levels was in September 2023, right after the bear market ended. These phases can take several weeks or even months, but historically, they have consistently presented attractive opportunities for establishing a DCA strategy.” It might be time to start a DCA strategy on Altcoins. “We’ve entered a buying zone, which is defined by the 30-day moving average falling below the annual average… last time we reached these levels was in September 2023, right after the bear market ended.” – By @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/xEHnHD5bg8 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 11, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

It comes in ninth among cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization between $22.9 billion and $23.87 billion. Solana (SOL), a top-five candidate, has a far higher market capitalization—between $82 billion and $85 billion. This striking disparity in value begs a fascinating question: Could Cardano surpass Solana, get a top-five ranking, and turn a well-timed investment into a million-dollar fortune? Cardano’s Market Performance and Challenges The price fluctuation of Cardano lately shows conflicting results. ADA dropped by about 1.81% to 2.74% over the past 24 hours; its weekly losses vary from 6.3% to 8.58%, indicating a more notable reduction than the 4.3% decline of the broader crypto market. A clear drop in daily trading volume, which has dropped by roughly 27.4% to a range of $454 million to $670 million, points to a declining investor energy. ADA tests a significant support level close to $0.65, while resistance falls between $0.75 and $0.84. Though its price stays below both the 50-day ($0.70-$0.71) and 200-day ($0.73-$0.78), the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a neutral position at about 45-46. If ADA wants to threaten Solana’s supremacy, this suggests a bearish short-term trend it will have to overcome. Should Cardano reach Solana’s $85 billion market valuation, it would require a remarkable over 260% increase. Although ambitious, such a spike is not totally out of reach in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Can ADA’s Growth Make You a Millionaire? Assuming a circulating supply of 35.27 billion ADA, ADA’s price would have to rise to roughly $2.41 if Cardano were to achieve Solana’s present $85 billion market valuation. An investor would need approximately 414,938 ADA tokens to transform this into a million-dollar bonanza, and at today’s price of $0.64, that would demand an investment of almost $265,560. If Cardano moved much higher and broke into the top five with a $100 billion market capitalization—akin to Binance Coin (BNB)—its price would jump to around $2.83. Under this situation, one must make about $225,000 in investments to guarantee a million-dollar reward. If Cardano has an Ethereum-level growth and reaches a $300 billion market cap, its price might leap to $8.50. An investor investing $75,300 now would find their holdings worth $1 million. At a $8.50 value, a simple $1,000 investment at the current ADA price—equal to around 1,562 ADA—could increase to $13,000 for smaller investors. Although this shows a good comeback, turning a modest investment into a seven-figure fortune would need a far higher outlay. But another coin gaining popularity has even more potential for exponential increase: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance (RXS) Offers a More Lucrative Opportunity Rexas Finance (RXS) is a fast-growing token with a growth trajectory much longer than ADA’s. It needs a considerable market cap increase to produce million-dollar rewards. Rexas Finance enables investors to easily own or tokenize assets, including real estate, art, and commodities, redefining asset ownership globally as a blockchain initiative transforms real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Its presale performance has been quite outstanding. Rexas Finance (RXS) has already raised approximately $47.80 million, filling 91.80% of its last phase. Right now, it is in its final presale stage at $0.20. Early investors are already positioned for notable returns with its official launch price of $0.25. Rexas Finance has consciously decided to maintain its community-driven development, unlike other ventures that depend on venture capital funding, assuring that retail investors, not only institutional backers, gain from its explosive potential. How Rexas Finance (RXS) Can Deliver 150,000% Gains Rexas Finance (RXS) has already seen an incredible 500% growth from its first presale phases. Its potential for a dramatic spike of over 150,000% distinguishes it and makes it among the most likely tokens for wealth creation. Even if it surpasses Solana, a $1,000 investment now might explode into nearly $1.5 million—an outcome much above ADA’s anticipated returns. The successful CertiK audit of Rexas Finance, which improves its security and reputation, increases investor confidence. The token has also been listed on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, driving its momentum and raising its profile among regular investors. These calculated actions position RXS as a game-changer in the crypto market and draw much interest from institutional and retail participants. In conclusion, while Cardano (ADA) has excellent potential value increase, its path to make an investor a millionaire calls for a sizable initial investment and notable price appreciation. The necessary investment is still significant even if ADA ranks higher than Solana and makes the top five cryptocurrencies. With a development trajectory that could see a $1,000 investment quadruple into millions, Rexas Finance (RXS) offers a considerably better wealth-building possibility.

Martinez tells his 135,000 followers on the social media platform X that market indicators, including a “death cross” on the daily timeframe, suggest Bitcoin is not convincingly breaking out. A death cross in technical analysis occurs when the 50-day moving average (MA) drops below the 200-day MA and is used to identify a weakening market. “While the recent Bitcoin bounce has been strong, the higher time frames suggest caution: Death cross recently formed on the daily chart. SuperTrend indicator still shows ‘Sell.’ Monthly open at $82,500 acting as resistance. Descending trendline from all-time high sits around $84,000. 50-day moving average at $85,800. 200-day moving average at $87,000.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking to the upside, Glassnode says that based on the historical precedent of the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), the flagship crypto asset faces a key resistance level at $94,500. The MVRV is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization compared to its realized capitalization – the value of all Bitcoin at the price they were bought at. The MVRV’s extreme deviation pricing bands are used to determine possible market bottoms and tops, with the 1.0 standard deviation being the upper band and -1.0 standard deviation being the lower band. “As Bitcoin rebounds, the next immediate resistance stands at $94,500, according to pricing bands.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Lastly, the analyst says that Bitcoin may see a massive rally if the top digital asset by market cap can reclaim $86,900 as support based on the Mayer Multiple. The Mayer Multiple is a technical tool that measures the difference between the current price of BTC and the 200-day moving average to determine if Bitcoin is overbought or oversold. “Based on the Mayer Multiple, Bitcoin could find solid support around $69,500. And, a breakout above $86,900 might set the stage for a market top near $208,550.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $79,829 at time of writing, down 3.9% in the last 24 hours.

43210660,https://finbold.com/?p=243362,1744371947,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Over $1.77 billion stolen in crypto hacks in Q1 2025 – Finbold report,https://finbold.com/over-1-77-billion-stolen-in-crypto-hacks-in-q1-2025-finbold-report/,"Following a string of staggering cryptocurrency hacks between January 1 and March 31, 2025 promises to be a particularly damaging year in terms of digital asset theft. More than $1.77 billion was stolen in the first quarter (Q1) of the year, according to Finbold’s Q1 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report , which assembled figures using data retrieved from hacks tracked by blockchain security firm SlowMist . The figures are made even more staggering by the fact that a singular attack accounts for nearly 85% of all the value stolen. Indeed, in February 2025, a Bybit cold wallet with approximately $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum ( ETH ) was spirited away by an unknown assailant. Along with representing the lion’s share of cryptocurrency stolen in Q1, 2025, the Bybit hack is larger than the total taken in the first half of 2024 – $1.38 billion – and is three times larger than the total for the first quarter of 2023 – $452 million, putting 2025 on track to be a record-breaking year for cryptocurrency hacks with several high-profile incidents already. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); The rug pull endorsed by a President Though the sheer scale of the Bybit hack is staggering, it arguably wasn’t the most shocking event of the first quarter. The Libra ( LIBRA ) rug pull, which saw the loss of approximately $100 million, involved the Argentinian President Javier Milei. In the early months of 2025, Milei began promoting LIBRA and the associated blockchain as a way to invest in the country. Though he appears to have been uninvolved with the scam itself, he has remained unapologetic. Another prominent figure involved with the scandal and paid to promote the cryptocurrency ahead of the rug pull was Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, who himself lost more than $5 million when the meme coin crashed. Though by no means negligible, the other hacks and attacks of the quarter with known losses pale in comparison both in terms of total assets and in terms of the shock factor. Developer that kept backdoor access Infini, a Hong Kong stablecoin neobank, suffered a $50 million loss in late February as the assailant abused the administrative privileges they retained. The attacker is alleged to have previously helped develop the contract for the company, only to secretly keep undue privileges and drain the funds using the famous cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash. Contract vulnerabilities help disappear 10,000 ETH Elsewhere, the fourth and fifth largest cryptocurrency heists of the quarter both involved the abuse of contract vulnerabilities. In late March, an attacker exploited a weakness in Abracadabra Money’s smart contracts to drain 6,262 ETH – worth approximately $13 million at the time – from the liquidity pool. In early February , another assailant utilized a rounding bug to drain a zkLend of 3,600 ETH worth $9.6 million. Lastly, it is worth noting that Finbold’s Q1 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report is based on incidents with known values, meaning that the actual total likely exceeds the known total of $1.77 billion.

This marks the first time tokenized gold has crossed the $1 billion threshold since March 2023, a period marked by a U.S. banking crisis that saw the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank , Silvergate’s voluntary liquidation , and the shutdown of Signature Bank by New York regulators . According to a report from CEX.io shared with Cryptonews.com, interest in tokenized gold began surging again in early February 2025, as fears of a renewed global trade war began impacting digital asset markets. Trump’s Tariffs Fuel Tokenized Gold Surge After January Announcement The impact of Trump’s tariffs, first announced on Jan. 20, has been especially pronounced in the tokenized gold sector. Paxos Gold (PAXG) trading volume has increased over 900%, Tether Gold (XAUT) is up more than 300%, and Kinesis Gold (KAU) has seen an astonishing 83,000% spike in activity. Collectively, tokenized gold projects have seen a 21% increase in market capitalization and a 1,000% jump in volume since Trump’s return to office. These digital gold assets fall under the broader real-world asset (RWA) tokenization trend, which involves minting financial instruments and physical goods—like real estate and art—on blockchain networks. While still early in development, RWAs like tokenized gold are gaining traction as investors look for diversification amid macroeconomic instability. President Trump issued an executive order on Crypto In the executive order, Dollar backed stablecoins will be promoted to protect the US Dollar. Telcoin is on track to become the first WEB3 firm to issue a fully regulated stablecoin called eUSD. My Thread … https://t.co/RPASN9BwJl pic.twitter.com/wAEqp6Lf6T — Angelica Saldaña S.T.B. (@AngelofYHVH) January 24, 2025 The surge in tokenized gold trading coincides with a record rally in physical gold prices , which hit an all-time high of $3,118 per ounce in late March. Year-to-date, gold is up over 18%, while Bitcoin has declined more than 12%, according to TradingView data. “Tokenized gold is emerging as one of the key diversification strategies among crypto-native users, alongside Bitcoin,” said Alexandr Kerya, VP of Product Management at CEX.IO. “It provides a safer and more stable approach to portfolio management, enabling users to stay within the crypto ecosystem while benefiting from the value and stability of the underlying physical asset.” As reported, cryptocurrency markets faced a brutal correction on what’s being dubbed “Black Monday,” with total liquidations exceeding $1.36 billion in the day. Crypto wasn’t alone in the selloff. U.S. stock futures also plunged Sunday night, heightening fears of a broader market crash. S&P 500 futures fell 5.98%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid 6.2%, and Dow futures dropped 5.5%, all pointing to a chaotic start to the trading week. Trump’s Trade Moves Trigger Renewed Flight to Stablecoins and Tokenized Assets Trump’s trade policies have reignited investor appetite for both stable and tokenized assets, mirroring the flight to safety seen during the 2023 banking crisis. As reported, Tether, the issuer of the world’s most traded stablecoin, is considering launching a U.S.-only version of its token if the Trump administration introduces favorable regulations to support domestic stablecoin development. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, said that discussions are underway with U.S. regulators regarding the framework for stablecoins.

Markets saw a mixed performance over the past 24 hours, with some altcoins trading in the green while others traded in the red. Solana (SOL) is trading at $116, up almost 2%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 1% at $0.157. Cardano (ADA) is up 1.10%, while Chainlink (LINK) is also marginally up over the past 24 hours.

Kaiko Report Highlights Q1 Difficulties Bitcoin (BTC) and other assets faced significant headwinds in Q1 2025 as global economic tensions and turmoil registered a marked increase. The year started positively, driven by market optimism about Donald Trump’s return to office and a supportive macroeconomic environment. However, markets soon began struggling with a significant drop in trading volume as investors retreated. According to a report by Kaiko, tariffs introduced by the Trump administration have contributed to the market’s increased volatility and the risk-off sentiment among investors. BTC, which rallied to record-breaking highs in January, is down over 25% from its peak. Meanwhile, Ethereum and other altcoins also saw declines after peaking in January, with AI tokens and meme coins posting average losses of over 50%. Weekly trading volumes for BTC, ETH, and other altcoins averaged $266 billion, down 30% from levels seen in 2024. The Kaiko report attributed the decline to a drop in offshore exchange activity and traders reducing exposure thanks to rapid market swings and uncertainty. The report also noted that US-based crypto exchanges maintained robust market depth despite selloffs, helping buffer the impact on Bitcoin’s liquidity. According to the report, platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and CEX.IO collectively made up 60% of BTC’s market depth in Q1. As a result, BTC could outperform several altcoins that were dealing with reduced demand and liquidity. The report also noted that such an environment favored large-cap assets, further highlighting BTC's resilience. “Altcoin volatility surged in early 2025, reaching multi-year or all-time highs for certain tokens, notably Cardano’s ADA. Bitcoin’s volatility also rose, from 34% in February to 51% in March, though it stayed below the peaks observed during last August’s carry trade unwinding. The growing volatility gap between Bitcoin and altcoins may discourage risk-averse traders from entering the market in the near future.” Trump Admits Tariff Problems President Donald Trump acknowledged that his tariff policy changes would be problematic but added that he pursued them because no one else had addressed the issues. Trump defended his trade strategy during a cabinet meeting, arguing it was a necessary correction despite the short-term strain. “The transition is difficult, but the end result will be positive.” President Trump has also not ruled out extending the 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariffs, stating that if he cannot secure favorable deals with US trading partners, tariffs will revert to higher rates after the pause. Trump’s remarks come amid growing concern among policymakers. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee has gone as far as to express concern about a return to economic conditions last seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Goolsbee warned that setbacks in investor sentiment could create broader risks for the economy. President Trump Removes Controversial Biden-Era IRS Rule President Donald Trump has signed a resolution that removes a controversial Biden-era IRS rule, approved towards the end of the Biden administration. The rule required DeFi platforms to track and report user activity and details, similar to traditional brokers. Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Carey of Ohio introduced a joint resolution to overturn the Internal Revenue Service rule, passed in December. Carey, who attended the resolution's signing on Thursday, said it was the first-ever crypto bill to be signed into law. “By repealing this misguided rule, President Trump and Congress have given the IRS an opportunity to return its focus to the duties and obligations it already owes to American taxpayers instead of creating a new series of bureaucratic hurdles.” The resolution also marks the first time a pro-crypto effort has cleared Congress. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives agreed to reverse the IRS action with strong bipartisan support, highlighting the sector’s strength in this Congress. This could be a positive sign for the industry as it increases the chances with more crucial matters, including legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has posted a marginal recovery after dropping below $80,000 on Thursday, falling to a low of $78,452 before settling at $79,592. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum after reaching $82,743 on Thursday, falling to move past the 20-day SMA. However, analysts remain uncertain about BTC’s trajectory thanks to market volatility driven by President Trump’s tariffs. While tariffs have been paused for 90 days, markets remain jittery thanks to several previous flip-flops on tariffs. Alexander Kuptsikevich, Senior Market Analyst at FxPro, stated, “Bitcoin (BTC) has temporarily recovered to $80,000, but the medium to long-term trend reversal remains uncertain. Bitcoin is currently approaching the upper end of the downtrend and is being tested to see if it can break out of the correction trend that has continued for the past two months.” Another analyst has suggested that if BTC breaks past $84,000, it could surge to the next resistance zone around $96,000. According to CryptoQuant analysis, BTC must reclaim $85,000 for bullish sentiment to return. “Bitcoin may face resistance at the $84,000 level. If it breaks through this resistance line, it could surge to the next resistance zone of $96,000. This price range initially acted as a support line at the beginning of this bull market, but if the upward trend slows, it could turn into a resistance line. The same pattern was repeated in past bear markets.” BTC registered a sharp jump last Tuesday, surging to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $82,525.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has recovered after dropping below $1,500 on Thursday as selling pressure wiped out significant gains made on Wednesday.

According to the analyst, ETH is approaching the -1 standard deviation pricing band based on Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands. The analyst stated that the -1 standard deviation pricing band is around $1,387, while ETH’s realized price is around $2,005.

Miners are capitulating at a time when Pi Coin price is struggling to regain its bullish momentum. As mining activity drops and miners and bearish headwinds from economic uncertainty intensify, can the Pi network token recover, or should traders brace for more declines? Let’s explore. Pi Network Price Analysis as Miners Capitulate Pi Network price trades at $0.603 today with a slight 1.8% gain in 24 hours. These gains follow a modest recovery across the broader crypto market, as Bitcoin price rebounded above $82,000. Analysts have now stated that Pi Network miners are giving up . One noted that they are likely capitulating because the already mined coins have not been moved to their wallets. He stated, Pi Coin Mining Miners are crucial to price stability and performance. If these stakeholders are exiting the network, it might fail to bode well for Pi Network price, as it shows reduced confidence in the future performance of this altcoin. At the same time, reduced mining activity could be a double-edged sword. This decline may spark a decline in the supply, which could be bullish for Pi Coin price . Pi Network Price Tracks Bitcoin Dr Altcoin believes that supply and mining activity will not be the only factor that will shape the Pi Network price forecast . He observed that Pi Coin has been tracking Bitcoin price, and would continue to do so until there is a surge in utility. PI/BTC Chart A previous Coingape article reported that Pi Coin’s usage is rising across the Asian market. This is after the token was adopted as a means of payment by a skincare brand in South Korea. Strategic partnership deals like the one with Banxa and Zito Realty in the US might also be a catalyst for Pi Coin price recovery. Pi Network Technical Analysis On the lower timeframe, Pi Network price is flashing bullish signs that hint toward possible recovery in the near term. The RSI has recorded a steady rise to 60 at press time, suggesting that bullish momentum is in play. The AO histogram bars also show that bulls are gaining strength. These bars are rising as buying activity builds, which indicates that the uptrend is gaining strength. For the Pi Network token to maintain the upward momentum, it first needs to flip the resistance level at $0.63. This will pave the way for an uptrend to $0.80. PI/USDT: 2-Hour Chart Therefore, the Pi Network price is at a pivotal point, with the reduced mining activity suggesting that crucial stakeholders are losing confidence. However, the 2-hour price chart hints at a possible recovery if Pi Coin can overcome resistance at $0.64 and possibly reach $1.

Assembly Bill A7788 , introduced by Assemblyman Clyde Vanel, seeks to amend state financial law to allow New York state agencies to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. It would permit state agencies to accept payments in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), according to the bill’s text. Source: Nysenate.gov According to the bill, state offices could authorize crypto payments for “fines, civil penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue, financial obligations or other amounts,” as well as penalties, special assessments and interest. Related: Trump’s tariff escalation exposes ‘deeper fractures’ in global financial system Cryptocurrency legislation is becoming a focal point in New York, with Bill A7788 marking the state’s second crypto-focused legislation in a little over a month. In March, New York introduced Bill A06515, aiming to establish criminal penalties to prevent cryptocurrency fraud and protect investors from rug pulls. Crypto-focused legislation has gathered momentum since President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, with Trump signaling during his campaign that his administration intends to make crypto policy a national priority , as well as making the US a global hub for blockchain innovation. Related: Illinois Senate passes crypto bill to fight fraud and rug pulls New York may mandate state “service fee” on crypto payments If passed, the bill would mark a significant shift in how New York handles digital assets. It would allow state entities to integrate cryptocurrency into the payment infrastructure used for collecting public funds. The proposal also includes a clause allowing the state to impose a service fee on those choosing to pay with crypto. According to the text, the state may require “a service fee not exceeding costs incurred by the state in connection with the cryptocurrency payment transaction.” This could include transaction costs or fees owed to crypto issuers. Assembly Bill A7788 has been referred to the Assembly Committee for review and may advance to the state Senate as the next step.

Blockchain platforms that rely on international cooperation, such as CHZ, may be impacted by this. CHZ may experience slower uptake or delays in establishing agreements with non-US sports organizations if trade tensions increase. Platforms like Chiliz stand to gain from the temporary 90-day tariff respite for 75 nations, which may also increase demand for CHZ by fostering a more advantageous international collaboration climate. Furthermore, yesterday saw a huge pump in Bitcoin, which frequently portends a favorable trend for altcoins. Altcoins like CHZ may see a price comeback if investor interest in them increases as a result of a rising Bitcoin (BTC) price. The movement of BTC and these changes in international trade contribute to the unpredictable mix that affects CHZ’s price in April 2025.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including CHZ , please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the CHZ token. Will Chiliz go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the CHZ token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for CHZ price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low CHZ can go. Should I invest in Chiliz? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any CHZ price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the CHZ token.",Predictions|Prediction,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CHZ,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-11 11:56:38

One of those is pseudonymous crypto analyst NotWojak, who took to the TradingView website to share a rather bullish prediction for the Ethereum price that goes contrary to the current market sentiment. Bearish Ethereum Price Downtrend Coming To An End The Ethereum price is still stuck in an apparent downtrend. However, according to the crypto analyst, this could be ending anytime soon with two supply zones coming up. So far, there have been multiple liquidity sweeps across major levels, sending the Ethereum price towards lower lows. Nevertheless, this could turn bullish soon as they could suggest a reversal is coming for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: This Crypto Analyst Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash At $97,000, He Just Released Another Forecast Currently, the two supply zones called out by the analyst are the $1,425 and $1,600 level. As they explain, the $1,425 level has already been mitigated during the latest retracement. So, this leaves only the $1,600 level unmitigated. As such, this could easily turn this level into resistance in the event of an uptrend. Despite sellers still dominating currently with high volumes pouring into the market, the crypto analyst puts the bottom before $1,350. In this case, this level could be potential support and the breakout could begin from here. The target for this major breakout has been placed 20% above the current level, with the analyst setting a high $1,835 target. This could lead to further upside, especially if resistances are easily cleared from here. ETH On-Chain Ethereum’s profitability has plummeted with the price decline as only 32% of all investors are seeing any profit on their positions. On the other side, 65% of all holders are in losses and only 2% are sitting at breakeven price, according to data from the on-chain data aggregation website, IntoTheBlock. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Rounded Bottom Within Descending Channel, Target Set Above $3 Ethereum whales have also been very active during this time and this could mean that large investors have been behind the selling that has crashed the ETH price. Large transactions rose from $4.8 billion to $6.48 billion by April 9 as the Ethernet price dropped back below $1,500. Average transaction size also grew during the this time from $4,048 to $5,415. This suggests that investors are moving more coins at the time, which could explain the increased selling that has plagued the cryptocurrency. If this continues, then the ETH price could see further crashes from here. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price was trending at $1,544, down 4.56% in the last day.

Meanwhile, this comes as the crypto holds the $2 support despite recent volatile trading. Besides, amid the ongoing speculations, a renowned analyst has predicted a potential rally for the token ahead to $19, especially amid the soaring buzz after the recent successful US ETF launch. XRP News: Ripple’s 200 Million Move Fuels Speculations Leading on-chain transaction tracker Whale Alert reported that Ripple shifted 200 million XRP recently, worth around $402.78 million, to an unknown address. The transaction was made from Ripple’s wallet, identified by the wallet address “rBg2F…1o91m”, and was sent to an unknown recipient address “rP4X2…sKxv3”. Meanwhile, such high-volume transfers typically fuel investor concerns and curiosity. Some speculate Ripple could be preparing for strategic positioning in anticipation of regulatory clarity. Others suggest the transfer might be linked to OTC trades or internal wallet management. However, there are no official comments on this latest XRP news. However, the timing of this move also coincides with recent legal developments in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, adding another layer of speculation to the event. Ripple Vs SEC Case Update In another latest XRP news, Ripple and the US SEC have submitted a joint legal filing. As per the filing, both parties have requested the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to pause the ongoing proceedings. This comes after the settlement of the major parts of the XRP lawsuit. If granted, the motion could give Ripple more flexibility and time to navigate its next legal and business steps. The request to keep the appeal “in abeyance” indicates both parties are aiming for a smoother closure pending final court approval. Notably, this move may also influence institutional sentiment, especially following the recent ETF-related excitement. XRP ETF Success Aids In Price Surge: Rally To Sustain? The first XRP ETF has noted a successful launch in the US this week, which has sparked market optimism. Amid this, XRP price has jumped about 1% in the last 24 hours to reach $2.01. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.03 and $1.93, respectively, reflecting the volatile scenario in the market. Besides, the active addresses holding Ripple’s native asset has also touched a new high recently. This indicates that more investors are shifting their attention towards the asset. What’s Next? However, amid this, renowned expert EGRAG CRYPTO said that the XRP price may hit $19 or even $45, citing historical trends. According to the expert, if XRP mimics the 2017 or 2021 cycle, it can rally by 2700% or 1,050% to hit $45 or $19, respectively. This also comes after the expert highlighted the XRP/BTC chart and said that the crypto could hit $22 if BTC rallies to a new ATH ahead.

The bears did try to drag the price below the range for two consecutive days but failed, with the price reclaiming $120 in no time. Since then, the price has been consolidating around the gains, aiming to reclaim the crucial resistance at $125, which could clear the path to $135. With this, the SOL price could probably rise above the bearish influence, but if the selling pressure mounts, the token may face a significant setback. Solana was one of the most exposed tokens after FTT following the collapse of the FTX exchange back in 2022. The SOL price faced a massive pullback and dropped to a single-digit figure from the highs above $240 following a huge uncertainty over the token. However, the token rebounded finely and surged close to $300, forming a new ATH. In a new update ahead of FTX’s repayment program scheduled for May, the exchange has unstaked large amounts of SOL, raising concerns over the upcoming price action. The FTX exchange has just unstaked over 186,000 SOL worth nearly $22 million, which may push the price into a decisive phase. Although unstaking does not directly mean dumping, as the creditors may certainly not sell out their holding as soon as they get it, some probability of a pullback remains higher. Currently, no major price change is seen as the market sentiment remains bullish after the Bitcoin price climbed back above $81,000. Should you be worried about the SOL price rally? The SOL price in the short term is trading within an ascending triangle and is testing the upper resistance zone between $119.54 and $120.84. The RSI is rising while the Stochastic RSI has entered the overbought zone. Therefore, this carries some possibility of a pullback but as long as RSI maintains a strong ascending trend, the Solana price is believed to maintain a strong upswing and test the higher targets mentioned above.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 12:14:35

Binance has waived listing fees for these assets. These tokens were previously available on Binance Alpha, the exchange’s experimental token market, but will be removed from Alpha once they are listed on the main spot market. Users are encouraged to transfer their assets from Binance Alpha to their Spot Accounts. All three tokens will be listed with a Seed Tag, indicating that they represent innovative projects with higher volatility and risk. Binance applies Seed Tags to newly launched or early-stage crypto projects to ensure users are more vigilant.

On Friday, April 11, the CEX announced its ‘Vote To List’ results, which appear to have prompted numerous trading pair listings. As a result, crypto market participants now expect price gains in these assets, given that market exposure increases remarkably with listing on a globally leading CEX. Binance Unveils ONDO, VIRTUAL, & BIGTIME Listings Binance’s official announcement revealed that the exchange will list ONDO, VIRTUAL, and BIGTIME tokens following the ‘Vote To List’ event held on the platform. The following trading pairs will be available for users starting April 11 at 14:00 UTC. New Spot Trading Pairs: ONDO/USDT ONDO/USDC BIGTIME/USDT BIGTIME/USDC VIRTUAL/USDT VIRTUAL/USDC The listing fee is set at 0 BNB, offering additional market support to the tokens. Besides, it’s also worth mentioning that these assets are already available on Binance Alpha, an early-stage and pre-listing crypto platform. Further, the top crypto exchange added that “The 3 tokens were selected based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors,” including historical performance, trading demand, and risk assessment, among other things. The ‘Seed Tag’ will be applied next to these assets, highlighting their risky and volatile nature, per the announcement. Will Prices Rally? The broader crypto market sentiment remains uncertain at the moment, primarily due to Donald Trump’s tariffs saga. However, the Binance listing appears to have sparked some investor curiosity over the aforementioned tokens and their future prices. Historically, listings on top exchanges have ignited price rallies, offering bullish support to prices. At the time of reporting, ONDO price soared 5% amid its listing and closed in at $0.8819. VIRTUAL price also surged by 15% to $0.5319. Lastly, BIGTIME price witnessed a 25% uptick and exchanged hands at $0.07553. All the mentioned tokens are currently witnessing a price upswing in tandem with new listings. However, it’s worth mentioning that the pump may be short-lived due to broader trends putting pressure on prices. CoinGape recently reported that Binance listed Babylon (BABY) , which triggered a brief price rally for the token. However, BABY’s price soon crashed from a high of $0.12 to the $0.09 level despite its listing. In the wake of this saga, traders and investors remain cautious about investments in the tokens.

A widening of credit spreads is an increase in the difference between the yields on corporate bonds and government securities, which usually indicates increased risk in the economy. When investors demand a higher risk premium, it often portends slower economic growth or a recession. ”It is too early to expect bullish momentum,” the analyst emphasized. Short-term challenges amid long-term opportunities While the long-term effects of the recession could be positive for bitcoin due to the monetary easing that usually follows a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, Thielen warned of possible difficulties before the cryptocurrency finds positive momentum. ”Bitcoin usually falls first when China devalues the yuan or the Fed cuts rates, as the first decline may not be as significant and also confirms the weakness of the economy,” Thielen explained. White House adviser on cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence David Sacks announced on April 10 on Platform X that ”it's time for a rate cut” after the core consumer price index rose 2.8 percent year-over-year for March, the lowest since March 2021. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool shows a 64.8% probability of no rate cut at the Federal Open Market Committee's May meeting of the Fed. Historical patterns and current trends Traders typically view falling interest rates and expanding money supply as factors positively impacting asset prices, especially bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, Thielen noted that historically, when annualized credit spreads ”start to widen,” bitcoin often faces additional selling pressure and takes longer to recover. ”This pattern indicates that while there may be opportunities in the long term, bitcoin will continue to be under pressure in the near term,” Thielen said. He added that currency devaluations have also historically had a negative impact on markets in the short term before becoming positive in the long term. These observations come amid growing concerns among market participants about a weakening U.S. dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) stands at 100.337, marking a drop of 2.92% over the past five days, according to TradingView. Analyst resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote on April 10 on Platform X: ”The U.S. dollar has left the room. Something broke again.” Meanwhile, BlackRock's head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick said in late March that bitcoin would thrive in a recession. ”I don't know if there will be a recession or not, but a recession would be a powerful catalyst for bitcoin,” said Mitchnick. Economic uncertainty and a weakening dollar create a challenging backdrop for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin's long-term prospects remain positive, but investors should be prepared for possible volatility in the near future.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-11 12:22:04

Bitcoin is around 4% up so far, and some of the leading altcoins are really outperforming. $SOL, $KAS, and $SONIC are among the leaders. $SOL nudges through descending trendline Source: TradingView The $SOL price can be seen to just be nudging its way through the descending trendline that goes all the way back to the $294 all-time high in mid-January of this year. The last-ditch support at $94 was retested by a candle wick, and how the price is settling above the $112 horizontal support. If the bulls can maintain this surge and force the price through the trendline, the very tough $122 resistance is only just overhead. $SOL close to a definitive breakout Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly timeframe, it can be noted just how close to a definitive breakout, and a change in trend, that the $SOL price is. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the blue indicator line crossed above the orange, so once these rise up, upside price momentum will not be far off. $KAS breaks out Source: TradingView The $KAS price has broken through the descending trendline. Also, it is not that far from making a higher high at $0.083. If it does so, the path is clear to the major resistance step at $0.10. $KAS forming a W bottoming pattern Source: TradingView As is the case for $BTC , the $KAS price is forming a W bottoming pattern. If this pattern plays out for Bitcoin, it might be imagined that it would also occur for $KAS. Two potential W patterns for $SONIC Source: TradingView The $SONIC price has been up as much as 23% so far on Friday, although it has dipped back down to around 15% currently. Looking at the daily chart above, it can be seen that there is a W pattern forming on a horizontal as well as an angled plane. If the $SONIC bulls can push the price up above $0.35, and then $0.43, there is not much resistance until $0.70. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It plans to divide digital assets into two categories so that it could be regulated better and aims to make crypto rules more effective and easier to apply. The agency demands public feedback on the proposal before finalizing it and is open to opinions and suggestion until May 10, 2025. Two-Tier System It has proposed a two-tier system based on how funds are distributed. Under Type 1 are the tokens used for business or in raising funds for the parent project. This also includes altcoins from budding projects that still need funding to grow. Some utility tokens fall into this category. Under Type 2 are the more established and decentralized tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum that do not issue tokens to raise funds for their Business. The assets are subject to different set of regulations based on which category they fall, suiting different features. Type 1: Focus On Disclosure The FSA emphasized that for Type 1 crypto assets (which are used for business or fundraising), the projects have to clearly explain their plan to use the raised funds. The goal is to protect investors by ensuring that there is more transparency and accountability in the projects. Therefore the Type 1 token issuers would need to disclose in details about the purpose, project details and the risks associated in investing. They are also expected to follow FSA rules, including regular disclosure requirements. Once the Type 1 crypto assets gain large number of investors, then the projects will be evaluated to check if they could be subject to security token regulations. The FSA will not be dealing directly with the issuers of Type 1 crypto projects as it’s hard to identify a specific issuer. The Financial Services Agency stated that “with regard to type 1 cryptoassets, there is a strong need to eliminate the information asymmetry between issuers and users regarding the purpose of use of the raised funds and the content of the project, etc.” Type 2 to be Regulated Through Exchanges It plans to regulate Type 2 crypto assets through crypto exchanges. Exchanges need to report major price fluctuations that could impact the market. The committee also plans to continue reviewing while considering the public feedback and how other countries are regulating crypto. The paper outlines key financial issues focusing on disclosures, business conduct, guidelines for entering the market and prevent inside trading. However it does not touch upon crypto taxes. Japan’s Changing Stance on Crypto Japan, which once used to be more restrictive, is now changing its stance towards crypto. In a major move, the regulators are also considering lifting the ban on crypto ETFs which has sparked excitement in the community. The agency also aims to revise the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by 2026, where cryptocurrencies will longer be viewed as just payment tools, instead its own financial product category.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-11 12:24:37

The upgrade marks a shift from Onyx’s existing Layer 3 rollup to a standalone Layer 1 blockchain, with promises of improved scalability, security, and performance. One of the more notable claims associated with Goliath is its potential to match, or even exceed the transaction speeds of traditional payment networks like Visa, which processes around 24,000 transactions per second (TPS). While the mainnet utilizes a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism that could, in theory, support significantly higher throughput, achieving that performance in a decentralized environment remains a considerable technical hurdle. At press time, XCN is trading at $0.022, with a 136% gain over the past seven days. The recent rally follows a volatile start to 2025, during which XCN surged more than 1,500% in just two weeks to a peak of $0.035. XCN one-day and one-week price chart.

The token now leads crypto market gains after breaking back into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. XCN on-chain activity and trading volume surge post-launch XCN’s rally has coincided with a surge in both trading volume and user activity. On April 11, the token logged 3,902 daily active addresses and a trading volume of $591 million, marking a notable uptick in engagement following the Goliath Mainnet launch.

The OI-weighted funding rate for XCN stood at -0.5648% as of April 11, according to CoinGlass , a sign that short sellers remain dominant. This may lead to increased volatility in the short term, especially if long traders are forced to exit positions abruptly.

Long-Term Holders Start Selling as Price Recovers,https://cryptonews.com/news/are-ethereum-whales-giving-up-long-term-holders-start-selling-as-price-recovers/,"The return of risk-on sentiment has sparked a recovery, but many still question Ethereum as a “best crypto to buy” contender, with long-term holders offloading at a loss. As global investment markets rallied on Trump’s 90-day “tariff war” pause, the front-running altcoin saw a 24% surge during Wednesday trading to a $1695 peak. While this policy shift opened the door to fresh liquidity, sentiment quickly cooled. A likely “sell-the-news” event has since dragged Ethereum back to $1550. Now down over 60% from its post-election rally highs, ETH is seeing capitulation trades from holders looking to limit further downside. Long-Term Holders Enter Capitulation Mode Long-term Ethereum holders have now entered what’s commonly referred to as “capitulation” mode—a stage when even the most patient investors begin to fold under pressure. Ethereum long-term holder Net Unrealise Profit/Loss (NUPL). Source: Ali Martinez / X. With the multi-month free fall, many investors have already exited positions, while others remain sidelined waiting for clarity. Still, some see opportunity. According to popular analyst Ali Martinez, this could present a rare window for contrarian buyers. “For those watching risk-reward dynamics, this phase has historically marked prime accumulation zones,” he shared on X .

This breakdown breaches the lower boundary of a massive symmetrical triangle pattern—a final line of defense before deeper losses set in. While much of these losses have already materialized, the next key support sits at $1,050. That marks a potential 30% slide before substantial buying pressure is likely to return. While much of the downside has already played out, the next key support lies at $1,050, leaving room for a potential 30% slide before meaningful demand returns. This scenario holds weight, with the MACD line accelerating its move away from the signal line, underscoring dominant selling pressure. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has hit the oversold threshold at 30—a sign of seller exhaustion—a pronounced reversal seems slim without conviction from buyers. Instead, a short-term consolidation around the immediate $1,525 support level—seems the most probable outcome without any fresh market catalysts. Keep Your Eyes on This New ICO Before the Bull Market Returns Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially as the altcoin market continues to fall. While Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting BTC highs of $1 million by 2030, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $4.5 million raised in its initial few months, the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 91% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

The DXY index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed-world currencies like the euro, sterling, and Japanese yen, dropped to $99—down 10% from its highest point this year. This crash came after China announced its retaliatory tariffs against the United States. All US goods entering the country will now face a universal 125% tariff. Beijing made this announcement after the US imposed a 145% levy on most Chinese goods. As such, the retaliation signals that the game of chicken will continue, with Trump likely to respond in kind. The ongoing crash in the US dollar index may benefit risk assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins. That’s because a weaker US dollar typically pushes investors toward Bitcoin, which is often viewed as a store of value due to its 21 million supply cap. You might also like: Goldman Sachs scraps recession forecast as Trump pauses tariffs Further, Bitcoin and most altcoins are primarily traded against either the US dollar or Tether ( USDT ), a stablecoin backed by the greenback. As a result, a falling dollar may make Bitcoin appear cheaper and more attractive. Bitcoin and altcoin prices may benefit if the Fed slashes rates The ongoing US dollar index crash is happening as investors remain concerned that the US may be heading towards a recession. A Polymarket poll places the odds of a recession in the US this year at 63%, while Kalshi’s odds are a bit higher at 65%. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s, also put the odds of a recession at 60%, citing high tariffs as a major contributing factor. With US inflation falling , there is increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve may intervene by cutting rates this year. Odds of an emergency rate cut have risen to 31% on Polymarket, while traders anticipate three cuts over the course of the year. Bitcoin and altcoins tend to thrive when the Fed is cutting interest rates and when the US dollar index is declining. For instance, crypto prices surged during the pandemic, as the dollar index fell to $89.25 and the Fed implemented several rate cuts. The weakening dollar partially explains why Bitcoin and other altcoins held steady on Friday. Bitcoin was trading at $82,000, while XRP hovered at $2.

At this point, John Bollinger said that Bitcoin Bollinger bands are trying to form a double bottom formation, but this has not been confirmed yet. Following the sharp declines, John Bollinger said that Bitcoin may be forming a classic “W” bottom pattern based on the %b indicator. The %b indicator measures the closing price of an asset based on its position within the Bollinger Bands. This means that Bitcoin has formed a bottom according to the Bollinger Bands. “According to Bollinger Bands, a classic W bottom is forming in the Bitcoin/USD trading pair. However, this still needs confirmation. Because Bollinger Bands on both the weekly and daily time frames show that a trend reversal has not yet occurred.” While confirmation is still needed, it could signal a potential price recovery, according to Bollinger. “W” bottoms occur when prices make a higher low and touch the lower band. Experienced analyst Timothy Peterson also shared his expectations for Bitcoin, predicting that Bitcoin could only rise after stocks find their bottom. *This is not investment advice.

While most assets display resilience following the relief rallies, Helium (HNT) extended its gains in the past 24 hours. HNT soared from a 24-hour low of $2.59 to $3.04, a 17.37% price increase. The substantial uptrends emerged after Noval Labs, the developer behind the Helium Network, scored a major legal win. According to Helium’s latest blog , the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has officially closed allegations that Helium ecosystem tokens, HNT, MOBILE, and IOT, violated securities laws. Helium🎈 @helium · Follow Today marks a major win for Helium and The People’s Network! The SEC has agreed to dismiss its unregistered securities claims with prejudice.

SEC ends lawsuit against Helium Network In a massive win for crypto and decentralized wireless initiatives, the SEC has ended a lawsuit claiming that Nova Labs sold unlicensed securities. With the case officially closed, the regulator will no longer consider HNT, MOBILE, and IOT tokens as securities. That means Helium hotspots and asset distribution are now legal. The dismissal alleviated regulatory challenges that have hindered Helium’s token adoption and ecosystem expansion. Moreover, the decision underscored the shifting regulatory landscape under Trump’s administration. Helium’s team stated: We that the new leadership at the SEC for finally providing clarity and look forward to a new era where innovation can truly thrive. With this chapter finally closed, Helium and the community can now move forward with full confidence, accelerating adoption and real-world innovation in decentralized wireless and crypto-powered infrastructure. HNT price prediction HNT/USD saw a swift price jump after the announcement, soaring from $2.59 to $3.04. That represents a significant rebound from the alt’s latest lows and indicates optimism in the project following the SEC’s move. HNT changes hands at $2.92 after a slight retracement from its daily peaks. Chart by Coinmarketcap The surging 24-hour trading volume highlights renewed investor interest in the token. Amidst the bullish price actions, AgentXBT highlighted key levels to watch for HNT’s price movements. The analyst observed Helium’s bullishness, fueled by surged buying pressure from institutional players. The daily chart shows that HNT’s latest rebound occurred at a crucial support barrier of $2.60 – $2.70. Reclaiming the support at $2.99 could support a decisive closing beyond $3.0. Such a move will attract more buyers to open the paths towards higher targets of $3.27, $3.39, and $3.48. Source – AgentXBT on X That would mean an approximately 20% surge from HNT’s current price of $2.92. However, enthusiasts should watch for potential challenges to the anticipated rally. While near-term indicators flash optimistic signals, HNT trades below the vital 200-day MA, confirming bear dominance in long-term trends. Further, broad market sentiments are vital for shaping Helium’s trajectory. Cryptocurrencies seem indecisive after the latest rebound, as Bitcoin appears stuck between $80k and $82k. HNT should break and sustain above $2.99 and $3.27 to extend its recoveries. Failure to do that could see the token revising support barrier at $2.84 and $2.70. Losing $2.60 will postpone Helium’s anticipated rally in the near term.

According to a recent research paper , the new design claims to allow the deployment of complex smart contracts on Bitcoin in a more capital-efficient manner. The new system may also be vastly more efficient from a computing standpoint. ColliderVM is a protocol designed to enable stateful computation on Bitcoin, allowing multi-step processes to be securely executed over multiple transactions. Traditionally, Bitcoin script output is not accessible to other scripts, making complex calculations nearly impossible. The researchers argue that ColliderVM could allow the use of Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (STARKs) — a type of zero-knowledge proof — on Bitcoin without requiring consensus-level changes to the network. The architecture would let Bitcoin verify complex offchain computations with minimal onchain data. ColliderVM targets Bitcoin limitations Each Bitcoin block can contain up to 4 million OPCodes (commands) across all transactions, and a single Bitcoin script can contain up to 1,000 stack elements (data entries). Furthermore, stateless execution means that each script executes without memory of previous state or intermediate computations from earlier transactions, making complex computations impractical. The BitVM implementation from a 2023 paper by Robin Linus from Bitcoin research firm ZeroSync allowed for complex smart contracts on Bitcoin but required fraud proofs. Fraud proofs are cryptographic proofs that prove a particular transaction or computation was performed incorrectly, possibly triggering corrective actions. Fraud-proof implementation typically requires operators to front capital for potential corrective actions. In BitVM, operators pay an advance to cover potentially fraudulent transactions, recovering the capital after the fraud-proof window closes. The new system is also more efficient from a computing point of view, compared with previous implementations, but still expensive. Previous implementations used cryptographic one-time signatures ( Lamport and Winternitz ) that were notably computationally heavy. ColliderVM draws from the November 2024 ColliderScript paper by researchers from StarkWare, web services firm Cloudflare and Bitcoin sidechain developer Blockstream. This system relies on a hash collision-based commitment setting a challenge to produce an input that, when run through a hash function, produces an output with pre-determined features. Related: A beginner’s guide to the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade This setup requires significantly fewer computing resources from honest operators than from malicious actors. Computational resources needed by honest and malicious actors depending on collision difficulty. Source: ColliderVM paper Hash, but no food or weed A hash is a non-reversible mathematical function that can be run on arbitrary data, producing a fixed-length alphanumeric string. Non-reversible means that it is impossible to run the computation in reverse to obtain the original data from a hash. This results in a sort of data ID identifying data to the bit, without containing any underlying data. Hash function examples. Source: Wikimedia This system — somewhat resembling Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining — requires significantly fewer hash operations compared to BitVM, reducing both script size and processing time. ColliderVM researchers claim to have reduced the number of those operations even further, by at least a factor of 10,000. The researchers seemingly suggest that this implementation is nearly making a STARKs-based Bitcoin sidechain practical. The paper reads: “We estimate that the Bitcoin script length for STARK proof verification becomes nearly practical, allowing it to be used alongside other, pairing-based proof systems common today in applications.” STARKs are a ZK-proof system recognized for their scalability and trustless nature (no trusted setup is needed). ZK-proofs are a cryptographic system that allows users to prove a particular feature of a piece of data without revealing the underlying data. Many early ZK-proof systems necessitated a one-time secure setup that relied on “toxic waste” data. If a party were to keep hold of the toxic waste, it would allow them to forge signatures and generate fraudulent proofs. STARKs do not rely on such a setup, making them trustless. Traditional implementation of STARK verifiers would require scripts that exceed Bitcoin’s limits. Now, researchers behind ColliderVM argue that their more efficient system approaches make an onchain verification script for STARK-proofs “nearly practical.” Related: Bitcoin sidechains will drive BTCfi growth Bitcoin-based trustless sidechains? Bitcoin is widely considered the most secure and reliable blockchain , but its critics raise issues with its feature set being significantly more limited when compared to many altcoins. Sidechains such as Blockstream’s Liquid exist, but are not trustless. Director of research at blockchain firm Blockstream and mathematician Andrew Poelstra told Cointelegraph as far back as 2020 that ZK-proof-based systems are “one of the most exciting areas of development ” in the cryptography space. Cypherpunk, a developer cited in the Bitcoin white paper and Blockstream founder, explained in a 2014 paper that more work was needed to implement trustless ZK-proof-based sidechains on Bitcoin. Still, even 10 years later, a system based on ColliderVM would be trust-minimized rather than trustless. This is because users would still need to trust that at least a minimal subset of network participants will act honestly to ensure the correct functioning of the system. The study’s lead authors include Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of StarkWare, along with researchers Lior Goldberg and Ben Fisch. Ben-Sasson is one of the original developers of STARKs and has long advocated for the use of zero-knowledge proofs to improve blockchain scalability. In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, StarkWare co-founder Ben-Sasson noted that a real Bitcoin layer-2 solution would need to have “the security of Bitcoin itself.” Instead, current solutions rely on trust in signers or fraud-proof-based economic incentives. Still, he recognized the Lightning Network: “We should also acknowledge there’s, of course, today, lightning networks, which have the security of Bitcoin.“ Magazine: ‘Bitcoin layer 2s’ aren’t really L2s at all: Here’s why that matters",,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-11 13:13:05

Congratulations on the strong performance of your cryptocurrency. With so many RWA projects in the space, what made MANTRA stand out? Thank you! We’re proud of MANTRA ( OM ) momentum and the growing recognition in the RWA space. What sets MANTRA apart is our commitment to building a fully compliant, end-to-end ecosystem for real-world asset tokenization and trading. Our permissionless chain was designed from the beginning to meet regulatory standards. We recently secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), authorizing us to operate as a Virtual Asset Exchange. This positions MANTRA as one of the most regulatory-compliant platforms in the RWA sector today. Beyond compliance, we’re driving real-world adoption through strategic partnerships – most notably with DAMAC Group , recently committing to tokenize more than US$1 billion in Dubai real estate. Unlike projects that focus on just one piece of the RWA puzzle, MANTRA is building a comprehensive ecosystem – from asset tokenization to exchange infrastructure and investment services.

The MEF will operate with an open-arms policy, welcoming projects at any developmental stage globally with a particular focus on RWA’s and DeFi. Applications can be made with just a one pager through our portal and we’re interested in meeting teams that are building in categories that include; lending and borrowing, asset management, trading and exchanges, infrastructure and tools and derivatives and synthetics. How will MANTRA ensure that the fund’s investments align with its commitment to regulatory compliance and security, given the complexities of tokenizing real-world assets? The MEF will only invest in teams that share a similar commitment to compliance and security that we do. Truly scalable adoption for us, and anyone building in RWA, only comes through a compliance and regulatory orientation. We think it is a prerequisite in achieving PMF therefore, that teams adhere as tightly as we do. We will lend our expertise and network to ensure teams are sufficiently positioned for the challenges they will face in this vertical. Many blockchain projects have launched ecosystem funds in the past with limited success. How do you plan to ensure that projects in your fund do well? We are taking a very differentiated approach from previous ecosystem funds, one we believe will mitigate that. Firstly, most ecosystem funds refuse to accept that we live in a multi-chain world. The result is that they only work with teams that will exclusively partner with them on the infrastructure layer side. This constrains the variety of the teams that funds can work with. By acknowledging this, this means we can work with teams across ecosystems, and thus can pick from a more diverse range of applications. We want to work with much fewer teams, and make larger resourced bets. This way we believe teams will be properly invested in us and our commitment, as we are them. The second difference is that we are trying to make fundamental, high-conviction bets. This differentiates from other approaches, that issue small cheques, that don’t result in any meaningful or fruitful relationship for either partner. We’re saying that from day zero, we are looking to be long-term partners with those in the MEF. Aiding not just on the infrastructure side but on set up, distribution, press, and so on.

What unique challenges do you see in bridging traditional finance with DeFi through RWAs, and how is MANTRA addressing them? The biggest challenge MANTRA faces, in its singular pursuit of being the blockchain infrastructure partner of asset issuers and managers globally, is getting these traditional institutions educated with a new technology stack, its benefits and risks; and arguably most importantly, getting our technology working with them, in a way that is compliant and regulatory oriented. We have found that traditional institutions fully understand the benefits of tokenization, and are compelled by the various operational and cost efficiency gains. But there has been hesitancy on regulation and compliance from other possible infrastructure partners (L1s/L2s). That is precisely why we designed our L1 in the way we did, with compliance and regulation at its very core. We have designed not just our tech stack, but the fabric of our firm, from our staff to our pursuit of top-tier licensing/regulatory status, so we are an obvious day 0 partner to any financial institution. We work in lock-step with our institutional partners, to address all the unique challenges that come with tokenizing a broad spectrum of assets, across different classes and jurisdictions. What is the progress on your partnership with DAMAC? When can we see tangible results on this? Our partnership with DAMAC to tokenize more than $1 billion of assets spanning real estate, hospitality, data centers, and other critical sectors has already begun. We look forward to sharing more details soon. How do you see the RWA tokenization market evolving over the next decade, and what role does MANTRA aim to play in shaping that future? Just like the wider industry, we’ll see evolution come from adoption, with adoption coming from regulation and a collective composed of both institutional players and passionate builders. We believe in an open-arms and source approach when it comes to regulation. T his means working alongside regulators, like we did with VARA to obtain the first Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Licence, to draft regulations that suit both parties. We’ll continue to do this as we enter new markets. The next part is assisting others seeking to enter those regions and jurisdictions we already have, by sharing our learnings.

Investors Are Already Piling Into This Other ICO",https://cryptonews.com/news/will-shib-miss-the-next-1000-rally-investors-are-already-piling-into-this-other-ico/,"SHIB has risen by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, with its drop to $0.00001199 coming as the crypto market as a whole falls by the same percentage today. Despite the market’s recent lift in response to Trump’s 90-day pause on higher tariffs , SHIB also remains down by 3.5% in a week, by 9% in a fortnight and by 57% in a year. These are disappointing percentages for a token that was the thirteenth-biggest by market cap this time last year , with SHIB since falling down to 21st amid a relative loss of interest and growing competition. But while it looks like SHIB’s days of stratospheric gains may be over, newer coins are appearing to fill the void it has left, with new ERC-20 token SUBBD raising over $100,000 in the first week of its presale. Will SHIB Miss the Next 1,000% Rally? SHIB’s chart is now in an interesting position, given that its indicators look like they’ve begun to show signs of a recovery. Having touched an oversold 30 a few days ago, its RSI (purple) is currently rising towards 50, a clear sign of growing buying pressure. Meanwhile, its 30-day average (orange) looks like it may flatten out, something which could mark the beginning of a rise towards the 200-day average (blue). Source: TradingView Given that SHIB has been in an oversold position since the middle of December, it really is overdue a big rebound. Yet there are two things worth bearing in mind, with the first being that SHIB is dependent, like the rest of the market, on the development of the ongoing tariff situation. If the US can negotiate trade-friendly deals with (or completely drop tariffs on) most countries, then the market will almost certainly continue the recovery it potentially began today. Europe is ready to negotiate with the US. We have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods. Because we're always ready for a good deal. But we’re also prepared to respond with countermeasures. And protect ourselves against indirect effects through trade diversion. pic.twitter.com/hpZ77TXH4B — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) April 7, 2025 However, if the situation worsens again, we may see SHIB fall even further. On top of this, there’s an argument that SHIB has been suffering from a long-term decline for a couple of years now, with efforts to provide it with more utility falling short. We have seen the launch of its own layer-two Shibarium in August 2023 , as well as the launch of several Shiba Inu-themed games . Yet such developments haven’t done enough to keep SHIB in the top 20, implying that the market is becoming less interested in the coin over time. As such, while an improvement in macroeconomic conditions may see it return to $0.0000150 in the next few weeks, it’s doubtful whether it’s going to experience a true market-beating rally this year. Investors Are Already Piling Into This Other ICO Yet one coin with the opportunity to outpace market averages is SUBBD (SUBBD), an ERC-20 token that launched is very own presale last week. It has already raised just over $140,000 in this sale, providing an early sign of how popular it could become.

And what’s interesting about SUBBD is that its platform will use AI-based tools to make content creation more efficient for users. It will offer an AI personal assistant to users to help them with content creation, including the generation of ideas, advice and even content itself. In addition, its use of crypto and blockchain will help creators monetize their content in a way that hasn’t been possible with legacy platforms. This includes creating NFTs for particular videos and posts, as well as providing more transparent and automated payouts. All of this gives SUBBD the potential to become the next big content creation platform, with another early sign of popularity being the fact that its X account already has 125,000 followers . $SUBBD PRESALE IS LIVE – Investors, This Is BIG!!! $100K+ raised & counting! $SUBBD is disrupting an $85B market with AI & Web3.

New York bill proposes legalizing Bitcoin, crypto for state payments Assembly Bill A7788 , introduced by Assemblyman Clyde Vanel, seeks to amend state financial law to allow New York state agencies to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. It would permit state agencies to accept payments in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), according to the bill’s text. Source: Nysenate.gov According to the bill, state offices could authorize crypto payments for “fines, civil penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue, financial obligations or other amounts,” as well as penalties, special assessments and interest. Cryptocurrency legislation is becoming a focal point in New York, with Bill A7788 marking the state’s second crypto-focused legislation in a little over a month. In March, New York introduced Bill A06515, aiming to establish criminal penalties to prevent cryptocurrency fraud and protect investors from rug pulls. Crypto-focused legislation has gathered momentum since President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, with Trump signaling during his campaign that his administration intends to make crypto policy a national priority , as well as making the US a global hub for blockchain innovation. Trump signs resolution killing IRS DeFi broker rule US President Donald Trump signed a joint congressional resolution on April 10 that overturned a Biden-era rule requiring decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to report transactions to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) The so-called IRS DeFi broker rule was set to take effect in 2027 and twould have expanded the tax authority’s existing reporting requirements to include DeFi platforms, requiring them to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions. Representative Mike Carey, who backed the resolution, said it was the the first time a president has signed a crypto bill into law. Source: Mike Carey Critics of the rule claimed it would lump decentralized platforms with too onerous rules, hampering crypto innovation, while supporters said killing the rule would create a loophole for wealthy tax cheats. Trump was widely expected to sign the bill, as White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks said in March that the president supported killing the measure. SEC drops suit against Helium for alleged securities violations The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed a lawsuit against Nova Labs, developer of decentralized wireless network Helium, for allegedly issuing unregistered securities, Helium stated in an April 10 blog post. Filed in January 2025, the lawsuit was among the SEC’s final enforcement actions against a cryptocurrency developer under former Chair Gary Gensler, who stepped down from his post on Jan. 20 after US President Donald Trump took office. The dismissal with prejudice means the blockchain developer cannot be charged with similar violations again for issuing in 2019 its native token Helium (HNT), the company said . “[W]e can now definitively say that all compatible Helium Hotspots and the distribution of HNT, IOT, and MOBILE tokens through the Helium Network are not securities,” Helium said. “[T]he outcome establishes that selling hardware and distributing tokens for network growth does not automatically make them securities in the eyes of the SEC [and] that the SEC cannot bring these charges against Helium again,” it added.

The information was disclosed by prominent defense attorney James K. Filan on X, whose ongoing commentary on the Ripple case has made him a trusted voice in the legal and crypto arenas. Awaiting Final SEC Commission Approval The joint motion, filed ahead of the expected appellate briefing, states that the appeal process is being paused due to a mutual agreement to settle, with final approval pending from the SEC Commission itself. This development means that no further legal brief will be filed on the scheduled April 16 date—a clear signal that behind-the-scenes negotiations between Ripple and the SEC have yielded substantial progress. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The parties have filed a joint motion to hold the appeal in abeyance based on the parties’ agreement to settle. The settlement is awaiting Commission approval. No brief will be filed on April 16th. pic.twitter.com/OVKPCIh43H — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) April 10, 2025 While the contents of the settlement agreement have not yet been publicly disclosed, the very fact that both parties are moving forward cooperatively is being hailed as a monumental shift in a legal battle that has spanned more than three years. It marks the closest point to full resolution since the SEC first filed suit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, accusing the company of conducting an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. A Bullish Signal for XRP and Crypto Regulation For many analysts and legal observers, the decision to halt the appeal suggests that both Ripple and the SEC are preparing to turn the page on one of the most pivotal cases in crypto history. The SEC’s agreement to pause the appeal indicates a likely recognition of the practical and regulatory significance of Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling, which found that XRP is not a security when sold on public exchanges. This outcome is widely seen as a partial win for Ripple, and any formal settlement that preserves or affirms this point would create legal clarity not just for XRP, but potentially for a wide range of other digital assets. It could set a precedent that narrows the scope of the SEC’s regulatory reach over cryptocurrencies, especially those already functioning as utility tokens in the secondary market. Implications for XRP Price and Investor Sentiment Following James K. Filan’s disclosure, sentiment in the XRP community has turned sharply optimistic. Many investors view the agreement as removing a significant cloud of uncertainty that has long weighed on XRP’s price and market performance. While the final settlement terms will be crucial, the halt in litigation itself is a confidence booster, signaling the beginning of regulatory normalization for Ripple and a potential green light for broader institutional adoption of XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The market has historically reacted favorably to positive legal milestones in the case. With the lawsuit approaching a likely conclusion, many expect renewed momentum for XRP, especially if the settlement affirms the token’s non-security status for retail transactions. This would empower exchanges, fintech firms, and cross-border payment platforms to more freely engage with XRP without fear of SEC enforcement action. A Defining Moment for Crypto Law Beyond the fate of a single token, the Ripple v. SEC case has come to symbolize the broader tension between innovation and regulation in the digital asset space. A finalized settlement could serve as a blueprint for future SEC actions and prompt Congress to accelerate efforts to introduce comprehensive crypto legislation. For Ripple, it could mean unencumbered growth as it expands its On-Demand Liquidity services and banking partnerships worldwide. For the SEC, it may offer a way to recalibrate its approach without setting a negative precedent through a courtroom loss. And for the crypto industry as a whole, it signals a potential thawing of the regulatory freeze that has constrained innovation in the U.S. for years. As the Commission deliberates on the final approval of the agreement, eyes across the financial world remain fixed on what could be one of the most transformative conclusions in digital asset legal history.

Token vesting tracker Tokenomist data shows that 40 million Trump tokens will be released in a cliff unlock, meaning the tokens will be available all at once. With the tokens currently trading at about $8, the unlock represents about $321 million in supply entering the market at once. Token vesting is a common practice in the crypto space to incentivize long-term holding and prevent early investors or team members from dumping tokens during the start of the project. Instead, projects impose a vesting period that allows individuals or entities to gradually get access to the tokens. Trump memecoin down 89% since its peak While the token’s creators reportedly profited by more than $350 million , retail investors have not fared as well. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis estimates that at least 813,000 wallets suffered losses totaling roughly $2 billion following the memecoin’s rapid rise and fall. Trump’s official token has seen a sharp decrease in value since its peak. On Jan. 19, the token reached an all-time high (ATH) of $73.43. This happened a day before the then-incoming US president was inaugurated. The hype surrounding the token has died down since. Its current value of $8 represents an 89% drop since its ATH. The forthcoming token unlock might also cause a further price drop for the Trump memecoin. Massive token unlocks are often followed by sharp declines in crypto prices as holders who previously couldn’t sell will be allowed to offload their crypto. In March 2024, Arbitrum unlocked $2.32 billion in vested crypto tokens. At the time, its ARB token was worth $1.89. However, the event was followed by a decline in the crypto asset’s value, with the token trading at $0.29 at the time of writing, an 84% drop since the unlock. The Trump token is the largest single crypto unlock scheduled for the week of April 14–20. It accounts for roughly 61% of the total $519 million in tokens set to be released across several projects, according to Tokenomist. $519 million in locked crypto tokens will be released next week.

The policies have influenced the US dollar’s strength and caused financial market uncertainty. Bitcoin, however, is gaining traction as a safer alternative for investors to store their funds. US Dollar falls as Trade war begins The US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped below 100 for the first time in three years to 99.01 before correcting to 99.45. The dollar index has dropped over 7% since Trump stepped back into the White House, including a 2% drop alone in the past week. Analysts attribute the sharp decline to Trump’s hawkish trade war with China. Even though the 10-year US Treasury yield is higher, the dollar is not today. Usually, when the yield increases, the dollar increases too. But now, they are moving in opposite directions. This means that investors are worried and have no clue what the future economic policies will be. Bitcoin Rises Despite Dollar Weakness Bitcoin, however, is going in the opposite direction . Its value went up from $74,500 to $82,500 as investors flocked to a haven where they could park their money. Bitcoin is seen by many as a “ digital gold ” or a hedge against turbulent times in traditional finance. Other major world currencies have also become stronger against the dollar. The euro, Swiss franc, pound, and even Australian and New Zealand dollars have strengthened. In fact, the euro may hit 1.15 against the dollar if there are no major developments in the near future. This shows that individuals are losing confidence in the US dollar internationally. Individuals are increasingly concerned about the budget plans of the US government. A new budget plan that has recently passed the House has raised the issue of funding future tax cuts. This is also increasing the risk on US assets such as stocks and bonds. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fed’s QT Could Delay Major ETH Rally Until 2025, Warns Analyst , March CPI inflation readings were below forecast at 0.1% rather than 0.3%, yet this failed to prevent the dollar from weakening.

Trump signaled that he can dismiss the Federal Reserve Chairman if interest rates are not lowered in the near term According to Blommberg. This adds political risk to an already unstable environment. As long as there are trade problems and unknowns about interest rates, the US dollar will continue to stay weak. Bitcoin will do well because more people need alternatives to mainstream finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Volume Surges 66% in 24 Hours,https://cryptonews.com/news/pi-network-comeback-volume-surges-66-in-24-hours/,"Bullish Pi Network price forecasts are gaining traction after a 66% trading volume surge drove a 6% daily uptick—marking a potential reversal point after weeks of sluggish performance. As Trump’s 90-day “tariff war” pause revives risk-on sentiment, PI remains largely excluded from the “best crypto to buy” narrative, with market confidence still split The policy shift did open the door to fresh liquidity, but that momentum faded fast. A sharp rise to $0.66 quickly retraced to $0.57 in a likely sell-the-news event. With no clear fundamentals or upcoming catalysts to defend PI as a front-running altcoin , the viability of a new uptrend is shaky. PI Price Analysis: Is PI Network Ready for a Comeback? The altcoin is approaching a potential breakout from the descending channel that has guided its six-week-long decline. PI / USDT 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: Binance. After two failed breakout attempts and a false breakdown last week, buying pressure has proven too weak to sustain a convincing break. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is slowly rising after hitting the oversold threshold at 30—a sign of seller exhaustion—currently holding under 40. The descending channel suggests potential highs around $1, offering a 70% gain from current levels. However, the balance remains fragile. Without a solid foundation, Pi Network remains susceptible to further declines. The broader Pi ecosystem continues to struggle with adoption. Its price action remains largely speculative, lacking a meaningful use case to sustain long-term growth. Despite 86% approval in a recent community vote, Binance continues to withhold a listing—underscoring the lack of confidence in PI’s long-term viability. A decline from current levels would put the $0.40 support at risk and open the door to all-time lows around the pattern lower support—a 40% drop from where it trades now.

Amidst the growing acceptance and adoption of BTC, Lomond School has joined a list of institutions embracing crypto payments. Effective from the autumn term in 2025, Lomond School will accept Bitcoin from its two FCA-approved Bitcoin providers. This development comes amid the growing trend of Bitcoin adoption and the changing regulatory environment. Let’s unveil the UK school’s strategies and the European country’s crypto initiatives. UK School Accepts Bitcoin Payment, Know More In collaboration with BTC providers CoinCorner and Musquet, UK’s Lomond School has begun to accept Bitcoin payments for school fees. The school will build an asset reserve from the Bitcoin payments, initially converting them into GBP. Bitcoin Magazine unveiled this critical development via its recent X thread. The post read, “Lomond School became the first UK school to accept Bitcoin for payments. They will “look to build a Bitcoin reserve.” Significantly, Lomond School’s strategic move comes in response to the growing demand from international education agents and parent for alternative payment options. UK’s Crypto Initiatives: A Closer Look Europe has been at the forefront of crypto initiatives and regulations. Recently, Patrick Hansen, the Director, EU Strategy and Policy Advisor at Circle, revealed Europe’s lead in crypto banking . He cited, “Europe is leading the world in terms of crypto-friendly banks.” Currently, the continent boasts more than 50 banks that offer digital asset services. The UK school’s Bitcoin payments aligns with the country’s broader vision of crypto establishment. Europe’s growing enthusiasm on crypto is evident in the latest developments including Mastercard-Kraken collaboration. Mastercard Partners Kraken Mastercard and Kraken entered into a partnership to enable Bitcoin and crypto payments across the UK and Europe. Scott Abrahams, Executive Vice President of Global Partnerships at Mastercard, stated, “Mastercard is committed to driving innovation and expanding the possibilities of digital payments.” BlackRock’s Entry into UK Additionally, asset manager BlackRock has received approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer crypto services to clients in the country. Being listed alongside Coinbase, Moonpay, and eToro, BlackRock has become the 51 st company to gain legal authority in the UK. Bitcoin Payments Gain Traction: Why To Choose BTC? Amid changing regulatory environment and monetary policies, Bitcoin and crypto payments are gaining global recognition. Countries across the world are choosing Bitcoin for various purposes. Nations like El Salvador have acknowledged BTC as legal tender. Notably, the University of Nicosia began to accept Bitcoin payments in 2013, becoming first of the kind. A spokesperson commented, “The intention of this initiative is to ease transmission difficulties for certain students and to build our own practical knowledge about this field, not to engage in currency speculation” US’ Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Moreover, UK’s renewed interest in Bitcoin payments and cryptocurrencies could be attributed to the US President Donald Trump’s progressive stance. Recently, Trump signed an executive order to add Bitcoin as the country’s strategic crypto reserve, a move that inspired many other governments.

Just weeks into the New Year, a frenzy of politically fueled memecoins sent Crypto Twitter into overdrive, while lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic turned up the heat on stablecoins, securities laws and tokenized assets, usually with different approaches. It was a whirlwind first quarter, shaped by Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market and a US political climate that put digital assets back in the spotlight. Q1 delivered no shortage of storylines. Who better to break it all down than the journalists tracking it in real time? In the latest episode of Decentralize with Cointelegrap h, editorial team members sit down for an unfiltered newsroom roundtable. Savannah Fortis, head of podcasts and EU reporter, is joined by Gareth Jenkinson, chief of multimedia; Zoltan Vardai, breaking news reporter on the EU news team; and Vince Quill, US news reporter, to reflect on Q1’s biggest stories and what they signal for the months ahead. Memecoins, power and perception As memecoins surged in early 2025, questions regarding their legitimacy and political entanglement intensified. For Cointelegraph’s editorial team, the frenzy wasn’t just a market quirk, it revealed deep tensions among innovation, opportunism and influence. Jenkinson was first to comment on what the impact of US President Donald Trump and greater political memecoin frenzies may mean for the industry in the long term, saying, “I struggle to still trust what the Trump administration and his group of advisers are doing, when they are launching things like memecoins...” “Yes, we’ve seen a much more favorable approach to the wider crypto industry, and that’s been really great. But a lot of the lobbying, from Ripple, Circle and others, was about making sure their cryptocurrencies were included in this bundle of assets the US wants to hold.” Related: Bitcoin may hit a wall at $84K if bullish conditions don’t pick up: CryptoQuant The team acknowledged that while regulatory clarity and institutional support have created a more stable environment for crypto companies in general since the new administration took office, that progress risks being overshadowed by spectacle. More memes… Trump’s big moves seem to domino into other political figures, namely Argentina’s President Javier Milei, to become entangled in a high-profile memecoin controversy that rippled far beyond national politics. For an industry seeking legitimacy, this kind of involvement by world leaders sends a mixed message. “It’s terrible for the industry,” Jenkinson added. “Milei was supposed to be a savior for Argentina after years of hyperinflation. And now he’s launching a memecoin with a known rug puller.” Still, the roundtable remained hopeful. “I’m an eternal optimist,” he continued. “At least we got the affirmation for Bitcoin. People now understand what it is, governments are starting to hold it. That’s how good the fundamentals are.” Stablecoins and the altcoin fallout While much attention has centered on Bitcoin’s institutional glow-up and the memecoin spectacle, several members of the Cointelegraph team voiced deeper concerns around emerging stablecoin legislation and the quiet moves behind it. “One thing that I think kind of flew under the radar is that the Trump-linked World Liberty Forum actually launched a US dollar-backed stablecoin in March,” Vardai pointed out. “These stablecoins would fall completely in line with both requirements in the Genius Act and Stable Act... but it could really be interpreted as Trump trying to pass stablecoin legislation while having a vested interest. His World Liberty Financial is launching a lot of crypto-related products.” The fallout from politically aligned memecoins has also weighed heavily on the broader crypto markets, particularly altcoins. “Altcoins aren’t really winning at all this quarter,” Vardai also noted. “Memecoins have had this premature rally, and they’ve been rallying independently from other cryptocurrencies. A lot of people are concerned whether Bitcoin’s rise is going to come before Ether’s, and before any altcoin rise.” So what defined Q1 of 2025?

Xi will not be bullied and dares to forgo the US market Owing to how dependent the Chinese market is on exports, Xi may have a case to argue only if he convinces other nations to take up the amount of goods it has exported to the US market annually. That’s easier said than done, but Xi is not one to back down. China posted a 10.7% year-over-year export surge in December 2024, buoyed by exporters front-loading shipments ahead of the Lunar New Year and the worry of more trade restrictions. China’s trade surplus widened to $104.8 billion for the month, including a $33.5 billion surplus with the US. According to data from the China Briefing, in 2024, the United States economy reached approximately US$29.2 trillion, growing at a rate of 2.8%. The North also saw a considerable two-year increase in its outbound direct investment (ODI) totaling $364 billion, particularly from countries like Ireland, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The US economy is still the world’s largest because of its consumer-driven model. On the flipside, China’s economy expanded by 5.0% in 2024 to bring its GDP to approximately RMB 134.9 trillion (US$18.9 trillion). The growth rate may have outpaced the US in percentage terms, but China’s per capita GDP stood at US$13,445, much lower than the US figure of US$86,600. China’s ODI went up by 11.3% last year, focusing on initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and its investments in clean energy and high-tech sectors. The East Asian nation follows the US in economy size terms, a fact that Xi now wants to overturn by using the trade war to convince other countries to go against the US. Yet, the Chinese leader’s defiant tone contrasts with signs of stress within China’s manufacturing base. Factories in Guangdong and Shenzhen have suspended operations due to tariff uncertainty, and companies that rely heavily on US demand are bracing for revenue collapse. “We can only hang on for so long,” said Hong Binbin, owner of a toy manufacturing firm in Shenzhen. “If we can’t hold out, we’ll shut down the factory.” American businesses are also scrambling to adjust to the Trumpian markets. At Darianna Bridal & Tuxedo in Pennsylvania, co-owner Franco Salerno is worried about how much 223 dresses currently en route from China will cost him. “ It will eat my salary up ,” he said, also promising to not pass the charges to brides. Xi plays the long game, Trump pushes for decoupling Xi is not leaving office anytime in the foreseeable future, since he abolished presidential term limits in 2018. He faces no re-election pressure, much unlike Trump, who must leave office by 2029, unless he follows through on “defying constitutional norms.” The Chinese leader has spent years preparing the country for decoupling from the West, according to political analysts. “ He believes the Chinese political system is superior to the American one ,” said Joseph Torigian of American University. “ He likely views this trade war as proof that China must become even more self-sufficient .” Trump tariffs may have given Xi political cover if China ever falls into an economic crisis. “ This saves Xi from having to take responsibility for China’s weak growth. It’s a ‘get out of jail free’ card ,” reckoned Jessica Teets, a political scientist at Middlebury College. If no agreement falls in place soon, analysts are warning consumers that they may face unreasonable prices and fewer product choices if the US loses access to Chinese manufacturing. “If we break through a $19.95 or $29.95 price point, sales will drop,” said cosmetic bag manufacturer Lay-n-Go co-founder Adam Fazackerley. Trump insists that his ultimate goal is to eliminate the US trade deficit and revive domestic manufacturing, but before the target is realized, the weight of the trade war could fall on US consumers. “ Hopefully, China realizes that the days of ripping off the USA. are over ,” the POTUS said last Wednesday, announcing a 10% baseline tariff on virtually all imports, but sparing allies for 90 days.

Towns protocol presents itself as the web3 version of web2 applications like Discord, Slack, X but distincts by providing a decentralised control. As a decentralized communication platform aiming to reshape how online communities interact and govern themselves in the Web3 era, the protocol announced its funding on Thursday. The round also saw participation from Union Square Ventures, Kindred Ventures, Seed Club Ventures, and others. This signals a strong institutional interest in building the next generation of online communities beyond traditional platforms like Discord and Telegram. Notably, the investment marks a major vote of confidence in on-chain messaging infrastructure and the broader decentralized social stack. Here’s Why What Is Towns Protocol Towns Protocol, founded in 2022 by Ben Rubin, is a Web3-native communication protocol designed to bring group chats, online communities, and social interactions fully on-chain. Built with decentralization and composability at its core, Towns aims to give users total control over their community’s structure, data, and rules. Each “town” represents a group or community space that lives entirely on-chain. Unlike centralized messaging platforms, these towns are governed by smart contracts, allowing for programmable rules around membership, moderation, and even revenue sharing. The project wants to make group communication a first-class citizen in Web3, alongside identity, finance, and governance. Excited to share our latest funding round, led by @a16zcrypto , with the addition of new investor @cbventures and continued support from @benchmark . The future of communication is onchain. pic.twitter.com/qGQUa9cvaE — Towns Protocol (@TownsProtocol) April 10, 2025 Why Coinbase and a16z Are Interested The decision by Coinbase and a16z to back Towns reflects a growing conviction among investors that decentralized communication is the next major layer of the crypto stack. After years of innovation in DeFi, infrastructure, and gaming, attention is now turning to how communities interact, organize, and scale in trustless environments. Coinbase Ventures, which has also invested in Web3 identity projects and DAOs, views Towns as part of the essential toolkit for making crypto communities more resilient, secure, and autonomous. The investment further aligns with Coinbase’s broader goal of supporting user-controlled, censorship-resistant ecosystems. Interestingly, in a recent instance, the VC Ventures parent exchange firm, Coinbase provided blueprint for US SEC on digital assets regulation. Can Towns Provide the Decentralized Communication in web3 While existing platforms like Discord have been widely adopted by crypto communities, they come with significant downsides — including centralized control, data vulnerability, spam attacks, and lack of native crypto integration. Towns aims to solve this by: Allowing communities to vote on membership, permissions, and rule changes. It has enabled wallet-native access with which entry to chats can be gated via tokens, NFTs, or verified identities. It allows developers to build apps and bots that plug directly into towns. Users and communities own their messages, content, and interactions. This approach appeals especially to DAOs, NFT projects, and Layer 2 ecosystems looking for customizable, secure communication tools that can evolve with their needs. Notably, Towns also recently made Trading live on Towns – allowing users to trade any Solana or Base token directly in their respective town. According to an X post by its founder, Ben Rubin, its transactions volume has already surpassed $3.5 million with $540,000 in fees collected from over 1 million members. Towns Screenshot What’s Next for Towns? The Towns Protocol team plans to use the $10 million to expand engineering and developer support, improve protocol scalability, and launch a public beta later this year. It is also working to open-source key components of the stack and enable easy integration with other Web3 apps and wallets. Long-term, the project hopes to become a core social layer for decentralized applications, functioning much like Ethereum did for programmable money — but for programmable community interaction.

The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $78,452 on Thursday before settling at $79,592. BTC is up over 3% during the ongoing session, trading around $82,167 as it looks to move past $85,000. Analysts believe BTC could have ended its recent downtrend, suggesting a rebound was on the horizon. New Hampshire House Passes Bitcoin Reserve Bill The New Hampshire House has voted 192-179 in favor of House Bill 302 after it cleared the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee with a one-sided vote of 16-1. The passage of the Bitcoin Reserve bill makes New Hampshire the fourth state to advance such legislation with Arizona, Texas, and Oklahoma. The bill will now head to the Senate to be debated further before potentially landing on Governor Kelly Ayotte’s desk for approval. If signed into law, House Bill 302 would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of New Hampshire’s general fund, revenue stabilization fund, or any other legislatively approved fund towards certain digital assets and precious metals, including Gold, silver, and platinum. However, the bill places stringent requirements to qualify for inclusion in the reserve. To be included in the reserve, a cryptocurrency must have maintained an average market capitalization of at least $500 billion over a year, a criteria only met by Bitcoin . According to supporters, the bill could open up new avenues for revenue generation and financial diversification. Bitcoin Maturing As A Macro Asset Bitcoin (BTC) is maturing as a macro asset amid growing market turmoil, believes James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet. BTC spent weeks moving in tandem with traditional assets and equities. However, it decoupled to demonstrate a measured reaction to a historic selloff after the US imposed reciprocal tariffs on over 100 countries. According to Toledano, this measured response highlights BTC’s growing maturity as a macro asset. Toledano's observations came after BTC began consolidating after weeks of a gradual decline, which saw the asset drop over 25% from its Jan 20 peak. The drop, which mirrored losses suffered by the equities market, challenged the notion that BTC is not correlated with traditional assets. It also undermined the digital gold narrative of the flagship cryptocurrency. However, Toledano believes BTC’s recent reversal shows investors are changing their perspective. “While it’s far from decoupled or insulated from broader economic shocks, it has fared surprisingly well during this recent market-wide sell-off. This might suggest that fewer investors view it as merely another high-beta risk trade. Instead, we’re beginning to see bitcoin occupy a liminal space between risk and refuge.” BTC had tracked global markets during much of Q1 2025. However, Gold had its best performance in decades, reaching a new milestone just days after the April 7 market meltdown. Gold’s performance emboldened BTC’s critics. However, Toledano argued, “The global response to US policy shifts is reinforcing bitcoin’s core proposition: a non-sovereign store of value in an increasingly fragmented world. While not yet a traditional safe haven, bitcoin is growing into that role—its resilience increasingly speaks louder than price action alone.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $80,000 on Thursday, falling to a low of $78,452. However, it rebounded during the current session to reclaim $80,000, reaching a day high of $82,983 before registering a marginal decline. Despite BTC’s recovery, analysts remain skeptical of whether it can retain momentum and push toward $85,000 or higher. While tariffs have been paused for 90 days, markets remain jittery. Alexander Kuptsikevich, Senior Market Analyst at FxPro, stated, “Bitcoin (BTC) has temporarily recovered to $80,000, but the medium to long-term trend reversal remains uncertain. Bitcoin is currently approaching the upper end of the downtrend and is being tested to see if it can break out of the correction trend that has continued for the past two months.” Meanwhile, another analyst has suggested that if BTC pushes above $85,000, it could surge to the next resistance zone around $96,000. “Bitcoin may face resistance at the $84,000 level. If it breaks through this resistance line, it could surge to the next resistance zone of $96,000. This price range initially acted as a support line at the beginning of this bull market, but if the upward trend slows, it could turn into a resistance line. The same pattern was repeated in past bear markets.” BTC registered a sharp decline on Wednesday, reaching a day high of $88,624 before plunging over 3% to $82,525. It recovered on Thursday, rising 0.82%, and continued to push higher on Friday, rising 0.76% to settle at $83,828. However, sentiment changed over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday and settled at $83,423. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC plunged over 6%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $78,301. The price faced volatility on Monday after rumors about a tariff pause, falling to a low of $74,393 before surging past $80,000 and then dropping to settle at $79,164, ultimately registering an increase of 1.10%. Source: TradingView However, BTC was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping almost 4% to $76,283. Markets rallied on Wednesday after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. As a result, BTC surged over 8% to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,593. The rally lost momentum on Thursday as the price dropped 3.63%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $79,592. BTC has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price up almost 3% and trading at $81,816. Buyers will look to retain control and push BTC past $85,000.

To read full editions, subscribe . The week between the Liberation Day announcement and the 90-day pause gave a good indication of where folks are at when it comes to huge news events that have potential impacts on crypto. Everyone approaches sudden downturns differently. Some use it as a buy-the-dip moment, some hunker down and prepare for the worst, and others adopt a wait-and-see mindset that allows them to think an action through before an immediate reaction. Skale’s Jack O’Holleran would probably say he’s in the third camp, especially as an executive in the industry. “If you’re working in the crypto space, you’re making decisions that are short term, that impact days and weeks, but you also have to make decisions that impact months and quarters, and so you have to be planning ahead,” he told me. “And it frankly, makes things incredibly challenging, knowing that there are all these other variables outside of your control that you can’t accurately predict. You have to build volatility and variability into your plan.” I asked O’Holleran what he thought about fundamentals in crypto, and if we’ve really started to see that shift play out as Blockworks Research’s Ryan Connor believes . O’Holleran thinks we’re still on the path toward fundamentals. I know we’ve heard the 90s comparisons a couple of times here on Empire. But O’Holleran pointed out that at the beginning of the dot-com era (before it was a bubble), speculation swirled around the tech, even when the products weren’t live quite yet. Crypto’s operating similarly, he noted. In crypto, the evolution toward fundamentals will shift into focusing more on project metrics. The industry is in what O’Holleran referred to as “loss leader” mode. “People are less concerned about economic values than they are about TVL and trading volume,” he said. “[In] March there was a strong indicator of success at the infrastructure level. Because I think there’s a general belief that as incumbents and new players gain market share and build moats, they’re going to be able to then increase their profitability, or token value capture.” And one of the key things we’re building up right now is just how we value different segments in crypto. O’Holleran pointed out that folks are still gauging how something like DePIN or layer-2 projects should be weighted in their categories. All of these things reaffirm what may be a bit obvious to us: The industry is really at a maturity inflection point. Prepare for some growing pains, but figuring out metrics to value a project will, in the long run, be a net positive for crypto. Bring on the fundamentals.

Assembly Bill A7788, sponsored by Assemblymember Clyde Vanel, proposes that agencies may begin accepting Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Litecoin ( LTC ), and Bitcoin Cash for fines, taxes, rent, and other payments owed to the state. Filed on April 10, 2025, the bill would amend the State Finance Law by adding Section 4-b, granting agencies the authority to enter into agreements with crypto issuers or payment providers. These agreements would define how payments are processed and the conditions under which the state may accept or reject cryptocurrency transactions. If enacted, state agencies could accept crypto for a broad range of obligations — provided that the cryptocurrency issuer confirms final and unconditional payment. Agencies may also require a service fee from payers to offset transaction costs, including fees paid to crypto issuers, according to the bill. You might also like: Lomond School becomes the first U.K school to accept Bitcoin payments Settled debts The bill emphasizes that debts are not considered settled until the state has received full payment in fiat from the crypto issuer. This ensures the state avoids volatility risks and maintains accounting standards. This is not the first time such legislation has been proposed in New York. Similar versions were introduced in prior sessions, including bills A9782 (2017-2018), A1500 (2019-2020), and A2532 (2023-2024), though none advanced to law. The bill is currently in the Assembly Governmental Operations Committee. If approved, it will take effect 90 days after becoming law.

ONDO became one of the new tokens to be added to the exchange after the most recent round of Vote to List. Ondo (ONDO) became one of the latest assets to be added to Binance, after the latest round of Vote to List. Binance also added Big Time (BIGTIME) and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) in the second round of the community proposal program. The tokens have already been promoted through Binance Alpha, so users can transfer their tokens to the spot market. Binance already opened deposits for the tokens and will launch a total of six trading pairs, ONDO/USDT, ONDO/USDC, BIGTIME/USDT, BIGTIME/USDC, VIRTUAL/USDT, VIRTUAL/USDC. Withdrawals will be open from April 12. The current batch of tokens taps a wider selection of chains, while the first round only selected native assets from BNB Smart Chain. ONDO and BIGTIME still use Ethereum, while VIRTUAL will be listed with two smart contracts, on Ethereum and Base. This voting round selected relatively established tokens, in contrast with the first round that focused on recently launched memes. The tokens from the Vote to List program are more established compared to other Binance listings. They are only launched after one last round of due diligence, and offer well-established liquidity on other markets, as well as bigger communities. The latest voting round received a total of 523,111 votes from 424,749 participants, as Binance aimed for organic engagement and a minimal amount of automated votes. ONDO rallies to one-week high Following the listing announcement, ONDO rallied to a one-week high of $0.88, touching the higher range for the past month. The token recently bounced from its lower range for the past 12 months. ONDO has gained continued attention as one of the hottest representatives of the RWA tokenization narrative. ONDO is ranked third in the RWA tokenization sector, following Chainlink (LINK) and Mantra (OM). In the past, ONDO has been a part of the portfolio of the Trump family fund, World Liberty Financial. The project has also partnered with mainstream investment companies to offer tokenization tools for real-world assets. The launch of a new native chain by the protocol is expected to boost RWA tokenization. ONDO is seen as one of the undervalued tokens, based on a TVL of nearly $1B and a market capitalization of around $2.78B. Ondo also offers a tokenized US government bond, locking in $325M in value. The project’s applications and future plans make it stand out among meme tokens and altcoins with no clear utility. BIGTIME boosts attention for on-chain games The BIGTIME listing draws attention to renewed attempts to popularize on-chain games. Big Time is a free-to-play RPG with on-chain options. The successful vote reflected the game’s strong community, as Big Time made calls for active voting through social media. After the news of the listing, the BIGTIME token rallied to a one-month high of $0.08. This is the second rally for BIGTIME, as the token outperformed after being selected for Vote to List. Big Time also drew attention after launching this week’s special Easter edition with a new leaderboard. The effect of Binance was the weakest for VIRTUAL. AI agent tokens were one of the weakest narratives in the first quarter of 2025. VIRTUAL only rallied to $0.52, still trading near the lower range for the past month. The token still awaits a relief rally to erase the last three months of losses. VIRTUAL has been sliding since a January peak at $4.61, during the peak season for AI agents. An addition to Binance is yet to show its final effect, as some of the hottest listed tokens end up losing value due to selling pressures.

Three prominent crypto investors have recently redirected their portfolios from established assets such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) into Ozak AI’s native token, $OZ, citing advanced predictive features and an expanding AI-based infrastructure. The recent move indicates investors transfer funds to blockchain initiatives that provide operational AI capabilities in trading and analytical functions alongside risk control tools. Ozak AI provides decentralized AI calculation capabilities through its native platform, which includes financial tools accessible through token economy mechanisms. After raising $1,000,000 from the $OZ presale , investments continue to accumulate. Ozak Stream Network (OSN) combined with Prediction Agents (PAs) forms the project infrastructure, which directs investors to shift their capital investments from Layer-1 traditional assets into AI-powered platforms. AI and Blockchain Integration Attracts Strategic Capital Allocation Ozak AI implements Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) to build up security protocols and ensure transparent data systems. Users can now handle financial data so it gets processed rapidly and accurately through this system, making it suitable for traders and asset managers who need real-time information. The Prediction Agents within the platform allow clients to design customized AI models for prediction and investment allocation needs. The machine learning solutions designed specifically for financial choices at Ozak AI position the company to match market needs for secure automated data analysis. Of all the advancements in AI technology within financial institutions, there is strong interest in blockchain initiatives that deliver actual operational benefits. The investment decisions made by these three financial groups stem from recognizing the fundamental changes occurring in decentralized financial data management methods. Youtube embed: $1 Target Set for OZAK, Buy OZAK AI at $0.003 is The Best Altcoin investment of 2025 Presale Performance and Future Token Utility Drive Investment Decisions The $OZ token presale conducts multiple growth cycles, which transform its initial value of $0.001 into $0.003. Early standards require investors to pay $0.005 to obtain AI-powered tools in advance of other customers, while their price will climb to $0.005 within the next phase. Even though experts believe the $OZ token will even go higher to $1 by 2025 due to its planned listing price of $0.05. The Ozak AI system utilizes automated risk applications coupled with predictive dashboards, which provide investment guidance throughout uncertain markets. During the presale period, purchasers will get complete access to these services once Ozak AI launches its platform. Retail and institutional users selected the $OZ token due to its scalable decentralized structure and decentralized infrastructure, among other factors, for choosing to move away from legacy tokens. The future market segment for digital assets will adopt blockchain platforms with actionable analytics because of AI’s impact on the market.

These tokens carry a Seed Tag, signaling both high potential and elevated risk. The Selected Ones The world’s largest crypto exchange recently issued a community vote to check which additional tokens its users want to see available on the platform. It honored the final results and embraced Ondo (ONDO), Big Time (BIGTIME), and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). The newly introduced spot trading pairs include ONDO/USDT, ONDO/USDC, BIGTIME/USDT, BIGTIME/USDC, VIRTUAL/USDT, and VIRTUAL/USDC. It is worth mentioning that the altcoins were previously available on Binance Alpha. They will no longer be showcased there, and users can now transfer any available holdings involving the assets to their spot accounts. “The purchase function for the aforementioned token (s) will be stopped on Binance Alpha when spot trading opens on Binance Spot. The sell function on Binance Alpha will not be impacted . After the token(s) is removed from Binance Alpha, users can still view their Alpha token balances from the Alpha Accounts, and transfer them to Spot Accounts to continue trading on Binance Spot,” the disclosure reads. The added tokens experienced substantial price increases shortly after the news. BIGTIME soared by 25% daily to a two-month high of over $0.07. VIRTUAL also witnessed a double-digit spike on a 24-hour scale, while ONDO recorded a less significant pump. Support from Binance provides increased liquidity for the tokens in question and injects them with a credibility shot. As such, the aforementioned price upswing should not be considered a surprise. It is important to note that the exchange listed ONDO, BIGTIME, and VIRTUAL with seed tags applied. This section includes early-stage projects with high potential but also a bigger risk. That should serve as a warning to people to hop on the bandwagon with caution, do proper due diligence beforehand, and invest only as much as they are ready to lose. Delisting Causes the Opposite Reaction Earlier this month, Binance removed 14 altcoins from its platform, causing significant price declines for the affected. Cream (CREAM) and Beta Finance (BETA) suffered the worst consequences, nosediving by roughly 60% shortly after the announcement. A similar crash was observed in October last year when the company terminated all trading services with Rupiah Token (IDRT), Keep3rV1 (KP3R), Ooki Protocol (OOKI), and Unifi Protocol DAO (UNFI).

A ""Trumpcession"" may see it finally mature into a reserve. Unlike the 2008 crisis caused by Wall Street and sparking a distrust in the finance system, a Trumpcession stems from political moves, and may cause a global distrust in politics. A potential Trumpcession could trigger a global economic cooldown, leading institutions and nation-states to view Bitcoin as a hedge against political and economic instability. However, risks abound: Bitcoin currently lags gold, correlates to risk assets, and may never mature due to its Trump ties and ""failure"" as a global currency. While Bitcoin has not yet matured into a global reserve asset and remains correlated with risk assets, its superior technical qualities make it a strong long-term buy, in my view. Despite Trump’s April 9th pivot on tariffs, equity markets are still in turmoil. The S&P 500 declined more than 3% on April 10th. Perhaps more worryingly, yields on 10-year US treasuries are still rising and are above levels seen before April 2nd. A “ Trumpcession ” - which I personally define as a politically induced recession with non-zero risk of inflation remaining sticky - has the potential to plunge the US into a stagflationary environment. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was launched in January 2009, towards the end of the Great Recession. Many observers in the crypto space, me included, believe this was no coincidence. Bitcoin was born as a decentralized payment system as a reaction to a world where Wall Street crashed the US economy due to greed and lax controls. Today’s pos sible “ Trumpcession ” has radically different causes from the 2008 recession. It has not been caused by the greed of Wall Street. Rather, this is the result of a US administration pushing for highly questionable economic policies. However, Bitcoin has also radically evolved in the past 16 years. Launched as a decentralized global payment system, today Bitcoin is more akin to a global reserve asset than as a global currency (more of my thoughts on this shortly). In this article, I explain why exactly like the 2008 Recession saw Bitcoin born as a global alternative to currencies, the “Trumpcession” may be pivotal for Bitcoin , making it mature once as a global reserve asset or become irrelevant for good. How Bitcoin pivoted to become a reserve asset, not a global currency In cryptocurrency, a hard fork is a protocol update to a blockchain that splits it into two new, distinct blockchains. One adheres to the “old rules”, the other adopts new ones to introduce improvements or address existing flaws. Users must decide on which blockchain to stay. Back in 2018, Bitcoin underwent a major hard fork, resulting in Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) branching off as a new cryptocurrency, distinct from the main Bitcoin blockchain. This 2018 Bitcoin fork was caused by a long-standing argument in the Bitcoin’s community over the core purpose of Bitcoin. Advocates for Bitcoin Cash pushed to raise block size limits, arguing that larger blocks would speed up transactions. They believed this was key to realizing Bitcoin’s original goal as a global currency capable of handling high transaction volumes. With no consensus reached, developers created Bitcoin Cash as a Bitcoin fork. Bitcoin Cash remains the most notable fork in Bitcoin history. This cryptocurrency still exists and ranks among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Yet, it pales next to Bitcoin. Today, Bitcoin Cash is valued below $300 per coin, while Bitcoin is priced above $79,000 at the time of writing. I see the Bitcoin Cash fork of 2018 as the moment where Bitcoin definitely pivoted to a narrative of being a new alternative global reserve asset . Many other on-chain indicators point to the same conclusion, for example, the fact that the number of transactions and the number of active addresses on the BTC blockchain has been stagnant since 2018. This is something I covered in detail in a past article on Bitcoin. I encourage readers that still think of Bitcoin as a global payment system to read that piece before proceeding, as this concept is important in the context of my thesis today. Great Recession vs. “Trumpcession”: a macro comparison The Great Recession was provoked by a housing market bubble fueled by risky subprime mortgages, lax lending standards, and complex financial derivatives, leading to widespread defaults and a collapse in global financial markets. In that regard, it was a failure of the financial system, rather than the political one. Unsurprisingly, the “Occupy Wall Street” movement was born as a result of public distrusts in high finance. In contrast, the current situation is the sole result of political will. Of course, we do not know whether the Trumpcession will be deep (or whether it will take place at all). Odds for a US recession are changing rapidly, with different banks placing them at vastly different ranges. Personally, I believe Trump is indeed trying to induce a recession with very questionable policy, and especially tariffs on foreign trade. By pivoting on tariffs just after yields on the 10-Year US Treasuries skyrocketed, I think Trump made it clear his initial policies were a mistake. What the Great Recession and a Trumpcession have in common is that they are both caused by human mistakes which triggered two kinds of public distrusts: Distrust in the contemporary global monetary system - triggered by the 2008 crisis. Distrust in the contemporary political system - something that may be triggered by a “Trumpcession” and an increasingly deglobalized, polarized world. Both elements, in my view, have a strong influence on Bitcoin. In the first case, they were behind the very invention of Bitcoin as a system alternative to traditional finance. In the second case, distrust in politics may be what pushes Bitcoin to mature as a global reserve asset. Or, it may do the exact opposite and condemn Bitcoin to irrelevance. This is what I am going to discuss in my next two sections, with the bull and bear case for Bitcoin in the context of a Trumpcession. The bull case: a Trumpcession and the need for Bitcoin The current US administration was elected with a promise to focus on cutting supposedly ‘unsustainable’ government spend and debt. That was one of the reasons why DOGE was created. DOGE has allegedly saved $150 Billion of taxpayers money to date, according to self-reported accounts that can be found on its own website. Even taking this figure as correct at face value, Trump has effectively negated the full savings amount by raising the Pentagon’s 2025 budget. At a total of $1 Trillion, it represents an increase of slightly more than $150 Billion against the 2024 Pentagon budget of $850 Billion. Brookings Beyond the specifics of each department, US government spending has moved in line with 2024 since the start of this administration, as shown by the chart above. In other terms, there has not been any relevant change in the spending habits of the US government. I find this is potentially very bullish for Bitcoin. Bitcoin has historically been highly correlated with money supply, as shown by the chart below. BTC vs. Global Money Supply (MacroMicro) A Trumpcession may trigger a deep US recession, which in turn may trigger a global cooldown of the economy . Historically, a US recession has often provoked a global recession, due to the size and globalized nature of the world’s economy. This, I believe, can result in one thing only: global banks returning to low rates and relaxed monetary policy , potentially including again Quantitative Easing. Further to this dynamic, there is also the political element that I mentioned previously. If Trump continues with its policies (which I personally see as neo-socialist ), I think the US is going to be seen increasingly as an unreliable trade, economic and military partner. Bitcoin is a neutral asset, which has characteristics technically superior to those of gold - it is far scarcer, significantly easier and cheaper to move, more durable and fungible. In a context of high political uncertainty and increased global money supply, I could see how institutions and nation-states may want to invest in Bitcoin as a further hedge. This may very well be happening together with gold , which has been on a massive bull run recently. Ultimately, in a highly polarized and uncertain world, I see room for both Bitcoin and gold as global reserves. Whether institutions and nation states will start seeing Bitcoin as a reserve, rather than a high-risk asset, remains to be seen. What’s sure, however, is that Bitcoin enjoys far more institutional acceptance today than what it had until the last expansionary monetary cycle . It is far more easily accessible via ETFs and other liquid funds to everyone, and it has generally better acceptance by global regulatory bodies, in my view. The bear case: risks of buying Bitcoin and its recent gold lag To understand the main risk for Bitcoin, one only needs to look at its past: Bitcoin never matured into the original global payment system that its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, outlined in its Whitepaper . Exactly how that happened, institutions may never start seeing it as a better, digitized version of gold. Personally, I am strongly convinced that humanity will eventually abandon gold as a global reserve asset. That is because gold is not that scarce in nature, at 4 parts per billion in the universe. While that is scarce enough for today, a relatively modest advancement of our civilization (including asteroid mining or new mining techniques) would be enough to render it obsolete almost overnight. However, that may only happen beyond our lifetimes and Bitcoin may not be the beneficiary of such an event. It is exactly a comparison with gold that, in my view, shows how Bitcoin is nowhere near being perceived as a global reserve asset, and it may never get there. GLD vs. BTC vs. QQQ, past 1 year (Seeking Alpha) GLD vs. BTC vs. QQQ, YTD (Seeking Alpha) Bitcoin behaved relatively OK during these challenging times, with some articles on Seeking Alpha even mentioning a supposed “decoupling” of Bitcoin against equities based on a few days' data. However, the reality is that Bitcoin is still highly correlated with risk assets, and it has severely underperformed Gold Year-To-Date as well as in the past year, as shown by the charts above. I find that some Bitcoin skeptics and bulls alike sometimes think of Bitcoin as a sort of immutable protocol that is not subject to human behaviors. I disagree with that notion, and I see Bitcoin as a superior digital protocol that is not immutable at all, but, on the contrary, depends entirely on its community. In this sense, the main risk of investing in Bitcoin today is that its maturity will depend on human behaviors that are difficult or impossible to predict by definition. A final risk - and almost a paradox - is that one of the reasons why institutions and governments may not ultimately decide to adopt Bitcoin is its backing by the Trump administration . In my view, that could act like a deterrent in a context of high diplomatic tension between nation states. Conclusion With the US adopting protectionist economic policies that resemble more those of Venezuela than those of a capitalist country, we are living through unprecedented times. These times may end up benefiting Bitcoin, if the following happens: A Trumpcession may push the US, and the world, into a deep recession. As a reaction, most central banks, with possibly the notable exception of the Fed in case of stagflation, should pivot and resort to lax monetary policy. Bitcoin has historically been correlated to global money supply (as other risk assets) and may benefit enormously from a return to expansive global monetary policy. Pushed by unprecedented levels of uncertainty and distrust in politics (especially American politics), global institutions and governments may start perceiving Bitcoin as a hedge against bad policymaking, and buy it. This may very well happen together with a sustained gold bull run. I see enough room for both Bitcoin and Gold to act as global reserves in today’s polarized world. Of course, the above scenario is all but certain . Bitcoin has not yet matured into a global reserve asset, and is still highly correlated with risk assets such as the Nasdaq 100. The fact that the Trump administration seemingly backs Bitcoin may even act as a further headwind to its adoption by other nation states. Personally, I remain very bullish on Bitcoin , believing that its superior technical qualities will prevail in the long term and make it mature into a global reserve asset. However, significant risks still exist. I rate Bitcoin a STRONG BUY at current price levels, with an upside up to $650,000 per coin, which I discussed in previous coverage of Bitcoin.",BCH-USD|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-11 13:52:31

However, Trump has now signed a new law that will overturn this change, thereby exempting DEXs from IRS regulations. Keep reading to understand its implications, how it’s yet another pro-crypto move by the new president, and how you can benefit from this by buying the best presales . DEXs No Longer Brokers, Says Trump A lot of DeFi exchanges had objected to their inclusion as brokers by the IRS. Logically, unlike centralized exchanges (CEX), which act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, decentralized exchanges look to eliminate the middleman so that market participants can transact directly. This increases anonymity on the blockchain. However, the IRS had tax evasion concerns, hence the inclusion. The IRS believed that a lot of crypto holders aren’t paying taxes. This is why it required decentralized exchanges to send tax forms to the IRS besides, of course, crypto holders. Given the anonymity of blockchains, this was always a difficult task. The concern has now been adequately dealt with by the ‘crypto president,’ and DEXs will no longer be considered as a broker for tax purposes. A Huge Boost to DEX Positive crypto regulations were one of the major promises Trump had made during his presidential campaign. With this latest relief, the entire DEX industry has dodged a bullet. Being classified as a broker would have increased regulatory compliance, adding a lot of hindrance to its day-to-day work. Now that the uncertainty is gone, it will make it easier for decentralized platforms to operate and innovate, which will increase trading volumes. The total 24-hour trading volume on DEXs right now is $5.91B , which is expected to increase going forward. Plus, most newly launched cryptos usually trade on DEXs, driving more traders to these platforms. If you’re also looking to benefit from the upcoming DEX market growth, here are three new cryptos you should not miss out on. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Revolutionary AI Crypto Offering Investment Advice With crypto trading set to receive a push by Trump’s new mandate, this could be the right time to invest in a new cryptocurrency like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , which has been specifically designed to revolutionize crypto investing. $MIND is an AI agent programmed to talk to the crypto community on online platforms like X. By hearing out and then analyzing countless people’s biases towards crypto, MIND of Pepe will be able to find the crypto coins most likely to explode next . Manually doing so, i.e., studying market sentiments to identify purchase-worthy meme coins and altcoins, is nearly impossible. Thanks to $MIND’s cutting-edge AI technology, though, crypto investing will be much simpler. As a $MIND token holder, you’ll benefit not only from the AI agent’s exclusive investing recommendations but also from the increase in the token’s price once it launches. As per our $MIND price prediction , the token could reach as high as $0.0263 by the end of 2030. This translates to a nearly 710% potential gain if you buy $MIND now. Each token is currently available for just $0.0037015, and the project has raised nearly $8M in presale funding. For more info, here’s a guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe . 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Presale to Buy for Bitcoin Maximalists Bitcoin shot up by over 5% immediately after Trump’s tariff pause. This shows just how positively it can react to favorable macroeconomic conditions. In light of Trump’s pro-crypto attitude, we can reasonably expect Bitcoin (and crypto) to rally higher in the near future. When that happens, holders of the BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will rejoice the most. That’s because $BTCBULL will offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders every time the OG crypto smashes through a new milestone, like $150K, $200K, and $250K. All you have to do to be eligible for free bitcoins is buy and HODL $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . Additionally, the project’s creators have decided to follow a deflationary model. This means they’ll eliminate a portion of the total $BTCBULL token supply at regular intervals. The logic behind this is simple. Strangle supply to effect an increase in demand and, ultimately, an increase in BTC Bull Token ‘s price. The best altcoins follow this tactic. After careful research, our $BTCBULL price prediction has put the token’s price at $0.0096 by the end of 2026. Currently, though, the token is selling for just $0.002455. It’s one of the best cheap cryptos because it’s in presale, where it has already raised over $4.5M. 3. PepeX ($PEPX) – First-Ever AI-Powered No-Code Launchpad for Meme Coins PepeX ($PEPX) takes a leaf out of the OG Pepe, which was one of the best meme coins of all time. However, although $PEPX has a similar frog-themed mascot, there’s nothing old-school about this AI-based crypto project. Self-proclaimed as the first-ever AI-powered no-code launchpad for meme coins, PepeX aims to revolutionize how meme coins are built. Essentially, it no longer wants only cunning developers to possess the power of creating meme coins. Instead, by offering a platform that can create meme coins with just prompts, PepeX will tear down the barriers the industry has put on token creation with full-stack development. Non-tech-savvy crypto enthusiasts like us will be able to create, promote, and manage our own meme coins thanks to PepeX’s AI agents. Even better, these AI agents will also integrate with X and Telegram, which have emerged as the go-to platforms for the marketing of new meme coins on presale . You won’t have to worry about security, either. PepeX employs on-chain monitoring and anti-sniping tech to ensure transparency and fairness in the distribution and trading of your meme coins. $PEPX is currently in presale and has already amassed over $1.3M. You can grab one token for only $0.0268 if you get in now. Bottom Line Even with the best presales in your portfolio, there’s no guarantee that you won’t make losses. As such, only invest an amount that you’re comfortable with, and do your own research before investing. As always, none of the above is a replacement for financial advice from a qualified professional.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-11 13:55:26

While Bitcoin’s institutional validation sparks interest, projects like XRP, Dogecoin, Solana, and Rexas Finance (RXS) are gaining traction. Among these, RXS stands out by merging blockchain innovation with trillion-dollar real-world markets, offering investors a tangible bridge between digital and physical assets. Bitcoin Cements Its Monetary Role Bitcoin continues to dominate as a decentralized store of value, with BlackRock’s endorsement reinforcing its credibility. Analysts view this shift as a gateway for institutional capital into crypto markets. Yet, Bitcoin’s volatility and speculative nature highlight the need for assets grounded in real-world utility—a gap Rexas Finance fills decisively. XRP Navigates Legal Uncertainty XRP has experienced sharp price swings, recently surging 14% on optimism around Ripple’s SEC case before retreating. While spot buying signals suggest bullish sentiment, futures data reveals lingering skepticism. Traders watch key levels at $2.23 (support) and $2.65 (resistance), but XRP’s reliance on legal outcomes contrasts with RXS’s asset-backed stability. Dogecoin Tests Market Sentiment Dogecoin hovers near $0.143, a historical support level that previously fueled rallies. A bearish candlestick pattern hints at potential downside, though a breakout above $0.176 could reverse the trend. DOGE’s meme-driven appeal lacks the foundational strength of RXS, which leverages real estate and commodities—markets worth over $300 trillion globally. Solana Eyes Growth Amid Consolidation Solana’s consolidation near $120 has analysts predicting a rally toward $1,000, supported by ecosystem growth and ETF interest. However, SOL’s trajectory remains tied to broader market trends, unlike RXS, which taps into real-world asset tokenization—a sector poised to redefine global ownership models. Rexas Finance Transforms Real-World Asset Ownership Rexas Finance is disrupting traditional markets by tokenizing assets like real estate and gold. This ERC-20 token enables fractional ownership, allowing a retail investor in Tokyo to own a stake in a Parisian apartment or a Dubai skyscraper with a single click. By converting physical assets into blockchain-based tokens, RXS erases geographical and financial barriers, unlocking access to markets previously reserved for institutions. Building and Funding with Rexas Tools Rexas Token Builder lets users tokenize assets effortlessly, while the Launchpad empowers creators to fund projects through community-driven token sales. Tools like Quickmint Bot and AI Shield streamline asset conversion and enhance security, ensuring seamless integration across blockchains. These features position RXS as a one-stop platform for democratizing global investment opportunities. Presale Momentum and Future Potential Rexas Finance has raised $47.6 million in its presale, with Stage 12 tokens priced at $0.20—a 6.6x surge from its initial $0.03. Over 91.6% of the 500 million presale tokens have sold, signaling intense demand. The confirmed $0.25 listing price offers immediate upside, while analysts project a climb to $10+ post-launch, delivering 50x returns. A whale secured 1,250,000 RXS ($250k) , reflecting heightened institutional interest in RXS. A live $1 million giveaway amplifies momentum, offering 20 winners $50,000 each. Participants submit an ERC20 wallet address, complete tasks, and refer friends for bonus entries. Coupled with CertiK-audited security and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS combines transparency with explosive growth potential. Securing a Stake In the Future As Bitcoin reshapes monetary systems, Rexas Finance redefines asset ownership. Its presale success—prioritizing public participation over venture capital—contrasts sharply with speculative altcoins. With Tier 1 exchange listings planned and real-world asset tokenization gaining steam, RXS isn’t just another crypto: it’s a blueprint for the future of global finance. Investors eyeing alternatives to volatile meme coins or slow-moving giants are securing RXS tokens before the presale concludes. The window for entry narrows, but the opportunity for transformative gains remains wide open.

White Hat Hero Saves $2.6 Million A well known white hat maximal extractable value (MEV) operator, “c0ffeebabe.eth,” was able to successfully intercept close to $2.6 million in stolen crypto assets after a vulnerability in Morpho Labs’ decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. The exploit happened after Morpho Labs implemented a front-end update on its Morpho Blue application on April 10. The very next day, a hacker exploited a flaw that was introduced by this update, which led to the loss of funds from a user address. Blockchain security firm PeckShield identified the vulnerability and confirmed that the hacker's transaction was front-run by the white hat MEV actor. While the funds have since been transferred to another wallet, it is still unclear whether they have been returned to the affected user. In response to the breach, Morpho Labs very quickly reverted the front-end update and confirmed via X that all funds in the protocol remained safe and unaffected. The team added that normal operations resumed and assured its users that no further action was necessary on their part. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in how certain transactions were crafted, stemming from the front-end changes that were designed to improve transaction flow. Morpho Labs is expected to release a detailed report next week to shed some more light on the incident. This was not the first time c0ffeebabe.eth stepped in during a crisis. In July of 2023, the MEV operator recovered roughly $5.4 million worth of Ether by front-running a hacker in the Curve Finance exploit and returned the funds to the deployer address. A similar thing took place during the Blueberry DeFi hack in 2024, where all of the stolen funds were intercepted and returned thanks to the same operator. Hackers Target Atomic and Exodus Wallets Users of Atomic Wallet and Exodus Wallet are also facing a new cybersecurity threat as hackers deploy malicious software packages through online coding repositories to steal private crypto keys. Cybersecurity firm ReversingLabs uncovered the exploit , which involves hiding harmful code in seemingly legitimate npm software packages that are commonly used by developers. Once installed, the malware targets locally stored wallet files, modifying them in a way that alters the user interface to mislead users into unknowingly sending funds to scam addresses. (Source: ReversingLabs ) This incident is part of the broader trend of increasingly sophisticated attacks being launched against the crypto community. Software supply chain attacks are emerging as a major threat vector, and are exploiting trusted development tools to gain access to users' funds. This latest scheme is now part of the growing game of cat-and-mouse between hackers and the crypto industry, with cybercriminals continuously changing their methods to bypass even the most trusted security measures. The scale of damage from these attacks has been staggering. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, cyber exploits led to almost $2 billion in losses, with the single largest incident being the $1.4 billion Bybit hack in February. A post-mortem from SafeWallet revealed that the attack stemmed from hackers compromising a developer’s machine and hijacking Amazon Web Services session tokens, granting them access to the company’s internal environment. Summary of hacks and exploits during Q1 2025 (Source: Hacken ) In a separate but equally alarming threat, address poisoning attacks are also becoming more common. Casa’s chief security officer Jameson Lopp recently raised awareness about these scams, which trick victims into sending funds to addresses that closely mimic legitimate ones. Hackers craft fake addresses that match the first and last characters of a known address, then send tiny transactions to the target so the fake address appears in their history. If a victim fails to double-check the full address, they may inadvertently transfer funds to the attacker. According to Cyvers, address poisoning alone accounted for $1.2 million in stolen crypto in March of 2025. Illinois Passes Crypto Fraud Crackdown Bill Luckily, there are people hard at work to protect the crypto space against these kinds of threats. The Illinois Senate recently passed a new bill that is aimed at cracking down on cryptocurrency fraud and enhancing investor protections. (Source: Ilga.gov ) On April 10, lawmakers approved Senate Bill 1797, which is also known as the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act, by a 39 to 17 vote. It was introduced by Senator Mark Walker in February, and it grants the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation the authority to oversee digital asset business activity in the state. Any individual or business engaging with Illinois residents in digital asset transactions will be required to register with the department, and crypto service providers must fully disclose all user fees and charges in advance. Senator Walker believes that there is an urgent need to tackle the growing instances of fraud in the crypto space, and stated that while digital assets present financial opportunities, they have also opened the door to bankruptcy, scams, and misleading practices. The legislation was passed during a wider push across the US to increase regulatory scrutiny, especially after the series of high-profile meme coin failures and insider-led scams that inflicted major losses on retail investors. In one particularly notorious case, the Libra token that was allegedly endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, collapsed after insiders reportedly withdrew over $107 million in liquidity. The move triggered a 94% crash in token value and erased close to $4 billion in market capitalization. Another collapse followed the launch of the Wolf of Wall Street-themed token (WOLF) by Hayden Davis, who was also the co-creator of the Libra token and the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA). Over 82% of WOLF’s supply was controlled by a single entity, and the token plummeted by 99% after peaking at a $42 million valuation. As a result of these kinds of collapses, calls for harsher legal consequences intensified. Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon even requested an Interpol Red Notice for Davis, and warned that his access to vast financial resources poses a serious risk of flight. Anastasija Plotnikova, CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, pointed out that activities like rug pulls and insider scams are not just unethical but also clearly illegal and should be dealt with by law enforcement. Similar regulatory initiatives like the one from Illinois were also filed in New York .",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-11 13:56:24

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.000081. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach an average value of $0.000215 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem with significant growth and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about its future price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and solidify its position in the crypto market? Will SHIB ever reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu Token SHIB Price $0.00001207 Market Cap $7.11B Trading Volume $105.62M Circulating Supply 589.25T SHIB All-time High $0.00008845 (Oct 27, 2021) All-time Low $0.00000000008165 (Aug 31, 2020) 24-hour high $0.00001238 24-hour low $0.00001207 Shiba Inu coin price prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Volatility 5.51% 50-Day SMA $ 0.00001440 14-Day RSI 46.70 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $ 0.00001891 Shiba Inu price analysis: SHIB sees a slight dip amid mild intraday volatility SHIB consistently fails to break above the $0.00001207 level, signaling intense selling pressure and a lack of momentum to push higher. The token consolidates within a narrow band between $0.00001144 and $0.00001211, reflecting market indecision and low volatility. Brief upward moves have lacked sustainability, with buyers unable to maintain gains, suggesting a short-term bearish bias and cautious sentiment in the market. On April 11th, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular meme cryptocurrency, is trading at $0.00001195, reflecting a 0.91% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, SHIB continues consolidating within a tight range, hinting at market indecision and low volatility during this short-term session. The token’s current trading pattern remains consistent with broader movements across altcoins, most trading sideways or experiencing minor corrections. SHIB’s 24-hour price range showed a low of $0.00001144 and a high of $0.00001211, staying within a narrow band. While there were brief rallies, they failed to maintain momentum, causing prices to return to mean levels. Notably, SHIB remains 86.5% down from its all-time high of $0.00008845 on October 28, 2021. The lack of significant bullish catalysts or whale accumulation in recent sessions has contributed to the subdued performance. Wallet activity appears stable, and the Ethereum-based token still shows regular transactions tracked via Etherscan.io. Shiba daily chart: SHIB shows a consolidation phase below the key resistance On the daily chart, SHIB is hovering just below a crucial resistance level at $0.00001207, which briefly acted as intraday support during previous sessions before turning into a supply zone. Despite the minor dip to $0.00001144, buyers defended the lower levels, forming a temporary bottom structure. However, repeated rejections near $0.00001207 indicate an inability to break through with volume, suggesting exhaustion among bulls. Price action shows multiple wicks to the upside, reflecting selling pressure at every attempted breakout. The 20-day moving average is slightly sloped downward and currently sits near $0.00001200, acting as a dynamic resistance level. Volume has remained muted, with no clear breakout or breakdown confirmation, pointing toward a sideways structure. Market structure on the daily remains neutral to slightly bearish unless bulls can push a close above $0.00001211 with volume confirmation. Support remains strong at the $0.00001140–$0.00001150 zone, where SHIB saw a cluster of bid activity during the session lows. Shiba 4-hour chart: SHIB reveals repeated failures at local highs On the 4-hour chart, SHIB shows multiple lower highs, indicating a short-term bearish structure despite temporary recoveries. The price was rejected sharply after touching $0.00001207, and there was no follow-through in volume to sustain higher prices. Recent recovery attempts have lacked bullish conviction, as candles show long upper shadows, suggesting profit-taking or algorithmic resistance. Support remains intact at $0.00001160, with buyers re-entering that range, keeping SHIB within a narrow compression zone.

Based on the current analysis, Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades in a tight consolidation range with low volatility, showing resistance at $0.00001207 and support around $0.00001140–$0.00001160. Price action reflects indecision, with weak volume and no strong breakout signals, while SHIB remains 86.5% below its all-time high. Stable wallet activity and consistent on-chain transactions suggest ongoing use, but without bullish momentum or catalysts, SHIB currently appears more suited for short-term trading than long-term investment. Will Shiba Inu recover? Shiba Inu is experiencing fluctuations with a recent upward trend; there are signs of potential recovery. Will SHIB reach $0.00005? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, SHIB is projected to reach up to $0.00005 by 2027. Will SHIB reach $0.0001 Yes, according to the long-term predictions, SHIB is projected to reach up to $0.0001 by 2029. Will SHIB reach $100? Reaching $100 for SHIB is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply and the astronomically high market capitalization it would necessitate. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments. Shiba Inu price prediction for April 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is expected to show a variety of price fluctuations through April 2025. The potential low is $0.000016, while the average price might be around $0.000018. SHIB could reach up to $0.000019, which is the highest expected price.

An accordion facility is a provision that allows a borrower to increase their borrowing without renegotiating the entire agreement. In effect, it expands like an accordion. Toronto-based APX, which offers lending with digital assets as collateral, plans to use the facility to accelerate its expansion in Canada to meet rising demands for crypto-backed loans, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Friday. “This accordion facility from Cypress Hills marks a major step forward in our mission to make crypto-backed loans transparent, secure, and accessible to Canadians,"" founder and CEO Andrei Poliakov said in the announcement. APX received exemptive relief from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) at the start of this month, exempting it from certain registration and prospectus requirements, which the firm said ""would address investor concerns in [a] retail context."" The exemption was granted ""based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application with the objective of fostering innovative businesses in Canada,"" according to a note on the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) website . Digital asset lending has a somewhat chequered history, with various lenders collapsing amid the onset of the crypto winter in 2022 .

Launching with over $250 million in BTC deposited, SatLayer will lay a stronger foundation for Bitcoin decentralized finance ( DeFi ) and help transform BTC into a programmable asset with more utility in the ecosystem. By doing so, SatLayer also unlocks trillions of dollars worth of idle Bitcoin to give nation-states, institutions, and individual traders more yield-earning opportunities. Bitcoin liquidity and security As a decentralized restaking app on Babylon, SatLayer helps bring BTC liquidity and security characteristic of Layer 1 and (L1) Layer 2 (L2) chains to decentralized applications (dApps) and infrastructure as well. Starting with Babylon Genesis and preparing to support other leading L1/L2 ecosystems in the future, SatLayer promises use cases such as under-collateralized loans, slashing insurance, and on-chain prime brokerage. To support the launch of Babylon Genesis and its native BABY token, SatLayer has developed Cube, a Babylon-native liquid staking solution that enables users to liquid-stake BABY and receive cBABY, a liquid staking token. cBABY token utility cBABY can be used to earn additional rewards when deposited into SatLayer and downstream DEFI protocols such as Tower, a Babylon Genesis decentralized exchange ( DEX ), or lending protocols. Luke Xie, co-founder of SatLayer, also noted the team’s desire to drive adoption with the token: “Beyond native BABY staking, the introduction of cBABY with the launch of Cube creates a multiplier effect on BABY’s efficiency and yield generation. Our goal is to connect the broader ecosystem in a way that scales security alongside adoption, without requiring a proportional increase in locked capital.” Since Cube is built natively on Babylon Genesis, users can strengthen the security of the ecosystem by staking while also supporting the growth of both SatLayer and Babylon Genesis and earning rewards.

Notably, the stocks JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock recorded premarket gains. As well as earnings reports, the market also has to digest the producer price index data for March, which showed a slight drop from February’s. Per the data, U.S. March PPI fell 0.4% month-over-month, with this the economic metric’s largest drop since October 2023. PPI was expected to rise 0.2%. Meanwhile, U.S. PPI nudged 2.7% year-over-year in March, below the consensus expectation of 3.3% and the prior 3.2%. The data comes out a day after consumer price index data released on Thursday. Despite signaling a month on month drop to 2.4%, the market largely ignored it as tariffs jitters dominated sentiment. While stocks have fallen amid the tariffs whiplash seen in the week, gains notched still see the S&P 500 poised for a green weekly candle. Most of the gains came on Wednesday as risk assets skyrocketed on Trump’s initial 90-day tariffs pause. But uncertainty isn’t likely to fade fast unless there’s a major catalyst.

The move aims to unlock new liquidity opportunities for developers, liquidity providers, and institutional players, while reinforcing Avalanche’s ( AVAX ) position as a hub for decentralized finance and tokenized real-world assets. First launched in December, Balancer v3 introduces several enhancements, including Boosted Pools and a Hooks Framework that allows developers to customize liquidity behavior, according to a release shared with crypto.news. These upgrades give LPs more control, enabling new trading strategies and pool designs.

It brings the protocol’s liquidity optimization tools to a network increasingly used by institutions such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and KKR for asset tokenization. “With Balancer v3’s advanced liquidity mechanisms now live, we expect a variety of DeFi adoption across the Avalanche ecosystem,” said Eric Kang, Head of DeFi at Ava Labs. Balancer’s arrival is expected to benefit protocols like Aave and BENQI, which can now access deeper liquidity and new yield strategies. Aave currently has over $500 million in total value locked on Avalanche. “Bringing Balancer v3 to Avalanche strengthens our commitment to expanding efficient liquidity solutions across ecosystems,” said Fernando Martinelli, Balancer Cofounder.

And on Thursday President Trump killed the measure for good . But let’s not fool ourselves — there’s more pain to come. In December 2024, the IRS proposed a broad rule requiring DeFi platforms to follow standard crypto broker tax rules, including extensive user KYC and other disclosures. The crypto industry pushed back immediately, with numerous blockchain groups suing the IRS almost as soon as the rule was announced. DeFi platforms aren’t designed to collect this type of information in the first place, and beyond that, the proposed rule contradicts DeFi’s core goal of protecting privacy while keeping transactions transparent. Thankfully, this rule is likely to be scrapped entirely under the Donald Trump administration after the U.S. Senate's 70-28 vote against the ruling on March 26. This follows the US House's 292-132 vote on March 11 and the Senate's earlier 70-27 vote on March 4, both in favor of repealing the IRS DeFi broker rule . If the rule had stuck, it would have hurt the U.S. crypto industry and innovation beyond just DeFi. As the operator of crypto tax platform Koinly, I know it would have made compliance significantly more costly and complicated for us too. But it is far from over. This repeal was easy because the rule was so over-the-top that even most government officials saw it as unworkable. But what happens when the IRS returns with a more subtle, carefully crafted rule that again targets DeFi? Overturning this version doesn’t prevent the agency from trying again. I wouldn’t be surprised if the IRS now goes on a hiring spree for DeFi experts to help with this, especially after bringing in several crypto specialists into the agency in February 2024. IRS is acting like there is still a fortune in uncollected crypto taxes The IRS clearly believes it's missing out on crypto tax revenue and is pushing to expand its reach as much as possible. DeFi may be privacy-focused, but it still involves money, so it’s not going to be ignored anytime soon. The IRS won’t take this rule being rejected lightly either. It wouldn’t be a stretch to assume the agency will ramp up its audits even more on US crypto users to ensure their filings are accurate. So, what should the US crypto industry do? It can’t afford to be reactive. Instead of waiting for the IRS to drop another harsh crypto tax ruling, it must push even harder for regulatory clarity on DeFi to prevent misinformed and overstepping rules from surfacing again. The best time to push for fairer IRS tax rules is now While crypto advocacy groups are already doing a great job on this , the industry needs to be even more persuasive — especially in pushing for rules that distinguish true brokers from self-executing smart contracts, ensure fair tax treatment for DeFi participants, and provide clear reporting guidance without stifling innovation. With Trump in office and a more pro-crypto friendly environment in Washington, there is a chance to get regulations right before the pendulum swings back toward aggressive enforcement. That means there's a four-year window to get this in shape. While the crypto industry is being proactive and engaging with Trump, it must ensure these rules are fully passed, clarified, and set into law. Otherwise, it could face an even harsher regulatory regime under a future administration less friendly to decentralized technologies. The IRS’s DeFi broker rule should serve as a warning: until there is a workable framework in place, regulators will continue attempting to impose harsh rules on a technology they barely understand. And next time, the crypto industry might not be as lucky in gaining enough votes for a repeal.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-11 14:06:13

The most recent volatility has been accompanied by an alarming drop in the number of active SOL addresses, which have, by April 11, hit a 2025 low at approximately 1.67 million, per the data FInbold retrieved from Dune Analytics via The Block ’ s on-chain metrics. SOL monthly active addresses in 2025. Source: Dune Analytics and The Block The dramatic price drop – Solana is, at $117.99, 55.06% below the January 18 high of $262.56 – paired with the decline in the number of addresses is an alarming signal for cryptocurrency investors as it could signal a simultaneous loss of confidence and interest. Still, recent trading has seen a spike in volume, signaling the network remains active. At the same time, April 11 figures retrieved by Finbold from Coinalyze demonstrate that nearly 75% of traffic in the last 24 hours has been related to long positions, signaling an overall bullish attitude. Solana long/short ratio in the last 24 hours. Source: Coinalyze Why a Solana crash might be imminent Elsewhere, there has been a notable increase in the short volume in the shorter timeframes, signaling a potential downward correction might be imminent. A potential trigger for such a price move could be Alameda Research’s April 11 unlocking of 186,326 SOL, as the bankrupt and disgraced cryptocurrency company could trigger significant selling pressure, either directly or through panic selling executed by other traders. Is Solana headed below $100? Nonetheless, the situation remains uncertain, indicating that SOL could be driven by the movements of the broader market. The overall performance of digital assets as a sector hints that the driving forces are likely to be external. So far, 2025 has featured numerous positive developments, primarily regarding the regulatory landscape, but cryptocurrencies have mostly traded on negative macroeconomic news. The Liberation Day announcement has caused an especially large bloodbath and triggered significant volatility, with more pain likely ahead despite President Donald Trump’s tariff pause. China’s decision to match the U.S. 125% tariff – and the decision to exclude the People’s Republic from the 90-day pause – could generate substantial selling pressure as the trade relationship between the two countries is all but guaranteed to squeeze Americans’ daily finances, leaving less room for risk assets. SOL’s latest rally remains trivial compared to 2025 losses Such a bearish outlook is further backed by Solana’s performance since the start of 2025. While Ethereum ( ETH ) has been generally noted for its unexpectedly disappointing price movements, SOL suffered an even greater drop and is 37.72% down year-to-date (YTD) to $117.99.
