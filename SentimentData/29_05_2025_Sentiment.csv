This development highlights a broader trend of companies exploring how digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, can serve strategic financial purposes beyond just trading. What is a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Why Does it Matter? A Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as part of its corporate reserves, similar to how traditional companies hold cash, bonds, or gold. It’s a decision driven by various factors, often including: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about currency devaluation, some companies see Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a potential hedge against inflation. Store of Value: Positioning Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, potentially appreciating over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings. Signal of Innovation: Demonstrating forward-thinking adoption of emerging technologies. For a company like K33, a crypto broker, adopting such a strategy aligns with its core business and can instill confidence in its customers and investors regarding its belief in the asset class it facilitates trading for. K33 ‘s Strategic Crypto Funding Explained K33, a prominent name in the Nordic crypto market, announced on its official website that it has successfully raised 60 million SEK, equivalent to approximately $6.22 million USD. This funding wasn’t from a typical venture capital round but through investment agreements with its key, long-term shareholders. The stated purpose of this capital injection is explicit: to fund the company’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. This means the raised funds are earmarked specifically for acquiring Bitcoin to be held on K33’s balance sheet. This move is strategic for several reasons: It strengthens K33’s financial position by adding a potentially appreciating asset. It demonstrates a strong conviction from its core investors in both K33’s business model and the long-term value of Bitcoin. It positions K33 as a proactive player in the crypto broker space, potentially attracting clients interested in companies with direct exposure to Bitcoin. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Investment While K33’s move is significant for a crypto broker, the concept of companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury is not entirely new. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, is perhaps the most well-known example, holding billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Other public and private companies have also allocated portions of their reserves to the digital asset. Here are a few notable examples (values are approximate and subject to change): Company Approx. BTC Holdings Estimated Current USD Value Primary Motivation (often cited) MicroStrategy ~214,400 BTC ~$13.5 Billion+ Inflation hedge, Capital allocation strategy Marathon Digital Holdings ~17,631 BTC ~$1.1 Billion+ Treasury reserve, Assets from mining Coinbase ~10,500 BTC ~$660 Million+ Corporate treasury Tesla ~9,720 BTC ~$610 Million+ Corporate treasury diversification Note: These figures are estimates based on publicly available data and market prices at a given time. K33 joining this list, especially as a dedicated crypto broker, adds another layer to the narrative of institutional and corporate adoption. It suggests that even companies deeply embedded within the crypto ecosystem see strategic value in holding the underlying asset itself, not just facilitating its trade. Implications for the Crypto Broker Landscape and Beyond K33’s decision could have ripple effects. As a regulated crypto broker operating in Europe, its move might inspire other similar firms to consider their own treasury strategies. If more crypto-native companies allocate capital to Bitcoin, it could further legitimize the asset class and potentially drive additional demand. For investors, this news from K33 provides insight into how companies operating directly in the crypto space are managing their balance sheets and expressing their long-term outlook on Bitcoin. It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component of corporate finance. Key Takeaways from K33’s Funding Round K33 secured $6.22 million specifically for a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The funding came from key existing shareholders, indicating strong internal support. This move reflects growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. It positions K33 uniquely within the crypto broker market by directly holding BTC on its balance sheet with dedicated funding. The trend of corporate Bitcoin investment continues to gain traction. K33’s successful funding round for its Bitcoin treasury strategy is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic statement. It underscores the increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and highlights how companies, particularly those in the digital asset space, are integrating cryptocurrencies into their long-term financial planning. As the crypto market matures, expect to see more innovative approaches like this shaping the future of corporate finance.

The filing, dated May 27, 2025, addresses a fundamental regulatory question: when does a crypto asset, originally distributed under an investment contract, cease to be considered a security? This correspondence follows a meeting held on May 20 between Ripple and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. It aligns with Commissioner Hester Peirce’s recent “New Paradigm” speech . Ripple’s letter aims to provide a legal and policy framework to help clarify the distinction between securities and non-securities in the context of digital assets, particularly those like XRP. BREAKING: @Ripple has submitted an additional letter to the SEC, addressing a crucial question about when a token should lose its security label! BULLISH FOR #XRP pic.twitter.com/b5qD9MHivw — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 28, 2025 Reinforcing XRP’s Status With Existing Case Law Ripple’s letter draws from established legal analysis, particularly the 2022 paper, The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law by Lewis Cohen and others. The company argues that current law does not support classifying most fungible crypto assets as securities when traded on secondary markets. Ripple cites a section of the paper that emphasizes how these assets do not involve the kind of legal relationship characteristic of investment contracts. The company also references Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling from July 2023 , where it was determined that Ripple’s programmatic token sales and other secondary market transactions did not qualify as securities. Judge Torres ruled that while Ripple’s past institutional sales involved investment contracts, these did not apply to subsequent market transactions, and the token itself is not a security. This distinction plays a central role in Ripple’s argument that XRP should not be broadly classified as a security. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Proposing a Maturity-Based Framework Ripple proposes using “maturity” as a clearer regulatory standard than “decentralization.” Under this approach, a digital asset would no longer be regulated as a security once its network becomes sufficiently independent. Ripple suggests indicators like market capitalization, operational history, and lack of unilateral control as signs of maturity, arguing these factors offer a more practical measure of independence than metrics such as token distribution or ties to the issuer. Avoiding Misleading Disclosure Requirements Ripple’s letter also warns that requiring ongoing disclosures for non-securities could mislead the public into thinking affiliated parties still control the asset. Many detractors wrongly assume that XRP is centralized , and requirements like these could amplify those false beliefs. The filing comes amid Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, when the proposed settlement agreement was denied on procedural grounds . Ripple’s latest submission reinforces its stance that XRP should not be treated as a security, and settling the case with the SEC would help cement the asset’s status.

In a move poised to shape the future of the industry, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the nation’s primary financial watchdog, has initiated a public consultation on proposed regulations for two critical areas: stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody services. This development marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing evolution of UK crypto regulation , signaling a commitment to balancing innovation with necessary safeguards. What is the Latest in UK Crypto Regulation ? The core of this recent announcement is the FCA’s call for feedback on its proposed rules. As reported by Cointelegraph, the regulator is seeking input from a wide range of stakeholders – including crypto firms, traditional financial institutions, consumer groups, academics, and the general public – on how best to regulate activities involving stablecoins and the safekeeping of digital assets. This isn’t just a bureaucratic exercise; it’s an open invitation to participate in designing the regulatory landscape for a rapidly evolving sector. The proposals stem from the UK government’s broader ambition to establish the country as a global hub for crypto asset technology and investment. Recognizing the potential of digital assets while also acknowledging the inherent risks, the FCA is working to create a regulatory environment that fosters market trust and encourages responsible innovation. This collaborative effort also involves close coordination with the Bank of England, particularly concerning stablecoins, which have implications for monetary and financial stability. Deep Dive: Understanding the FCA Stablecoin Proposals Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset or basket of assets, such as fiat currencies (like the British Pound), commodities, or other cryptocurrencies. Their potential use cases range from facilitating faster and cheaper payments to enabling seamless trading within the crypto ecosystem. However, the stability of stablecoins is paramount. A loss of confidence or a failure in their mechanisms could pose risks to users and potentially the wider financial system, especially if they achieve significant scale. The FCA stablecoin proposals are expected to cover various aspects, likely including: Issuance Requirements: Rules for entities creating and issuing stablecoins, focusing on areas like reserve management, transparency, and governance. Holding and Transfers: Regulations for firms that facilitate the holding or transfer of stablecoins, ensuring secure and reliable transactions. Consumer Protection: Measures aimed at protecting individuals and businesses using stablecoins, including clear information disclosure and complaint resolution mechanisms. The FCA’s focus here aligns with global efforts to bring stablecoins under regulatory purview, recognizing their potential as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Collaboration with the Bank of England highlights the systemic importance stablecoins could eventually hold. Securing Your Assets: The Focus on Crypto Custody UK Crypto custody refers to the service of storing private keys for cryptocurrency wallets on behalf of clients. Since losing private keys means losing access to the digital assets, secure and reliable custody is fundamental to the crypto ecosystem, particularly for institutional investors and businesses holding significant amounts of crypto. Currently, the regulatory landscape for crypto custody providers in the UK is less defined than for traditional financial custodians. The FCA’s consultation aims to address this gap by proposing rules that would likely impose stringent requirements on firms offering these services in the crypto custody UK market. Potential areas of regulation could include: Security Standards: Mandating robust cybersecurity measures and operational resilience to protect stored assets from theft or loss. Capital Requirements: Ensuring custody providers have sufficient financial resources to manage risks and potential liabilities. Segregation of Assets: Requiring firms to keep client assets separate from their own operational funds. Governance and Risk Management: Establishing clear frameworks for how firms are run and how they identify and mitigate risks. By regulating crypto custody, the FCA seeks to enhance investor protection and build confidence in the market, making it safer for both retail and institutional participants to hold digital assets. Why is the UK Financial Watchdog Taking Action Now? Several factors are driving the UK financial watchdog to prioritize stablecoin and custody regulation: Market Growth: The crypto market continues to grow, attracting more users and capital, increasing the need for clear rules. Risk Mitigation: Unregulated stablecoins and custody services pose risks of fraud, market manipulation, and systemic instability. Global Alignment: Other major jurisdictions are also developing crypto regulations, and the UK aims to stay competitive and interoperable. Government Strategy: This aligns with the UK government’s stated goal of becoming a leader in digital assets. Consumer Protection: A primary mandate of the FCA is to protect consumers and maintain market integrity. By addressing these foundational elements of the crypto market, the FCA is laying groundwork for future growth while attempting to prevent potential harm. How Can You Participate in Shaping Stablecoin Regulation UK ? This consultation period represents a critical opportunity for anyone involved in or interested in the crypto space to have their voice heard. The FCA is genuinely seeking feedback to ensure the regulations are practical, effective, and forward-looking. Actionable Insights for Participation: Read the Consultation Paper: The FCA will publish detailed documents outlining their specific proposals and the questions they are asking. Read these carefully to understand the nuances. Identify Relevant Areas: Focus your feedback on the areas most relevant to you or your business – whether it’s stablecoin issuance, using custody services, or the general impact on the market. Prepare a Response: Structure your feedback clearly. Provide specific examples or data to support your points. Explain the potential consequences (positive or negative) of the proposed rules. Submit Your Feedback: Follow the instructions provided by the FCA for submitting responses, paying close attention to the deadline. Engaging with the consultation process is vital. It allows the industry and the public to provide real-world context and technical expertise that can help the FCA refine its proposals and create regulations that are both effective and conducive to innovation in stablecoin regulation UK and custody. Potential Benefits of Clear Regulation Increased investor and consumer confidence. Greater participation from traditional financial institutions. Reduced risk of illicit activity and fraud. A clearer playing field for businesses, fostering competition. Enhanced market stability and integrity. Potential Challenges to Consider Risk of overly burdensome compliance costs for smaller firms. Defining the scope of regulation clearly in a rapidly changing space. Balancing innovation freedom with necessary oversight. Ensuring interoperability with international regulatory approaches. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for UK Crypto The FCA’s public consultation on stablecoins and crypto custody is more than just a regulatory update; it’s a defining moment for the UK’s position in the global digital asset landscape. By proactively addressing these foundational elements, the UK financial watchdog is taking a measured approach to integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system while attempting to mitigate the associated risks. The success of these regulations will depend significantly on the quality of the feedback received during this consultation period. It is an unparalleled opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to shaping rules that will govern how stablecoins are used and how digital assets are secured in the UK for years to come. Engaging now is crucial to ensure the final framework is robust, fair, and supportive of a thriving, safe, and innovative crypto ecosystem.

As traders move away from legacy tokens, it is clear that the next breakout stars are emerging from underdog projects with strong narratives and tech utility. FloppyPepe (FPPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are at the forefront of this rise, backed by surging community support and fast-developing ecosystems. While the Dogecoin price holds sentimental value, new capital is chasing high-reward, early-stage altcoins with significant upside. Those betting on early-stage altcoins today are laying the foundation for massive portfolio returns tomorrow. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The High-Upside AI Altcoin Set For An Explosive Rally Among all altcoins vying for attention, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out for its 600x upside potential. Backed by an AI utility stack that includes FloppyX for video content creation, Meme-o-Matic for viral meme generation, and FloppyAI for market insights, the token is far beyond a typical altcoin. While the Dogecoin price has matured after years of market presence, FloppyPepe (FPPE) trades at just $0.00000035 in Stage 2 of its presale. With Stage 1 having raised over $2 million, the presale is moving fast, with over $150,000 already secured in the current round. Early adopters are acting quickly, drawn by the rare blend of low entry price and massive upside. The FLOPPY80 bonus further fuels the meme token’s presale excitement, offering 80% more tokens per purchase. With analyst Nass Crypto calling FloppyPepe (FPPE) a top altcoin pick, interest is snowballing; the window to enter before the next price increase is rapidly closing. Why FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Structure Supports Long-Term Gains FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Floppynomics model further boosts its appeal, rewarding holders and reducing supply over time. Each transaction triggers a 1% burn, a 1% redistribution to token holders, and a 1% contribution to wildlife conservation. This multi-pronged structure gives the token long-term staying power. The project has passed a SolidProof smart contract audit , adding credibility and reassuring potential backers. With its link to Matt Furie’s legacy and regularly released hand-drawn art, FloppyPepe (FPPE) gains even more cultural depth. Dogecoin Price Gears Up for a Sudden Move To $2 Currently hovering around $0.227, the Dogecoin price continues to show strong bullish signs, with analysts forecasting a potential surge to $2. That’s an 8.7x move from today’s level, driven by increasing institutional interest and renewed on-chain activity. Technical analysts point to several bullish signals, including a break above the 200-day EMA and increasing open interest. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade further observes that the Dogecoin price mirrors the price action of the last pre-pump structure. All signs suggest that a rapid, potentially violent movement to $2 could be imminent for the Dogecoin price. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Breaking Out of Consolidation While short-term predictions suggest a 32% gain, long-term projections for Shiba Inu (SHIB) point to a possible 600x rise based on prior performance and ecosystem growth. Bullish technical patterns are forming, with Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) RSI indicating room for upward movement. Data from Santiment reveals primary whale interest, with over 530 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) accumulated recently. If this trend continues, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could become one of the top-performing altcoins of the cycle. Altcoin Momentum Is Shifting The Dogecoin price remains a valuable indicator of crypto sentiment, but the spotlight is moving toward altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FloppyPepe (FPPE) . The growing traction from the former’s ecosystem and the latter’s AI-powered utility propels both altcoins toward breakout moments. FloppyPepe (FPPE), in particular, is leading this charge. Its unique AI-powered offerings, with strong presale performance and viral appeal, position it for a possible 600x surge. The low price of $0.00000035 and the FLOPPY80 bonus make the deal even more enticing, as early investors rush in before mainstream awareness catches up. With the crypto market heating up and investor focus shifting, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FloppyPepe (FPPE) are defining the next wave of altcoin success. The chance to enter early, at ground-floor prices, is fleeting.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making. Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies. Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView In late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024 . The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance. Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase. Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Once SOL price enters price discovery, bullish momentum could target the 1.618 extension, suggesting SOL could reach as high as $418. However, failure to hold the 50-week EMA could cause SOL retest the lower support near $157. Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard Chartered Solana traders debate SOL’s next breakout catalyst While Solana continues to trade nearly 40% below its all-time high, SOL futures market activity remains robust. According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility. Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlass Funding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds. Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

If the pattern plays out, the trader warned that SOL could revisit $157 to $152 in the short term. The $180 level remains the critical inflection point. A decisive move above it could confirm a bullish continuation, while rejection may lead to a healthy correction to the $150–$160 range.

The announcement was made at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference on Wednesday at the Venetian Convention Center in Las Vegas by Bilal Bin Saqib, the special assistant to the Pakistani prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency. Saqib announced that Pakistan will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and never sell its BTC trove in future. Furthermore, Pakistan wants to follow in the footsteps of the United States, which intends to implement a strategic Bitcoin reserve to deal with the high debt burden. “We are getting inspired by the U.S. government. We will be holding these Bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” Saqib stated . What Next For Bitcoin Price Action? Bitcoin price experienced a significant resistance level above $110k in the past few days, thus resulting in the ongoing market correction. The flagship coin dropped over 2 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $107k on Wednesday, May 29, during the late North American trading session. Bitcoin price has experienced relentless bearish pressure since last Friday, despite the notable accumulation by institutional investors. Furthermore, more institutional investors, led by GameStop, have joined Strategy in acquiring more BTCs as a hedge against inflation. https://x.com/techcharts/status/1927791497090363555?s=46 According to market analyst, Aksel Kibar, Bitcoin price must clear the resistance hurdle around $109k, in the weekly timeframe, to invalidate a potential retrace towards $76k.

Recently, a significant claim has emerged from Sunil Kavuri , a prominent representative for FTX creditors, drawing a potentially controversial parallel between the trading activities of a well-known Crypto Whale and the infamous strategies of Alameda Research. What Are the Allegations Against James Wynn? The core of the recent stir comes from Sunil Kavuri , who took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to voice his observations. Kavuri specifically pointed towards the trading behavior of James Wynn , a figure recognized within the crypto community, particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid, for executing large trades. Kavuri’s assertion is that Wynn’s trading patterns bear a striking resemblance to the methods employed by Alameda Research , the sister company to the now-defunct FTX exchange. This comparison is highly significant because Alameda Research was at the heart of the FTX collapse, known for its aggressive trading strategies, privileged access to FTX resources, and accusations of market manipulation. The allegations are not just based on observed trading style. Kavuri’s claims are bolstered by past reports suggesting a direct financial link between Wynn and Alameda. According to previous reporting, James Wynn reportedly received payments from Alameda Research as far back as December 2020. While the nature or purpose of these payments hasn’t been explicitly detailed in the recent claims, their existence raises questions about potential prior connections or arrangements. The focus on Wynn’s trading isn’t new. Data analysis firm Lookonchain previously highlighted Wynn’s remarkable, albeit volatile, performance. They reported that Wynn managed to accumulate over $87 million in profits within a concentrated period of just 70 days. However, this period of immense gains was followed by a precipitous decline, with Wynn reportedly losing nearly all of those profits within a mere five days. This kind of rapid, high-stakes profit and loss cycle is precisely the type of volatile trading often associated with the leveraged and aggressive strategies that characterized Alameda Research . For FTX Creditors , any potential link or resemblance to Alameda’s operations is a sensitive point. These creditors are still navigating the complex process of recovering funds lost in the FTX collapse, a collapse largely attributed to the intertwined and allegedly improper relationship between FTX and Alameda Research. Therefore, any suggestion that entities or individuals may have benefited from or mimicked Alameda’s potentially problematic strategies attracts significant attention and concern from those seeking restitution. Why Does an Alameda Research Comparison Matter? Understanding why the comparison to Alameda Research is so potent requires a look back at what Alameda was and how it operated. Alameda was not just a typical trading firm; it was intrinsically linked to FTX, the exchange founded by the same individual, Sam Bankman-Fried. This relationship allegedly afforded Alameda significant advantages, including: Preferential Execution: Some reports and legal filings suggest Alameda had faster access to market data and execution speeds on FTX compared to regular users. Unlimited Credit Line: Crucially, Alameda allegedly had access to a massive, unchecked line of credit from FTX customer funds, allowing it to take on enormous risks without facing margin calls like other traders. Market Making & Liquidity Provision: While providing a legitimate service, their position also gave them deep insight into order books and market dynamics on FTX. Aggressive & Leveraged Trading: Alameda was known for using high leverage, making large directional bets, and engaging in complex trading strategies across various assets. The collapse revealed that the lines between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s balance sheet were blurred, leading to a multi-billion dollar shortfall when Alameda’s risky bets went south. Therefore, when Sunil Kavuri or others suggest that a trader’s style resembles Alameda’s, it implicitly raises questions about: Whether similar high-risk, high-leverage strategies are being employed. Whether the trader might have had access to unique information or advantages. The potential impact of such large-scale, volatile trading on market stability. For FTX Creditors , it could also stir concerns about whether past activities involving Alameda and other parties contributed to the overall financial picture that led to the exchange’s downfall. Who is Sunil Kavuri and Why Are His Claims Significant? Sunil Kavuri is not just a casual observer; he is a vocal and active representative for the interests of FTX Creditors . As part of the official committee representing unsecured creditors in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, Kavuri has been deeply involved in the process of understanding what happened, identifying assets, and advocating for the recovery of funds. His role gives his statements a certain weight, as they come from someone directly engaged in scrutinizing the aftermath of the FTX collapse. Kavuri has been particularly critical of various aspects of the bankruptcy process and has actively sought transparency and accountability regarding the handling of assets and the actions of parties involved with FTX and Alameda. His public statements often aim to shed light on potential issues or connections that he believes are relevant to the creditors’ ability to recover their losses. When Sunil Kavuri makes a claim connecting a current significant trader like James Wynn to the methods of Alameda Research , it’s significant because: It highlights the ongoing scrutiny of individuals and entities who may have had dealings with Alameda or FTX prior to the collapse. It suggests that the trading patterns observed by large players in the market are being watched and analyzed for potential red flags. It underscores the concerns of FTX Creditors that the full picture of Alameda’s activities and its relationships with other market participants has yet to be fully revealed. Kavuri’s position allows him access to information and a platform to raise concerns that resonate with the thousands of individuals and institutions who lost funds on FTX. Examining James Wynn’s Trading Activity: What Does the Data Show? The Lookonchain report provides a concrete example of the kind of volatile trading that has drawn attention to James Wynn . Earning $87 million in profits in 70 days is an extraordinary feat, indicative of highly successful, large-scale, and likely leveraged positions. However, losing nearly all of it in just five days is equally remarkable and speaks to the extreme risk involved. This boom-and-bust cycle, while possible for any high-leverage trader, aligns with the kind of outcomes that characterized Alameda’s performance at times. Alameda was known for making massive, sometimes ill-fated, bets that could result in huge swings in their balance sheet. The sheer scale of Wynn’s reported profits and subsequent losses is what makes the comparison to Alameda’s trading style pertinent. Here’s a simplified look at the reported data: Trader Period Reported Profit/Loss Notes James Wynn 70 Days +$87,000,000+ Rapid accumulation of gains James Wynn Following 5 Days ~-$87,000,000 Near total loss of recent gains This table illustrates the extreme volatility. While we don’t have direct, detailed comparisons of specific trade types or strategies used by Wynn versus documented Alameda trades, the overall pattern of massive, rapid swings in capital is a shared characteristic that fuels the comparison made by Sunil Kavuri . It’s important to note that publicly available data on trading performance, like that provided by Lookonchain, often focuses on realized profits and losses on specific addresses or tracked entities. A complete picture of a trader’s strategy would require much more detailed information, including their use of leverage, specific instruments traded (perpetuals, options, spot), entry and exit points, and risk management techniques (or lack thereof). Are These Allegations Actionable? Challenges and Implications While Sunil Kavuri ‘s claims connecting James Wynn ‘s trading to Alameda Research methods are significant within the community, proving a direct, improper link or actionable wrongdoing based solely on trading style and past payments presents challenges. Here are some points to consider: Proving “Trading Style”: Trading styles can resemble each other without implying collusion or improper advantage. Many large traders use similar high-leverage, high-frequency techniques, especially in volatile markets. Nature of Past Payments: The reported payments from Alameda to Wynn in 2020 would need further investigation. Were they for services rendered (e.g., market making, consulting), investments, or something else? The context is crucial. Lack of Direct Evidence (Publicly): Kavuri’s statement is an observation and a claim. Proving it in a legal or regulatory sense would require concrete evidence of coordinated activity, shared information, or specific instances of market manipulation linked to the alleged connection. Regulatory Interest: Claims like these, especially involving large traders and comparisons to entities involved in a major collapse, could potentially attract the attention of regulatory bodies interested in market integrity and past dealings related to FTX and Alameda. Impact on FTX Creditors: For FTX Creditors , uncovering any assets or past transactions that could potentially be clawed back or that shed light on the collapse is paramount. If there were any improper dealings between Alameda and other parties, identifying them is key to the recovery process. The implications of these allegations extend beyond just Wynn and Alameda. They highlight the ongoing scrutiny of large players in the crypto market, the methods they employ, and their historical connections to now-collapsed entities. They also underscore the persistent efforts of FTX Creditors and their representatives like Sunil Kavuri to piece together the full story of the FTX/Alameda saga and maximize recovery. The crypto market is still grappling with the fallout from 2022, and transparency regarding the activities of major players and defunct firms remains a critical concern for restoring trust and ensuring market health. The allegations against James Wynn , while needing further substantiation, serve as a reminder that the past is still very much relevant to the present state and future regulation of the industry. Conclusion: The Ongoing Shadow of Alameda Research Sunil Kavuri ‘s claims linking James Wynn ‘s trading style to that of Alameda Research have injected a new point of discussion into the crypto community, particularly among those affected by the FTX collapse. The reported past payments from Alameda to Wynn and the documented volatility of Wynn’s trading performance, including rapid nine-figure swings, provide the basis for Kavuri’s comparison. While the resemblance in trading style and historical financial ties do not automatically prove improper conduct, they are sufficient to raise questions and warrant attention, especially from the perspective of FTX Creditors . The shadow of Alameda Research continues to loom large over the crypto space, and any suggestion of its methods or connections resurfacing or influencing current market dynamics is bound to be met with scrutiny. As the FTX bankruptcy proceedings continue and the market matures, transparency, data analysis, and the vigilance of representatives like Sunil Kavuri play a crucial role in understanding past events and potentially identifying ongoing risks or previously undisclosed relationships. The allegations against James Wynn are a stark reminder that the complex web of connections from the 2022 crypto downturn is still being untangled.

TACO trade , which stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” refers to a pattern in which the president announces the imposition of heavy new tariffs, the markets then suffer a significant decline in a short time, and, later, he pauses the tariffs or makes them less severe, causing the market to recover after declining. Reporters asked Trump about the term at the White House. In response, he denied ever backing down, adding that his actions had put the US in a better position in trading discussions. Trump claims the EU accused him of backing down after making a “reasonable” deal with them The European Union is an example of those subjected to Trump’s tariff. EU had just been hit with a 50% US tariff before Trump highlighted two days later that he was hitting a delay button on his new levy. In his comments, the president credited the threat of a 50% tariff as a smart strategy for moving trade talks between the US and the EU. This was after he claimed that after he did what he did, the EU said that they would meet anytime he wanted. Afterward, the president asked, “Do you really think that’s backing down?” “It’s actually called negotiation,” he added after labeling the question “mean.” Trump further stated that it was unfortunate that they said he was backing down when he finally made a more “reasonable” deal with them. He remarked, “That’s just unbelievable.” To demonstrate the TACO trade effect on the EU market, stocks dropped after Trump suggested that the US should impose a high tariff on the EU starting June 1. Later, he announced he would push that deadline back to July 9 at the request of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Following the pause on the tariffs policy, stocks bounced back across major indexes when trade resumed. Trump’s Cabinet members describe his tariffs as a wise negotiation approach Trump’s Cabinet members have greatly supported his tariff policy. Last month, Trump administration officials defended the president’s wide-ranging tariffs that have created chaos on the stock market and fears of a recession, arguing that the import taxes were already forcing dozens of countries to negotiate. They told Americans not to panic as conservatives and liberals raised questions and criticism of tariffs with increasing vigor. Based on Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’s claims, fifty countries contacted the White House to talk with the President due to the trade tariffs. Furthermore, White House senior counselor Peter Navarro urged everyone not to worry, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected forecasts from economists and banks that suggested a recession was coming. The full-court press from cabinet members and advisers came as the administration faced intense pressure to walk back the tariffs, which prompted the largest loss in American stock market wealth since the panicked sell-off as COVID-19 spread in March 2020. Despite the strong support from his Cabinet members, several conservatives are increasingly vocal in opposing Trump’s actions, including an influential legal nonprofit backed by conservatives that is suing Trump over the tariffs, and some Republicans in both the House and the Senate are planning to try to stop the tariffs via legislation.

Bergen County, the most populous county in New Jersey, is making waves by embracing blockchain technology . This isn’t just a small pilot; it’s a major initiative set to transform how hundreds of thousands of property deeds are stored and accessed. What Exactly is Happening with Bergen County Blockchain? Bergen County has partnered with Balcony, a firm specializing in land records on the blockchain. The ambitious plan is to migrate 370,000 property deeds onto the Avalanche blockchain network. To put that into perspective, these deeds represent a staggering $240 billion worth of real estate. This move, as reported by CoinDesk, positions Bergen County as a potential leader in integrating distributed ledger technology into government functions. This project aims to take traditional paper or centralized digital records and place them onto an immutable, transparent, and secure ledger. It’s a step that could have far-reaching implications for property ownership and management in the region. Why Move Property Deeds to the Blockchain? The traditional system for managing property deeds and land records can be complex, slow, and prone to errors or potential fraud. Think about the lengthy process of buying or selling a home, involving title searches, escrow, and significant paperwork. By moving property deeds blockchain , Bergen County is looking to leverage the inherent advantages of this technology: Enhanced Security: Blockchain records are cryptographically secured and extremely difficult to alter once entered. This provides a high level of integrity for official documents like property deeds. Increased Transparency: While specific personal data might be kept off-chain or encrypted, the transaction history and the existence of a deed can be publicly verifiable on the blockchain ledger (depending on the specific implementation). Improved Efficiency: Automating certain processes related to record-keeping and verification could significantly speed up transactions and reduce administrative overhead for the county and residents. Reduced Fraud: The immutable nature of blockchain makes it much harder to forge or tamper with property records. This initiative represents a forward-thinking approach to modernizing essential government services and potentially setting a precedent for other municipalities. How Does Real Estate Blockchain Work in Practice? Putting real estate blockchain isn’t about owning your house with an NFT (at least, not yet!). In this context, it’s about using the blockchain as a secure, shared database for official records. Here’s a simplified view: When a property transaction occurs (sale, transfer, mortgage), the official deed information is digitized. This digital record (or a unique identifier/hash of the record) is then securely anchored onto the blockchain ledger via Balcony’s platform. Each entry is timestamped and linked to the previous one, creating an unbroken, verifiable chain. Anyone with access to the network can verify the existence and history of the record without needing to trust a single central authority (though the county remains the official source). The choice of the Avalanche blockchain is also notable. Avalanche is known for its speed, scalability, and relatively low transaction costs compared to some other networks, making it a suitable choice for handling a large volume of records and potential future activity. What Are the Potential Benefits for Residents and the County? This move isn’t just a technical upgrade; it has practical benefits: For Residents: Potentially faster and more transparent property transactions. Increased confidence in the security and accuracy of official property records. For Bergen County: Streamlined administrative processes, reduced costs associated with managing physical or legacy digital records, enhanced security against data breaches or tampering, and improved public access to non-sensitive record information. For the Real Estate Industry: Could pave the way for faster title searches, more efficient closing processes, and potentially new ways of managing property-related data. This project serves as a tangible example of how blockchain technology can move beyond cryptocurrency speculation and be applied to real-world governmental and administrative functions. Are There Challenges to Implementing Property Deeds on Blockchain? While the benefits are clear, transitioning to a property deeds blockchain system isn’t without its hurdles: Legal Framework: Does state law recognize a blockchain record as the official, legal deed? This often requires updates to existing statutes. Integration Complexity: Connecting the new blockchain system with existing county databases and workflows can be technically challenging. Data Privacy: Ensuring sensitive personal information is handled according to privacy regulations while still leveraging the transparency of blockchain. Adoption and Education: County staff, real estate professionals, and the public need to understand how the new system works. Long-term Maintenance: Ensuring the blockchain infrastructure remains secure and accessible for decades to come. Bergen County and Balcony will need to navigate these challenges carefully to ensure a successful and compliant implementation. What Does This Mean for the Future of Real Estate and Government Records? The Bergen County initiative could be a significant case study. If successful, it could inspire other counties and states to explore similar applications of real estate blockchain . Imagine a future where property records across the country are easily verifiable and securely stored on distributed ledgers, drastically simplifying interstate transactions and reducing administrative burdens. This project highlights a growing trend: governments exploring blockchain for various uses, from supply chain tracking to digital identity and now, land records. The choice of the Avalanche blockchain for such a large-scale governmental use case also underscores the increasing maturity and adoption of specific blockchain networks for enterprise and public sector applications. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward Bergen County’s decision to place 370,000 property deeds representing $240 billion onto the Avalanche blockchain is a bold and potentially transformative step. It demonstrates a willingness to embrace innovative blockchain technology to improve efficiency, security, and transparency in a critical government function. While challenges remain, the potential benefits for residents, the county, and the broader real estate sector are substantial. This project is a compelling example of how blockchain can move from theoretical potential to practical application in the public sector, setting a precedent for the future of digital record-keeping.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,100 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the period of altcoin underperformance against Bitcoin is almost over based on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart. The BTC.D chart tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. A bearish BTC.D indicates that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. According to Van de Poppe, altcoins are now poised to outpace Bitcoin as the BTC.D chart is flashing a bearish reversal signal on the weekly chart. “The end of the bear market (yes, a bear market on altcoins underperforming Bitcoin) is still here. Strong bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance, implying we’re about to reverse and altcoins about to shine. Nothing has changed.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 63.89%. Looking at Bitcoin, the trader thinks BTC will retest a key psychological area as support before rallying to fresh record-high levels. “I’m monitoring the current price action and I won’t be surprised if we’re seeing a slight correction happening on Bitcoin. Probably macro-driven or whatever reason, but I wouldn’t be surprised to build some more stamina before we continue the rally to $120,000-$130,000.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $109,112. As for Ethereum ( ETH ), the analyst says a correction toward the $2,000 price level would present a solid opportunity for long-term investors. “Similarly, I think it’s vital that, if ETH drops beneath $2,400, that will give a tremendous opportunity. Ethereum rallied from $1,800 to $2,700 in a few days. If there’s a 10-20% correction, pretty normal, great opportunity to get yourself positioned into it.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,663.

While immediate attention often focuses on geopolitical factors like US chip export controls , experts suggest there’s a more fundamental indicator of Nvidia’s future health tucked within the report: the adoption and delivery success of its cutting-edge Nvidia AI hardware . Why Focus Shifts Beyond US Chip Export Controls The headlines frequently highlight the impact of trade restrictions, particularly concerning China, on Nvidia’s international business. These restrictions undoubtedly create short-term market volatility. However, veteran observers like Kevin Cook, a senior equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, argue that the long-term picture is less about navigating these hurdles and more about core demand for their technology. Cook notes that Nvidia’s stock has shown remarkable resilience, quickly recovering from dips related to export control news. He believes the company has a significant ‘moat’ and is less vulnerable to these issues than many might think. Even with potential limitations in one market, strong demand persists elsewhere. Consider these points: Immediate stock reactions to export news are often temporary. Nvidia has a broad customer base, including major global hyperscalers. New projects, like the Stargate initiative in the Middle East, demonstrate demand outside restricted regions. Therefore, while US chip export controls are worth monitoring for immediate market impact, they may not be the defining factor for Nvidia’s valuation down the line. Introducing Key Nvidia AI Hardware: The GB200 NVL72 Instead of solely focusing on export issues, Cook points to the rollout of new Nvidia AI hardware as a more significant metric. Specifically, he highlights the GB200 NVL72. This isn’t just another chip; it’s a powerful, single-rack exascale computer system designed for massive AI workloads. Key details about the GB200 NVL72: It includes 72 high-performance GPUs. The estimated cost is around $3 million per unit. Shipments began in February. This system represents the forefront of AI infrastructure, and its adoption rate provides crucial insight into how quickly and aggressively enterprises are investing in next-generation AI capabilities. Tracking GB200 NVL72 Deliveries in Nvidia Earnings The upcoming Nvidia earnings report will be the first opportunity to get concrete data on GB200 NVL72 shipments. This is uncharted territory, making the delivery numbers particularly important. Analyst expectations for this unit have seen significant adjustments. According to Cook, events earlier in the year led many analysts to halve their initial delivery estimates for the GB200 NVL72. This makes the actual reported figures even more critical. What numbers should observers watch for? A delivery target of 10,000 units in the next quarter would be seen as very impressive by the market, representing potentially $30 billion in revenue from this product alone. Cook, however, anticipates a more conservative number, possibly less than 5,000 units initially. The reported delivery figures and future guidance for the GB200 NVL72 will offer the first real glimpse into the initial success and production ramp-up of this significant new product. Gauging Enterprise AI Demand: The Upgrade Cycle Question Beyond the raw numbers, the adoption rate of the GB200 NVL72 speaks to a larger trend: the nature of Enterprise AI demand . Will companies treat AI hardware upgrades like consumers treat smartphone upgrades, consistently buying the latest and most powerful systems? Or will they adopt a slower, more measured approach? This question is fundamental to Nvidia’s long-term growth trajectory. If enterprises rapidly adopt new generations of AI chips and hardware, it ensures a continuous revenue stream and sustains Nvidia’s leading position. A slower upgrade cycle, on the other hand, could impact future growth forecasts and valuation. The early delivery numbers for the GB200 NVL72 will start to paint a picture of this crucial enterprise behavior, offering insights far more impactful than short-term fluctuations caused by export controls. Looking Beyond the Headlines in Nvidia Earnings While market narratives often simplify complex situations, the upcoming Nvidia earnings report requires a nuanced view. The immediate reaction will likely be tied to guidance related to US chip export controls and overall revenue figures. However, for those looking at Nvidia’s long-term potential and the broader trend of Enterprise AI demand , the details surrounding the delivery and adoption of cutting-edge Nvidia AI hardware like the GB200 NVL72 are arguably more telling. As Cook puts it, if deliveries are expected to be steady to exceptional, it suggests strong underlying momentum for the rest of the year, potentially overshadowing quarterly revenue fluctuations. In conclusion, while export restrictions create noise, the true signal for Nvidia’s future, and a key indicator of the pace of enterprise AI adoption, lies in the performance of its newest, most powerful systems like the GB200 NVL72. This is the data point that could truly shape perceptions of Nvidia’s resilience and growth potential in the coming years.

GME price spiked 15% post-delisting despite earlier dip during low-volume trading. The delisting aligns with Bybit’s broader removal of low-cap tokens amid stricter compliance reviews. Bybit officially delisted the GME/USDT perpetual contract on March 25, 2025, at 9:00 AM UTC. The exchange confirmed that all trading, open orders, and bot activity tied to the contract were disabled. Positions were auto-closed using the 30-minute average index price before delisting. Bybit’s move impacted users involved in trading GME derivatives. Traders saw their positions forcibly closed, with no option to manage exposure or adjust stop-loss levels ahead of time. Immediate Aftermath: Sudden GME Price Spike Despite the delisting, the GME token saw a surprising 15% jump within hours. Before delisting, GME traded near $0.0026. It then surged to a peak above $0.0033, according to CoinMarketCap data, before settling at $0.0030.

At the core of any company’s financial health lies the general ledger system. This crucial software acts as the central repository for all financial transactions, providing the essential data required for accurate financial reporting. Why is the General Ledger So Important? Think of the general ledger as the operational heart of a company’s finance function. It’s where every debit and credit is recorded, categorized, and summarized. Without a robust and accurate general ledger, generating essential financial statements like the balance sheet and income statement becomes challenging, if not impossible. For a long time, venture capitalists were hesitant to invest in startups building new general ledger software. Why? Because convincing companies to switch from their existing systems is difficult. As Julien Bek, a partner at Sequoia Capital, put it, asking a company to replace its general ledger is like performing “open-heart surgery.” Building a new general ledger business from scratch is also a complex undertaking. How Rillet Changes the Game with AI Accounting Julien Bek’s perspective shifted when he encountered Rillet. This three-year-old company is leveraging machine learning and generative AI to transform the automation of accounting reports. Rillet doesn’t aim to just tweak existing processes; it aims to streamline them fundamentally. Here’s how Rillet’s AI accounting solution works: It directly pulls data from various sources like banks and platforms (Salesforce, Stripe, Ramp, Brex, Rippling). It uses machine learning and AI to process and analyze this data. It automatically generates core financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements. Nicolas Kopp, Rillet’s founder, notes that this approach allows accounting and finance teams at medium-sized companies to complete their monthly or quarterly book closures in mere hours, a process that traditionally took weeks. This dramatic speed improvement is a direct result of their advanced AI automation . Securing Significant Fintech Funding Rillet recently announced a significant step in its growth journey, raising a $25 million Series A funding round. This round was led by Sequoia Capital, with participation from existing investors. This fresh capital comes just 10 months after the company secured a $13.5 million seed and pre-seed round from investors like First Round Capital, Creandum, and Susa Ventures. This substantial Fintech funding underscores investor confidence in Rillet’s technology and market approach. Replacing Legacy General Ledger Systems A key factor driving Rillet’s success and investor interest is its ability to effectively replace legacy general ledger systems. Nicolas Kopp previously served as U.S. CEO of European neobank N26, bringing valuable experience in the financial technology sector. Since launching its product last year, Rillet has seen its revenue grow five-fold and acquired nearly 200 customers. Notable customers include fast-growing tech companies like Windsurf (reportedly sold to OpenAI) and Decagon (an AI customer support startup). Companies of this size would historically have likely relied on older software like NetSuite, a system developed in the late 1990s that remains prevalent among mid-sized businesses despite being perceived as slow and clunky. According to Sequoia’s Julien Bek, a significant portion of Rillet’s new deals come from companies actively replacing NetSuite or similar legacy systems. This capability to win over larger customers previously anchored to older platforms was a critical data point that helped Sequoia decide to invest. Accounting Automation Made Easier One of the biggest hurdles in switching general ledger software is the migration process. Transferring years of financial data can take months, creating significant disruption. Rillet’s AI-driven approach simplifies this, reducing the data transfer time to about four to six weeks. Clients can continue using their old platform until they are confident all data has been successfully moved to Rillet. This streamlined process makes accounting automation transitions far less daunting. Rillet currently competes with legacy platforms like NetSuite but appears to have a competitive edge by leveraging AI and machine learning specifically for mid-size companies. While other AI accounting startups exist, like Digits, they currently target different market segments, such as small businesses using QuickBooks and Xero. Summary: The Future of Finance Operations Rillet’s successful funding round highlights the increasing importance of AI and machine learning in automating core business functions like accounting. By tackling the complex challenge of the general ledger, Rillet offers a faster, more efficient alternative to traditional systems. Their rapid growth and ability to attract significant investment and customers like Windsurf and Decagon demonstrate a clear market need for advanced AI accounting solutions. As businesses continue to scale rapidly, especially in dynamic sectors like Fintech and AI, solutions that automate and accelerate financial closing processes will become indispensable.

While the crypto space explores decentralized innovation, traditional software is also undergoing a significant transformation driven by AI. A prime example is Context AI , a startup making waves in the productivity sector. This week, Context announced a substantial funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in its vision for a new kind of AI office suite . Context AI Lands Significant Startup Funding Context, the company developing this AI-powered office suite, officially announced on Wednesday that it successfully closed an $11 million seed funding round. This significant injection of capital was led by Lux Capital, a prominent venture capital firm known for investing in frontier technologies. Additional participation came from notable investors including Qualcomm Ventures and General Catalyst. This latest round brings Context’s total funding raised to approximately $15.75 million. The seed round values the young company at $70 million, a notable valuation for a startup at this stage, highlighting the perceived potential of their AI office suite concept. Why Build a New AI Office Suite? The founder, Joseph Semrai, a Thiel Fellow, began working on Context in 2024. His motivation stemmed from a clear observation: existing digital office suites, while widely used, weren’t originally built with the capabilities of modern AI models in mind. Semrai noted in an interview that we currently use a collection of separate applications not necessarily designed to leverage the full power of AI. The core idea behind Context is to take advantage of large AI context windows and the ability of models to work across multiple applications simultaneously. This approach aims to achieve better results than using disparate tools individually. The goal is to create a unified environment where AI is not just an add-on feature but a fundamental part of the workflow. How Context AI Differs from Existing AI Productivity Tools Over the past few years, many productivity and browsing applications have adopted chat-based interfaces, inspired by the success of AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Major players like Google and Microsoft have integrated AI features into their suites. Creative tools like Canva are expanding into general office work with AI, and Notion is building enterprise features like AI search. Many of these existing tools offer connectors to third-party applications, enabling users to pull in data. However, Semrai points out that while data retrieval is becoming easier, the ability to *analyze* and *reason* over that data effectively isn’t always robust in current tools. This is where Context AI aims to differentiate itself. It is specifically designed to make it easier for users to understand the data they gather from various sources and make informed decisions based on that analysis. Key Features of the Context AI Platform Context features a simple, clean interface centered around a chat box. Users interact with the AI tool primarily through conversation. Here are some of its core capabilities: Research: Ask the AI to perform research using your own documents, connected applications, and web knowledge. Content Generation: Convert research findings and data into documents, spreadsheets, or presentations. Iterative Workflow: Continue interacting with the AI to refine and generate different versions or artifacts based on the initial output. Python Interpreter: Includes a built-in Python interpreter, allowing users to run code for more complex data manipulation or analysis directly within the suite. Context isn’t necessarily trying to replace comprehensive suites like Microsoft 365 entirely. Instead, it targets a specific market need for AI-native data analysis and content creation workflows that existing tools don’t fully address. Availability and Pricing for Context AI Context is designed to be a powerful tool for workers, similar to how specialized tools like Cursor have become valuable for programmers. The company is also working on features like an offline mode for its desktop app, which would enable simple analysis and document drafting using existing local data and documents, a capability not common among many AI-powered data analysis products. Interested users can explore Context AI through a free tier. This provides 50 credits, one workspace, and support for up to 10 team members. For more extensive use, a paid plan is available at $20 per month. This subscription offers 2,000 credits and removes limits on the number of workspaces and team members. The Road Ahead for Context AI and AI Productivity Tools The substantial startup funding secured by Context underscores the high level of interest and investment flowing into the AI productivity space. With Lux Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, and General Catalyst backing their vision, Context is well-positioned to develop its platform further and challenge existing paradigms in office software. Their focus on AI-native analysis and cross-application reasoning could potentially redefine how we interact with our data and create content in the future.

Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altseason-loading-analyst-explains-how-ftx-5b-distribution-may-trigger-the-next-bull-leg/,"As Bitcoin and Ethereum hover near critical resistance levels, market sentiment is shifting rapidly. Analysts are now calling for an incoming Altseason, with bullish momentum building across the board, even as macroeconomic uncertainty continues to rattle global markets. Despite rising treasury yields and geopolitical tensions, crypto assets are showing strength, and altcoins appear poised to benefit next. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Top analyst Axel Bitblaze has spotlighted May 30th as a potentially defining moment in this cycle. This week, over $5 billion in stablecoins will be distributed to FTX creditors—a massive injection of liquidity representing nearly 2% of the entire stablecoin supply. Unlike previous events, this capital is expected to stay within the crypto ecosystem. Most of these investors remained in crypto despite the FTX collapse. Now, as they regain access to their funds, many are likely to rotate that capital back into the market. With Bitcoin targeting $120K and Ethereum challenging the $3,000 level, the stage is set for capital to flow into high-beta altcoins and push for an Altseason. Altcoins Setup Strengthens Ahead Of $5B FTX Liquidity Injection The FTX collapse in late 2022 was a brutal event, marking the climax of the previous bear market. It triggered mass panic, billions in liquidations, and the final capitulation that ultimately set the bottom of the cycle. While devastating in the short term, it paved the way for recovery. Now, nearly two years later, May 30th may become the most important day of this new phase. FTX is distributing over $5 billion in stablecoins to creditors this week—a long-awaited step in the bankruptcy process. These payouts represent nearly 2% of the total stablecoin supply and will hit the market in one large wave. But this isn’t just idle money returning to passive holders. Most of these users remained in crypto through the storm. They didn’t leave—they adapted, held, and now, they’re getting liquidity back in the middle of a bullish setup. The timing couldn’t be better. Ethereum is pumping, flirting with a critical resistance level that, if broken, could confirm a major move for altcoins. Bitcoin is hovering near its all-time highs, altcoins are gaining serious traction, pro-crypto narratives are heating up in Washington, and regulatory progress is finally in motion. Everything is aligning at once. Bitblaze explains that this $5B return of capital could be the exact catalyst the market needs. In his view, this sudden injection of liquidity could send Bitcoin toward $120K—and unlock the altseason traders have been waiting for. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? Ethereum Eyes $2,700 Breakout As Altseason Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,638, consolidating just below a key resistance zone at $2,700. After a sharp rally in early May, ETH has held its gains and formed a solid base above the 34 EMA ($2,331) and key moving averages. The 200-day SMA, sitting at $2,697, now acts as a critical ceiling for price action. A clean breakout above this level would mark the first major reclaim of the long-term trend line since the bull cycle resumed, potentially unlocking a powerful continuation for ETH and the broader altcoin market. Volume has remained steady throughout this consolidation phase, indicating buyer interest and positioning ahead of a decisive move. ETH’s structure shows higher lows and strong bullish follow-through, suggesting that momentum is building just beneath the surface. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? If Ethereum can close above $2,700 with conviction, it would not only confirm a breakout but could also trigger broader market rotation into altcoins. Historically, ETH breaking above major resistance levels has been a strong leading indicator for altseason. With Bitcoin hovering near ATHs and macro conditions favoring digital assets, ETH’s next move could be the spark that ignites a new wave of altcoin rallies across the board.

Meanwhile, Jupiter is inching closer to a possible bullish breakout. This piece delves into whether these cryptocurrencies are poised for a change in direction, creating a buzz among investors looking for growth opportunities. Explore the upcoming trends and what could trigger these movements. Solana's Price Dynamics: A Month of Recovery After Long-Term Declines Solana saw an 18.09% price increase over the last month, showing signs of renewed market interest. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a 26.46% decline, reflecting a sustained downward trend. The recent monthly bounce indicates a possible short-term turnaround against the backdrop of a longer period of weakness. SOL is currently trading between approximately $110 and $171, with nearby resistance at $195 and firm support around $72. Recent weekly gains of 3.71% suggest some bullish movement, though bears may still exert influence. Traders might consider entering near support levels and looking for profit opportunities as the price approaches resistance. Jupiter's 1-Month Surge Amidst a 6-Month Decline Jupiter experienced a significant 33.11% jump over the past month, despite a sharp decline of 45.43% over the last six months. Recent price action shows contrasting trends, with the short-term strength highlighting its ability to recover while still facing long-term bearish pressure. The coin's history has been marked by volatility, where rapid gains often followed by equally significant losses create uncertainty in its movement. Current prices fluctuate between $0.34 and $0.55, with resistance positioned at $0.63 and support around $0.22. The RSI reading at 64.78 indicates a slight bullish momentum, yet the overall trend remains unclear. Traders may look to engage at resistance near $0.63 while monitoring the support level at $0.22 for potential trading opportunities. Conclusion SOL is testing a key support level, and its future movement is crucial. It needs to hold this support to avoid a drop. In contrast, JUP is nearing a bullish breakout point. This suggests potential upward movement if the breakout happens. Both coins are at critical stages, with SOL needing to maintain support and JUP poised for possible gains.

Onchain data shared with Cointelegraph by the class group’s lawyer, Max Burwick, shows nearly $57 million worth of USDC ( USDC ) was frozen on May 28 after a Manhattan court agreed to a temporary freeze. “Yesterday, a federal court in SDNY [Southern District of New York] entered a Temporary Restraining Order at our request, Burwick Law, supported by Tim Treanor, freezing approximately 57.65 million USDC held at Circle,“ Burwick told Cointelegraph. He added that the court is scheduled to hold a hearing on June 9 to determine whether the assets will remain frozen as the class-action lawsuit progresses. Burwick is representing Omar Hurlock and other plaintiffs in a class-action suit against crypto venture firm Kelsier Ventures and its three sibling co-founders, Gideon, Thomas and Hayden Davis, on March 17, alleging they created the Libra (LIBRA) cryptocurrency and misled investors to siphon over $100 million from one-sided liquidity pools. The suit also named blockchain infrastructure companies, KIP Protocol and its CEO, Julian Peh, along with Meteora and its co-founder, Benjamin Chow, as defendants. Chow’s lawyer, Kelsier Ventures and KIP Protocol were contacted for comment. LIBRA reached a $4 billion market cap following an X post from Argentine President Javier Milei on Feb. 14 before crashing 94% hours later. The saga caused a political scandal for Milei, prompting members of Argentina’s opposition party to call for his impeachment, though little traction was gained beyond those statements. Data from polling platform Zuban Córdoba in March suggested that the Libra scandal negatively impacted Milei’s image and the national management approval rating. Two Solana wallets with total USDC balances worth $57.65 million were frozen on May 28 at 3:15 am and 3:18 am UTC. Data from Solana’s blockchain explorer, Solscan, shows that the address “3Fwr…ZQpK” had $44.59 million worth of the stablecoin frozen, while a little over $13 million was frozen from the wallet address “3nHw…xNgH.” Both wallets were frozen by the Multisig Freeze Authority, Solscan data shows. Milei closes Libra investigation in Argentina On May 19, Milei signed a decree to shut down a task force established to investigate the Libra scandal . Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard Chartered No action was taken against Milei or any other Argentine official allegedly tied to the scandal. However, some critics say a legitimate investigation wasn’t properly conducted in the first place. “It was always a fake, they never dared to investigate anything at all, and they’re covering each other up because they’re completely up to their necks in it,” Itai Hagman, an economist and member of the Chamber of Deputies of Argentina, said in a May 20 X post.

Coinbase, a leading name in the crypto industry, has just rolled out a significant new offering designed specifically for developers and businesses looking to integrate crypto functionality into their applications. This isn’t just another user-facing wallet; it’s a powerful piece of Web3 infrastructure aimed at simplifying one of the most complex aspects of decentralized application development: wallet management. Dubbed ‘CDP Wallets’ (though more broadly referred to as Coinbase Developer Wallets ), this new service provides a robust, API-driven infrastructure. Think of it as a backend service that allows developers to programmatically create and manage wallets for their users or applications without ever having to touch sensitive private keys or build complex wallet infrastructure from scratch. This is a potential game-changer for speeding up Web3 adoption and making it easier for traditional companies and startups alike to enter the space. What Makes Coinbase Developer Wallets Different? Traditionally, building an application that interacts with blockchain requires managing wallets. This involves handling private keys, ensuring their security, managing gas fees, tracking transactions, and dealing with various network complexities. It’s a significant burden that requires specialized expertise and introduces considerable security risks. Coinbase Developer Wallets aim to abstract away these complexities. Here’s a breakdown of the core concept: API-First Approach: Developers interact with the wallet infrastructure through a set of well-documented APIs. This means standard coding calls, not deep blockchain node management. Programmable Functionality: The wallets aren’t just passive storage. They are designed to be programmable, allowing developers to automate transactions, interact with smart contracts, and integrate wallet actions directly into their application logic. This is key for building dynamic Web3 experiences. Abstracted Key Management: Perhaps the most significant feature is that developers do not directly handle or store the private keys for the wallets they create using this service. Coinbase manages the underlying key infrastructure securely, reducing the developer’s security surface area and compliance burden. Scalability: Built on Coinbase’s existing robust infrastructure, the service is designed to scale with the needs of growing applications. Why Are Programmable Wallets a Game-Changer for Developers? The ability to have Programmable Wallets opens up a world of possibilities that were previously difficult or risky to implement. For many applications, you don’t just need a place to hold assets; you need wallets that can *do* things automatically based on application logic. Consider these scenarios: Gaming: Automatically distributing in-game rewards (tokens or NFTs) to player wallets based on achievements. Marketplaces: Facilitating escrow services or automated payments between buyers and sellers upon fulfillment conditions. DeFi Protocols: Allowing applications to execute complex DeFi strategies on behalf of users (with their permission) without requiring constant manual interaction. Loyalty Programs: Issuing tokenized loyalty points or rewards to customers seamlessly as part of their purchase or interaction history. Before programmable infrastructure like this, implementing such features often required developers to build complex backend systems for transaction signing and key management, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors and security breaches. Programmable Wallets shift the focus from infrastructure plumbing to building core application features. Leveraging the Crypto API for Seamless Integration The foundation of the Coinbase Developer Wallets offering is its Crypto API . APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the standard way software applications talk to each other. By providing a comprehensive API, Coinbase allows developers to integrate wallet creation, management, and transaction initiation into their existing backend systems using familiar programming paradigms. Instead of needing deep knowledge of blockchain nodes, transaction formats for various chains, gas estimation, and private key cryptography, developers can use simple API calls like: createWallet() sendTransaction(walletId, recipientAddress, amount, tokenType) getWalletBalance(walletId) listTransactions(walletId) signMessage(walletId, message) This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers who are new to Web3 but experienced in traditional software development. The Crypto API handles the underlying blockchain interactions, making the process much smoother and faster. Addressing Core Web3 Infrastructure Challenges Building reliable and scalable Web3 applications involves more than just writing smart contracts. The Web3 Infrastructure layer – including nodes, transaction relays, gas management, and data indexing – is notoriously complex and expensive to manage. Many companies struggle with the operational overhead and technical debt associated with maintaining this infrastructure. Coinbase Developer Wallets tackle several of these challenges head-on: Challenges Addressed by Coinbase Developer Wallets: Challenge How CDP Wallets Help Private Key Security Coinbase manages keys in secure environments, removing the burden from developers. Blockchain Node Management Developers interact via API, abstracting away the need to run or manage nodes. Transaction Reliability Infrastructure handles transaction broadcasting, retries, and monitoring. Multi-Chain Complexity A single API interface can potentially support multiple blockchain networks over time. Scalability Issues Leverages Coinbase’s scalable backend infrastructure. By providing a managed wallet service as part of its broader Web3 Infrastructure offerings (like Coinbase Cloud), Coinbase allows businesses to focus on their core product or service rather than becoming blockchain infrastructure experts. How Does This Ensure a Secure Wallet Environment? Security is paramount in the crypto space, and managing private keys is arguably the biggest security challenge. A single mistake can lead to the loss of all assets associated with a wallet. By offering a Secure Wallet solution where Coinbase handles the private key management, developers can significantly reduce their risk exposure. Coinbase has years of experience in securing digital assets at scale. They employ sophisticated security measures, including hardware security modules (HSMs), multi-party computation (MPC), strict access controls, and ongoing security audits. While developers still need to secure their own API keys and application backend, they are no longer responsible for the cryptographic keys that directly control the funds within the wallets created via the service. This model provides a different security profile compared to self-custodial solutions where the user holds their keys or developer-managed custodial solutions where the developer holds the keys. For many applications, especially those targeting mainstream users or businesses where ease of use and regulatory compliance are critical, a managed, Secure Wallet infrastructure like this offers a compelling trade-off. Benefits for Developers and Businesses Let’s summarize the key advantages of using Coinbase Developer Wallets : Accelerated Development: Get to market faster by using pre-built, reliable wallet infrastructure. Reduced Security Burden: Offload private key management to a specialized, secure provider. Lower Operational Costs: Avoid the expense and complexity of running and maintaining your own blockchain nodes and wallet systems. Enhanced Functionality: Easily integrate programmable wallet actions into your application logic via a simple Crypto API . Focus on Innovation: Free up your development team to build unique features and user experiences instead of infrastructure. Scalability: Rely on Coinbase’s battle-tested infrastructure to grow with your application. Potential Considerations and Challenges While the benefits are significant, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Centralization: Relying on Coinbase introduces a degree of centralization, which might be a philosophical concern for some in the Web3 space. Cost: While potentially cheaper than building from scratch, there will be costs associated with using the service (likely based on API calls, transactions, or number of wallets). Customization Limitations: A managed service might not offer the same level of granular control as a self-built solution. Vendor Lock-in: Migrating away from the service later could present challenges. Learning Curve: Developers still need to learn the specific Coinbase API and best practices for interacting with the service. Businesses and developers should carefully evaluate these points against their specific needs, technical capabilities, and risk tolerance. Examples of What You Can Build The possibilities are vast. Here are a few concrete examples where Coinbase Developer Wallets could be instrumental: Application Type How CDP Wallets Fit In Simplified Process NFT Marketplace Creating wallets for users upon signup, handling automated minting and transfer fees. No need to manage individual user private keys or run minting nodes. Web3 Gaming Platform Issuing in-game currency or item tokens, managing player balances, facilitating peer-to-peer trades. Automated token distribution and secure player asset management via API. Decentralized Social Media Allowing users to earn tokens for content, tipping creators, managing token-gated access. Easy token transfers and balance tracking integrated into the social platform. Supply Chain Solution Recording asset transfers or events on-chain, managing tokenized inventory. Programmable transactions triggered by real-world events, managed securely. These are just a few examples, highlighting how abstracting wallet infrastructure allows developers to focus on the unique value proposition of their application. Actionable Insights for Developers If you’re a developer or business looking to build in the Web3 space, here’s what you should consider: Explore the Documentation: Head over to the Coinbase Cloud documentation to understand the CDP Wallets features, supported chains, and API specifications in detail. Start Small: Consider integrating the service for a specific feature or a pilot project to evaluate its suitability for your needs. Assess Costs: Understand the pricing model to factor it into your project’s budget. Security Best Practices: While Coinbase handles key management, ensure your own application’s security, especially around API key management and user authentication. Evaluate Trade-offs: Weigh the benefits of speed and reduced complexity against the implications of using a centralized, managed service. This launch signifies a maturing of the Web3 ecosystem, where infrastructure providers are stepping up to offer services that make development more accessible and secure. Conclusion: A Step Towards Mass Adoption? The introduction of Coinbase Developer Wallets is a significant development. By offering a secure, programmable, and API-driven wallet infrastructure that removes the burden of private key management and complex node operations, Coinbase is directly addressing major pain points for developers and businesses building in Web3. This move has the potential to lower the barrier to entry, accelerate innovation, and pave the way for more sophisticated and user-friendly decentralized applications. While considerations around centralization and cost remain, the promise of simplified development and enhanced security offered by these Programmable Wallets built on robust Web3 Infrastructure is compelling. As the ecosystem continues to evolve, solutions like this, leveraging a powerful Crypto API , will likely play a crucial role in bringing Web3 technology to a wider audience, ensuring a more Secure Wallet future for integrated applications.

Following the recent rally to a new all-time high, there has been a notable improvement in the BTC’s Coinbase Premium Index. Positive Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Bitcoin’s price may have experienced a slight pullback, but several key aspects still indicate a potential continuation of its recent upward trend. As the flagship digital asset gears up for an extended rally, Alphractal, an on-chain data analytics platform, mentions that a key market indicator is flashing signs of renewed investors’ interest. In its post on X, the platform announced that Bitcoin’s Coinbase Premium Index has returned to positive territory after rallying to a new all-time high. This bullish shift has ignited newfound optimism in the market, generating more interest in the crypto giant. Specifically, the Coinbase Premium Index is a crucial market indicator that calculates the difference in Bitcoin’s price on the Coinbase exchange and other international crypto exchanges. The index’s move into positive territory implies that many traders in the United States are once again paying more to purchase BTC. “During Bitcoin’s latest rally , the Coinbase Premium Index turned positive again, signaling significant buying pressure from the U.S. market,” the platform stated. Alphractal noted that when the metric is positive, as it is now, it indicates that BTC is trading at a premium on the Coinbase exchange, which represents stronger demand from US-based markets. Such a pattern is frequently linked to institutional accumulation and an increase in local demand. According to the on-chain expert, the shift is a signal worth paying close attention to in the recent market trends. Presently, the development provides Bitcoin’s ongoing upward trend an additional boost and may support the current bullish market sentiment. With the growing adoption and interest in BTC from US investors, the flagship asset could be poised for another major rally as seen in past scenarios, suggesting that the bull market is not yet over. A Resurgence Of BTC’s Whale Investors Heightened interest has gained steam among major BTC investors . While prices have briefly declined, the number of whale wallet addresses holding 1,000 BTC or more has started to climb once again, a trend that signals renewed conviction in the asset. A recent report from Glassnode shows that these large investors have begun increasing after dropping in late April. From late April till now, this cohort rose to 1,455 even as BTC’s price surged to a new all-time high days ago. This increase amidst the current consolidation phase raises the possibility that long-term investors and institutional players are capitalizing on recent price swings and preparing for a future change in the market. Since growing whale accumulation has historically led to major moves, this development could be a bullish indication of a sustained uptrend.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|coinbase exchange|Glassnode,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-29 01:00:10

It’s not just about charts and volume anymore. It’s about what these coins are doing, on-chain activity, tech rollouts, partnerships, and how they’re handling tough market cycles. And let’s be honest, a lot of coins look shiny but don’t really offer value. That’s why we’ve put together this list, Unstaked, Filecoin, Litecoin, and Toncoin. Each of them brings something different to the table, from AI-powered community agents to real-world data storage solutions and strong technical patterns. If you want to spot coins that are pushing forward, not stalling, this is where to start. Let’s break down the top crypto coins to invest in right now and why they’re worth a serious look. This isn’t about jumping on bandwagons, it’s about staying ahead with projects that are actually building something that matters. 1. Unstaked – The AI Edge You Can Own Unstaked is changing the game by giving crypto real-world utility. At its core are autonomous AI agents that run 24/7 across platforms like X and Telegram. These agents engage with communities, manage support, post updates, and grow online presence, all without human labor. Every action they take is tracked on-chain, and users are rewarded in $UNSD based on actual engagement. At just $10–$25/month, these agents are way cheaper than hiring community managers and offer up to 100x in yearly cost savings. That’s real value, not just hype. The project is currently in Stage 15 of its presale with the token priced at $0.009831. So far, Unstaked has raised over $7.8 million and sold around 860 million tokens. With a projected launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are looking at a potential 27x ROI. Add to that a fair launch model (no private sales, no VC deals), and Unstaked becomes one of the most accessible and high-upside entries in 2025. You’ll need $UNSD to deploy, upgrade, and govern agents, which locks the token into the ecosystem’s daily use. Unstaked isn’t just promising, it’s already delivering. No question it’s one of the top crypto coins to invest in right now. 2. Filecoin – Real Utility with Web3 Storage Filecoin continues to stand out with actual usage in the decentralized storage sector. Trading between $2.80 and $2.85 this May, it’s holding ground while integrating with some of the biggest Web3 players. In May 2025, Filecoin launched its Avalanche bridge, letting smart contracts on Avalanche tap into Filecoin’s decentralized storage, adding verifiable, low-cost, and compliant-grade storage solutions. And they’ve just completed the “Teep” network upgrade, bringing faster finality, simplified economics for storage providers, and better tools for developers. It’s not just another update, it makes the protocol more usable, and that matters in this market. The Fil+ program is also seeing big moves, with a new Experimental Pathway Metaallocator system to speed up Datacap access and grow the ecosystem. Meanwhile, major AI companies like SingularityNET and GoKite AI are using Filecoin for transparent, decentralized storage. When AI and blockchain projects start stacking together, it’s a good sign. Considering its strong roadmap and current price stability, Filecoin should absolutely be on your radar if you’re looking at the top crypto coins to invest in with a long-term view. 3. Litecoin – The Veteran Still Holding Strong Litecoin might not be flashy, but it’s proving that solid fundamentals still count. Right now, LTC is trading around $96.47, up 1.57% in the last 24 hours, with technical analysts tracking a breakout above the $96 level. If it holds, there’s potential for a rally to $120 or even $128. Some long-term projections even suggest $200+ if Bitcoin starts climbing above $150K later this year. Even with all the newer coins out there, Litecoin still pulls daily transaction numbers over 500,000. That’s not a stat you can ignore. Network usage is up, and adoption through BitPay and NOWPayments keeps growing across e-commerce. What’s even more interesting is the ETF proposal Canary Capital filed, though delayed by the SEC, it shows ongoing institutional interest. For investors who want a coin with consistent performance, low transaction fees, and strong liquidity, Litecoin is still a solid pick. It’s not trying to be something it’s not, it just keeps delivering. That’s why it deserves a spot on this list of top crypto coins to invest in, especially if you want a less volatile option that still performs. 4. Toncoin – Fast Network, Growing Ecosystem Toncoin (TON) has been moving fast both in development and adoption. At the end of May 2025, it’s priced around $2.96, after a slight 0.71% daily bump. While it’s down 6.57% over the past month and 53.88% from its all-time high of $8.27, there’s more going on here than the price shows. Daily transactions have exploded from 100,000 to 1.2 million. That’s a clear sign that the TON blockchain is picking up serious traction. Add to that the recent integration of Tether (USDT), the launch of TON DNS and TON Storage, and a cleaner ecosystem direction after shutting down its cross-chain bridge earlier in May, it’s clear this project is tightening its game. Technically, analysts are eyeing a symmetrical triangle pattern with a breakout potential above $3.20. If that happens, a move towards $5.00 could be in play. Market cap currently sits around $7.37 billion, just under Monero, after losing a bit of ground. Toncoin’s combination of speed, adoption, and new features puts it in a promising place among the top crypto coins to invest in if you’re looking for solid infrastructure and actual traction. Summing Up From decentralized AI agents to fast, secure payment systems and high-utility storage networks, these four options, Unstaked, Filecoin, Litecoin, and Toncoin, offer more than just speculation. They show where real development is happening and where real user activity is driving demand. Whether it’s the massive cost savings of Unstaked’s autonomous agents or the growing use of Filecoin in AI and cross-chain projects, these coins reflect the kind of momentum that can actually build returns. Litecoin continues to prove that reliability matters, and Toncoin is putting up network growth numbers that are hard to ignore. If you’re building your portfolio and want to focus on the top crypto coins to invest in, this list is a strong place to start, rooted in performance, not promises.

45224053,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163764,1748480453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45224053.jpeg,Paxos Gold (PAXG): Unlock Exciting Tokenized Gold Trading on Coinbase New York,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/paxos-gold-coinbase-ny/,"BitcoinWorld Paxos Gold (PAXG): Unlock Exciting Tokenized Gold Trading on Coinbase New York For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors in New York, a significant development has just unfolded. Paxos Gold (PAXG), a prominent gold-backed digital asset, is now fully accessible on Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This opens up new avenues for crypto trading NY residents interested in diversifying their portfolios with exposure to gold, but within the familiar crypto ecosystem. What is Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Why is it on Coinbase New York? Before diving into the implications for New Yorkers, let’s understand what Paxos Gold is. PAXG is an ERC-20 token issued by Paxos, a regulated financial institution. What makes it unique is that each PAXG token is backed by one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold stored in secure vaults. This means that owning PAXG is equivalent to having direct ownership rights to physical gold, but with the liquidity, divisibility, and transferability of a digital asset. The availability of Paxos Gold on Coinbase, specifically for users in New York, is a notable event. New York has one of the most stringent regulatory environments for cryptocurrencies in the United States, governed by the BitLicense framework. For an asset like PAXG to be listed and made available to NY residents on a regulated platform like Coinbase, it signifies that it has met the necessary compliance standards. This provides a layer of assurance for users in the state. Coinbase announced this expansion via their official channels, confirming that NY residents can now buy, sell, and trade PAXG seamlessly through their Coinbase.com website and the Coinbase mobile applications on both iOS and Android devices. This integration simplifies the process for New Yorkers looking to access a gold backed crypto asset. The Appeal of Tokenized Gold: More Than Just a Digital Asset The concept of tokenized gold bridges the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Gold has historically been seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. However, owning physical gold can come with challenges like storage costs, insurance, and difficulty in fractionalizing or transferring small amounts. Paxos Gold addresses these issues by providing: Accessibility: Easy to buy and sell on digital exchanges like Coinbase, 24/7. Divisibility: You can own fractions of an ounce of gold, making it accessible for smaller investors. Liquidity: Traded on various exchanges, offering easier entry and exit compared to physical gold. Lower Costs: Avoids the high premiums, storage fees, and assay costs often associated with physical gold. Transparency: Paxos provides regular attestations verifying that the amount of PAXG tokens in circulation matches the amount of gold held in reserve. Token holders can even look up the serial number of the physical gold bar their token represents. For New York residents, having access to this form of tokenized gold on a trusted platform like Coinbase means they can now easily add gold exposure to their digital asset portfolio without dealing with the complexities of physical ownership or the limitations of traditional market hours for gold ETFs. Why is Availability in New York a Big Deal for Crypto Trading NY? New York is a major financial hub with a large population of investors. The state’s regulatory approach has often meant that certain crypto assets or services are not immediately available there compared to other states. When a compliant, regulated asset like Paxos Gold gets the green light for Coinbase New York users, it signals several positive things: Increased Access: Opens up a significant market for PAXG and provides NY residents with more investment options within the regulated crypto space. Regulatory Confidence: The fact that PAXG is approved for trading under New York’s BitLicense framework adds credibility and potentially attracts more institutional interest over time. Platform Strength: Reinforces Coinbase’s position as a platform committed to regulatory compliance, which is crucial for operating in New York. For those involved in crypto trading NY , this development is not just about a new asset; it’s about the continued maturation and acceptance of digital assets within stringent regulatory frameworks. It offers a regulated path for traditional investors in New York to get exposure to gold through a digital medium they might be increasingly comfortable with.

Trump. According to the Court of International Trade ruling, an emergency law invoked by the White House does not provide unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The ruling offers a major check on executive power and could have long-lasting implications for the US trade policy. The Manhattan-based court said the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. This is not superseded by the president’s remit to safeguard the economy. The lawsuit, filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties, was the first major legal challenge to Trump’s tariffs. According to the firms, the tariffs will hurt their business. Federal court weighs first legal challenge to Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs The lawsuit is one of seven court challenges to Trump’s tariff policies, along with challenges from 13 U.S. states and other groups of small businesses. The hearing at the Court of International Trade in Manhattan marks the first time a federal court has addressed the legality of President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. Earlier this month, Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer from the conservative Liberty Justice Center representing the plaintiffs, argued that the case is straightforward. He stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — a 1977 law granting the president authority to regulate commerce during national emergencies — does not empower Trump to impose tariffs unilaterally. Schwab further contended that Trump’s declared emergency, based on trade deficits, fails to meet the legal criteria of an emergency, which must be brief, rare, and not ongoing. He then noted that the case is so far outside what constitutes an emergency or an unusual and extraordinary threat that this Court can easily rule it is not an emergency. When the three-judge panel — appointed by Presidents Obama, Trump, and Reagan — asked for guidance on the legal standards to apply in their decision earlier this month, Schwab urged them not to overcomplicate matters. “I’m asking this court to be an umpire and call a strike. You’re asking me, where’s the strike zone? Is it at the knees or just below? I say it’s a wild pitch, far off the plate, hitting the backstop — no debate needed.” The lawsuit was filed in April by a group of small businesses — including a New York liquor distributor, a Utah pipe company, a Virginia electronics store, a Pennsylvania tackle shop, and a Vermont cycling company. These businesses rely heavily on imports from countries such as China and Mexico and argued that Trump’s tariffs represent an unprecedented power grab that would cause irreparable harm . They maintained that the IEEPA does not grant the president the authority to impose tariffs like those announced, which included a broad tariff rate plus higher rates on certain countries. They described the national emergency Trump cited as “a figment of his own imagination,” pointing out that the US has run massive trade deficits for years without suffering economic damage. “If such power were granted by statute, it would represent an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch without any clear limit on discretion,” the plaintiffs argued. At the beginning of May, Department of Justice lawyers countered, asserting that Congress does allow the president to impose some tariffs and that Trump’s invocation of a national emergency expands that authority, justifying the broad tariffs. They warned that a court order blocking the tariffs would unlawfully interfere with the president’s constitutional and statutory authority. “Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction would be an enormous intrusion on the President’s conduct of foreign affairs and efforts to protect national security under IEEPA and the Constitution,” the DOJ stated. States and businesses take Trump’s tariffs to court in landmark trade dispute At least six separate lawsuits have challenged Trump’s tariffs, including one filed by California and a coalition of twelve state attorneys general. While many were initially filed in district courts they were gradually transferred to the Court of International Trade. In April, the court rejected an emergency request for a temporary order to block the tariffs, finding that the businesses failed to prove that “immediate and irreparable harm” would stem from the tariffs. A three-judge panel conducted the hearing: Gary S. Katzmann, Timothy M. Reif, and Jane A. Restani — appointed by Presidents Obama, Trump, and Reagan, respectively. Located in a corner of New York’s Foley Square, the Court of International Trade has nationwide jurisdiction over trade disputes. It typically handles niche issues, such as honey customs and mattress imports. Tuesday’s oral argument promises to be the court’s most high-profile hearing in recent memory.

However, recent comments from agriculture minister Shinjiro Koizumi have drawn criticism regarding prices, preferential selling, and direct state intervention in the market. With state-imposed production limits for farmers, a devastated yen and rampant inflation, Japan’s rice market is still in the throes of what local media is calling the “ Reiwa Rice Strife .” On Monday, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ended the previous bidding system for selling stockpiled state rice, and introduced “discretionary contracts.”Stockpiled rice has been released by the state in recent times in order to combat shortage and skyrocketing prices, with the price of the staple grain doubling in only a year for consumers. Koizumi to release older rice to small businesses, rural areas Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said at a House of Representatives committee meeting Wednesday: “We want to continue making efforts to distribute stockpiled rice as widely as possible in the region,” intending to focus on smaller businesses after ending sales to large buyers on Tuesday. Terraced rice fields in Japan. Photo: DeltaWorks . Of the 300,000 tons up for sale via the new discretionary contracts scheme, much of the newer grain (from 2022) was quickly gobbled up instantly by giant corporations such as AEON and Pan Pacific International Holdings (PPIH).One local supermarket manager, Tatsuhito Tanaka, was quoted by regional media about the scheme, saying: “I really hope they’ll share the rice with us so that it’s not just the big companies.”As per regional reports , the remaining 100,000 tons of older (2021) stockpiled rice is set to be contracted out to smaller enterprises over the next few months. The focus will onstensibly be on supporting rural areas. Farmers say the government is the real reason for the shortage As Cryptopolitan reported previously, there is much debate over why a shortage of Japan’s prize grain even occurred in the first place. Mass media has been blaming the weather and myriad other factors, but full-time Japanese farmers are directly blaming the government and special interests for subsidizing limits on acreage, engaging in backroom deals, and essentially rigging prices and contracts. As nippon.com reported last year :“Currently, 40% of paddy fields are not in use, meaning that production is limited to around 6.5 million tons. If Japan stopped this policy of reduced production, and instead exported 4 million tons, it could handle the kind of situation seen this year through a small decrease in the amount exported and no domestic shortages.” JPY to USD historical data. Source: Trading Economics . Koizumi’s stance has drawn fire from the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, with party member Kaori Ishikawa noting Wednesday that it is not the state’s place to be involved in rice prices. Koizumi responded that this was only an “emergency measure.” State intervention thus far has not lowered the still-rising prices .From the stance of many, corporate giants are getting preferential treatment, with local supermarkets left to crunch on the remaining, oldest grain almost as an afterthought. Much like the small-scale farmers unable to produce due to Japan Agriculture Cooperatives’ powerful connections to Tokyo subsidies and restrictions.At the time of writing, the USD is flexing against JPY again, with an exchange rate of 145.81 JPY/1 USD.

To achieve this success, it has collaborated with Nvidia Corp. to create an AI data center in Vietnam and Japan, extending into semiconductor chip design. The tech company is Vietnam’s seventh-largest publicly traded company , boasting a market value of $6.8 billion. The company employs over 80,000 people and operates in 30 different countries. Internationally, FPT counts 130 Fortune Global 500 companies, like Airbus SE, Halliburton Co., and Ford Motor Co., as clients. It has moved the nation beyond building Nike Inc. shoes and Apple Inc. devices, marking a significant milestone in the country. Binh moves Vietnam from a low-cost economic center to a giant tech center Truong Gia Binh established FPT, a technology company, four decades ago with a single computer in a room. The computer was borrowed from his then-father-in-law, General Vo Nguyen Giap, who won the admiration of generations of Vietnamese for leading the Vietnam People’s Army to victory over the French and US armies. Binh’s life follows the story of the victorious North Vietnamese forces. In 1954, his family moved to Hanoi with revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh to support the fight for independence, according to the FPT chairman. They were very poor, so Binh wore clothes passed down from his sisters and witnessed US bombers dropping explosives on the city. Binh, now 69 and has met Ho Chi Minh twice, revealed that a shortage of almost everything marked his childhood. Despite his challenges, he wanted to create a top-tier technology sector in Vietnam. The tech giant has been Vietnam’s way to move beyond being a low-cost economic center, explained Lam Nguyen, managing director of IDC Indochina. The Communist government views FPT as a model for helping the country shift from its traditional manufacturing roots to industries focused on areas like AI products, which Bain & Co. predicts could be worth $990 billion globally by 2027. During an interview, Binh stated that they were working day and night to take the company to greater heights. He speculates that the company can achieve an annual revenue growth rate of about 20% in the long run. Binh owns almost 7% of FPT Corp., with the government owning 5.71%. FPT faces significant obstacles in its run to become the leading tech company FPT is preparing for global economic turbulence and can fine-tune its business plan for the tough 20% revenue increase this year on risks. DNSE Securities said this in a statement on its website, citing FPT Chief Executive Officer Nguyen Van Khoa at the company’s April shareholders’ meeting. The brokerage said FPT is lowering costs by 30% without harming the core business, citing Khoa. Still, significant obstacles lie ahead for FPT as it tries to compete with more established tech firms from India and Malaysia. The tech giant also needs to deal with a new wave of tariffs set by President Donald Trump. Although FPT is not directly affected by new US tariffs , the company noted that it might face indirect impacts because many of its global customers are influenced by these tariffs. It may also have to face the country’s ever-attentive police. When pressed on reports about the Ministry of Public Security, which has been strengthening internet regulations in recent years, wanting to hold a majority stake in the company’s internet unit, FPT Telecom, said it has “no further details about it.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Tech|Vietnam,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-29 01:08:02

Humanity Protocol , the innovative project focused on preventing deep-fake issues using AI and blockchain technology, has just announced a significant move that’s set to energize a key part of the ecosystem. They are allocating a substantial sum – $2.2 million worth of their native H tokens – directly into the KaitoAI ecosystem. Understanding the Humanity Protocol Before diving into the specifics of the token allocation , let’s quickly touch upon what Humanity Protocol is all about. In an age where digital identity is increasingly crucial and simultaneously under threat from sophisticated AI-driven deep fakes, Humanity Protocol aims to provide a robust, decentralized identity solution. Leveraging a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, their goal is to create a verifiable and secure digital identity layer that can resist manipulation and fraud. Think of it as building a trustworthy foundation for online interactions in the future. Exploring the KaitoAI Ecosystem So, why is the KaitoAI ecosystem the recipient of this generous allocation? KaitoAI positions itself as a leading AI-powered search and intelligence platform specifically tailored for the world of Web3. It helps users navigate the vast and often complex landscape of decentralized applications, protocols, and communities. By providing sophisticated tools for research, analysis, and discovery, KaitoAI plays a vital role in making Web3 more accessible and understandable for both newcomers and seasoned participants. It’s a hub for information and discussion within the decentralized sphere. The $2.2M Token Allocation Explained The core of this announcement is the significant financial commitment being made. Humanity Protocol is allocating $2.2 million USD worth of their H tokens to KaitoAI. This isn’t just a simple transfer; it’s a strategic investment aimed at fostering growth and activity within the KaitoAI platform. The value is tied to the H token, signifying confidence in Humanity Protocol’s own ecosystem while simultaneously injecting valuable resources into a complementary project. This kind of cross-ecosystem support is a hallmark of a healthy, interconnected Web3 environment. Boosting the Web3 Community Through Engagement The primary purpose behind this substantial token allocation is to significantly boost Web3 community engagement and discussions. Community is the lifeblood of decentralized projects, and incentivizing participation is a proven method for fostering vibrant and active ecosystems. Humanity Protocol explicitly stated that these tokens are earmarked for distribution among two key groups: KAITO Stakers: Individuals who are staking their KAITO tokens, likely contributing to the security or functionality of the KaitoAI platform, will be rewarded. This directly incentivizes long-term commitment to KaitoAI. Humanity Yappers: While the exact nature of ‘Humanity Yappers’ isn’t detailed in the original snippet, it strongly suggests active community members or contributors within the Humanity Protocol ecosystem itself. Rewarding them via the KaitoAI platform could encourage cross-pollination and broader participation. By directing funds towards these engaged user bases, the allocation aims to stimulate more discussion, content creation, and overall activity focused on Web3 topics within the KaitoAI environment. Synergies: AI, Blockchain, and Community Growth This collaboration highlights a powerful synergy between different facets of the modern digital landscape: AI Blockchain technology and dedicated community building. Humanity Protocol leverages AI for its core function (deep-fake prevention) and blockchain for its infrastructure (decentralized identity). KaitoAI uses AI to navigate the blockchain/Web3 world. The intersection lies in using resources generated by an AI/Blockchain project (Humanity Protocol’s H tokens) to fuel an AI-powered platform (KaitoAI) that serves the broader Web3 community built on blockchain principles. This strategic move underscores the growing interconnectedness of these technologies and the recognition that robust community interaction is essential for the long-term success and adoption of complex Web3 and AI Blockchain initiatives. It’s an investment not just in a platform, but in the people who use and contribute to the decentralized web. What This Means for Users For members of the KaitoAI and Humanity Protocol communities, this allocation presents tangible benefits. If you are currently staking KAITO tokens, you can anticipate receiving a portion of the H token distribution. If you are an active participant or ‘Yapper’ in the Humanity Protocol community, engaging on platforms like X (where the announcement was made), you may also be eligible for rewards distributed through the KaitoAI ecosystem. This is a direct incentive to stay engaged and contribute to the growth and discussion within these projects. Conclusion: A Strategic Investment in Web3’s Future The decision by Humanity Protocol to allocate $2.2 million worth of H tokens to the KaitoAI ecosystem is a significant development. It represents a clear commitment to fostering a vibrant Web3 community by directly incentivizing participation among KAITO stakers and Humanity Yappers . This strategic token allocation leverages the strengths of both an innovative AI Blockchain project and a key Web3 intelligence platform to drive engagement and discussion, ultimately contributing to the health and growth of the decentralized web.

Taking the stage in front of a packed room of Bitcoin enthusiasts, developers, and investors, Vance delivered a powerful message, hinting that the United States government is ready to embrace Bitcoin’s role in shaping the country’s economic and technological future. “We want to start to put in motion the strategic importance of Bitcoin for the United States government,” Vance declared, drawing loud applause from the audience. “We know the People’s Republic of China doesn’t like Bitcoin — and that should make us ask: why? If our biggest adversary is trying to push away from it, maybe that’s a sign we should move towards it.” Bitcoin & National Security: A New Era Vance said that this isn’t just a one-way conversation between government officials and the public. He called for ongoing dialogue between policymakers and the crypto community to help shape smart, forward-thinking Bitcoin policies that will safeguard America’s future prosperity. “None of us want to wake up ten years from now in a country that’s less wealthy and prosperous because we made bad decisions today,” Vance cautioned. “We’re going to make the right decisions — but that depends on you guys being part of the conversation.” Bitcoin, AI, and the Political Divide In a candid moment, Vance also touched on an interesting trend he’s observed in tech circles — how different technologies seem to attract different political leanings. “Very smart right-wing people in tech seem to be drawn to Bitcoin and crypto, while very smart left-leaning folks gravitate toward artificial intelligence,” he remarked. While acknowledging this was a generalization, he stressed the importance of keeping Bitcoin and AI conversations connected. “What happens in AI will very much affect Bitcoin — and what happens to Bitcoin will affect AI. We need to ensure that Bitcoin is part of the AI conversation,” he added. Why It Matters Vance’s speech marks a turning point in how US leadership views Bitcoin — not just as an investment, but as a tool of strategic value in global geopolitics and economic security. As regulatory frameworks for crypto tighten worldwide, America’s embrace of Bitcoin could reshape the future of digital finance and national security.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 01:17:29

Vance didn’t mince words, offering a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and a clear stance on the future of crypto policy in the United States. Why Does JD Vance See Crypto as a “Ground-Up Innovation”? Speaking before a crowd of crypto enthusiasts and industry leaders, JD Vance characterized cryptocurrency, and particularly Bitcoin , as a genuine “ground-up innovation.” This framing is significant as it positions digital assets not as a fringe financial tool or a speculative bubble, but as a fundamental technological advancement driven by individuals and market forces rather than top-down governmental mandates. His remarks at Bitcoin 2025 highlighted: Decentralized Nature: Emphasizing that the technology and adoption are growing organically from users and developers. Economic Empowerment: Suggesting it provides new avenues for financial participation outside traditional systems. Technological Progress: Recognizing the underlying blockchain technology as a significant leap forward. This perspective aligns with a view that sees crypto as an unstoppable force, one that policy should seek to understand and integrate rather than stifle. Vance’s embrace of this narrative signals a potential shift in how a future administration might approach the digital asset space, moving away from skepticism towards recognition of its innovative potential. Can We Really Expect 100 Million Bitcoin Holders Soon? Perhaps one of the most striking predictions from JD Vance was his forecast that 100 million people would soon own Bitcoin . While he didn’t provide a specific timeline or the data underpinning this prediction, it reflects a strong belief in the accelerating pace of global Bitcoin adoption.

Vance’s Prediction Global Crypto Owners ~500-600 million N/A (Prediction specific to BTC) Global Bitcoin Holders ~200-300 million An additional 100 million soon % of World Population ~2.5% – 3.8% Potentially pushing towards 5% Reaching 100 million new holders would represent a substantial increase, suggesting Vance foresees a significant acceleration in mainstream adoption. This could be driven by various factors, including increased institutional interest, clearer regulatory frameworks (which he advocated for), growing awareness, and potentially macroeconomic conditions pushing people towards alternative assets like Bitcoin . Is Crypto the Ultimate Hedge Against Inflation and Government Overreach? A core tenet of Vance’s argument for Bitcoin and crypto is their perceived role as a hedge. He explicitly mentioned hedging against both inflation and government overreach. This is a common theme among crypto proponents: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often contrasted with fiat currencies, which can be subject to inflationary pressures through quantitative easing and government spending. The narrative is that as traditional currencies potentially lose purchasing power, scarce assets like Bitcoin can retain or increase value. Government Overreach: The decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin , means they operate outside the direct control of any single government or central authority. This offers a potential hedge against excessive financial surveillance, censorship, or control over personal assets. Vance’s articulation of these points resonates deeply within the crypto community, highlighting the philosophical underpinnings that attract many to the space beyond just investment potential. It frames crypto not just as an asset class, but as a tool for financial sovereignty and protection. Why the Criticism of Regulators Like Gary Gensler? The current regulatory landscape in the United States has been a major point of contention for the crypto industry. JD Vance echoed these frustrations by criticizing regulators, specifically mentioning Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The criticism typically centers on: Regulation by Enforcement: The SEC has been accused of using enforcement actions against crypto companies rather than providing clear rules of the road beforehand. Lack of Clarity: The industry has long called for clear guidelines on how digital assets should be classified and regulated, which many argue has not been adequately provided. Jurisdictional Disputes: Uncertainty exists regarding which regulatory body (SEC, CFTC, etc.) has primary oversight over different aspects of the crypto market. Vance’s critique suggests that the current regulatory approach is hindering innovation and creating uncertainty, rather than fostering responsible growth. His comments imply a desire for a more predictable and perhaps less aggressive regulatory environment for the crypto sector. What Does Pledging Trump Administration Support Mean for US Crypto Regulation? A significant part of JD Vance’s speech focused on the potential policy direction under a future Trump administration. He pledged support for the industry, indicating a potential pivot from the current administration’s approach. This pledge included a commitment to ending policies perceived as hostile to crypto, most notably Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . Understanding the potential impact requires looking at what “support” might entail: Clearer Legislation: Pushing for congressional action to create a defined legal framework for digital assets. Industry Dialogue: Engaging with crypto businesses and experts to understand their needs and concerns. Appointments: Appointing regulators who may be more favorable or knowledgeable about the crypto space. Ending Restrictive Policies: Actively dismantling initiatives seen as targeting the crypto industry indirectly. This kind of high-level political backing, if materialized, could significantly de-risk the U.S. market for crypto businesses and investors, potentially attracting more capital and talent to the country. Dismantling Operation Chokepoint 2.0: A Key Policy Promise One specific policy target mentioned by JD Vance was the promise to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . This term, coined by the crypto community, refers to a perceived coordinated effort by regulators and financial institutions to limit or cut off banking services to legitimate crypto businesses. While not an official government program name, the effects described are real: Crypto companies facing difficulty opening or maintaining bank accounts. Increased scrutiny and pressure on banks that service crypto clients. Delays or denials of payments related to crypto transactions. The original ‘Operation Chokepoint’ from the Obama administration targeted businesses deemed high-risk (like payday lenders) by pressuring banks to cease doing business with them. ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ is seen as a similar tactic applied to the crypto sector. Ending such practices would be a major win for crypto businesses, providing them with essential access to the traditional financial system and fostering a more stable operating environment. What Are the Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community? JD Vance’s statements offer several key takeaways: Political Engagement Matters: The fact that high-profile politicians are speaking at crypto conferences and discussing specific policy changes underscores the growing political relevance of the industry. Policy Shift Potential: A potential change in administration could bring a significant shift in US crypto regulation , potentially favoring growth and clarity over enforcement. Continued Advocacy Needed: While promises are made, the industry must continue to advocate for clear, supportive, and innovation-friendly regulations. Adoption Narrative Strengthened: Predictions like 100 million Bitcoin holders reinforce the long-term growth narrative for the asset. For investors and businesses, these signals suggest paying close attention to the political landscape and advocating for policies that support responsible innovation rather than hinder it. Conclusion: A Glimpse into a Potentially Brighter Regulatory Future? JD Vance’s appearance at Bitcoin 2025 delivered a clear message: the potential future leadership views crypto not as a threat to be contained, but as an innovation to be fostered. His prediction of 100 million Bitcoin holders reflects a bullish long-term view, while his pointed criticism of current regulators and specific policy promises, like ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0 , signal a desire for a dramatic shift in US crypto regulation . While political promises are subject to the complexities of governance, Vance’s statements provide a glimpse of a potentially more supportive and predictable environment for the digital asset industry in the United States, offering hope to many within the community.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Telegram's blockbuster deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk's AI company integrate into Telegram and the two firms share revenue, is still a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov earlier Wednesday, U.S. time, that the deal was inked. TON, a token affiliated with Telegram's ecosystem, is trading at $3.30, rallying there from $3 after the initial – now refuted – announcement of the partnership was made. The token is down from an earlier high of $3.68, after Elon Musk posted on X that no deal had been signed between the two companies. TON is still up 11% on the day, according to CoinDesk market data . While Durov has now confirmed that no deal has been signed, the Telegram founder said there is an ""agreement in principle"" which might be why TON still has significant support at the $3.30. All eyes will be on Telegram and xAI as the Asia business day begins to see if more clarification comes from either side.

Speaking at Web Summit in Vancouver on Wednesday, Graber argued blockchain technology’s permanence and resource-intensive design make it unsuitable for consumer-oriented social networks, where content is fleeting and personal. “Why do you need your picture of what you post for lunch being maintained forever in this digital archive?” she asked on stage, highlighting the inherent scalability and cost limitations that drove her decision to avoid blockchain at Bluesky. Graber, to be sure, isn't against crypto. She says there's still genuine value in the technology for things like payments and digital identity, even if sometimes Web3 often presents solutions in search of a problem, and has a trend of gravitating towards centralization. “There’s a period where everyone was creating blockchain like this hammer, and we were just going to try blockchain for everything,” Graber said. “Every system that's trying to do it ends up with concentrations because it's easy, and convenience ultimately wins at the end of the day."" For her, Bluesky's future lies in combining the ideals of decentralization, such as user autonomy and portability, with practical, Web2 infrastructure to create a platform that prioritizes users' needs. ""Blockchain will probably find its place somewhere in the world of technology, but Bluesky is not on a blockchain because we're just making the best choices for our users,” she concluded. Nvidia's Earnings Beat Boosts Stock, Offers Modest Lift to AI Tokens Shares of Nvidia rose roughly 4% in after-hours trading Wednesday after reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings, highlighted by a 69% revenue increase from last year and a 73% jump in its data center business driven by robust demand for AI chips. Net income rose 26% to $18.8 billion, boosting Nvidia’s year-to-date performance modestly higher, CoinDesk previously reported. The earnings report provided a slight lift to AI-related crypto tokens like Bittensor (TAO), NEAR Protocol, and Internet Computer (ICP), though gains were modest. However, Nvidia tempered future expectations, cautioning that second-quarter revenue might fall short of market estimates due to tariff-related trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin dipped 1.2% to $107,800, though NYDIG sees more room for gains. At the same time, crypto markets shrugged off a U.S. court blocking Trump's broad tariffs as unconstitutional, with BTC trading remaining muted. ETH: Ether is trading above $2700 as Asia begins its business day. Earlier, CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole wrote ETH is eying a breakout above $3,000, forming a bullish ""ascending triangle"" pattern with rising support and resistance at $2,735, as higher lows signal growing buying pressure and accumulation ahead of a potential price surge. Gold: Gold has slipped 1% to $3,267.47 amid cooling safe-haven demand, though tariff and geopolitical uncertainty linger. Nikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 is opening in the green, up 1%, as investors in export-reliant Japan are looking at a recent announcement that the Supreme Court has blocked Trump's tariffs with cautious optimism, even as crypto shrugged it off.

This is where AMD’s latest strategic move comes into play, signaling a significant push to enhance its capabilities in powering next-generation AI systems. For anyone following the intersection of advanced computing and market dynamics, understanding this acquisition is key. Fueling AMD AI Ambitions with Strategic Acquisition AMD, a major player in the semiconductor industry, has announced the acquisition of Enosemi, a startup specializing in custom materials for silicon photonics product development. While the specific financial terms remain undisclosed, the intent behind this move is clear: to significantly bolster AMD’s presence and innovation in the AI space. This acquisition is a direct response to the escalating demands placed on computing infrastructure by increasingly large and complex AI models. As Brian Armick, SVP of Technology and Engineering at AMD, highlighted, the need for faster and more efficient data movement is accelerating. Enosemi, having previously collaborated with AMD as an external partner, now integrates its team and expertise directly into AMD’s operations. This is expected to immediately scale AMD’s capacity to support and develop various photonics and Co-packaged Optics solutions critical for advanced AI applications. Understanding the Power of Silicon Photonics Tech At the heart of this acquisition is silicon photonics, a technology that utilizes light (photons) instead of traditional electrical signals to transmit data. Why is this important? Speed: Light can transmit data significantly faster than electrical currents, which is crucial for the massive datasets processed by AI. Efficiency: Photonics consume less power than electrical interconnects, leading to more energy-efficient data centers. Bandwidth: It enables higher bandwidth connections, allowing more data to be moved simultaneously. Distance: Data can be transmitted over longer distances with less signal degradation. These benefits make Silicon Photonics Tech an increasingly attractive solution for high-performance computing environments, particularly those geared towards AI and machine learning workloads. AMD is not alone in recognizing this potential; other chipmakers are also exploring and investing in this technology. AMD itself reportedly engaged in an R&D collaboration with Taiwan startups in this area late last year, underscoring its growing commitment. Addressing the Challenge of AI Data Movement One of the significant bottlenecks in scaling AI performance is the speed and efficiency of moving data between processing units (like GPUs) and memory, as well as between different nodes in a data center. This challenge, often referred to as AI Data Movement , becomes more pronounced as AI models grow in size and complexity. Enosemi’s expertise in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) directly addresses this issue. PICs are microchips that combine multiple photonic components to form functional circuits capable of handling optical signals. Enosemi’s products, such as optical interconnects, are designed to integrate computing and networking components within data centers, facilitating much faster and more efficient communication pathways. By bringing Enosemi’s capabilities in-house, AMD aims to develop integrated solutions that significantly reduce latency and increase throughput for AI workloads. Details of the Enosemi Acquisition Founded in 2023 by semiconductor engineers Ari Novack and Matthew Streshinsky, Silicon Valley-based Enosemi was a relatively young startup. Prior to its acquisition, the company had raised $150,000 in VC funding. As of May, it reportedly had a team of 16 employees. The fact that AMD chose to acquire a startup with this specific focus highlights the strategic importance it places on photonics for its future AI roadmap. The Enosemi Acquisition is AMD’s first since its significant deal involving ZT Systems, further demonstrating AMD’s intent to make targeted investments that align with its core growth areas, particularly AI. Ari Novack’s LinkedIn profile already lists him as a silicon design engineering fellow at AMD, indicating a smooth integration of key talent. The Role of Co-packaged Optics in Next-Gen AI Systems The acquisition is specifically aimed at accelerating AMD’s innovation in Co-packaged Optics . This technology involves integrating optical components directly onto the same package as the electronic chips (like CPUs or GPUs). This close proximity dramatically reduces the distance data needs to travel electrically before being converted to light, leading to significant improvements in speed, power efficiency, and density compared to traditional pluggable optical modules. For next-generation AI systems that require unprecedented levels of interconnect performance between processors and memory, and between processors in large clusters, co-packaged optics are seen as essential. By integrating Enosemi’s expertise, AMD is positioning itself to be a leader in developing these critical components, ensuring its future AI chips and platforms can meet the demanding requirements of advanced AI training and inference. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for AMD in the AI Race The acquisition of Enosemi represents a strategic and forward-thinking move by AMD. By integrating a company with specialized expertise in silicon photonics and photonic integrated circuits, AMD is directly addressing the critical challenges of AI Data Movement and high-performance interconnects. This move is set to accelerate AMD’s development of Co-packaged Optics , which are vital for the performance and efficiency of future AI Systems . Ultimately, this strengthens AMD’s position in the competitive landscape and underscores its commitment to fueling its ambitious growth plans in artificial intelligence, building on its already impressive AI chip revenue figures.

The company has announced that Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings is joining its Board of Directors . This move brings a highly experienced Technology Executive into the governance structure of one of the key players in the artificial intelligence arena. Why is Reed Hastings Joining Anthropic Significant? The addition of Reed Hastings to the Anthropic board is notable for several reasons. Hastings is a widely recognized figure in the tech industry, best known for co-founding Netflix and leading it through its transformation into a global streaming giant. His experience extends beyond Netflix, having served on the boards of major companies like Microsoft, Bloomberg, and Meta.

This independent body sits at the top of Anthropic’s corporate governance. Its purpose is to ensure that Anthropic’s development of AI prioritizes the long-term benefit of humanity, even if it means making decisions that are not in the immediate financial interest of the company or its investors. The Trust has the power to appoint and remove board members, highlighting its critical role in guiding Anthropic’s mission and ethics. This unique governance model sets Anthropic apart and underscores its stated commitment to responsible AI development. The appointment process through the Trust emphasizes that new board members are selected not just for their business acumen but also for their potential contribution to the Trust’s overarching goal. Who Else Sits on Anthropic’s Board of Directors? Reed Hastings joins an existing group of individuals on the Board of Directors who bring diverse expertise to Anthropic. The current board includes the company’s co-founders, Dario and Daniela Amodei, who are deeply involved in the technical and strategic direction of the AI company .

They shared this bullish outlook during a discussion on stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Don Jr. anticipated that Bitcoin could trade from $175,000 to $150,000 after Eric joked that the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value could soar “to the moon” by the close of next year . Eric said that every day, people put billions and billions of dollars into Bitcoin. He forecasted that 0.1 Bitcoin would be worth an absolute fortune, adding that demand for the digital asset overtook supply. Saylor urges Trump’s family to invest in Bitcoin Don Jr. and Eric have become strong supporters of the crypto industry . They are involved in various crypto projects, such as the World Liberty Financial DeFi project and an American Bitcoin mining company. Moreover, most recently, Nasdaq-listed Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social and Truth. Fi revealed its plans to raise $2.5 billion to launch a Bitcoin treasury. American Bitcoin is also “staking sats” as part of a plan to boost its “Bitcoin per share” metric, which it uses to calculate the value of Bitcoin treasury companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Meanwhile, World Liberty intends to introduce a stablecoin. Don Jr. stated that they are actively working on all these projects, bearing in mind that crypto is for the long term. He further stated that this was a major focus for them. Eric revealed that Saylor was helping the Trump family transition into “crypto magnates.” At one point, Saylor had tried to convince the Trumps — with whom he has been family friends in New York for a long time — to mortgage the Mar-a-Lago property so they could use the money to buy Bitcoin. Eric mentioned that Saylor told them to follow his lead, urging them that there was an amazing chance of getting Bitcoin. He then admitted that he had never seen anything like this in any other field where a major leader is actually encouraging talented individuals to challenge them. Bitcoin reached a greater height on May 22, closing at $111,390 after briefly rising to a high of $112,000. The milestone capped a 45% surge in early April when Bitcoin was traded at around $76,450. Based on CoinMarketCap reports, Bitcoin is trading at $108,105.47, reflecting an approximately 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. Eric says everyone wants to be associated with Bitcoin Eric observed in his daily experiences with the Trump organization that he is seeing more institutions create strategies for holding Bitcoin, including royal families and private offices. He mentioned that just a year ago, fewer than 100 companies were likely treasuring Bitcoin, and now this has changed. Following this, he stated that this trend is not limited to America. It includes the entire Middle East, Africa, and all of Asia. Based on his argument, everyone wants to be associated with Bitcoin and not to part with it. Eric further highlighted that his interest in cryptocurrency was strengthen after he experienced some difficulties with the traditional financial system, including the process of being debanked. “All of my accounts just stopped working,” he said. “Then you start to see how corrupt the system is… it was used to be against people.” “I don’t like using the word hate, but I can’t think of a better word,” he added, before admitting that he would like to see some of the big banks vanish entirely, because, in his opinion, they really ought to.

In earnings released May 28 for its first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year ended April 27, Nvidia reported revenues of $44.1 billion, up 12% from its previous quarter and 69% from a year ago and beating Zacks analyst estimates of $42.91 billion by nearly 2.7%. However, the chip maker posted an earnings per share of 81 cents, missing analyst estimates of 85 cents per share. Nvidia recorded a net income of $18.8 billion, up 26% compared to a year ago. In an earnings call, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that the “global demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong” as countries start recognizing “AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet.” Source: Nvidia “AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate,” he said. US export rules to deliver $8 billion hit Nvidia said the lower-than-expected income resulted from a $4.5 billion charge due to the US government’s restrictions on exporting its high-powered H20 artificial intelligence chips to China. In its outlook for its Q2 results, the company said it expects revenues around $45 billion, which “reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations.” Nvidia will reportedly launch a new lower-cost AI chip specifically for China, with mass production expected to start in June. Nvidia’s data center revenue accounted for most of the firm’s total revenues, hitting $39.1 billion, up 10% from the previous quarter.

Despite the increase in selling pressure from miners after the all-time high, the price of Bitcoin has managed to hold above $108,000, with on-chain data showing Bitcoin diamond hands absorbing all the selling pressure. Long-Term Holders Accumulating With Minimal Spending According to data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Spending Binary Indicator has fallen to its lowest level since September 2024. This interesting trend was initially noted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst Alex Adler Jr. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next The 15-day moving average of this metric, as shown in the chart by CryptoQuant, has dropped to the minimal spending zone. Notably, this zone has consistently preceded a more bullish move in the Bitcoin price. In parallel, long-term holder supply has risen by approximately 300,000 BTC over the past 20 days. This marks a deviation from the trend of declines in the long-term holder supply since 2024. At the time of writing, 14.6 million BTC, representing about 74% of the total current circulating supply of BTC, is in addresses classified as long-term holders. This pattern suggests that so-called “diamond hands”, i.e., investors with a strong conviction who hold through volatility, are not only refraining from selling with Bitcoin’s recent new peak, but are actively accumulating. The chart below shows the correlation between minimal LTH spending and rising price action, a behavior that also aligned with phases of Bitcoin’s uptrend in 2019, late 2020, and late 2024. Why It’s Bullish For The Market The significant uptick in long-term holder supply, combined with minimal selling activity, reveals a hidden strength in the market. The current behavior of long-term investors also indicates their confidence in Bitcoin’s valuation at current levels, despite the recent price surge. Many of these long-term holders are in substantial profit, yet still choose to hold. This is unlike short-term holders, who have collectively realized over $11.6 billion in profits over the past month alone. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Drawing a parallel with historical data, the current decline in long-term holder (LTH) spending mirrors a similar pattern observed in September 2024. At that time, the LTH Indicator was in the minimal zone, and the long-term holder supply was also increasing steadily. What followed was a remarkable 96% surge in Bitcoin’s price, rising from approximately $54,000 to peaks around $106,000 in December and January. If the market were to follow a similar trajectory from the current price level, a comparable 96% rally would see Bitcoin rise to a new peak near $212,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,000.

However, it also attracts bad actors looking to exploit unsuspecting individuals. A recent development highlights this risk: a Vietnamese woman has been arrested in Thailand in connection with a massive crypto scam worth an estimated $300 million. What Led to This Significant Thailand Arrest ? According to reports, Thai authorities apprehended a Vietnamese national suspected of being involved in a large-scale cryptocurrency fraud operation. The arrest took place in Thailand, where the suspect was allegedly operating or linked to activities that impacted thousands of victims. The core of the allegations revolves around a classic high-yield investment program (HYIP) style scam, adapted for the crypto age. Victims were reportedly lured in with promises of incredibly high, fixed monthly returns – specifically, between 20% and 30%. These kinds of unrealistic promises are a major red flag in the world of investments, traditional or crypto. The Promise: Guaranteed 20-30% monthly returns. The Reality: A complete loss of initial investment for most, if not all, participants. Impacted: Approximately 2,600 victims. Total Loss: Estimated at $300 million. Location of Arrest: Thailand. Suspect’s Nationality: Vietnamese. This incident serves as a stark reminder that if an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Understanding the Mechanics of Such Investment Fraud Scammers often employ sophisticated tactics to appear legitimate. They might create professional-looking websites, use complex terminology, and even show fabricated payout proofs in the initial stages to build trust and encourage larger investments. The promise of high returns, especially on a monthly basis, is designed to trigger a sense of urgency and greed, overriding critical thinking. In this specific case, the alleged scheme managed to defraud 2,600 victims, accumulating losses totaling around $300 million. This scale indicates a potentially widespread operation, likely utilizing online platforms and aggressive recruitment strategies. Key Characteristics of This Type of Scam: Based on the information available, the scheme exhibits several common traits of fraudulent operations: Unrealistic Return Promises: 20-30% monthly is far beyond what legitimate, low-risk investments can offer. Even high-risk ventures rarely promise such consistent, exorbitant returns. Focus on Recruitment: While not explicitly stated in the brief report, many HYIP scams rely on participants recruiting new investors to pay off earlier ones (a Ponzi scheme structure). Lack of Transparency: Details about how these massive returns are generated are usually vague or non-existent. Legitimate investments explain their strategy. Pressure Tactics: Scammers often pressure potential victims to invest quickly to not miss out on the opportunity. This investment fraud highlights the need for extreme caution when evaluating any opportunity, especially in the fast-moving crypto space. The Broader Context: Tackling Crypto Crime Across Borders The arrest of a Vietnamese suspect in Thailand in relation to a crypto scam impacting potentially international victims underscores the cross-border nature of crypto crime . Cryptocurrencies operate globally, which makes tracing funds and pursuing suspects challenging for law enforcement agencies that are bound by national jurisdictions. Collaboration between international police forces and financial regulators is crucial in combating these types of crimes. The successful Thailand arrest in this case demonstrates that such cooperation can yield results, bringing alleged perpetrators to justice and potentially helping in asset recovery efforts, although recovering lost funds in crypto scams is often difficult. Law enforcement agencies worldwide are increasingly developing specialized units and expertise to handle cases involving digital assets. However, the speed at which new scams emerge often outpaces regulatory and enforcement capabilities. Actionable Insights: How to Protect Yourself from Cryptocurrency Fraud Protecting yourself from scams like the one that led to this Thailand arrest requires vigilance and education. Here are some actionable steps you can take: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on someone else’s recommendation. Understand the project, the team behind it, and the technology. Be Skeptical of High Returns: If an investment guarantees extremely high returns, especially with little to no risk, it is highly likely a scam. Legitimate investments carry risk, and returns fluctuate. Check for Red Flags: Vague business models, lack of a whitepaper or clear documentation, anonymous teams, pressure to recruit others, and demands for payment in unconventional ways are all warning signs. Verify Company Information: Try to verify the legitimacy of the company or platform. Are they registered? Do they have a physical address? Can you find independent reviews or news articles about them (not just promotional material)? Start Small: If you decide to invest in something new, start with a small amount you can afford to lose. Be wary if there are high minimum investment requirements. Secure Your Wallets and Keys: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with common scam tactics in the crypto space. Follow reputable news sources and educational platforms. Remember, the responsibility ultimately falls on the individual investor to perform due diligence and recognize the signs of potential investment fraud . Summary: A Wake-Up Call Against Crypto Scams The recent Thailand arrest of a Vietnamese suspect in connection with a $300 million crypto scam serves as a critical reminder of the risks present in the cryptocurrency market. Schemes promising unrealistic returns are prevalent forms of cryptocurrency fraud and can lead to devastating financial losses for thousands of victims. While law enforcement is working to combat crypto crime , investor education and skepticism remain the most powerful tools against falling victim to investment fraud . Always approach opportunities that seem too good to be true with extreme caution and conduct thorough research before committing your funds.

On the daily time frame, XRP has been losing momentum as Bitcoin cools off, and since most altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead, XRP is no exception. When Bitcoin dips or moves sideways, altcoins often react with sharper drops, and that’s exactly what’s happening now. Bitcoin dominance is currently quite strong, which means Bitcoin is holding its value better than many altcoins. This puts added pressure on coins like XRP, which are now struggling to stay above important support levels. Recently, XRP slipped below a key support area around $2.30. Is There a Bullish Pattern Forming? With this level lost, analysts are now keeping a close eye on the next important zone, which sits between $2.10 and $2.15. If XRP fails to hold here, the next significant level to watch would be around $2.00, and below that, there’s some support near $1.80. Interestingly, there’s a bullish setup forming on the daily chart. There are early signs of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is a classic reversal formation that could hint at a bigger move to the upside. Short-Term Outlook However, for this pattern to actually play out, XRP would need to stabilize somewhere in the lower $2 range, likely between $2.00 and $2.15, before bouncing back towards $2.62. A confirmed breakout above this higher level would be a strong bullish signal, possibly opening the door to new highs. But for now, this pattern is only a possibility and not confirmed. In the shorter time frames, XRP has also lost a bit of positive momentum. A short-term bullish divergence recently failed as the price and RSI both made lower lows, canceling out the divergence. This signals the potential for further downside in the immediate term, with the next likely stop being around the $2.10 area.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 02:01:04

Google Photos AI is making significant strides with a major update, rolling out powerful new features that leverage AI to transform how we edit and manage our memories. This evolution in mainstream AI technology highlights the rapid advancements happening across the tech landscape, relevant to anyone interested in the future of digital tools and platforms. Redesigned Google Photos: A Fresh Look and Enhanced Power Google is celebrating a decade of Google Photos by introducing a significantly redesigned editor. This update isn’t just a cosmetic change; it brings a suite of advanced AI capabilities previously exclusive to Pixel devices to a much wider audience. The goal is to make powerful editing more accessible and intuitive for everyone using the app on Android and, later, iOS. This Redesigned Google Photos experience centralizes tools and offers helpful suggestions, streamlining the editing workflow considerably. Unlocking Creativity with Generative AI Photo Features At the heart of this update are new generative AI tools that push the boundaries of photo editing. One standout feature is ‘Reimagine’. This tool uses Generative AI Photo technology to allow users to alter objects and backgrounds within their pictures using simple text prompts. Imagine changing a dull sky to ‘clear blue skies’ or transforming elements in the scene just by describing what you want. This level of control, driven by AI, offers unprecedented creative possibilities directly within the app. Powerful AI Photo Editing Capabilities Beyond generative transformations, the update enhances core AI Photo Editing functions. The ‘Auto Frame’ feature intelligently suggests optimal ways to frame your shots, whether that involves cropping, widening the perspective, or even using generative AI to fill in blank areas created by adjustments. Another notable addition is the ‘AI Enhance’ option, which bundles multiple AI effects for quick, impactful edits. Users can combine actions like sharpening an image and removing unwanted objects in a single tap. The editor also provides contextual suggestions; tap on a specific part of your photo, and Google Photos might suggest relevant tools like adjusting lighting or blurring the background. Accessing Advanced Google AI Tools Bringing these sophisticated capabilities to all users democratizes access to advanced Google AI Tools . These features were previously a key differentiator for Google’s Pixel phones, showcasing the company’s leading edge in mobile AI. Now, with the global rollout starting next month for Android devices and coming later this year to iOS, millions more people will be able to leverage these powerful functions directly within the Google Photos app. This move signals Google’s commitment to making its AI innovations available across its popular platforms. Beyond Editing: Enhanced Sharing and Community While the editor redesign is the main highlight, Google also announced a practical new feature for sharing: QR codes for albums. This makes it significantly easier to share photo albums with people nearby or at events. You can simply display or print a QR code, and anyone who scans it can instantly view and even add photos to the shared album. This small but useful addition simplifies collaboration and sharing memories in group settings. The integration of advanced Google Photos AI features represents a significant leap in mobile photo editing. By making powerful generative and assistive AI tools widely available, Google is changing how people interact with their photos, offering creative control and simplified editing workflows. As AI continues to evolve, its integration into everyday applications like Google Photos demonstrates its growing impact on technology used globally, a trend closely watched by innovators in fields like cryptocurrency and blockchain.

In the aftermath of SUI’s meteoric rise, many find themselves reflecting on missed chances. The window to early entry has closed, and the market’s attention is shifting. In this new wave of momentum, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged not just as a promising presale—but as a technology platform purpose-built to resolve the persistent issues that hindered earlier blockchain projects. While SUI advanced the architecture of high-throughput Layer 1s, Qubetics delivers real-world applications through interoperability, decentralization, and unmatched user flexibility. With a presale that has already raised over millions, the narrative is clear: this project is quickly becoming the most popular cryptocurrency among informed adopters. Qubetics: A Strategic Entry into Practical Web3 Innovation For those who missed SUI, Qubetics offers a rare opportunity to enter at the ground level of a project engineered for real-world adoption. Positioned as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics brings cross-chain interoperability, a user-centric non-custodial wallet, and advanced transaction capabilities into one seamless ecosystem. Currently in its 36th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $17.5 million in contributions. The token, priced at $0.3064, has drawn widespread attention due to its strong performance metrics and expansive roadmap. Over 514 million $TICS have been sold to a rapidly growing community of over 27,200 holders—clear evidence of market confidence. At the heart of Qubetics lies its multi-chain, non-custodial wallet application—designed for professionals, businesses, and everyday users who require flexibility, speed, and control over their digital assets. This wallet allows seamless asset management across various blockchains without requiring multiple interfaces or custodial intermediaries. A digital design agency accepting global payments can simplify accounting by aggregating multi-chain revenues in a single dashboard. There’s no need for constant wallet switching or managing several DeFi apps. One of the most compelling aspects of Qubetics lies in its wealth-building potential. With $TICS currently priced at $0.3064 during the presale, projections for post-launch returns are turning heads across the investment community. If $TICS reaches $1, early participants could secure a return on investment of 226%. Should the token climb to $5, the ROI surges to 1,531%. At $6, that jumps to 1,858%, while a $10 valuation would represent an astonishing 3,163% return. And if $TICS hits $15 following the mainnet launch, early holders could see a remarkable 4,795% ROI. Investing in $TICS at this stage isn’t merely speculation—it’s securing a position in the backbone of tomorrow’s decentralized web. Qubetics addresses the usability gap left by earlier platforms and positions itself as the most popular cryptocurrency for practical Web3 deployment. SUI: A Breakthrough with Limited Access SUI, developed by Mysten Labs, introduced an advanced Layer 1 blockchain architecture that utilized the Move programming language and parallel transaction execution. Its design offered significant scalability improvements and real-time finality—ideal for decentralized applications in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs. The launch was widely anticipated and gained substantial traction, particularly among developers seeking new, high-performance chains. For builders, this means longer timelines. For early buyers, it introduces uncertainty and missed compounding opportunities. This scenario has become familiar: a groundbreaking concept launches, early access is limited, and by the time the broader market is onboard, the upside potential has largely diminished. It’s a pattern that defines many most popular cryptocurrency projects in hindsight. Conclusion: An Opportunity That Demands Action History rewards those who act with foresight. While SUI delivered exceptional performance, many were excluded from its earliest and most profitable stages. Qubetics presents a fresh opportunity—with advanced technology, a clear roadmap, and significant backing. The next most popular cryptocurrency is unlikely to resemble the last. It will solve new problems, unlock new efficiencies, and deliver returns to those who recognize its value early. Do not allow another opportunity to pass by unnoticed. Participate in the Qubetics presale, evaluate its utility, and secure a position before the narrative changes again. This is a rare convergence of timing, technology, and upside potential. And for those who take action now, the rewards may be transformative.

45226635,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163778,1748485825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45226635.jpeg,DeepSeek R1: Crucial AI Model Update Released on Hugging Face,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/deepseek-r1-hugging-face/,"BitcoinWorld DeepSeek R1: Crucial AI Model Update Released on Hugging Face In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, developments from key players like DeepSeek often capture significant attention. For those following the intersection of technology and digital assets, understanding these shifts is vital as AI increasingly influences various sectors, including blockchain and data analysis. A notable event occurred on May 28, 2025, when Chinese startup DeepSeek announced a significant DeepSeek R1 update. What Does This AI Model Update Entail? DeepSeek, a company that gained prominence earlier this year, has rolled out an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model. This particular model is known for its capabilities that previously challenged established models from companies like OpenAI. The announcement, initially shared via a WeChat message, confirms that this is a “minor” upgrade, according to DeepSeek’s own description. While DeepSeek terms it a minor adjustment, any update to a model of R1’s caliber is noteworthy. Details on the specific improvements are limited within the public release information, which primarily includes configuration files and weights rather than a detailed description of the model’s enhancements. However, the release itself signals ongoing development and refinement of their core technology. The Significance of the Hugging Face Release A key aspect of this announcement is the Hugging Face release . DeepSeek has made the updated R1 model available on this popular developer platform. Hugging Face serves as a central hub for open-source machine learning models and datasets, facilitating collaboration and accessibility within the AI community. Putting the updated R1 on Hugging Face means it’s now more readily available for researchers, developers, and organizations to access, experiment with, and potentially integrate into their own projects. This move aligns with the trend of making powerful AI tools more accessible, although the model’s size presents practical challenges for many users. Exploring the Power of Reasoning AI The DeepSeek R1 is fundamentally a Reasoning AI model. Reasoning models are designed to perform complex cognitive tasks that go beyond simple pattern recognition. They aim to understand context, infer information, and make logical deductions, skills crucial for advanced applications like complex problem-solving, sophisticated data analysis, and generating highly coherent and contextually relevant text. DeepSeek’s focus on reasoning capabilities sets its models apart and contributed to R1’s initial success and the attention it received. The continuous updating of such models suggests a commitment to advancing AI’s ability to handle more abstract and logical challenges. Understanding the Scale: A Massive Large Language Model The updated R1 model is described as having 685 billion parameters. Parameters are essentially the internal components that guide a model’s behavior, often synonymous with ‘weights.’ This parameter count places R1 firmly in the category of a Large Language Model (LLM). To put 685 billion parameters into perspective, this is an extremely large model. Running such a model typically requires significant computational resources, including high-end GPUs and substantial memory. Consequently, without specific modifications or quantization techniques, the updated R1 model is unlikely to run on standard consumer-grade hardware. This means its immediate use case is primarily for organizations and researchers with access to powerful computing infrastructure. What About Licensing and Concerns? DeepSeek has released the updated R1 under a permissive MIT license. This is a significant point as it means the model can be used commercially. An MIT license is one of the most liberal open-source licenses, allowing users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software without restriction, provided the original copyright and permission notice are included. Despite the open licensing, DeepSeek’s technology has previously attracted scrutiny. Some regulators, particularly in the United States, have expressed concerns that DeepSeek’s AI capabilities could pose a national security risk, given the company’s origins. These concerns highlight the broader geopolitical considerations surrounding advanced AI development and its potential dual-use nature. Concluding Thoughts The release of DeepSeek’s updated R1 reasoning AI model on Hugging Face, despite being labeled a “minor” update, is an important event in the AI space. It makes a powerful, commercially usable reasoning model more accessible to the global developer community, reinforcing the trend towards open model sharing. While the sheer scale of the 685 billion parameter model limits its immediate accessibility to those with significant computational resources, and regulatory concerns persist, DeepSeek’s continued development and release strategy signal its intent to remain a key player in the advanced AI market.

The number landed well above expectations and immediately pushed Nvidia’s stock up around 6% in after-hours trading. The company also beat on earnings, posting 96 cents per share, adjusted, compared to the 93 cents analysts expected. Despite new restrictions from Washington that blocked shipments of its H20 AI chips to China, Nvidia still delivered one of its strongest quarters ever. The company had been set to make nearly $8 billion more in revenue if not for the policy change. During the quarter, the US government informed the company that the H20 chip, which had previously been cleared, would now require an export license. That decision forced Nvidia to take a $4.5 billion hit from excess inventory and wiped out $2.5 billion in potential sales. China ban slams revenue, Jensen Huang says AI market is closed to US Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang told investors during the earnings call that the new export controls effectively blocked US companies from competing in China’s massive AI chip market. “The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China,” Jensen said. He added that the $50 billion AI chip opportunity in China is now “effectively closed to US industry.” The company’s gross margin came in at 61%, but would have been 71.3% if not for the China-related losses. Still, Nvidia’s net income for the quarter climbed 26% to $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, compared to $14.9 billion or 60 cents per share a year ago. Revenue jumped from $26 billion a year earlier, driven largely by the company’s data center unit. That division, which includes the hardware powering AI tools like ChatGPT, rose 73% to $39.1 billion, accounting for 88% of total revenue. Nvidia said that almost half of the data center business came from large cloud providers. Sales of networking products, which connect thousands of GPUs for AI training, hit $5 billion. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told investors that Microsoft has “deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs and is expected to ramp to hundreds of thousands” of the company’s GB200 chips, mainly due to its work with OpenAI. Gaming, auto, and visualization units post solid gains The gaming division, once the company’s main business, pulled in $3.8 billion, a 42% increase from the previous year. Nvidia still builds the processor for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, but many of these chips now double for AI purposes too. The automotive and robotics unit brought in $567 million, up 72%, boosted by more demand for chips and software used in self-driving technology. The professional visualization segment, including hardware like the DGX Spark and DGX Station, posted $509 million in revenue, up 19% from last year. These machines are used for AI and 3D design workloads. The company also returned cash to shareholders in a big way. It spent $14.1 billion on share repurchases and issued $244 million in dividends during the quarter. Despite facing regulatory setbacks and a China chokehold, Nvidia is less than 5% off its record high from January and is currently sitting at its highest level in four months. Outside of the company’s report, financial markets got another jolt late Wednesday when the US Court of International Trade ruled against President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. The court said Trump had overreached and ordered the tariffs to be vacated. S&P 500 futures rose 1.6%, Nasdaq 100 futures added 2%, and the Dow Jones futures climbed 511 points, or 1.2%. This came after a sluggish session where the S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%, and the Dow lost 245 points. But by the end of the week, things looked different. Major indexes are now on pace to end both the week and the month higher. The S&P 500 is up 1.5%, the Dow rose 1.2%, and the Nasdaq gained 2%. The tech sector alone has surged over 10% in May, driven by the AI wave and announcements from companies like Alphabet. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

One such player making waves recently is DeepSeek AI . This Chinese AI lab has burst onto the global scene, gaining viral attention and sparking discussions about the future of artificial intelligence. What is DeepSeek AI and Where Did it Come From? DeepSeek AI quickly rose to prominence, topping app store charts and capturing the attention of analysts and technologists alike. Its rapid ascent has led many to question the current global AI landscape and the dynamics of the AI race. But what exactly is DeepSeek, and how did a relatively new player achieve such widespread recognition? The origins of DeepSeek AI are tied to the financial world. It is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a quantitative hedge fund based in China that leverages AI for its trading strategies. Founded in 2015 by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, High-Flyer Capital Management established DeepSeek in 2023 as a dedicated AI research lab, separate from its core financial operations. The lab eventually spun off into its own entity, retaining the name DeepSeek, with High-Flyer as a key investor. From its inception, DeepSeek invested in building its own data center infrastructure for model training. However, like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has faced challenges due to U.S. export restrictions on advanced hardware. This has meant using chips like the Nvidia H800, a less powerful alternative to the H100 available elsewhere, for training some of its larger AI Models . The DeepSeek team is notable for its composition, reportedly featuring a young technical staff aggressively recruited from top Chinese universities. The company also hires individuals from non-computer science backgrounds to enhance its models’ understanding across diverse subjects, aiming to build a more versatile AI Chatbot . Exploring DeepSeek’s Powerful AI Models DeepSeek first unveiled its suite of AI Models in November 2023, including DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat. However, it was the release of the next-generation DeepSeek-V2 family of models that truly captured the AI industry’s attention. Key characteristics of DeepSeek-V2: A general-purpose system capable of analyzing both text and images. Strong performance across various AI benchmarks. Significantly lower operational costs compared to contemporary models. Forced domestic competitors like ByteDance and Alibaba to reduce their own model pricing, with some even becoming free. The launch of DeepSeek-V3 in December 2024 further solidified DeepSeek’s reputation. According to the company’s internal testing, DeepSeek V3 demonstrated performance exceeding both openly available models like Meta’s Llama and closed models accessed via API, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Another impressive model is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model, released in January. DeepSeek claims R1 performs comparably to OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. As a reasoning model, R1 incorporates a self-fact-checking mechanism designed to mitigate common AI pitfalls. While reasoning models might take slightly longer to generate responses (seconds to minutes), they tend to be more reliable, particularly in complex domains like physics, science, and mathematics. The Challenges and Controversies of China AI Despite their technical prowess, DeepSeek’s AI Models face specific challenges inherent to being developed in China. They are subject to oversight and benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure they align with “core socialist values.” This regulatory environment impacts the behavior of the AI Chatbot . For instance, the R1 model within the DeepSeek app will not provide answers to sensitive political questions regarding topics like Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. Beyond domestic regulation, DeepSeek has also become a point of contention in the broader geopolitical and industry landscape. In March, traffic to DeepSeek saw significant visits, positioning it strongly, though still far behind giants like ChatGPT in terms of overall user base. However, the company’s disruptive approach and technical claims have not gone unnoticed. DeepSeek’s Disruptive Business Model and Industry Impact One of the most puzzling aspects of DeepSeek AI is its seemingly unconventional business model. The company prices its products and services significantly below market rates, even offering some for free. Despite considerable venture capital interest, DeepSeek is reportedly not seeking external investment. The company attributes this strategy to breakthroughs in efficiency that allow for extreme cost competitiveness, although some experts have questioned these claims. Regardless of the specifics, developers have embraced DeepSeek’s models. While not strictly open source, they are available under permissive licenses allowing commercial use. Platforms like Hugging Face host DeepSeek’s models, with thousands of derivative models created by developers, accumulating millions of downloads. DeepSeek’s success has been described in various ways, from “upending AI” to being potentially “over-hyped.” Its emergence coincided with an 18% drop in Nvidia’s stock price in January and elicited public comments from industry leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, highlighting the competitive pressure and strategic importance of AI infrastructure. However, DeepSeek also faces significant pushback, particularly from governments concerned about data security and potential propaganda. U.S. Commerce department bureaus, New York state, and countries like South Korea have banned DeepSeek on government devices. Microsoft’s Vice Chairman and President also cited data security and propaganda concerns for prohibiting its use by Microsoft employees, despite Microsoft Azure AI Foundry listing DeepSeek as available. OpenAI has gone as far as to label DeepSeek as “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” recommending that the U.S. government consider banning its models. Conversely, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” noting that reasoning models like R1 are beneficial for Nvidia due to their high compute demands. The Future of DeepSeek AI Predicting the exact future trajectory of DeepSeek AI is challenging. Continued development and improvement of its Generative AI models are likely. However, the increasing scrutiny and potential bans from governments, particularly in the U.S., pose significant obstacles. Reports suggest the U.S. government is likely to implement broader bans on DeepSeek for government use, reflecting growing wariness over perceived foreign influence in critical technology sectors. Conclusion DeepSeek AI’s rapid rise from a hedge fund lab to a globally recognized AI Chatbot provider is a testament to its technical innovation and disruptive strategy, particularly its focus on compute-efficient AI Models . It has successfully challenged established players, influenced pricing dynamics, and sparked debate about the global AI race and the role of China AI . While its technical achievements are clear, the company navigates a complex landscape of geopolitical tensions, regulatory constraints, and industry competition, making its future path uncertain but undeniably impactful on the evolution of Generative AI .

Recently, VivoPower International — a NASDAQ-listed energy firm — announced it had raised $121 million in a private share placement to launch a digital asset treasury strategy centered on XRP. What makes this move even more interesting is that the funding was led by His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, a long-time investor in digital assets and XRP. In an official statement, the Saudi prince revealed that his team met with President Trump and his leadership group during a recent visit to Saudi Arabia. Following those discussions, they believed the timing was right to embrace digital assets and blockchain technology in the Kingdom. This meeting appears to have played a key role in accelerating plans for the XRP-focused treasury strategy. VivoPower aims to become the first public company to officially hold XRP as part of its treasury reserves, joining a growing trend of firms adding cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. BREAKING: The Saudi Prince (per his own quote) met with President Trump and decided the timing was right for an $XRP focused public company! THIS IS MASSIVE NEWS FOR XRP! https://t.co/L57EnifPbY pic.twitter.com/SFHRtqraC1 — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) May 28, 2025 Adding to the excitement, former SBI Ripple Asia executive Adam Traidman has joined VivoPower as chairman of its advisory board. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also acknowledged the move, highlighting it as a major step forward for the XRP ecosystem. This development shows how digital assets like XRP are being adopted at the institutional and governmental level. While it remains unclear how directly involved Trump was in pushing this deal, the timing and the prince’s remarks hint that their meeting may have influenced the decision. For XRP holders, this news offers a bullish signal. As more institutions and global players consider integrating digital assets into their financial strategies, XRP appears to be climbing back into the spotlight.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 02:59:44

45227484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=760361,1748487643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45227484.jpeg,"Bitcoin Set For 50%+ Move Within 6 Months, Says Hedge Fund Boss",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-50-move-within-6-months/,"Bitcoin is currently changing hands just above $108,000, consolidating after Tuesday’s fresh all-time high. Charles Edwards, founder of the digital-asset hedge fund Capriole Investments, believes that price could be at least 50% higher by November. In his latest market note, “Saddle Up,” released on 27 May, the manager argues that a rare confluence of macro, technical and on-chain factors has created “the most bullish technical setup we could ask for for Bitcoin at all-time highs.” Bitcoin 50% Rally Is “Conservative” Edwards first set the stage for the call in late April, when Bitcoin was trading near $93,000. “We noted the bullish Bitcoin setup and expectation to be ‘pushing new all-time highs quite soon’,” he recalled. One month later the market has risen 16%, validating that view and, in Edwards’s telling, clearing the decks for the next leg higher. Central to the thesis is what Edwards dubs the “Hard Asset Era.” A breakout in the Gold-to-S&P 500 ratio above its 200-week moving average signals that investors are again favouring scarce stores of value over equities. Historically, such regimes are “sticky,” he writes, adding that the ensuing outperformance of gold over stocks has ranged from 150% to 650% in past cycles. “If you think gold has already rallied a lot, think again,” Edwards said. On that analogue, Bitcoin — which tends to lag gold by several months — could be poised for even steeper gains. Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Recent policy changes have underpinned the rotation. Basel III rules elevated gold to Tier-1 reserve status in 2022, forcing banks to back paper positions with physical metal, while last year’s approvals of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened institutional flood-gates to the cryptocurrency. Washington’s creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early 2025 provided an additional layer of state-level legitimacy. Against the same backdrop, persistent inflation, tariff frictions and the precedent of freezing Russian foreign-exchange reserves have catalysed demand for politically neutral assets. Bitcoin Technicals And Fundamental From a market-structure standpoint, Bitcoin’s April slide to $75,000 and sharp recovery above $90,000 is described as a text-book “fake-out” — a failed breakdown that often precedes powerful upside trends. The weekly close reclaim above $90,000 “marked the start of a new trend,” Edwards contends, making the $104,000 level the first line of defence. “As long as price is above $104K, this is the most bullish technical setup we could ask for,” he wrote, reducing near-term risk management to a single number. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock Capriole’s machine-learning-driven Bitcoin Macro Index, which blends more than 100 on-chain, macro and equity-market variables, continues to register in “bullish growth.” Apparent demand (production minus dormant supply) has turned positive, US liquidity remains supportive, and Capriole’s new “Volume Summer” metric shows trend-confirming expansion in trading activity. Taken together with the historical three-to-five-month lag between gold breakouts and Bitcoin rallies, the firm argues that “a 50 %-plus rise over the next six months is a conservative target.” Policy Wild-Cards The clearest threats to the projection lie on the policy front. Edwards highlights a 30- to 60-day window for the United States to strike tariff compromises with China and the European Union; failure could dent risk appetite. He also warns that the flourishing “Bitcoin-treasury arbitrage” — whereby corporates issue low-cost debt to accumulate BTC — could amplify downside in a future deleveraging, though leverage levels remain manageable for now. For the moment, however, the combination of a hard-asset bull cycle, confirmed technical strength and improving fundamentals keeps Capriole “very optimistic about the mid- to long-term potential for both gold and Bitcoin.” As long as the market holds above that $104,000 weekly pivot, Edwards suggests investors should — in his own closing words — “saddle up.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,005.
