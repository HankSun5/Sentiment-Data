This development highlights a broader trend of companies exploring how digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, can serve strategic financial purposes beyond just trading. What is a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Why Does it Matter? A Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as part of its corporate reserves, similar to how traditional companies hold cash, bonds, or gold. It’s a decision driven by various factors, often including: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about currency devaluation, some companies see Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a potential hedge against inflation. Store of Value: Positioning Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, potentially appreciating over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings. Signal of Innovation: Demonstrating forward-thinking adoption of emerging technologies. For a company like K33, a crypto broker, adopting such a strategy aligns with its core business and can instill confidence in its customers and investors regarding its belief in the asset class it facilitates trading for. K33 ‘s Strategic Crypto Funding Explained K33, a prominent name in the Nordic crypto market, announced on its official website that it has successfully raised 60 million SEK, equivalent to approximately $6.22 million USD. This funding wasn’t from a typical venture capital round but through investment agreements with its key, long-term shareholders. The stated purpose of this capital injection is explicit: to fund the company’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. This means the raised funds are earmarked specifically for acquiring Bitcoin to be held on K33’s balance sheet. This move is strategic for several reasons: It strengthens K33’s financial position by adding a potentially appreciating asset. It demonstrates a strong conviction from its core investors in both K33’s business model and the long-term value of Bitcoin. It positions K33 as a proactive player in the crypto broker space, potentially attracting clients interested in companies with direct exposure to Bitcoin. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Investment While K33’s move is significant for a crypto broker, the concept of companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury is not entirely new. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, is perhaps the most well-known example, holding billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Other public and private companies have also allocated portions of their reserves to the digital asset. Here are a few notable examples (values are approximate and subject to change): Company Approx. BTC Holdings Estimated Current USD Value Primary Motivation (often cited) MicroStrategy ~214,400 BTC ~$13.5 Billion+ Inflation hedge, Capital allocation strategy Marathon Digital Holdings ~17,631 BTC ~$1.1 Billion+ Treasury reserve, Assets from mining Coinbase ~10,500 BTC ~$660 Million+ Corporate treasury Tesla ~9,720 BTC ~$610 Million+ Corporate treasury diversification Note: These figures are estimates based on publicly available data and market prices at a given time. K33 joining this list, especially as a dedicated crypto broker, adds another layer to the narrative of institutional and corporate adoption. It suggests that even companies deeply embedded within the crypto ecosystem see strategic value in holding the underlying asset itself, not just facilitating its trade. Implications for the Crypto Broker Landscape and Beyond K33’s decision could have ripple effects. As a regulated crypto broker operating in Europe, its move might inspire other similar firms to consider their own treasury strategies. If more crypto-native companies allocate capital to Bitcoin, it could further legitimize the asset class and potentially drive additional demand. For investors, this news from K33 provides insight into how companies operating directly in the crypto space are managing their balance sheets and expressing their long-term outlook on Bitcoin. It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component of corporate finance. Key Takeaways from K33’s Funding Round K33 secured $6.22 million specifically for a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The funding came from key existing shareholders, indicating strong internal support. This move reflects growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. It positions K33 uniquely within the crypto broker market by directly holding BTC on its balance sheet with dedicated funding. The trend of corporate Bitcoin investment continues to gain traction. K33’s successful funding round for its Bitcoin treasury strategy is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic statement. It underscores the increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and highlights how companies, particularly those in the digital asset space, are integrating cryptocurrencies into their long-term financial planning. As the crypto market matures, expect to see more innovative approaches like this shaping the future of corporate finance.

The filing, dated May 27, 2025, addresses a fundamental regulatory question: when does a crypto asset, originally distributed under an investment contract, cease to be considered a security? This correspondence follows a meeting held on May 20 between Ripple and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. It aligns with Commissioner Hester Peirce’s recent “New Paradigm” speech . Ripple’s letter aims to provide a legal and policy framework to help clarify the distinction between securities and non-securities in the context of digital assets, particularly those like XRP. BREAKING: @Ripple has submitted an additional letter to the SEC, addressing a crucial question about when a token should lose its security label! BULLISH FOR #XRP pic.twitter.com/b5qD9MHivw — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 28, 2025 Reinforcing XRP’s Status With Existing Case Law Ripple’s letter draws from established legal analysis, particularly the 2022 paper, The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law by Lewis Cohen and others. The company argues that current law does not support classifying most fungible crypto assets as securities when traded on secondary markets. Ripple cites a section of the paper that emphasizes how these assets do not involve the kind of legal relationship characteristic of investment contracts. The company also references Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling from July 2023 , where it was determined that Ripple’s programmatic token sales and other secondary market transactions did not qualify as securities. Judge Torres ruled that while Ripple’s past institutional sales involved investment contracts, these did not apply to subsequent market transactions, and the token itself is not a security. This distinction plays a central role in Ripple’s argument that XRP should not be broadly classified as a security. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Proposing a Maturity-Based Framework Ripple proposes using “maturity” as a clearer regulatory standard than “decentralization.” Under this approach, a digital asset would no longer be regulated as a security once its network becomes sufficiently independent. Ripple suggests indicators like market capitalization, operational history, and lack of unilateral control as signs of maturity, arguing these factors offer a more practical measure of independence than metrics such as token distribution or ties to the issuer. Avoiding Misleading Disclosure Requirements Ripple’s letter also warns that requiring ongoing disclosures for non-securities could mislead the public into thinking affiliated parties still control the asset. Many detractors wrongly assume that XRP is centralized , and requirements like these could amplify those false beliefs. The filing comes amid Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, when the proposed settlement agreement was denied on procedural grounds . Ripple’s latest submission reinforces its stance that XRP should not be treated as a security, and settling the case with the SEC would help cement the asset’s status.

In a move poised to shape the future of the industry, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the nation’s primary financial watchdog, has initiated a public consultation on proposed regulations for two critical areas: stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody services. This development marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing evolution of UK crypto regulation , signaling a commitment to balancing innovation with necessary safeguards. What is the Latest in UK Crypto Regulation ? The core of this recent announcement is the FCA’s call for feedback on its proposed rules. As reported by Cointelegraph, the regulator is seeking input from a wide range of stakeholders – including crypto firms, traditional financial institutions, consumer groups, academics, and the general public – on how best to regulate activities involving stablecoins and the safekeeping of digital assets. This isn’t just a bureaucratic exercise; it’s an open invitation to participate in designing the regulatory landscape for a rapidly evolving sector. The proposals stem from the UK government’s broader ambition to establish the country as a global hub for crypto asset technology and investment. Recognizing the potential of digital assets while also acknowledging the inherent risks, the FCA is working to create a regulatory environment that fosters market trust and encourages responsible innovation. This collaborative effort also involves close coordination with the Bank of England, particularly concerning stablecoins, which have implications for monetary and financial stability. Deep Dive: Understanding the FCA Stablecoin Proposals Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset or basket of assets, such as fiat currencies (like the British Pound), commodities, or other cryptocurrencies. Their potential use cases range from facilitating faster and cheaper payments to enabling seamless trading within the crypto ecosystem. However, the stability of stablecoins is paramount. A loss of confidence or a failure in their mechanisms could pose risks to users and potentially the wider financial system, especially if they achieve significant scale. The FCA stablecoin proposals are expected to cover various aspects, likely including: Issuance Requirements: Rules for entities creating and issuing stablecoins, focusing on areas like reserve management, transparency, and governance. Holding and Transfers: Regulations for firms that facilitate the holding or transfer of stablecoins, ensuring secure and reliable transactions. Consumer Protection: Measures aimed at protecting individuals and businesses using stablecoins, including clear information disclosure and complaint resolution mechanisms. The FCA’s focus here aligns with global efforts to bring stablecoins under regulatory purview, recognizing their potential as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Collaboration with the Bank of England highlights the systemic importance stablecoins could eventually hold. Securing Your Assets: The Focus on Crypto Custody UK Crypto custody refers to the service of storing private keys for cryptocurrency wallets on behalf of clients. Since losing private keys means losing access to the digital assets, secure and reliable custody is fundamental to the crypto ecosystem, particularly for institutional investors and businesses holding significant amounts of crypto. Currently, the regulatory landscape for crypto custody providers in the UK is less defined than for traditional financial custodians. The FCA’s consultation aims to address this gap by proposing rules that would likely impose stringent requirements on firms offering these services in the crypto custody UK market. Potential areas of regulation could include: Security Standards: Mandating robust cybersecurity measures and operational resilience to protect stored assets from theft or loss. Capital Requirements: Ensuring custody providers have sufficient financial resources to manage risks and potential liabilities. Segregation of Assets: Requiring firms to keep client assets separate from their own operational funds. Governance and Risk Management: Establishing clear frameworks for how firms are run and how they identify and mitigate risks. By regulating crypto custody, the FCA seeks to enhance investor protection and build confidence in the market, making it safer for both retail and institutional participants to hold digital assets. Why is the UK Financial Watchdog Taking Action Now? Several factors are driving the UK financial watchdog to prioritize stablecoin and custody regulation: Market Growth: The crypto market continues to grow, attracting more users and capital, increasing the need for clear rules. Risk Mitigation: Unregulated stablecoins and custody services pose risks of fraud, market manipulation, and systemic instability. Global Alignment: Other major jurisdictions are also developing crypto regulations, and the UK aims to stay competitive and interoperable. Government Strategy: This aligns with the UK government’s stated goal of becoming a leader in digital assets. Consumer Protection: A primary mandate of the FCA is to protect consumers and maintain market integrity. By addressing these foundational elements of the crypto market, the FCA is laying groundwork for future growth while attempting to prevent potential harm. How Can You Participate in Shaping Stablecoin Regulation UK ? This consultation period represents a critical opportunity for anyone involved in or interested in the crypto space to have their voice heard. The FCA is genuinely seeking feedback to ensure the regulations are practical, effective, and forward-looking. Actionable Insights for Participation: Read the Consultation Paper: The FCA will publish detailed documents outlining their specific proposals and the questions they are asking. Read these carefully to understand the nuances. Identify Relevant Areas: Focus your feedback on the areas most relevant to you or your business – whether it’s stablecoin issuance, using custody services, or the general impact on the market. Prepare a Response: Structure your feedback clearly. Provide specific examples or data to support your points. Explain the potential consequences (positive or negative) of the proposed rules. Submit Your Feedback: Follow the instructions provided by the FCA for submitting responses, paying close attention to the deadline. Engaging with the consultation process is vital. It allows the industry and the public to provide real-world context and technical expertise that can help the FCA refine its proposals and create regulations that are both effective and conducive to innovation in stablecoin regulation UK and custody. Potential Benefits of Clear Regulation Increased investor and consumer confidence. Greater participation from traditional financial institutions. Reduced risk of illicit activity and fraud. A clearer playing field for businesses, fostering competition. Enhanced market stability and integrity. Potential Challenges to Consider Risk of overly burdensome compliance costs for smaller firms. Defining the scope of regulation clearly in a rapidly changing space. Balancing innovation freedom with necessary oversight. Ensuring interoperability with international regulatory approaches. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for UK Crypto The FCA’s public consultation on stablecoins and crypto custody is more than just a regulatory update; it’s a defining moment for the UK’s position in the global digital asset landscape. By proactively addressing these foundational elements, the UK financial watchdog is taking a measured approach to integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system while attempting to mitigate the associated risks. The success of these regulations will depend significantly on the quality of the feedback received during this consultation period. It is an unparalleled opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to shaping rules that will govern how stablecoins are used and how digital assets are secured in the UK for years to come. Engaging now is crucial to ensure the final framework is robust, fair, and supportive of a thriving, safe, and innovative crypto ecosystem.

As traders move away from legacy tokens, it is clear that the next breakout stars are emerging from underdog projects with strong narratives and tech utility. FloppyPepe (FPPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are at the forefront of this rise, backed by surging community support and fast-developing ecosystems. While the Dogecoin price holds sentimental value, new capital is chasing high-reward, early-stage altcoins with significant upside. Those betting on early-stage altcoins today are laying the foundation for massive portfolio returns tomorrow. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The High-Upside AI Altcoin Set For An Explosive Rally Among all altcoins vying for attention, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out for its 600x upside potential. Backed by an AI utility stack that includes FloppyX for video content creation, Meme-o-Matic for viral meme generation, and FloppyAI for market insights, the token is far beyond a typical altcoin. While the Dogecoin price has matured after years of market presence, FloppyPepe (FPPE) trades at just $0.00000035 in Stage 2 of its presale. With Stage 1 having raised over $2 million, the presale is moving fast, with over $150,000 already secured in the current round. Early adopters are acting quickly, drawn by the rare blend of low entry price and massive upside. The FLOPPY80 bonus further fuels the meme token’s presale excitement, offering 80% more tokens per purchase. With analyst Nass Crypto calling FloppyPepe (FPPE) a top altcoin pick, interest is snowballing; the window to enter before the next price increase is rapidly closing. Why FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Structure Supports Long-Term Gains FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Floppynomics model further boosts its appeal, rewarding holders and reducing supply over time. Each transaction triggers a 1% burn, a 1% redistribution to token holders, and a 1% contribution to wildlife conservation. This multi-pronged structure gives the token long-term staying power. The project has passed a SolidProof smart contract audit , adding credibility and reassuring potential backers. With its link to Matt Furie’s legacy and regularly released hand-drawn art, FloppyPepe (FPPE) gains even more cultural depth. Dogecoin Price Gears Up for a Sudden Move To $2 Currently hovering around $0.227, the Dogecoin price continues to show strong bullish signs, with analysts forecasting a potential surge to $2. That’s an 8.7x move from today’s level, driven by increasing institutional interest and renewed on-chain activity. Technical analysts point to several bullish signals, including a break above the 200-day EMA and increasing open interest. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade further observes that the Dogecoin price mirrors the price action of the last pre-pump structure. All signs suggest that a rapid, potentially violent movement to $2 could be imminent for the Dogecoin price. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Breaking Out of Consolidation While short-term predictions suggest a 32% gain, long-term projections for Shiba Inu (SHIB) point to a possible 600x rise based on prior performance and ecosystem growth. Bullish technical patterns are forming, with Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) RSI indicating room for upward movement. Data from Santiment reveals primary whale interest, with over 530 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) accumulated recently. If this trend continues, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could become one of the top-performing altcoins of the cycle. Altcoin Momentum Is Shifting The Dogecoin price remains a valuable indicator of crypto sentiment, but the spotlight is moving toward altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FloppyPepe (FPPE) . The growing traction from the former’s ecosystem and the latter’s AI-powered utility propels both altcoins toward breakout moments. FloppyPepe (FPPE), in particular, is leading this charge. Its unique AI-powered offerings, with strong presale performance and viral appeal, position it for a possible 600x surge. The low price of $0.00000035 and the FLOPPY80 bonus make the deal even more enticing, as early investors rush in before mainstream awareness catches up. With the crypto market heating up and investor focus shifting, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FloppyPepe (FPPE) are defining the next wave of altcoin success. The chance to enter early, at ground-floor prices, is fleeting.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making. Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies. Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView In late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024 . The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance. Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase. Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Once SOL price enters price discovery, bullish momentum could target the 1.618 extension, suggesting SOL could reach as high as $418. However, failure to hold the 50-week EMA could cause SOL retest the lower support near $157. Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard Chartered Solana traders debate SOL’s next breakout catalyst While Solana continues to trade nearly 40% below its all-time high, SOL futures market activity remains robust. According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility. Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlass Funding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds. Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

If the pattern plays out, the trader warned that SOL could revisit $157 to $152 in the short term. The $180 level remains the critical inflection point. A decisive move above it could confirm a bullish continuation, while rejection may lead to a healthy correction to the $150–$160 range.

The announcement was made at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference on Wednesday at the Venetian Convention Center in Las Vegas by Bilal Bin Saqib, the special assistant to the Pakistani prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency. Saqib announced that Pakistan will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and never sell its BTC trove in future. Furthermore, Pakistan wants to follow in the footsteps of the United States, which intends to implement a strategic Bitcoin reserve to deal with the high debt burden. “We are getting inspired by the U.S. government. We will be holding these Bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” Saqib stated . What Next For Bitcoin Price Action? Bitcoin price experienced a significant resistance level above $110k in the past few days, thus resulting in the ongoing market correction. The flagship coin dropped over 2 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $107k on Wednesday, May 29, during the late North American trading session. Bitcoin price has experienced relentless bearish pressure since last Friday, despite the notable accumulation by institutional investors. Furthermore, more institutional investors, led by GameStop, have joined Strategy in acquiring more BTCs as a hedge against inflation. https://x.com/techcharts/status/1927791497090363555?s=46 According to market analyst, Aksel Kibar, Bitcoin price must clear the resistance hurdle around $109k, in the weekly timeframe, to invalidate a potential retrace towards $76k.

Recently, a significant claim has emerged from Sunil Kavuri , a prominent representative for FTX creditors, drawing a potentially controversial parallel between the trading activities of a well-known Crypto Whale and the infamous strategies of Alameda Research. What Are the Allegations Against James Wynn? The core of the recent stir comes from Sunil Kavuri , who took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to voice his observations. Kavuri specifically pointed towards the trading behavior of James Wynn , a figure recognized within the crypto community, particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid, for executing large trades. Kavuri’s assertion is that Wynn’s trading patterns bear a striking resemblance to the methods employed by Alameda Research , the sister company to the now-defunct FTX exchange. This comparison is highly significant because Alameda Research was at the heart of the FTX collapse, known for its aggressive trading strategies, privileged access to FTX resources, and accusations of market manipulation. The allegations are not just based on observed trading style. Kavuri’s claims are bolstered by past reports suggesting a direct financial link between Wynn and Alameda. According to previous reporting, James Wynn reportedly received payments from Alameda Research as far back as December 2020. While the nature or purpose of these payments hasn’t been explicitly detailed in the recent claims, their existence raises questions about potential prior connections or arrangements. The focus on Wynn’s trading isn’t new. Data analysis firm Lookonchain previously highlighted Wynn’s remarkable, albeit volatile, performance. They reported that Wynn managed to accumulate over $87 million in profits within a concentrated period of just 70 days. However, this period of immense gains was followed by a precipitous decline, with Wynn reportedly losing nearly all of those profits within a mere five days. This kind of rapid, high-stakes profit and loss cycle is precisely the type of volatile trading often associated with the leveraged and aggressive strategies that characterized Alameda Research . For FTX Creditors , any potential link or resemblance to Alameda’s operations is a sensitive point. These creditors are still navigating the complex process of recovering funds lost in the FTX collapse, a collapse largely attributed to the intertwined and allegedly improper relationship between FTX and Alameda Research. Therefore, any suggestion that entities or individuals may have benefited from or mimicked Alameda’s potentially problematic strategies attracts significant attention and concern from those seeking restitution. Why Does an Alameda Research Comparison Matter? Understanding why the comparison to Alameda Research is so potent requires a look back at what Alameda was and how it operated. Alameda was not just a typical trading firm; it was intrinsically linked to FTX, the exchange founded by the same individual, Sam Bankman-Fried. This relationship allegedly afforded Alameda significant advantages, including: Preferential Execution: Some reports and legal filings suggest Alameda had faster access to market data and execution speeds on FTX compared to regular users. Unlimited Credit Line: Crucially, Alameda allegedly had access to a massive, unchecked line of credit from FTX customer funds, allowing it to take on enormous risks without facing margin calls like other traders. Market Making & Liquidity Provision: While providing a legitimate service, their position also gave them deep insight into order books and market dynamics on FTX. Aggressive & Leveraged Trading: Alameda was known for using high leverage, making large directional bets, and engaging in complex trading strategies across various assets. The collapse revealed that the lines between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s balance sheet were blurred, leading to a multi-billion dollar shortfall when Alameda’s risky bets went south. Therefore, when Sunil Kavuri or others suggest that a trader’s style resembles Alameda’s, it implicitly raises questions about: Whether similar high-risk, high-leverage strategies are being employed. Whether the trader might have had access to unique information or advantages. The potential impact of such large-scale, volatile trading on market stability. For FTX Creditors , it could also stir concerns about whether past activities involving Alameda and other parties contributed to the overall financial picture that led to the exchange’s downfall. Who is Sunil Kavuri and Why Are His Claims Significant? Sunil Kavuri is not just a casual observer; he is a vocal and active representative for the interests of FTX Creditors . As part of the official committee representing unsecured creditors in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, Kavuri has been deeply involved in the process of understanding what happened, identifying assets, and advocating for the recovery of funds. His role gives his statements a certain weight, as they come from someone directly engaged in scrutinizing the aftermath of the FTX collapse. Kavuri has been particularly critical of various aspects of the bankruptcy process and has actively sought transparency and accountability regarding the handling of assets and the actions of parties involved with FTX and Alameda. His public statements often aim to shed light on potential issues or connections that he believes are relevant to the creditors’ ability to recover their losses. When Sunil Kavuri makes a claim connecting a current significant trader like James Wynn to the methods of Alameda Research , it’s significant because: It highlights the ongoing scrutiny of individuals and entities who may have had dealings with Alameda or FTX prior to the collapse. It suggests that the trading patterns observed by large players in the market are being watched and analyzed for potential red flags. It underscores the concerns of FTX Creditors that the full picture of Alameda’s activities and its relationships with other market participants has yet to be fully revealed. Kavuri’s position allows him access to information and a platform to raise concerns that resonate with the thousands of individuals and institutions who lost funds on FTX. Examining James Wynn’s Trading Activity: What Does the Data Show? The Lookonchain report provides a concrete example of the kind of volatile trading that has drawn attention to James Wynn . Earning $87 million in profits in 70 days is an extraordinary feat, indicative of highly successful, large-scale, and likely leveraged positions. However, losing nearly all of it in just five days is equally remarkable and speaks to the extreme risk involved. This boom-and-bust cycle, while possible for any high-leverage trader, aligns with the kind of outcomes that characterized Alameda’s performance at times. Alameda was known for making massive, sometimes ill-fated, bets that could result in huge swings in their balance sheet. The sheer scale of Wynn’s reported profits and subsequent losses is what makes the comparison to Alameda’s trading style pertinent. Here’s a simplified look at the reported data: Trader Period Reported Profit/Loss Notes James Wynn 70 Days +$87,000,000+ Rapid accumulation of gains James Wynn Following 5 Days ~-$87,000,000 Near total loss of recent gains This table illustrates the extreme volatility. While we don’t have direct, detailed comparisons of specific trade types or strategies used by Wynn versus documented Alameda trades, the overall pattern of massive, rapid swings in capital is a shared characteristic that fuels the comparison made by Sunil Kavuri . It’s important to note that publicly available data on trading performance, like that provided by Lookonchain, often focuses on realized profits and losses on specific addresses or tracked entities. A complete picture of a trader’s strategy would require much more detailed information, including their use of leverage, specific instruments traded (perpetuals, options, spot), entry and exit points, and risk management techniques (or lack thereof). Are These Allegations Actionable? Challenges and Implications While Sunil Kavuri ‘s claims connecting James Wynn ‘s trading to Alameda Research methods are significant within the community, proving a direct, improper link or actionable wrongdoing based solely on trading style and past payments presents challenges. Here are some points to consider: Proving “Trading Style”: Trading styles can resemble each other without implying collusion or improper advantage. Many large traders use similar high-leverage, high-frequency techniques, especially in volatile markets. Nature of Past Payments: The reported payments from Alameda to Wynn in 2020 would need further investigation. Were they for services rendered (e.g., market making, consulting), investments, or something else? The context is crucial. Lack of Direct Evidence (Publicly): Kavuri’s statement is an observation and a claim. Proving it in a legal or regulatory sense would require concrete evidence of coordinated activity, shared information, or specific instances of market manipulation linked to the alleged connection. Regulatory Interest: Claims like these, especially involving large traders and comparisons to entities involved in a major collapse, could potentially attract the attention of regulatory bodies interested in market integrity and past dealings related to FTX and Alameda. Impact on FTX Creditors: For FTX Creditors , uncovering any assets or past transactions that could potentially be clawed back or that shed light on the collapse is paramount. If there were any improper dealings between Alameda and other parties, identifying them is key to the recovery process. The implications of these allegations extend beyond just Wynn and Alameda. They highlight the ongoing scrutiny of large players in the crypto market, the methods they employ, and their historical connections to now-collapsed entities. They also underscore the persistent efforts of FTX Creditors and their representatives like Sunil Kavuri to piece together the full story of the FTX/Alameda saga and maximize recovery. The crypto market is still grappling with the fallout from 2022, and transparency regarding the activities of major players and defunct firms remains a critical concern for restoring trust and ensuring market health. The allegations against James Wynn , while needing further substantiation, serve as a reminder that the past is still very much relevant to the present state and future regulation of the industry. Conclusion: The Ongoing Shadow of Alameda Research Sunil Kavuri ‘s claims linking James Wynn ‘s trading style to that of Alameda Research have injected a new point of discussion into the crypto community, particularly among those affected by the FTX collapse. The reported past payments from Alameda to Wynn and the documented volatility of Wynn’s trading performance, including rapid nine-figure swings, provide the basis for Kavuri’s comparison. While the resemblance in trading style and historical financial ties do not automatically prove improper conduct, they are sufficient to raise questions and warrant attention, especially from the perspective of FTX Creditors . The shadow of Alameda Research continues to loom large over the crypto space, and any suggestion of its methods or connections resurfacing or influencing current market dynamics is bound to be met with scrutiny. As the FTX bankruptcy proceedings continue and the market matures, transparency, data analysis, and the vigilance of representatives like Sunil Kavuri play a crucial role in understanding past events and potentially identifying ongoing risks or previously undisclosed relationships. The allegations against James Wynn are a stark reminder that the complex web of connections from the 2022 crypto downturn is still being untangled.

TACO trade , which stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” refers to a pattern in which the president announces the imposition of heavy new tariffs, the markets then suffer a significant decline in a short time, and, later, he pauses the tariffs or makes them less severe, causing the market to recover after declining. Reporters asked Trump about the term at the White House. In response, he denied ever backing down, adding that his actions had put the US in a better position in trading discussions. Trump claims the EU accused him of backing down after making a “reasonable” deal with them The European Union is an example of those subjected to Trump’s tariff. EU had just been hit with a 50% US tariff before Trump highlighted two days later that he was hitting a delay button on his new levy. In his comments, the president credited the threat of a 50% tariff as a smart strategy for moving trade talks between the US and the EU. This was after he claimed that after he did what he did, the EU said that they would meet anytime he wanted. Afterward, the president asked, “Do you really think that’s backing down?” “It’s actually called negotiation,” he added after labeling the question “mean.” Trump further stated that it was unfortunate that they said he was backing down when he finally made a more “reasonable” deal with them. He remarked, “That’s just unbelievable.” To demonstrate the TACO trade effect on the EU market, stocks dropped after Trump suggested that the US should impose a high tariff on the EU starting June 1. Later, he announced he would push that deadline back to July 9 at the request of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Following the pause on the tariffs policy, stocks bounced back across major indexes when trade resumed. Trump’s Cabinet members describe his tariffs as a wise negotiation approach Trump’s Cabinet members have greatly supported his tariff policy. Last month, Trump administration officials defended the president’s wide-ranging tariffs that have created chaos on the stock market and fears of a recession, arguing that the import taxes were already forcing dozens of countries to negotiate. They told Americans not to panic as conservatives and liberals raised questions and criticism of tariffs with increasing vigor. Based on Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’s claims, fifty countries contacted the White House to talk with the President due to the trade tariffs. Furthermore, White House senior counselor Peter Navarro urged everyone not to worry, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected forecasts from economists and banks that suggested a recession was coming. The full-court press from cabinet members and advisers came as the administration faced intense pressure to walk back the tariffs, which prompted the largest loss in American stock market wealth since the panicked sell-off as COVID-19 spread in March 2020. Despite the strong support from his Cabinet members, several conservatives are increasingly vocal in opposing Trump’s actions, including an influential legal nonprofit backed by conservatives that is suing Trump over the tariffs, and some Republicans in both the House and the Senate are planning to try to stop the tariffs via legislation.

Bergen County, the most populous county in New Jersey, is making waves by embracing blockchain technology . This isn’t just a small pilot; it’s a major initiative set to transform how hundreds of thousands of property deeds are stored and accessed. What Exactly is Happening with Bergen County Blockchain? Bergen County has partnered with Balcony, a firm specializing in land records on the blockchain. The ambitious plan is to migrate 370,000 property deeds onto the Avalanche blockchain network. To put that into perspective, these deeds represent a staggering $240 billion worth of real estate. This move, as reported by CoinDesk, positions Bergen County as a potential leader in integrating distributed ledger technology into government functions. This project aims to take traditional paper or centralized digital records and place them onto an immutable, transparent, and secure ledger. It’s a step that could have far-reaching implications for property ownership and management in the region. Why Move Property Deeds to the Blockchain? The traditional system for managing property deeds and land records can be complex, slow, and prone to errors or potential fraud. Think about the lengthy process of buying or selling a home, involving title searches, escrow, and significant paperwork. By moving property deeds blockchain , Bergen County is looking to leverage the inherent advantages of this technology: Enhanced Security: Blockchain records are cryptographically secured and extremely difficult to alter once entered. This provides a high level of integrity for official documents like property deeds. Increased Transparency: While specific personal data might be kept off-chain or encrypted, the transaction history and the existence of a deed can be publicly verifiable on the blockchain ledger (depending on the specific implementation). Improved Efficiency: Automating certain processes related to record-keeping and verification could significantly speed up transactions and reduce administrative overhead for the county and residents. Reduced Fraud: The immutable nature of blockchain makes it much harder to forge or tamper with property records. This initiative represents a forward-thinking approach to modernizing essential government services and potentially setting a precedent for other municipalities. How Does Real Estate Blockchain Work in Practice? Putting real estate blockchain isn’t about owning your house with an NFT (at least, not yet!). In this context, it’s about using the blockchain as a secure, shared database for official records. Here’s a simplified view: When a property transaction occurs (sale, transfer, mortgage), the official deed information is digitized. This digital record (or a unique identifier/hash of the record) is then securely anchored onto the blockchain ledger via Balcony’s platform. Each entry is timestamped and linked to the previous one, creating an unbroken, verifiable chain. Anyone with access to the network can verify the existence and history of the record without needing to trust a single central authority (though the county remains the official source). The choice of the Avalanche blockchain is also notable. Avalanche is known for its speed, scalability, and relatively low transaction costs compared to some other networks, making it a suitable choice for handling a large volume of records and potential future activity. What Are the Potential Benefits for Residents and the County? This move isn’t just a technical upgrade; it has practical benefits: For Residents: Potentially faster and more transparent property transactions. Increased confidence in the security and accuracy of official property records. For Bergen County: Streamlined administrative processes, reduced costs associated with managing physical or legacy digital records, enhanced security against data breaches or tampering, and improved public access to non-sensitive record information. For the Real Estate Industry: Could pave the way for faster title searches, more efficient closing processes, and potentially new ways of managing property-related data. This project serves as a tangible example of how blockchain technology can move beyond cryptocurrency speculation and be applied to real-world governmental and administrative functions. Are There Challenges to Implementing Property Deeds on Blockchain? While the benefits are clear, transitioning to a property deeds blockchain system isn’t without its hurdles: Legal Framework: Does state law recognize a blockchain record as the official, legal deed? This often requires updates to existing statutes. Integration Complexity: Connecting the new blockchain system with existing county databases and workflows can be technically challenging. Data Privacy: Ensuring sensitive personal information is handled according to privacy regulations while still leveraging the transparency of blockchain. Adoption and Education: County staff, real estate professionals, and the public need to understand how the new system works. Long-term Maintenance: Ensuring the blockchain infrastructure remains secure and accessible for decades to come. Bergen County and Balcony will need to navigate these challenges carefully to ensure a successful and compliant implementation. What Does This Mean for the Future of Real Estate and Government Records? The Bergen County initiative could be a significant case study. If successful, it could inspire other counties and states to explore similar applications of real estate blockchain . Imagine a future where property records across the country are easily verifiable and securely stored on distributed ledgers, drastically simplifying interstate transactions and reducing administrative burdens. This project highlights a growing trend: governments exploring blockchain for various uses, from supply chain tracking to digital identity and now, land records. The choice of the Avalanche blockchain for such a large-scale governmental use case also underscores the increasing maturity and adoption of specific blockchain networks for enterprise and public sector applications. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward Bergen County’s decision to place 370,000 property deeds representing $240 billion onto the Avalanche blockchain is a bold and potentially transformative step. It demonstrates a willingness to embrace innovative blockchain technology to improve efficiency, security, and transparency in a critical government function. While challenges remain, the potential benefits for residents, the county, and the broader real estate sector are substantial. This project is a compelling example of how blockchain can move from theoretical potential to practical application in the public sector, setting a precedent for the future of digital record-keeping.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 789,100 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the period of altcoin underperformance against Bitcoin is almost over based on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart. The BTC.D chart tracks how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. A bearish BTC.D indicates that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. According to Van de Poppe, altcoins are now poised to outpace Bitcoin as the BTC.D chart is flashing a bearish reversal signal on the weekly chart. “The end of the bear market (yes, a bear market on altcoins underperforming Bitcoin) is still here. Strong bearish divergence on the Bitcoin dominance, implying we’re about to reverse and altcoins about to shine. Nothing has changed.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 63.89%. Looking at Bitcoin, the trader thinks BTC will retest a key psychological area as support before rallying to fresh record-high levels. “I’m monitoring the current price action and I won’t be surprised if we’re seeing a slight correction happening on Bitcoin. Probably macro-driven or whatever reason, but I wouldn’t be surprised to build some more stamina before we continue the rally to $120,000-$130,000.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $109,112. As for Ethereum ( ETH ), the analyst says a correction toward the $2,000 price level would present a solid opportunity for long-term investors. “Similarly, I think it’s vital that, if ETH drops beneath $2,400, that will give a tremendous opportunity. Ethereum rallied from $1,800 to $2,700 in a few days. If there’s a 10-20% correction, pretty normal, great opportunity to get yourself positioned into it.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,663.

While immediate attention often focuses on geopolitical factors like US chip export controls , experts suggest there’s a more fundamental indicator of Nvidia’s future health tucked within the report: the adoption and delivery success of its cutting-edge Nvidia AI hardware . Why Focus Shifts Beyond US Chip Export Controls The headlines frequently highlight the impact of trade restrictions, particularly concerning China, on Nvidia’s international business. These restrictions undoubtedly create short-term market volatility. However, veteran observers like Kevin Cook, a senior equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, argue that the long-term picture is less about navigating these hurdles and more about core demand for their technology. Cook notes that Nvidia’s stock has shown remarkable resilience, quickly recovering from dips related to export control news. He believes the company has a significant ‘moat’ and is less vulnerable to these issues than many might think. Even with potential limitations in one market, strong demand persists elsewhere. Consider these points: Immediate stock reactions to export news are often temporary. Nvidia has a broad customer base, including major global hyperscalers. New projects, like the Stargate initiative in the Middle East, demonstrate demand outside restricted regions. Therefore, while US chip export controls are worth monitoring for immediate market impact, they may not be the defining factor for Nvidia’s valuation down the line. Introducing Key Nvidia AI Hardware: The GB200 NVL72 Instead of solely focusing on export issues, Cook points to the rollout of new Nvidia AI hardware as a more significant metric. Specifically, he highlights the GB200 NVL72. This isn’t just another chip; it’s a powerful, single-rack exascale computer system designed for massive AI workloads. Key details about the GB200 NVL72: It includes 72 high-performance GPUs. The estimated cost is around $3 million per unit. Shipments began in February. This system represents the forefront of AI infrastructure, and its adoption rate provides crucial insight into how quickly and aggressively enterprises are investing in next-generation AI capabilities. Tracking GB200 NVL72 Deliveries in Nvidia Earnings The upcoming Nvidia earnings report will be the first opportunity to get concrete data on GB200 NVL72 shipments. This is uncharted territory, making the delivery numbers particularly important. Analyst expectations for this unit have seen significant adjustments. According to Cook, events earlier in the year led many analysts to halve their initial delivery estimates for the GB200 NVL72. This makes the actual reported figures even more critical. What numbers should observers watch for? A delivery target of 10,000 units in the next quarter would be seen as very impressive by the market, representing potentially $30 billion in revenue from this product alone. Cook, however, anticipates a more conservative number, possibly less than 5,000 units initially. The reported delivery figures and future guidance for the GB200 NVL72 will offer the first real glimpse into the initial success and production ramp-up of this significant new product. Gauging Enterprise AI Demand: The Upgrade Cycle Question Beyond the raw numbers, the adoption rate of the GB200 NVL72 speaks to a larger trend: the nature of Enterprise AI demand . Will companies treat AI hardware upgrades like consumers treat smartphone upgrades, consistently buying the latest and most powerful systems? Or will they adopt a slower, more measured approach? This question is fundamental to Nvidia’s long-term growth trajectory. If enterprises rapidly adopt new generations of AI chips and hardware, it ensures a continuous revenue stream and sustains Nvidia’s leading position. A slower upgrade cycle, on the other hand, could impact future growth forecasts and valuation. The early delivery numbers for the GB200 NVL72 will start to paint a picture of this crucial enterprise behavior, offering insights far more impactful than short-term fluctuations caused by export controls. Looking Beyond the Headlines in Nvidia Earnings While market narratives often simplify complex situations, the upcoming Nvidia earnings report requires a nuanced view. The immediate reaction will likely be tied to guidance related to US chip export controls and overall revenue figures. However, for those looking at Nvidia’s long-term potential and the broader trend of Enterprise AI demand , the details surrounding the delivery and adoption of cutting-edge Nvidia AI hardware like the GB200 NVL72 are arguably more telling. As Cook puts it, if deliveries are expected to be steady to exceptional, it suggests strong underlying momentum for the rest of the year, potentially overshadowing quarterly revenue fluctuations. In conclusion, while export restrictions create noise, the true signal for Nvidia’s future, and a key indicator of the pace of enterprise AI adoption, lies in the performance of its newest, most powerful systems like the GB200 NVL72. This is the data point that could truly shape perceptions of Nvidia’s resilience and growth potential in the coming years.

GME price spiked 15% post-delisting despite earlier dip during low-volume trading. The delisting aligns with Bybit’s broader removal of low-cap tokens amid stricter compliance reviews. Bybit officially delisted the GME/USDT perpetual contract on March 25, 2025, at 9:00 AM UTC. The exchange confirmed that all trading, open orders, and bot activity tied to the contract were disabled. Positions were auto-closed using the 30-minute average index price before delisting. Bybit’s move impacted users involved in trading GME derivatives. Traders saw their positions forcibly closed, with no option to manage exposure or adjust stop-loss levels ahead of time. Immediate Aftermath: Sudden GME Price Spike Despite the delisting, the GME token saw a surprising 15% jump within hours. Before delisting, GME traded near $0.0026. It then surged to a peak above $0.0033, according to CoinMarketCap data, before settling at $0.0030.

At the core of any company’s financial health lies the general ledger system. This crucial software acts as the central repository for all financial transactions, providing the essential data required for accurate financial reporting. Why is the General Ledger So Important? Think of the general ledger as the operational heart of a company’s finance function. It’s where every debit and credit is recorded, categorized, and summarized. Without a robust and accurate general ledger, generating essential financial statements like the balance sheet and income statement becomes challenging, if not impossible. For a long time, venture capitalists were hesitant to invest in startups building new general ledger software. Why? Because convincing companies to switch from their existing systems is difficult. As Julien Bek, a partner at Sequoia Capital, put it, asking a company to replace its general ledger is like performing “open-heart surgery.” Building a new general ledger business from scratch is also a complex undertaking. How Rillet Changes the Game with AI Accounting Julien Bek’s perspective shifted when he encountered Rillet. This three-year-old company is leveraging machine learning and generative AI to transform the automation of accounting reports. Rillet doesn’t aim to just tweak existing processes; it aims to streamline them fundamentally. Here’s how Rillet’s AI accounting solution works: It directly pulls data from various sources like banks and platforms (Salesforce, Stripe, Ramp, Brex, Rippling). It uses machine learning and AI to process and analyze this data. It automatically generates core financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements. Nicolas Kopp, Rillet’s founder, notes that this approach allows accounting and finance teams at medium-sized companies to complete their monthly or quarterly book closures in mere hours, a process that traditionally took weeks. This dramatic speed improvement is a direct result of their advanced AI automation . Securing Significant Fintech Funding Rillet recently announced a significant step in its growth journey, raising a $25 million Series A funding round. This round was led by Sequoia Capital, with participation from existing investors. This fresh capital comes just 10 months after the company secured a $13.5 million seed and pre-seed round from investors like First Round Capital, Creandum, and Susa Ventures. This substantial Fintech funding underscores investor confidence in Rillet’s technology and market approach. Replacing Legacy General Ledger Systems A key factor driving Rillet’s success and investor interest is its ability to effectively replace legacy general ledger systems. Nicolas Kopp previously served as U.S. CEO of European neobank N26, bringing valuable experience in the financial technology sector. Since launching its product last year, Rillet has seen its revenue grow five-fold and acquired nearly 200 customers. Notable customers include fast-growing tech companies like Windsurf (reportedly sold to OpenAI) and Decagon (an AI customer support startup). Companies of this size would historically have likely relied on older software like NetSuite, a system developed in the late 1990s that remains prevalent among mid-sized businesses despite being perceived as slow and clunky. According to Sequoia’s Julien Bek, a significant portion of Rillet’s new deals come from companies actively replacing NetSuite or similar legacy systems. This capability to win over larger customers previously anchored to older platforms was a critical data point that helped Sequoia decide to invest. Accounting Automation Made Easier One of the biggest hurdles in switching general ledger software is the migration process. Transferring years of financial data can take months, creating significant disruption. Rillet’s AI-driven approach simplifies this, reducing the data transfer time to about four to six weeks. Clients can continue using their old platform until they are confident all data has been successfully moved to Rillet. This streamlined process makes accounting automation transitions far less daunting. Rillet currently competes with legacy platforms like NetSuite but appears to have a competitive edge by leveraging AI and machine learning specifically for mid-size companies. While other AI accounting startups exist, like Digits, they currently target different market segments, such as small businesses using QuickBooks and Xero. Summary: The Future of Finance Operations Rillet’s successful funding round highlights the increasing importance of AI and machine learning in automating core business functions like accounting. By tackling the complex challenge of the general ledger, Rillet offers a faster, more efficient alternative to traditional systems. Their rapid growth and ability to attract significant investment and customers like Windsurf and Decagon demonstrate a clear market need for advanced AI accounting solutions. As businesses continue to scale rapidly, especially in dynamic sectors like Fintech and AI, solutions that automate and accelerate financial closing processes will become indispensable.

While the crypto space explores decentralized innovation, traditional software is also undergoing a significant transformation driven by AI. A prime example is Context AI , a startup making waves in the productivity sector. This week, Context announced a substantial funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in its vision for a new kind of AI office suite . Context AI Lands Significant Startup Funding Context, the company developing this AI-powered office suite, officially announced on Wednesday that it successfully closed an $11 million seed funding round. This significant injection of capital was led by Lux Capital, a prominent venture capital firm known for investing in frontier technologies. Additional participation came from notable investors including Qualcomm Ventures and General Catalyst. This latest round brings Context’s total funding raised to approximately $15.75 million. The seed round values the young company at $70 million, a notable valuation for a startup at this stage, highlighting the perceived potential of their AI office suite concept. Why Build a New AI Office Suite? The founder, Joseph Semrai, a Thiel Fellow, began working on Context in 2024. His motivation stemmed from a clear observation: existing digital office suites, while widely used, weren’t originally built with the capabilities of modern AI models in mind. Semrai noted in an interview that we currently use a collection of separate applications not necessarily designed to leverage the full power of AI. The core idea behind Context is to take advantage of large AI context windows and the ability of models to work across multiple applications simultaneously. This approach aims to achieve better results than using disparate tools individually. The goal is to create a unified environment where AI is not just an add-on feature but a fundamental part of the workflow. How Context AI Differs from Existing AI Productivity Tools Over the past few years, many productivity and browsing applications have adopted chat-based interfaces, inspired by the success of AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Major players like Google and Microsoft have integrated AI features into their suites. Creative tools like Canva are expanding into general office work with AI, and Notion is building enterprise features like AI search. Many of these existing tools offer connectors to third-party applications, enabling users to pull in data. However, Semrai points out that while data retrieval is becoming easier, the ability to *analyze* and *reason* over that data effectively isn’t always robust in current tools. This is where Context AI aims to differentiate itself. It is specifically designed to make it easier for users to understand the data they gather from various sources and make informed decisions based on that analysis. Key Features of the Context AI Platform Context features a simple, clean interface centered around a chat box. Users interact with the AI tool primarily through conversation. Here are some of its core capabilities: Research: Ask the AI to perform research using your own documents, connected applications, and web knowledge. Content Generation: Convert research findings and data into documents, spreadsheets, or presentations. Iterative Workflow: Continue interacting with the AI to refine and generate different versions or artifacts based on the initial output. Python Interpreter: Includes a built-in Python interpreter, allowing users to run code for more complex data manipulation or analysis directly within the suite. Context isn’t necessarily trying to replace comprehensive suites like Microsoft 365 entirely. Instead, it targets a specific market need for AI-native data analysis and content creation workflows that existing tools don’t fully address. Availability and Pricing for Context AI Context is designed to be a powerful tool for workers, similar to how specialized tools like Cursor have become valuable for programmers. The company is also working on features like an offline mode for its desktop app, which would enable simple analysis and document drafting using existing local data and documents, a capability not common among many AI-powered data analysis products. Interested users can explore Context AI through a free tier. This provides 50 credits, one workspace, and support for up to 10 team members. For more extensive use, a paid plan is available at $20 per month. This subscription offers 2,000 credits and removes limits on the number of workspaces and team members. The Road Ahead for Context AI and AI Productivity Tools The substantial startup funding secured by Context underscores the high level of interest and investment flowing into the AI productivity space. With Lux Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, and General Catalyst backing their vision, Context is well-positioned to develop its platform further and challenge existing paradigms in office software. Their focus on AI-native analysis and cross-application reasoning could potentially redefine how we interact with our data and create content in the future.

Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altseason-loading-analyst-explains-how-ftx-5b-distribution-may-trigger-the-next-bull-leg/,"As Bitcoin and Ethereum hover near critical resistance levels, market sentiment is shifting rapidly. Analysts are now calling for an incoming Altseason, with bullish momentum building across the board, even as macroeconomic uncertainty continues to rattle global markets. Despite rising treasury yields and geopolitical tensions, crypto assets are showing strength, and altcoins appear poised to benefit next. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Top analyst Axel Bitblaze has spotlighted May 30th as a potentially defining moment in this cycle. This week, over $5 billion in stablecoins will be distributed to FTX creditors—a massive injection of liquidity representing nearly 2% of the entire stablecoin supply. Unlike previous events, this capital is expected to stay within the crypto ecosystem. Most of these investors remained in crypto despite the FTX collapse. Now, as they regain access to their funds, many are likely to rotate that capital back into the market. With Bitcoin targeting $120K and Ethereum challenging the $3,000 level, the stage is set for capital to flow into high-beta altcoins and push for an Altseason. Altcoins Setup Strengthens Ahead Of $5B FTX Liquidity Injection The FTX collapse in late 2022 was a brutal event, marking the climax of the previous bear market. It triggered mass panic, billions in liquidations, and the final capitulation that ultimately set the bottom of the cycle. While devastating in the short term, it paved the way for recovery. Now, nearly two years later, May 30th may become the most important day of this new phase. FTX is distributing over $5 billion in stablecoins to creditors this week—a long-awaited step in the bankruptcy process. These payouts represent nearly 2% of the total stablecoin supply and will hit the market in one large wave. But this isn’t just idle money returning to passive holders. Most of these users remained in crypto through the storm. They didn’t leave—they adapted, held, and now, they’re getting liquidity back in the middle of a bullish setup. The timing couldn’t be better. Ethereum is pumping, flirting with a critical resistance level that, if broken, could confirm a major move for altcoins. Bitcoin is hovering near its all-time highs, altcoins are gaining serious traction, pro-crypto narratives are heating up in Washington, and regulatory progress is finally in motion. Everything is aligning at once. Bitblaze explains that this $5B return of capital could be the exact catalyst the market needs. In his view, this sudden injection of liquidity could send Bitcoin toward $120K—and unlock the altseason traders have been waiting for. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? Ethereum Eyes $2,700 Breakout As Altseason Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,638, consolidating just below a key resistance zone at $2,700. After a sharp rally in early May, ETH has held its gains and formed a solid base above the 34 EMA ($2,331) and key moving averages. The 200-day SMA, sitting at $2,697, now acts as a critical ceiling for price action. A clean breakout above this level would mark the first major reclaim of the long-term trend line since the bull cycle resumed, potentially unlocking a powerful continuation for ETH and the broader altcoin market. Volume has remained steady throughout this consolidation phase, indicating buyer interest and positioning ahead of a decisive move. ETH’s structure shows higher lows and strong bullish follow-through, suggesting that momentum is building just beneath the surface. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? If Ethereum can close above $2,700 with conviction, it would not only confirm a breakout but could also trigger broader market rotation into altcoins. Historically, ETH breaking above major resistance levels has been a strong leading indicator for altseason. With Bitcoin hovering near ATHs and macro conditions favoring digital assets, ETH’s next move could be the spark that ignites a new wave of altcoin rallies across the board.

Meanwhile, Jupiter is inching closer to a possible bullish breakout. This piece delves into whether these cryptocurrencies are poised for a change in direction, creating a buzz among investors looking for growth opportunities. Explore the upcoming trends and what could trigger these movements. Solana's Price Dynamics: A Month of Recovery After Long-Term Declines Solana saw an 18.09% price increase over the last month, showing signs of renewed market interest. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a 26.46% decline, reflecting a sustained downward trend. The recent monthly bounce indicates a possible short-term turnaround against the backdrop of a longer period of weakness. SOL is currently trading between approximately $110 and $171, with nearby resistance at $195 and firm support around $72. Recent weekly gains of 3.71% suggest some bullish movement, though bears may still exert influence. Traders might consider entering near support levels and looking for profit opportunities as the price approaches resistance. Jupiter's 1-Month Surge Amidst a 6-Month Decline Jupiter experienced a significant 33.11% jump over the past month, despite a sharp decline of 45.43% over the last six months. Recent price action shows contrasting trends, with the short-term strength highlighting its ability to recover while still facing long-term bearish pressure. The coin's history has been marked by volatility, where rapid gains often followed by equally significant losses create uncertainty in its movement. Current prices fluctuate between $0.34 and $0.55, with resistance positioned at $0.63 and support around $0.22. The RSI reading at 64.78 indicates a slight bullish momentum, yet the overall trend remains unclear. Traders may look to engage at resistance near $0.63 while monitoring the support level at $0.22 for potential trading opportunities. Conclusion SOL is testing a key support level, and its future movement is crucial. It needs to hold this support to avoid a drop. In contrast, JUP is nearing a bullish breakout point. This suggests potential upward movement if the breakout happens. Both coins are at critical stages, with SOL needing to maintain support and JUP poised for possible gains.

Onchain data shared with Cointelegraph by the class group’s lawyer, Max Burwick, shows nearly $57 million worth of USDC ( USDC ) was frozen on May 28 after a Manhattan court agreed to a temporary freeze. “Yesterday, a federal court in SDNY [Southern District of New York] entered a Temporary Restraining Order at our request, Burwick Law, supported by Tim Treanor, freezing approximately 57.65 million USDC held at Circle,“ Burwick told Cointelegraph. He added that the court is scheduled to hold a hearing on June 9 to determine whether the assets will remain frozen as the class-action lawsuit progresses. Burwick is representing Omar Hurlock and other plaintiffs in a class-action suit against crypto venture firm Kelsier Ventures and its three sibling co-founders, Gideon, Thomas and Hayden Davis, on March 17, alleging they created the Libra (LIBRA) cryptocurrency and misled investors to siphon over $100 million from one-sided liquidity pools. The suit also named blockchain infrastructure companies, KIP Protocol and its CEO, Julian Peh, along with Meteora and its co-founder, Benjamin Chow, as defendants. Chow’s lawyer, Kelsier Ventures and KIP Protocol were contacted for comment. LIBRA reached a $4 billion market cap following an X post from Argentine President Javier Milei on Feb. 14 before crashing 94% hours later. The saga caused a political scandal for Milei, prompting members of Argentina’s opposition party to call for his impeachment, though little traction was gained beyond those statements. Data from polling platform Zuban Córdoba in March suggested that the Libra scandal negatively impacted Milei’s image and the national management approval rating. Two Solana wallets with total USDC balances worth $57.65 million were frozen on May 28 at 3:15 am and 3:18 am UTC. Data from Solana’s blockchain explorer, Solscan, shows that the address “3Fwr…ZQpK” had $44.59 million worth of the stablecoin frozen, while a little over $13 million was frozen from the wallet address “3nHw…xNgH.” Both wallets were frozen by the Multisig Freeze Authority, Solscan data shows. Milei closes Libra investigation in Argentina On May 19, Milei signed a decree to shut down a task force established to investigate the Libra scandal . Related: Solana may be a memecoin ‘one-trick pony’ — Standard Chartered No action was taken against Milei or any other Argentine official allegedly tied to the scandal. However, some critics say a legitimate investigation wasn’t properly conducted in the first place. “It was always a fake, they never dared to investigate anything at all, and they’re covering each other up because they’re completely up to their necks in it,” Itai Hagman, an economist and member of the Chamber of Deputies of Argentina, said in a May 20 X post.

Coinbase, a leading name in the crypto industry, has just rolled out a significant new offering designed specifically for developers and businesses looking to integrate crypto functionality into their applications. This isn’t just another user-facing wallet; it’s a powerful piece of Web3 infrastructure aimed at simplifying one of the most complex aspects of decentralized application development: wallet management. Dubbed ‘CDP Wallets’ (though more broadly referred to as Coinbase Developer Wallets ), this new service provides a robust, API-driven infrastructure. Think of it as a backend service that allows developers to programmatically create and manage wallets for their users or applications without ever having to touch sensitive private keys or build complex wallet infrastructure from scratch. This is a potential game-changer for speeding up Web3 adoption and making it easier for traditional companies and startups alike to enter the space. What Makes Coinbase Developer Wallets Different? Traditionally, building an application that interacts with blockchain requires managing wallets. This involves handling private keys, ensuring their security, managing gas fees, tracking transactions, and dealing with various network complexities. It’s a significant burden that requires specialized expertise and introduces considerable security risks. Coinbase Developer Wallets aim to abstract away these complexities. Here’s a breakdown of the core concept: API-First Approach: Developers interact with the wallet infrastructure through a set of well-documented APIs. This means standard coding calls, not deep blockchain node management. Programmable Functionality: The wallets aren’t just passive storage. They are designed to be programmable, allowing developers to automate transactions, interact with smart contracts, and integrate wallet actions directly into their application logic. This is key for building dynamic Web3 experiences. Abstracted Key Management: Perhaps the most significant feature is that developers do not directly handle or store the private keys for the wallets they create using this service. Coinbase manages the underlying key infrastructure securely, reducing the developer’s security surface area and compliance burden. Scalability: Built on Coinbase’s existing robust infrastructure, the service is designed to scale with the needs of growing applications. Why Are Programmable Wallets a Game-Changer for Developers? The ability to have Programmable Wallets opens up a world of possibilities that were previously difficult or risky to implement. For many applications, you don’t just need a place to hold assets; you need wallets that can *do* things automatically based on application logic. Consider these scenarios: Gaming: Automatically distributing in-game rewards (tokens or NFTs) to player wallets based on achievements. Marketplaces: Facilitating escrow services or automated payments between buyers and sellers upon fulfillment conditions. DeFi Protocols: Allowing applications to execute complex DeFi strategies on behalf of users (with their permission) without requiring constant manual interaction. Loyalty Programs: Issuing tokenized loyalty points or rewards to customers seamlessly as part of their purchase or interaction history. Before programmable infrastructure like this, implementing such features often required developers to build complex backend systems for transaction signing and key management, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors and security breaches. Programmable Wallets shift the focus from infrastructure plumbing to building core application features. Leveraging the Crypto API for Seamless Integration The foundation of the Coinbase Developer Wallets offering is its Crypto API . APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the standard way software applications talk to each other. By providing a comprehensive API, Coinbase allows developers to integrate wallet creation, management, and transaction initiation into their existing backend systems using familiar programming paradigms. Instead of needing deep knowledge of blockchain nodes, transaction formats for various chains, gas estimation, and private key cryptography, developers can use simple API calls like: createWallet() sendTransaction(walletId, recipientAddress, amount, tokenType) getWalletBalance(walletId) listTransactions(walletId) signMessage(walletId, message) This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers who are new to Web3 but experienced in traditional software development. The Crypto API handles the underlying blockchain interactions, making the process much smoother and faster. Addressing Core Web3 Infrastructure Challenges Building reliable and scalable Web3 applications involves more than just writing smart contracts. The Web3 Infrastructure layer – including nodes, transaction relays, gas management, and data indexing – is notoriously complex and expensive to manage. Many companies struggle with the operational overhead and technical debt associated with maintaining this infrastructure. Coinbase Developer Wallets tackle several of these challenges head-on: Challenges Addressed by Coinbase Developer Wallets: Challenge How CDP Wallets Help Private Key Security Coinbase manages keys in secure environments, removing the burden from developers. Blockchain Node Management Developers interact via API, abstracting away the need to run or manage nodes. Transaction Reliability Infrastructure handles transaction broadcasting, retries, and monitoring. Multi-Chain Complexity A single API interface can potentially support multiple blockchain networks over time. Scalability Issues Leverages Coinbase’s scalable backend infrastructure. By providing a managed wallet service as part of its broader Web3 Infrastructure offerings (like Coinbase Cloud), Coinbase allows businesses to focus on their core product or service rather than becoming blockchain infrastructure experts. How Does This Ensure a Secure Wallet Environment? Security is paramount in the crypto space, and managing private keys is arguably the biggest security challenge. A single mistake can lead to the loss of all assets associated with a wallet. By offering a Secure Wallet solution where Coinbase handles the private key management, developers can significantly reduce their risk exposure. Coinbase has years of experience in securing digital assets at scale. They employ sophisticated security measures, including hardware security modules (HSMs), multi-party computation (MPC), strict access controls, and ongoing security audits. While developers still need to secure their own API keys and application backend, they are no longer responsible for the cryptographic keys that directly control the funds within the wallets created via the service. This model provides a different security profile compared to self-custodial solutions where the user holds their keys or developer-managed custodial solutions where the developer holds the keys. For many applications, especially those targeting mainstream users or businesses where ease of use and regulatory compliance are critical, a managed, Secure Wallet infrastructure like this offers a compelling trade-off. Benefits for Developers and Businesses Let’s summarize the key advantages of using Coinbase Developer Wallets : Accelerated Development: Get to market faster by using pre-built, reliable wallet infrastructure. Reduced Security Burden: Offload private key management to a specialized, secure provider. Lower Operational Costs: Avoid the expense and complexity of running and maintaining your own blockchain nodes and wallet systems. Enhanced Functionality: Easily integrate programmable wallet actions into your application logic via a simple Crypto API . Focus on Innovation: Free up your development team to build unique features and user experiences instead of infrastructure. Scalability: Rely on Coinbase’s battle-tested infrastructure to grow with your application. Potential Considerations and Challenges While the benefits are significant, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Centralization: Relying on Coinbase introduces a degree of centralization, which might be a philosophical concern for some in the Web3 space. Cost: While potentially cheaper than building from scratch, there will be costs associated with using the service (likely based on API calls, transactions, or number of wallets). Customization Limitations: A managed service might not offer the same level of granular control as a self-built solution. Vendor Lock-in: Migrating away from the service later could present challenges. Learning Curve: Developers still need to learn the specific Coinbase API and best practices for interacting with the service. Businesses and developers should carefully evaluate these points against their specific needs, technical capabilities, and risk tolerance. Examples of What You Can Build The possibilities are vast. Here are a few concrete examples where Coinbase Developer Wallets could be instrumental: Application Type How CDP Wallets Fit In Simplified Process NFT Marketplace Creating wallets for users upon signup, handling automated minting and transfer fees. No need to manage individual user private keys or run minting nodes. Web3 Gaming Platform Issuing in-game currency or item tokens, managing player balances, facilitating peer-to-peer trades. Automated token distribution and secure player asset management via API. Decentralized Social Media Allowing users to earn tokens for content, tipping creators, managing token-gated access. Easy token transfers and balance tracking integrated into the social platform. Supply Chain Solution Recording asset transfers or events on-chain, managing tokenized inventory. Programmable transactions triggered by real-world events, managed securely. These are just a few examples, highlighting how abstracting wallet infrastructure allows developers to focus on the unique value proposition of their application. Actionable Insights for Developers If you’re a developer or business looking to build in the Web3 space, here’s what you should consider: Explore the Documentation: Head over to the Coinbase Cloud documentation to understand the CDP Wallets features, supported chains, and API specifications in detail. Start Small: Consider integrating the service for a specific feature or a pilot project to evaluate its suitability for your needs. Assess Costs: Understand the pricing model to factor it into your project’s budget. Security Best Practices: While Coinbase handles key management, ensure your own application’s security, especially around API key management and user authentication. Evaluate Trade-offs: Weigh the benefits of speed and reduced complexity against the implications of using a centralized, managed service. This launch signifies a maturing of the Web3 ecosystem, where infrastructure providers are stepping up to offer services that make development more accessible and secure. Conclusion: A Step Towards Mass Adoption? The introduction of Coinbase Developer Wallets is a significant development. By offering a secure, programmable, and API-driven wallet infrastructure that removes the burden of private key management and complex node operations, Coinbase is directly addressing major pain points for developers and businesses building in Web3. This move has the potential to lower the barrier to entry, accelerate innovation, and pave the way for more sophisticated and user-friendly decentralized applications.

It’s not just about charts and volume anymore. It’s about what these coins are doing, on-chain activity, tech rollouts, partnerships, and how they’re handling tough market cycles. And let’s be honest, a lot of coins look shiny but don’t really offer value. That’s why we’ve put together this list, Unstaked, Filecoin, Litecoin, and Toncoin. Each of them brings something different to the table, from AI-powered community agents to real-world data storage solutions and strong technical patterns. If you want to spot coins that are pushing forward, not stalling, this is where to start. Let’s break down the top crypto coins to invest in right now and why they’re worth a serious look. This isn’t about jumping on bandwagons, it’s about staying ahead with projects that are actually building something that matters. 1. Unstaked – The AI Edge You Can Own Unstaked is changing the game by giving crypto real-world utility. At its core are autonomous AI agents that run 24/7 across platforms like X and Telegram. These agents engage with communities, manage support, post updates, and grow online presence, all without human labor. Every action they take is tracked on-chain, and users are rewarded in $UNSD based on actual engagement. At just $10–$25/month, these agents are way cheaper than hiring community managers and offer up to 100x in yearly cost savings. That’s real value, not just hype. The project is currently in Stage 15 of its presale with the token priced at $0.009831. So far, Unstaked has raised over $7.8 million and sold around 860 million tokens. With a projected launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are looking at a potential 27x ROI. Add to that a fair launch model (no private sales, no VC deals), and Unstaked becomes one of the most accessible and high-upside entries in 2025. You’ll need $UNSD to deploy, upgrade, and govern agents, which locks the token into the ecosystem’s daily use. Unstaked isn’t just promising, it’s already delivering. No question it’s one of the top crypto coins to invest in right now. 2. Filecoin – Real Utility with Web3 Storage Filecoin continues to stand out with actual usage in the decentralized storage sector. Trading between $2.80 and $2.85 this May, it’s holding ground while integrating with some of the biggest Web3 players. In May 2025, Filecoin launched its Avalanche bridge, letting smart contracts on Avalanche tap into Filecoin’s decentralized storage, adding verifiable, low-cost, and compliant-grade storage solutions. And they’ve just completed the “Teep” network upgrade, bringing faster finality, simplified economics for storage providers, and better tools for developers. It’s not just another update, it makes the protocol more usable, and that matters in this market. The Fil+ program is also seeing big moves, with a new Experimental Pathway Metaallocator system to speed up Datacap access and grow the ecosystem. Meanwhile, major AI companies like SingularityNET and GoKite AI are using Filecoin for transparent, decentralized storage. When AI and blockchain projects start stacking together, it’s a good sign. Considering its strong roadmap and current price stability, Filecoin should absolutely be on your radar if you’re looking at the top crypto coins to invest in with a long-term view. 3. Litecoin – The Veteran Still Holding Strong Litecoin might not be flashy, but it’s proving that solid fundamentals still count. Right now, LTC is trading around $96.47, up 1.57% in the last 24 hours, with technical analysts tracking a breakout above the $96 level. If it holds, there’s potential for a rally to $120 or even $128. Some long-term projections even suggest $200+ if Bitcoin starts climbing above $150K later this year. Even with all the newer coins out there, Litecoin still pulls daily transaction numbers over 500,000. That’s not a stat you can ignore. Network usage is up, and adoption through BitPay and NOWPayments keeps growing across e-commerce. What’s even more interesting is the ETF proposal Canary Capital filed, though delayed by the SEC, it shows ongoing institutional interest. For investors who want a coin with consistent performance, low transaction fees, and strong liquidity, Litecoin is still a solid pick. It’s not trying to be something it’s not, it just keeps delivering. That’s why it deserves a spot on this list of top crypto coins to invest in, especially if you want a less volatile option that still performs. 4. Toncoin – Fast Network, Growing Ecosystem Toncoin (TON) has been moving fast both in development and adoption. At the end of May 2025, it’s priced around $2.96, after a slight 0.71% daily bump. While it’s down 6.57% over the past month and 53.88% from its all-time high of $8.27, there’s more going on here than the price shows. Daily transactions have exploded from 100,000 to 1.2 million. That’s a clear sign that the TON blockchain is picking up serious traction. Add to that the recent integration of Tether (USDT), the launch of TON DNS and TON Storage, and a cleaner ecosystem direction after shutting down its cross-chain bridge earlier in May, it’s clear this project is tightening its game. Technically, analysts are eyeing a symmetrical triangle pattern with a breakout potential above $3.20. If that happens, a move towards $5.00 could be in play. Market cap currently sits around $7.37 billion, just under Monero, after losing a bit of ground. Toncoin’s combination of speed, adoption, and new features puts it in a promising place among the top crypto coins to invest in if you’re looking for solid infrastructure and actual traction. Summing Up From decentralized AI agents to fast, secure payment systems and high-utility storage networks, these four options, Unstaked, Filecoin, Litecoin, and Toncoin, offer more than just speculation. They show where real development is happening and where real user activity is driving demand. Whether it’s the massive cost savings of Unstaked’s autonomous agents or the growing use of Filecoin in AI and cross-chain projects, these coins reflect the kind of momentum that can actually build returns. Litecoin continues to prove that reliability matters, and Toncoin is putting up network growth numbers that are hard to ignore. If you’re building your portfolio and want to focus on the top crypto coins to invest in, this list is a strong place to start, rooted in performance, not promises.

Paxos Gold (PAXG), a prominent gold-backed digital asset, is now fully accessible on Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This opens up new avenues for crypto trading NY residents interested in diversifying their portfolios with exposure to gold, but within the familiar crypto ecosystem. What is Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Why is it on Coinbase New York? Before diving into the implications for New Yorkers, let’s understand what Paxos Gold is. PAXG is an ERC-20 token issued by Paxos, a regulated financial institution. What makes it unique is that each PAXG token is backed by one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold stored in secure vaults. This means that owning PAXG is equivalent to having direct ownership rights to physical gold, but with the liquidity, divisibility, and transferability of a digital asset. The availability of Paxos Gold on Coinbase, specifically for users in New York, is a notable event. New York has one of the most stringent regulatory environments for cryptocurrencies in the United States, governed by the BitLicense framework. For an asset like PAXG to be listed and made available to NY residents on a regulated platform like Coinbase, it signifies that it has met the necessary compliance standards. This provides a layer of assurance for users in the state. Coinbase announced this expansion via their official channels, confirming that NY residents can now buy, sell, and trade PAXG seamlessly through their Coinbase.com website and the Coinbase mobile applications on both iOS and Android devices. This integration simplifies the process for New Yorkers looking to access a gold backed crypto asset. The Appeal of Tokenized Gold: More Than Just a Digital Asset The concept of tokenized gold bridges the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Gold has historically been seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. However, owning physical gold can come with challenges like storage costs, insurance, and difficulty in fractionalizing or transferring small amounts. Paxos Gold addresses these issues by providing: Accessibility: Easy to buy and sell on digital exchanges like Coinbase, 24/7. Divisibility: You can own fractions of an ounce of gold, making it accessible for smaller investors. Liquidity: Traded on various exchanges, offering easier entry and exit compared to physical gold. Lower Costs: Avoids the high premiums, storage fees, and assay costs often associated with physical gold. Transparency: Paxos provides regular attestations verifying that the amount of PAXG tokens in circulation matches the amount of gold held in reserve. Token holders can even look up the serial number of the physical gold bar their token represents. For New York residents, having access to this form of tokenized gold on a trusted platform like Coinbase means they can now easily add gold exposure to their digital asset portfolio without dealing with the complexities of physical ownership or the limitations of traditional market hours for gold ETFs. Why is Availability in New York a Big Deal for Crypto Trading NY? New York is a major financial hub with a large population of investors. The state’s regulatory approach has often meant that certain crypto assets or services are not immediately available there compared to other states. When a compliant, regulated asset like Paxos Gold gets the green light for Coinbase New York users, it signals several positive things: Increased Access: Opens up a significant market for PAXG and provides NY residents with more investment options within the regulated crypto space. Regulatory Confidence: The fact that PAXG is approved for trading under New York’s BitLicense framework adds credibility and potentially attracts more institutional interest over time. Platform Strength: Reinforces Coinbase’s position as a platform committed to regulatory compliance, which is crucial for operating in New York. For those involved in crypto trading NY , this development is not just about a new asset; it’s about the continued maturation and acceptance of digital assets within stringent regulatory frameworks. It offers a regulated path for traditional investors in New York to get exposure to gold through a digital medium they might be increasingly comfortable with. How Does Paxos Gold Compare to Other Assets? Understanding where Paxos Gold fits in requires comparing it to related asset classes. Here’s a brief look: Feature Paxos Gold (PAXG) Physical Gold Gold ETFs (e.g., GLD) Bitcoin (BTC) Ownership Form Digital Token (direct ownership rights to physical gold) Physical Asset Shares in a trust holding gold Digital Asset (decentralized) Storage/Custody Secure Vaults (managed by Paxos), private wallet custody for token Self-storage (safe, vault) or third-party vault service Managed by ETF provider Self-custody (wallet) or exchange custody Divisibility Highly divisible (fractions of an ounce) Less divisible (requires cutting bars/coins) Divisible (shares) Highly divisible Trading Hours 24/7 (on crypto exchanges) Limited (dealers, markets) Market hours 24/7 Transaction Costs Exchange fees, small on-chain fees Premiums, assay fees, potential storage/insurance Brokerage fees, expense ratio Exchange fees, network fees (can vary) Regulatory Status (NY) Approved on regulated platforms (like Coinbase) Established market Established market Approved on regulated platforms (like Coinbase) As you can see, Paxos Gold offers a unique blend of the benefits of physical gold ownership with the advantages of digital assets, making it an interesting option for Coinbase New York users looking for a gold backed crypto .

45224190,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=736780,1748480614,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45224190.jpeg,Federal court weighs first legal challenge to Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/court-slams-trumps-power-to-impose-tariffs/,"A federal court has invalidated the sweeping global tariffs imposed by President Donald J. Trump. According to the Court of International Trade ruling, an emergency law invoked by the White House does not provide unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The ruling offers a major check on executive power and could have long-lasting implications for the US trade policy. The Manhattan-based court said the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. This is not superseded by the president’s remit to safeguard the economy. The lawsuit, filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties, was the first major legal challenge to Trump’s tariffs. According to the firms, the tariffs will hurt their business. Federal court weighs first legal challenge to Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs The lawsuit is one of seven court challenges to Trump’s tariff policies, along with challenges from 13 U.S. states and other groups of small businesses. The hearing at the Court of International Trade in Manhattan marks the first time a federal court has addressed the legality of President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. Earlier this month, Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer from the conservative Liberty Justice Center representing the plaintiffs, argued that the case is straightforward. He stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — a 1977 law granting the president authority to regulate commerce during national emergencies — does not empower Trump to impose tariffs unilaterally. Schwab further contended that Trump’s declared emergency, based on trade deficits, fails to meet the legal criteria of an emergency, which must be brief, rare, and not ongoing. He then noted that the case is so far outside what constitutes an emergency or an unusual and extraordinary threat that this Court can easily rule it is not an emergency. When the three-judge panel — appointed by Presidents Obama, Trump, and Reagan — asked for guidance on the legal standards to apply in their decision earlier this month, Schwab urged them not to overcomplicate matters. “I’m asking this court to be an umpire and call a strike. You’re asking me, where’s the strike zone? Is it at the knees or just below? I say it’s a wild pitch, far off the plate, hitting the backstop — no debate needed.” The lawsuit was filed in April by a group of small businesses — including a New York liquor distributor, a Utah pipe company, a Virginia electronics store, a Pennsylvania tackle shop, and a Vermont cycling company. These businesses rely heavily on imports from countries such as China and Mexico and argued that Trump’s tariffs represent an unprecedented power grab that would cause irreparable harm . They maintained that the IEEPA does not grant the president the authority to impose tariffs like those announced, which included a broad tariff rate plus higher rates on certain countries. They described the national emergency Trump cited as “a figment of his own imagination,” pointing out that the US has run massive trade deficits for years without suffering economic damage. “If such power were granted by statute, it would represent an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch without any clear limit on discretion,” the plaintiffs argued. At the beginning of May, Department of Justice lawyers countered, asserting that Congress does allow the president to impose some tariffs and that Trump’s invocation of a national emergency expands that authority, justifying the broad tariffs. They warned that a court order blocking the tariffs would unlawfully interfere with the president’s constitutional and statutory authority. “Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction would be an enormous intrusion on the President’s conduct of foreign affairs and efforts to protect national security under IEEPA and the Constitution,” the DOJ stated. States and businesses take Trump’s tariffs to court in landmark trade dispute At least six separate lawsuits have challenged Trump’s tariffs, including one filed by California and a coalition of twelve state attorneys general. While many were initially filed in district courts they were gradually transferred to the Court of International Trade. In April, the court rejected an emergency request for a temporary order to block the tariffs, finding that the businesses failed to prove that “immediate and irreparable harm” would stem from the tariffs. A three-judge panel conducted the hearing: Gary S. Katzmann, Timothy M. Reif, and Jane A. Restani — appointed by Presidents Obama, Trump, and Reagan, respectively. Located in a corner of New York’s Foley Square, the Court of International Trade has nationwide jurisdiction over trade disputes. It typically handles niche issues, such as honey customs and mattress imports. Tuesday’s oral argument promises to be the court’s most high-profile hearing in recent memory.

However, recent comments from agriculture minister Shinjiro Koizumi have drawn criticism regarding prices, preferential selling, and direct state intervention in the market. With state-imposed production limits for farmers, a devastated yen and rampant inflation, Japan’s rice market is still in the throes of what local media is calling the “ Reiwa Rice Strife .” On Monday, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ended the previous bidding system for selling stockpiled state rice, and introduced “discretionary contracts.”Stockpiled rice has been released by the state in recent times in order to combat shortage and skyrocketing prices, with the price of the staple grain doubling in only a year for consumers. Koizumi to release older rice to small businesses, rural areas Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said at a House of Representatives committee meeting Wednesday: “We want to continue making efforts to distribute stockpiled rice as widely as possible in the region,” intending to focus on smaller businesses after ending sales to large buyers on Tuesday. Terraced rice fields in Japan. Photo: DeltaWorks . Of the 300,000 tons up for sale via the new discretionary contracts scheme, much of the newer grain (from 2022) was quickly gobbled up instantly by giant corporations such as AEON and Pan Pacific International Holdings (PPIH).One local supermarket manager, Tatsuhito Tanaka, was quoted by regional media about the scheme, saying: “I really hope they’ll share the rice with us so that it’s not just the big companies.”As per regional reports , the remaining 100,000 tons of older (2021) stockpiled rice is set to be contracted out to smaller enterprises over the next few months. The focus will onstensibly be on supporting rural areas. Farmers say the government is the real reason for the shortage As Cryptopolitan reported previously, there is much debate over why a shortage of Japan’s prize grain even occurred in the first place. Mass media has been blaming the weather and myriad other factors, but full-time Japanese farmers are directly blaming the government and special interests for subsidizing limits on acreage, engaging in backroom deals, and essentially rigging prices and contracts. As nippon.com reported last year :“Currently, 40% of paddy fields are not in use, meaning that production is limited to around 6.5 million tons. If Japan stopped this policy of reduced production, and instead exported 4 million tons, it could handle the kind of situation seen this year through a small decrease in the amount exported and no domestic shortages.” JPY to USD historical data. Source: Trading Economics . Koizumi’s stance has drawn fire from the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, with party member Kaori Ishikawa noting Wednesday that it is not the state’s place to be involved in rice prices. Koizumi responded that this was only an “emergency measure.” State intervention thus far has not lowered the still-rising prices .From the stance of many, corporate giants are getting preferential treatment, with local supermarkets left to crunch on the remaining, oldest grain almost as an afterthought. Much like the small-scale farmers unable to produce due to Japan Agriculture Cooperatives’ powerful connections to Tokyo subsidies and restrictions.At the time of writing, the USD is flexing against JPY again, with an exchange rate of 145.81 JPY/1 USD.

To achieve this success, it has collaborated with Nvidia Corp. to create an AI data center in Vietnam and Japan, extending into semiconductor chip design. The tech company is Vietnam’s seventh-largest publicly traded company , boasting a market value of $6.8 billion. The company employs over 80,000 people and operates in 30 different countries. Internationally, FPT counts 130 Fortune Global 500 companies, like Airbus SE, Halliburton Co., and Ford Motor Co., as clients. It has moved the nation beyond building Nike Inc. shoes and Apple Inc. devices, marking a significant milestone in the country. Binh moves Vietnam from a low-cost economic center to a giant tech center Truong Gia Binh established FPT, a technology company, four decades ago with a single computer in a room. The computer was borrowed from his then-father-in-law, General Vo Nguyen Giap, who won the admiration of generations of Vietnamese for leading the Vietnam People’s Army to victory over the French and US armies. Binh’s life follows the story of the victorious North Vietnamese forces. In 1954, his family moved to Hanoi with revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh to support the fight for independence, according to the FPT chairman. They were very poor, so Binh wore clothes passed down from his sisters and witnessed US bombers dropping explosives on the city. Binh, now 69 and has met Ho Chi Minh twice, revealed that a shortage of almost everything marked his childhood. Despite his challenges, he wanted to create a top-tier technology sector in Vietnam. The tech giant has been Vietnam’s way to move beyond being a low-cost economic center, explained Lam Nguyen, managing director of IDC Indochina. The Communist government views FPT as a model for helping the country shift from its traditional manufacturing roots to industries focused on areas like AI products, which Bain & Co. predicts could be worth $990 billion globally by 2027. During an interview, Binh stated that they were working day and night to take the company to greater heights. He speculates that the company can achieve an annual revenue growth rate of about 20% in the long run. Binh owns almost 7% of FPT Corp., with the government owning 5.71%. FPT faces significant obstacles in its run to become the leading tech company FPT is preparing for global economic turbulence and can fine-tune its business plan for the tough 20% revenue increase this year on risks. DNSE Securities said this in a statement on its website, citing FPT Chief Executive Officer Nguyen Van Khoa at the company’s April shareholders’ meeting. The brokerage said FPT is lowering costs by 30% without harming the core business, citing Khoa. Still, significant obstacles lie ahead for FPT as it tries to compete with more established tech firms from India and Malaysia. The tech giant also needs to deal with a new wave of tariffs set by President Donald Trump. Although FPT is not directly affected by new US tariffs , the company noted that it might face indirect impacts because many of its global customers are influenced by these tariffs. It may also have to face the country’s ever-attentive police. When pressed on reports about the Ministry of Public Security, which has been strengthening internet regulations in recent years, wanting to hold a majority stake in the company’s internet unit, FPT Telecom, said it has “no further details about it.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Tech|Vietnam,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-29 01:08:02

Humanity Protocol , the innovative project focused on preventing deep-fake issues using AI and blockchain technology, has just announced a significant move that’s set to energize a key part of the ecosystem. They are allocating a substantial sum – $2.2 million worth of their native H tokens – directly into the KaitoAI ecosystem. Understanding the Humanity Protocol Before diving into the specifics of the token allocation , let’s quickly touch upon what Humanity Protocol is all about. In an age where digital identity is increasingly crucial and simultaneously under threat from sophisticated AI-driven deep fakes, Humanity Protocol aims to provide a robust, decentralized identity solution. Leveraging a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, their goal is to create a verifiable and secure digital identity layer that can resist manipulation and fraud. Think of it as building a trustworthy foundation for online interactions in the future. Exploring the KaitoAI Ecosystem So, why is the KaitoAI ecosystem the recipient of this generous allocation? KaitoAI positions itself as a leading AI-powered search and intelligence platform specifically tailored for the world of Web3. It helps users navigate the vast and often complex landscape of decentralized applications, protocols, and communities. By providing sophisticated tools for research, analysis, and discovery, KaitoAI plays a vital role in making Web3 more accessible and understandable for both newcomers and seasoned participants. It’s a hub for information and discussion within the decentralized sphere. The $2.2M Token Allocation Explained The core of this announcement is the significant financial commitment being made. Humanity Protocol is allocating $2.2 million USD worth of their H tokens to KaitoAI. This isn’t just a simple transfer; it’s a strategic investment aimed at fostering growth and activity within the KaitoAI platform. The value is tied to the H token, signifying confidence in Humanity Protocol’s own ecosystem while simultaneously injecting valuable resources into a complementary project. This kind of cross-ecosystem support is a hallmark of a healthy, interconnected Web3 environment. Boosting the Web3 Community Through Engagement The primary purpose behind this substantial token allocation is to significantly boost Web3 community engagement and discussions. Community is the lifeblood of decentralized projects, and incentivizing participation is a proven method for fostering vibrant and active ecosystems. Humanity Protocol explicitly stated that these tokens are earmarked for distribution among two key groups: KAITO Stakers: Individuals who are staking their KAITO tokens, likely contributing to the security or functionality of the KaitoAI platform, will be rewarded. This directly incentivizes long-term commitment to KaitoAI. Humanity Yappers: While the exact nature of ‘Humanity Yappers’ isn’t detailed in the original snippet, it strongly suggests active community members or contributors within the Humanity Protocol ecosystem itself. Rewarding them via the KaitoAI platform could encourage cross-pollination and broader participation. By directing funds towards these engaged user bases, the allocation aims to stimulate more discussion, content creation, and overall activity focused on Web3 topics within the KaitoAI environment. Synergies: AI, Blockchain, and Community Growth This collaboration highlights a powerful synergy between different facets of the modern digital landscape: AI Blockchain technology and dedicated community building. Humanity Protocol leverages AI for its core function (deep-fake prevention) and blockchain for its infrastructure (decentralized identity). KaitoAI uses AI to navigate the blockchain/Web3 world. The intersection lies in using resources generated by an AI/Blockchain project (Humanity Protocol’s H tokens) to fuel an AI-powered platform (KaitoAI) that serves the broader Web3 community built on blockchain principles. This strategic move underscores the growing interconnectedness of these technologies and the recognition that robust community interaction is essential for the long-term success and adoption of complex Web3 and AI Blockchain initiatives. It’s an investment not just in a platform, but in the people who use and contribute to the decentralized web. What This Means for Users For members of the KaitoAI and Humanity Protocol communities, this allocation presents tangible benefits. If you are currently staking KAITO tokens, you can anticipate receiving a portion of the H token distribution. If you are an active participant or ‘Yapper’ in the Humanity Protocol community, engaging on platforms like X (where the announcement was made), you may also be eligible for rewards distributed through the KaitoAI ecosystem. This is a direct incentive to stay engaged and contribute to the growth and discussion within these projects. Conclusion: A Strategic Investment in Web3’s Future The decision by Humanity Protocol to allocate $2.2 million worth of H tokens to the KaitoAI ecosystem is a significant development. It represents a clear commitment to fostering a vibrant Web3 community by directly incentivizing participation among KAITO stakers and Humanity Yappers . This strategic token allocation leverages the strengths of both an innovative AI Blockchain project and a key Web3 intelligence platform to drive engagement and discussion, ultimately contributing to the health and growth of the decentralized web.

Taking the stage in front of a packed room of Bitcoin enthusiasts, developers, and investors, Vance delivered a powerful message, hinting that the United States government is ready to embrace Bitcoin’s role in shaping the country’s economic and technological future. “We want to start to put in motion the strategic importance of Bitcoin for the United States government,” Vance declared, drawing loud applause from the audience. “We know the People’s Republic of China doesn’t like Bitcoin — and that should make us ask: why? If our biggest adversary is trying to push away from it, maybe that’s a sign we should move towards it.” Bitcoin & National Security: A New Era Vance said that this isn’t just a one-way conversation between government officials and the public. He called for ongoing dialogue between policymakers and the crypto community to help shape smart, forward-thinking Bitcoin policies that will safeguard America’s future prosperity. “None of us want to wake up ten years from now in a country that’s less wealthy and prosperous because we made bad decisions today,” Vance cautioned. “We’re going to make the right decisions — but that depends on you guys being part of the conversation.” Bitcoin, AI, and the Political Divide In a candid moment, Vance also touched on an interesting trend he’s observed in tech circles — how different technologies seem to attract different political leanings. “Very smart right-wing people in tech seem to be drawn to Bitcoin and crypto, while very smart left-leaning folks gravitate toward artificial intelligence,” he remarked. While acknowledging this was a generalization, he stressed the importance of keeping Bitcoin and AI conversations connected. “What happens in AI will very much affect Bitcoin — and what happens to Bitcoin will affect AI. We need to ensure that Bitcoin is part of the AI conversation,” he added. Why It Matters Vance’s speech marks a turning point in how US leadership views Bitcoin — not just as an investment, but as a tool of strategic value in global geopolitics and economic security.

Vance didn’t mince words, offering a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and a clear stance on the future of crypto policy in the United States. Why Does JD Vance See Crypto as a “Ground-Up Innovation”? Speaking before a crowd of crypto enthusiasts and industry leaders, JD Vance characterized cryptocurrency, and particularly Bitcoin , as a genuine “ground-up innovation.” This framing is significant as it positions digital assets not as a fringe financial tool or a speculative bubble, but as a fundamental technological advancement driven by individuals and market forces rather than top-down governmental mandates. His remarks at Bitcoin 2025 highlighted: Decentralized Nature: Emphasizing that the technology and adoption are growing organically from users and developers. Economic Empowerment: Suggesting it provides new avenues for financial participation outside traditional systems. Technological Progress: Recognizing the underlying blockchain technology as a significant leap forward. This perspective aligns with a view that sees crypto as an unstoppable force, one that policy should seek to understand and integrate rather than stifle. Vance’s embrace of this narrative signals a potential shift in how a future administration might approach the digital asset space, moving away from skepticism towards recognition of its innovative potential. Can We Really Expect 100 Million Bitcoin Holders Soon? Perhaps one of the most striking predictions from JD Vance was his forecast that 100 million people would soon own Bitcoin . While he didn’t provide a specific timeline or the data underpinning this prediction, it reflects a strong belief in the accelerating pace of global Bitcoin adoption. To put this number into perspective: Metric Current Estimate (Approx.) Vance’s Prediction Global Crypto Owners ~500-600 million N/A (Prediction specific to BTC) Global Bitcoin Holders ~200-300 million An additional 100 million soon % of World Population ~2.5% – 3.8% Potentially pushing towards 5% Reaching 100 million new holders would represent a substantial increase, suggesting Vance foresees a significant acceleration in mainstream adoption. This could be driven by various factors, including increased institutional interest, clearer regulatory frameworks (which he advocated for), growing awareness, and potentially macroeconomic conditions pushing people towards alternative assets like Bitcoin . Is Crypto the Ultimate Hedge Against Inflation and Government Overreach? A core tenet of Vance’s argument for Bitcoin and crypto is their perceived role as a hedge. He explicitly mentioned hedging against both inflation and government overreach. This is a common theme among crypto proponents: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often contrasted with fiat currencies, which can be subject to inflationary pressures through quantitative easing and government spending. The narrative is that as traditional currencies potentially lose purchasing power, scarce assets like Bitcoin can retain or increase value. Government Overreach: The decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin , means they operate outside the direct control of any single government or central authority. This offers a potential hedge against excessive financial surveillance, censorship, or control over personal assets. Vance’s articulation of these points resonates deeply within the crypto community, highlighting the philosophical underpinnings that attract many to the space beyond just investment potential. It frames crypto not just as an asset class, but as a tool for financial sovereignty and protection. Why the Criticism of Regulators Like Gary Gensler? The current regulatory landscape in the United States has been a major point of contention for the crypto industry. JD Vance echoed these frustrations by criticizing regulators, specifically mentioning Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The criticism typically centers on: Regulation by Enforcement: The SEC has been accused of using enforcement actions against crypto companies rather than providing clear rules of the road beforehand. Lack of Clarity: The industry has long called for clear guidelines on how digital assets should be classified and regulated, which many argue has not been adequately provided. Jurisdictional Disputes: Uncertainty exists regarding which regulatory body (SEC, CFTC, etc.) has primary oversight over different aspects of the crypto market. Vance’s critique suggests that the current regulatory approach is hindering innovation and creating uncertainty, rather than fostering responsible growth. His comments imply a desire for a more predictable and perhaps less aggressive regulatory environment for the crypto sector. What Does Pledging Trump Administration Support Mean for US Crypto Regulation? A significant part of JD Vance’s speech focused on the potential policy direction under a future Trump administration. He pledged support for the industry, indicating a potential pivot from the current administration’s approach. This pledge included a commitment to ending policies perceived as hostile to crypto, most notably Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . Understanding the potential impact requires looking at what “support” might entail: Clearer Legislation: Pushing for congressional action to create a defined legal framework for digital assets. Industry Dialogue: Engaging with crypto businesses and experts to understand their needs and concerns. Appointments: Appointing regulators who may be more favorable or knowledgeable about the crypto space. Ending Restrictive Policies: Actively dismantling initiatives seen as targeting the crypto industry indirectly. This kind of high-level political backing, if materialized, could significantly de-risk the U.S. market for crypto businesses and investors, potentially attracting more capital and talent to the country. Dismantling Operation Chokepoint 2.0: A Key Policy Promise One specific policy target mentioned by JD Vance was the promise to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . This term, coined by the crypto community, refers to a perceived coordinated effort by regulators and financial institutions to limit or cut off banking services to legitimate crypto businesses. While not an official government program name, the effects described are real: Crypto companies facing difficulty opening or maintaining bank accounts. Increased scrutiny and pressure on banks that service crypto clients. Delays or denials of payments related to crypto transactions. The original ‘Operation Chokepoint’ from the Obama administration targeted businesses deemed high-risk (like payday lenders) by pressuring banks to cease doing business with them. ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’ is seen as a similar tactic applied to the crypto sector. Ending such practices would be a major win for crypto businesses, providing them with essential access to the traditional financial system and fostering a more stable operating environment. What Are the Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community? JD Vance’s statements offer several key takeaways: Political Engagement Matters: The fact that high-profile politicians are speaking at crypto conferences and discussing specific policy changes underscores the growing political relevance of the industry. Policy Shift Potential: A potential change in administration could bring a significant shift in US crypto regulation , potentially favoring growth and clarity over enforcement.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Telegram's blockbuster deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk's AI company integrate into Telegram and the two firms share revenue, is still a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov earlier Wednesday, U.S. time, that the deal was inked. TON, a token affiliated with Telegram's ecosystem, is trading at $3.30, rallying there from $3 after the initial – now refuted – announcement of the partnership was made. The token is down from an earlier high of $3.68, after Elon Musk posted on X that no deal had been signed between the two companies. TON is still up 11% on the day, according to CoinDesk market data . While Durov has now confirmed that no deal has been signed, the Telegram founder said there is an ""agreement in principle"" which might be why TON still has significant support at the $3.30. All eyes will be on Telegram and xAI as the Asia business day begins to see if more clarification comes from either side.

Speaking at Web Summit in Vancouver on Wednesday, Graber argued blockchain technology’s permanence and resource-intensive design make it unsuitable for consumer-oriented social networks, where content is fleeting and personal. “Why do you need your picture of what you post for lunch being maintained forever in this digital archive?” she asked on stage, highlighting the inherent scalability and cost limitations that drove her decision to avoid blockchain at Bluesky. Graber, to be sure, isn't against crypto. She says there's still genuine value in the technology for things like payments and digital identity, even if sometimes Web3 often presents solutions in search of a problem, and has a trend of gravitating towards centralization. “There’s a period where everyone was creating blockchain like this hammer, and we were just going to try blockchain for everything,” Graber said. “Every system that's trying to do it ends up with concentrations because it's easy, and convenience ultimately wins at the end of the day."" For her, Bluesky's future lies in combining the ideals of decentralization, such as user autonomy and portability, with practical, Web2 infrastructure to create a platform that prioritizes users' needs. ""Blockchain will probably find its place somewhere in the world of technology, but Bluesky is not on a blockchain because we're just making the best choices for our users,” she concluded. Nvidia's Earnings Beat Boosts Stock, Offers Modest Lift to AI Tokens Shares of Nvidia rose roughly 4% in after-hours trading Wednesday after reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings, highlighted by a 69% revenue increase from last year and a 73% jump in its data center business driven by robust demand for AI chips. Net income rose 26% to $18.8 billion, boosting Nvidia’s year-to-date performance modestly higher, CoinDesk previously reported. The earnings report provided a slight lift to AI-related crypto tokens like Bittensor (TAO), NEAR Protocol, and Internet Computer (ICP), though gains were modest. However, Nvidia tempered future expectations, cautioning that second-quarter revenue might fall short of market estimates due to tariff-related trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin dipped 1.2% to $107,800, though NYDIG sees more room for gains. At the same time, crypto markets shrugged off a U.S. court blocking Trump's broad tariffs as unconstitutional, with BTC trading remaining muted. ETH: Ether is trading above $2700 as Asia begins its business day. Earlier, CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole wrote ETH is eying a breakout above $3,000, forming a bullish ""ascending triangle"" pattern with rising support and resistance at $2,735, as higher lows signal growing buying pressure and accumulation ahead of a potential price surge. Gold: Gold has slipped 1% to $3,267.47 amid cooling safe-haven demand, though tariff and geopolitical uncertainty linger. Nikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 is opening in the green, up 1%, as investors in export-reliant Japan are looking at a recent announcement that the Supreme Court has blocked Trump's tariffs with cautious optimism, even as crypto shrugged it off.

This is where AMD’s latest strategic move comes into play, signaling a significant push to enhance its capabilities in powering next-generation AI systems. For anyone following the intersection of advanced computing and market dynamics, understanding this acquisition is key. Fueling AMD AI Ambitions with Strategic Acquisition AMD, a major player in the semiconductor industry, has announced the acquisition of Enosemi, a startup specializing in custom materials for silicon photonics product development. While the specific financial terms remain undisclosed, the intent behind this move is clear: to significantly bolster AMD’s presence and innovation in the AI space. This acquisition is a direct response to the escalating demands placed on computing infrastructure by increasingly large and complex AI models. As Brian Armick, SVP of Technology and Engineering at AMD, highlighted, the need for faster and more efficient data movement is accelerating. Enosemi, having previously collaborated with AMD as an external partner, now integrates its team and expertise directly into AMD’s operations. This is expected to immediately scale AMD’s capacity to support and develop various photonics and Co-packaged Optics solutions critical for advanced AI applications. Understanding the Power of Silicon Photonics Tech At the heart of this acquisition is silicon photonics, a technology that utilizes light (photons) instead of traditional electrical signals to transmit data. Why is this important? Speed: Light can transmit data significantly faster than electrical currents, which is crucial for the massive datasets processed by AI. Efficiency: Photonics consume less power than electrical interconnects, leading to more energy-efficient data centers. Bandwidth: It enables higher bandwidth connections, allowing more data to be moved simultaneously. Distance: Data can be transmitted over longer distances with less signal degradation. These benefits make Silicon Photonics Tech an increasingly attractive solution for high-performance computing environments, particularly those geared towards AI and machine learning workloads. AMD is not alone in recognizing this potential; other chipmakers are also exploring and investing in this technology. AMD itself reportedly engaged in an R&D collaboration with Taiwan startups in this area late last year, underscoring its growing commitment. Addressing the Challenge of AI Data Movement One of the significant bottlenecks in scaling AI performance is the speed and efficiency of moving data between processing units (like GPUs) and memory, as well as between different nodes in a data center. This challenge, often referred to as AI Data Movement , becomes more pronounced as AI models grow in size and complexity. Enosemi’s expertise in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) directly addresses this issue. PICs are microchips that combine multiple photonic components to form functional circuits capable of handling optical signals. Enosemi’s products, such as optical interconnects, are designed to integrate computing and networking components within data centers, facilitating much faster and more efficient communication pathways. By bringing Enosemi’s capabilities in-house, AMD aims to develop integrated solutions that significantly reduce latency and increase throughput for AI workloads. Details of the Enosemi Acquisition Founded in 2023 by semiconductor engineers Ari Novack and Matthew Streshinsky, Silicon Valley-based Enosemi was a relatively young startup. Prior to its acquisition, the company had raised $150,000 in VC funding. As of May, it reportedly had a team of 16 employees. The fact that AMD chose to acquire a startup with this specific focus highlights the strategic importance it places on photonics for its future AI roadmap. The Enosemi Acquisition is AMD’s first since its significant deal involving ZT Systems, further demonstrating AMD’s intent to make targeted investments that align with its core growth areas, particularly AI. Ari Novack’s LinkedIn profile already lists him as a silicon design engineering fellow at AMD, indicating a smooth integration of key talent. The Role of Co-packaged Optics in Next-Gen AI Systems The acquisition is specifically aimed at accelerating AMD’s innovation in Co-packaged Optics . This technology involves integrating optical components directly onto the same package as the electronic chips (like CPUs or GPUs). This close proximity dramatically reduces the distance data needs to travel electrically before being converted to light, leading to significant improvements in speed, power efficiency, and density compared to traditional pluggable optical modules. For next-generation AI systems that require unprecedented levels of interconnect performance between processors and memory, and between processors in large clusters, co-packaged optics are seen as essential. By integrating Enosemi’s expertise, AMD is positioning itself to be a leader in developing these critical components, ensuring its future AI chips and platforms can meet the demanding requirements of advanced AI training and inference. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for AMD in the AI Race The acquisition of Enosemi represents a strategic and forward-thinking move by AMD. By integrating a company with specialized expertise in silicon photonics and photonic integrated circuits, AMD is directly addressing the critical challenges of AI Data Movement and high-performance interconnects. This move is set to accelerate AMD’s development of Co-packaged Optics , which are vital for the performance and efficiency of future AI Systems . Ultimately, this strengthens AMD’s position in the competitive landscape and underscores its commitment to fueling its ambitious growth plans in artificial intelligence, building on its already impressive AI chip revenue figures.

They shared this bullish outlook during a discussion on stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Don Jr. anticipated that Bitcoin could trade from $175,000 to $150,000 after Eric joked that the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value could soar “to the moon” by the close of next year . Eric said that every day, people put billions and billions of dollars into Bitcoin. He forecasted that 0.1 Bitcoin would be worth an absolute fortune, adding that demand for the digital asset overtook supply. Saylor urges Trump’s family to invest in Bitcoin Don Jr. and Eric have become strong supporters of the crypto industry . They are involved in various crypto projects, such as the World Liberty Financial DeFi project and an American Bitcoin mining company. Moreover, most recently, Nasdaq-listed Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social and Truth. Fi revealed its plans to raise $2.5 billion to launch a Bitcoin treasury. American Bitcoin is also “staking sats” as part of a plan to boost its “Bitcoin per share” metric, which it uses to calculate the value of Bitcoin treasury companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Meanwhile, World Liberty intends to introduce a stablecoin. Don Jr. stated that they are actively working on all these projects, bearing in mind that crypto is for the long term. He further stated that this was a major focus for them. Eric revealed that Saylor was helping the Trump family transition into “crypto magnates.” At one point, Saylor had tried to convince the Trumps — with whom he has been family friends in New York for a long time — to mortgage the Mar-a-Lago property so they could use the money to buy Bitcoin. Eric mentioned that Saylor told them to follow his lead, urging them that there was an amazing chance of getting Bitcoin. He then admitted that he had never seen anything like this in any other field where a major leader is actually encouraging talented individuals to challenge them. Bitcoin reached a greater height on May 22, closing at $111,390 after briefly rising to a high of $112,000. The milestone capped a 45% surge in early April when Bitcoin was traded at around $76,450. Based on CoinMarketCap reports, Bitcoin is trading at $108,105.47, reflecting an approximately 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. Eric says everyone wants to be associated with Bitcoin Eric observed in his daily experiences with the Trump organization that he is seeing more institutions create strategies for holding Bitcoin, including royal families and private offices. He mentioned that just a year ago, fewer than 100 companies were likely treasuring Bitcoin, and now this has changed. Following this, he stated that this trend is not limited to America. It includes the entire Middle East, Africa, and all of Asia. Based on his argument, everyone wants to be associated with Bitcoin and not to part with it. Eric further highlighted that his interest in cryptocurrency was strengthen after he experienced some difficulties with the traditional financial system, including the process of being debanked. “All of my accounts just stopped working,” he said. “Then you start to see how corrupt the system is… it was used to be against people.” “I don’t like using the word hate, but I can’t think of a better word,” he added, before admitting that he would like to see some of the big banks vanish entirely, because, in his opinion, they really ought to.

In earnings released May 28 for its first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year ended April 27, Nvidia reported revenues of $44.1 billion, up 12% from its previous quarter and 69% from a year ago and beating Zacks analyst estimates of $42.91 billion by nearly 2.7%. However, the chip maker posted an earnings per share of 81 cents, missing analyst estimates of 85 cents per share. Nvidia recorded a net income of $18.8 billion, up 26% compared to a year ago. In an earnings call, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that the “global demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong” as countries start recognizing “AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet.” Source: Nvidia “AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate,” he said. US export rules to deliver $8 billion hit Nvidia said the lower-than-expected income resulted from a $4.5 billion charge due to the US government’s restrictions on exporting its high-powered H20 artificial intelligence chips to China. In its outlook for its Q2 results, the company said it expects revenues around $45 billion, which “reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations.” Nvidia will reportedly launch a new lower-cost AI chip specifically for China, with mass production expected to start in June. Nvidia’s data center revenue accounted for most of the firm’s total revenues, hitting $39.1 billion, up 10% from the previous quarter.

Despite the increase in selling pressure from miners after the all-time high, the price of Bitcoin has managed to hold above $108,000, with on-chain data showing Bitcoin diamond hands absorbing all the selling pressure. Long-Term Holders Accumulating With Minimal Spending According to data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Spending Binary Indicator has fallen to its lowest level since September 2024. This interesting trend was initially noted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst Alex Adler Jr. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next The 15-day moving average of this metric, as shown in the chart by CryptoQuant, has dropped to the minimal spending zone. Notably, this zone has consistently preceded a more bullish move in the Bitcoin price. In parallel, long-term holder supply has risen by approximately 300,000 BTC over the past 20 days. This marks a deviation from the trend of declines in the long-term holder supply since 2024. At the time of writing, 14.6 million BTC, representing about 74% of the total current circulating supply of BTC, is in addresses classified as long-term holders. This pattern suggests that so-called “diamond hands”, i.e., investors with a strong conviction who hold through volatility, are not only refraining from selling with Bitcoin’s recent new peak, but are actively accumulating. The chart below shows the correlation between minimal LTH spending and rising price action, a behavior that also aligned with phases of Bitcoin’s uptrend in 2019, late 2020, and late 2024. Why It’s Bullish For The Market The significant uptick in long-term holder supply, combined with minimal selling activity, reveals a hidden strength in the market. The current behavior of long-term investors also indicates their confidence in Bitcoin’s valuation at current levels, despite the recent price surge. Many of these long-term holders are in substantial profit, yet still choose to hold. This is unlike short-term holders, who have collectively realized over $11.6 billion in profits over the past month alone. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Drawing a parallel with historical data, the current decline in long-term holder (LTH) spending mirrors a similar pattern observed in September 2024. At that time, the LTH Indicator was in the minimal zone, and the long-term holder supply was also increasing steadily. What followed was a remarkable 96% surge in Bitcoin’s price, rising from approximately $54,000 to peaks around $106,000 in December and January. If the market were to follow a similar trajectory from the current price level, a comparable 96% rally would see Bitcoin rise to a new peak near $212,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,000.

However, it also attracts bad actors looking to exploit unsuspecting individuals. A recent development highlights this risk: a Vietnamese woman has been arrested in Thailand in connection with a massive crypto scam worth an estimated $300 million. What Led to This Significant Thailand Arrest ? According to reports, Thai authorities apprehended a Vietnamese national suspected of being involved in a large-scale cryptocurrency fraud operation. The arrest took place in Thailand, where the suspect was allegedly operating or linked to activities that impacted thousands of victims. The core of the allegations revolves around a classic high-yield investment program (HYIP) style scam, adapted for the crypto age. Victims were reportedly lured in with promises of incredibly high, fixed monthly returns – specifically, between 20% and 30%. These kinds of unrealistic promises are a major red flag in the world of investments, traditional or crypto. The Promise: Guaranteed 20-30% monthly returns. The Reality: A complete loss of initial investment for most, if not all, participants. Impacted: Approximately 2,600 victims. Total Loss: Estimated at $300 million. Location of Arrest: Thailand. Suspect’s Nationality: Vietnamese. This incident serves as a stark reminder that if an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Understanding the Mechanics of Such Investment Fraud Scammers often employ sophisticated tactics to appear legitimate. They might create professional-looking websites, use complex terminology, and even show fabricated payout proofs in the initial stages to build trust and encourage larger investments. The promise of high returns, especially on a monthly basis, is designed to trigger a sense of urgency and greed, overriding critical thinking. In this specific case, the alleged scheme managed to defraud 2,600 victims, accumulating losses totaling around $300 million. This scale indicates a potentially widespread operation, likely utilizing online platforms and aggressive recruitment strategies. Key Characteristics of This Type of Scam: Based on the information available, the scheme exhibits several common traits of fraudulent operations: Unrealistic Return Promises: 20-30% monthly is far beyond what legitimate, low-risk investments can offer. Even high-risk ventures rarely promise such consistent, exorbitant returns. Focus on Recruitment: While not explicitly stated in the brief report, many HYIP scams rely on participants recruiting new investors to pay off earlier ones (a Ponzi scheme structure). Lack of Transparency: Details about how these massive returns are generated are usually vague or non-existent. Legitimate investments explain their strategy. Pressure Tactics: Scammers often pressure potential victims to invest quickly to not miss out on the opportunity. This investment fraud highlights the need for extreme caution when evaluating any opportunity, especially in the fast-moving crypto space. The Broader Context: Tackling Crypto Crime Across Borders The arrest of a Vietnamese suspect in Thailand in relation to a crypto scam impacting potentially international victims underscores the cross-border nature of crypto crime . Cryptocurrencies operate globally, which makes tracing funds and pursuing suspects challenging for law enforcement agencies that are bound by national jurisdictions. Collaboration between international police forces and financial regulators is crucial in combating these types of crimes. The successful Thailand arrest in this case demonstrates that such cooperation can yield results, bringing alleged perpetrators to justice and potentially helping in asset recovery efforts, although recovering lost funds in crypto scams is often difficult. Law enforcement agencies worldwide are increasingly developing specialized units and expertise to handle cases involving digital assets. However, the speed at which new scams emerge often outpaces regulatory and enforcement capabilities. Actionable Insights: How to Protect Yourself from Cryptocurrency Fraud Protecting yourself from scams like the one that led to this Thailand arrest requires vigilance and education. Here are some actionable steps you can take: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on someone else’s recommendation. Understand the project, the team behind it, and the technology. Be Skeptical of High Returns: If an investment guarantees extremely high returns, especially with little to no risk, it is highly likely a scam. Legitimate investments carry risk, and returns fluctuate. Check for Red Flags: Vague business models, lack of a whitepaper or clear documentation, anonymous teams, pressure to recruit others, and demands for payment in unconventional ways are all warning signs. Verify Company Information: Try to verify the legitimacy of the company or platform. Are they registered? Do they have a physical address? Can you find independent reviews or news articles about them (not just promotional material)? Start Small: If you decide to invest in something new, start with a small amount you can afford to lose. Be wary if there are high minimum investment requirements. Secure Your Wallets and Keys: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with common scam tactics in the crypto space. Follow reputable news sources and educational platforms. Remember, the responsibility ultimately falls on the individual investor to perform due diligence and recognize the signs of potential investment fraud . Summary: A Wake-Up Call Against Crypto Scams The recent Thailand arrest of a Vietnamese suspect in connection with a $300 million crypto scam serves as a critical reminder of the risks present in the cryptocurrency market. Schemes promising unrealistic returns are prevalent forms of cryptocurrency fraud and can lead to devastating financial losses for thousands of victims. While law enforcement is working to combat crypto crime , investor education and skepticism remain the most powerful tools against falling victim to investment fraud . Always approach opportunities that seem too good to be true with extreme caution and conduct thorough research before committing your funds.

On the daily time frame, XRP has been losing momentum as Bitcoin cools off, and since most altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead, XRP is no exception. When Bitcoin dips or moves sideways, altcoins often react with sharper drops, and that’s exactly what’s happening now. Bitcoin dominance is currently quite strong, which means Bitcoin is holding its value better than many altcoins. This puts added pressure on coins like XRP, which are now struggling to stay above important support levels. Recently, XRP slipped below a key support area around $2.30. Is There a Bullish Pattern Forming? With this level lost, analysts are now keeping a close eye on the next important zone, which sits between $2.10 and $2.15. If XRP fails to hold here, the next significant level to watch would be around $2.00, and below that, there’s some support near $1.80. Interestingly, there’s a bullish setup forming on the daily chart. There are early signs of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is a classic reversal formation that could hint at a bigger move to the upside. Short-Term Outlook However, for this pattern to actually play out, XRP would need to stabilize somewhere in the lower $2 range, likely between $2.00 and $2.15, before bouncing back towards $2.62. A confirmed breakout above this higher level would be a strong bullish signal, possibly opening the door to new highs. But for now, this pattern is only a possibility and not confirmed. In the shorter time frames, XRP has also lost a bit of positive momentum. A short-term bullish divergence recently failed as the price and RSI both made lower lows, canceling out the divergence. This signals the potential for further downside in the immediate term, with the next likely stop being around the $2.10 area.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 02:01:04

Google Photos AI is making significant strides with a major update, rolling out powerful new features that leverage AI to transform how we edit and manage our memories. This evolution in mainstream AI technology highlights the rapid advancements happening across the tech landscape, relevant to anyone interested in the future of digital tools and platforms. Redesigned Google Photos: A Fresh Look and Enhanced Power Google is celebrating a decade of Google Photos by introducing a significantly redesigned editor. This update isn’t just a cosmetic change; it brings a suite of advanced AI capabilities previously exclusive to Pixel devices to a much wider audience. The goal is to make powerful editing more accessible and intuitive for everyone using the app on Android and, later, iOS. This Redesigned Google Photos experience centralizes tools and offers helpful suggestions, streamlining the editing workflow considerably. Unlocking Creativity with Generative AI Photo Features At the heart of this update are new generative AI tools that push the boundaries of photo editing. One standout feature is ‘Reimagine’. This tool uses Generative AI Photo technology to allow users to alter objects and backgrounds within their pictures using simple text prompts. Imagine changing a dull sky to ‘clear blue skies’ or transforming elements in the scene just by describing what you want. This level of control, driven by AI, offers unprecedented creative possibilities directly within the app. Powerful AI Photo Editing Capabilities Beyond generative transformations, the update enhances core AI Photo Editing functions. The ‘Auto Frame’ feature intelligently suggests optimal ways to frame your shots, whether that involves cropping, widening the perspective, or even using generative AI to fill in blank areas created by adjustments. Another notable addition is the ‘AI Enhance’ option, which bundles multiple AI effects for quick, impactful edits. Users can combine actions like sharpening an image and removing unwanted objects in a single tap. The editor also provides contextual suggestions; tap on a specific part of your photo, and Google Photos might suggest relevant tools like adjusting lighting or blurring the background. Accessing Advanced Google AI Tools Bringing these sophisticated capabilities to all users democratizes access to advanced Google AI Tools . These features were previously a key differentiator for Google’s Pixel phones, showcasing the company’s leading edge in mobile AI. Now, with the global rollout starting next month for Android devices and coming later this year to iOS, millions more people will be able to leverage these powerful functions directly within the Google Photos app. This move signals Google’s commitment to making its AI innovations available across its popular platforms. Beyond Editing: Enhanced Sharing and Community While the editor redesign is the main highlight, Google also announced a practical new feature for sharing: QR codes for albums. This makes it significantly easier to share photo albums with people nearby or at events. You can simply display or print a QR code, and anyone who scans it can instantly view and even add photos to the shared album. This small but useful addition simplifies collaboration and sharing memories in group settings. The integration of advanced Google Photos AI features represents a significant leap in mobile photo editing. By making powerful generative and assistive AI tools widely available, Google is changing how people interact with their photos, offering creative control and simplified editing workflows. As AI continues to evolve, its integration into everyday applications like Google Photos demonstrates its growing impact on technology used globally, a trend closely watched by innovators in fields like cryptocurrency and blockchain.

With Bitcoin stabilizing above critical resistance zones and Ethereum showing renewed strength, early buyers are recalibrating portfolios and aggressively seeking undervalued opportunities. In the aftermath of SUI’s meteoric rise, many find themselves reflecting on missed chances. The window to early entry has closed, and the market’s attention is shifting. In this new wave of momentum, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged not just as a promising presale—but as a technology platform purpose-built to resolve the persistent issues that hindered earlier blockchain projects. While SUI advanced the architecture of high-throughput Layer 1s, Qubetics delivers real-world applications through interoperability, decentralization, and unmatched user flexibility. With a presale that has already raised over millions, the narrative is clear: this project is quickly becoming the most popular cryptocurrency among informed adopters. Qubetics: A Strategic Entry into Practical Web3 Innovation For those who missed SUI, Qubetics offers a rare opportunity to enter at the ground level of a project engineered for real-world adoption. Positioned as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics brings cross-chain interoperability, a user-centric non-custodial wallet, and advanced transaction capabilities into one seamless ecosystem. Currently in its 36th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $17.5 million in contributions. The token, priced at $0.3064, has drawn widespread attention due to its strong performance metrics and expansive roadmap. Over 514 million $TICS have been sold to a rapidly growing community of over 27,200 holders—clear evidence of market confidence. At the heart of Qubetics lies its multi-chain, non-custodial wallet application—designed for professionals, businesses, and everyday users who require flexibility, speed, and control over their digital assets. This wallet allows seamless asset management across various blockchains without requiring multiple interfaces or custodial intermediaries. A digital design agency accepting global payments can simplify accounting by aggregating multi-chain revenues in a single dashboard. There’s no need for constant wallet switching or managing several DeFi apps. One of the most compelling aspects of Qubetics lies in its wealth-building potential. With $TICS currently priced at $0.3064 during the presale, projections for post-launch returns are turning heads across the investment community. If $TICS reaches $1, early participants could secure a return on investment of 226%. Should the token climb to $5, the ROI surges to 1,531%. At $6, that jumps to 1,858%, while a $10 valuation would represent an astonishing 3,163% return. And if $TICS hits $15 following the mainnet launch, early holders could see a remarkable 4,795% ROI. Investing in $TICS at this stage isn’t merely speculation—it’s securing a position in the backbone of tomorrow’s decentralized web. Qubetics addresses the usability gap left by earlier platforms and positions itself as the most popular cryptocurrency for practical Web3 deployment. SUI: A Breakthrough with Limited Access SUI, developed by Mysten Labs, introduced an advanced Layer 1 blockchain architecture that utilized the Move programming language and parallel transaction execution. Its design offered significant scalability improvements and real-time finality—ideal for decentralized applications in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs. The launch was widely anticipated and gained substantial traction, particularly among developers seeking new, high-performance chains. For builders, this means longer timelines. For early buyers, it introduces uncertainty and missed compounding opportunities. This scenario has become familiar: a groundbreaking concept launches, early access is limited, and by the time the broader market is onboard, the upside potential has largely diminished. It’s a pattern that defines many most popular cryptocurrency projects in hindsight. Conclusion: An Opportunity That Demands Action History rewards those who act with foresight. While SUI delivered exceptional performance, many were excluded from its earliest and most profitable stages. Qubetics presents a fresh opportunity—with advanced technology, a clear roadmap, and significant backing. The next most popular cryptocurrency is unlikely to resemble the last. It will solve new problems, unlock new efficiencies, and deliver returns to those who recognize its value early. Do not allow another opportunity to pass by unnoticed.

45226635,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163778,1748485825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45226635.jpeg,DeepSeek R1: Crucial AI Model Update Released on Hugging Face,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/deepseek-r1-hugging-face/,"BitcoinWorld DeepSeek R1: Crucial AI Model Update Released on Hugging Face In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, developments from key players like DeepSeek often capture significant attention. For those following the intersection of technology and digital assets, understanding these shifts is vital as AI increasingly influences various sectors, including blockchain and data analysis. A notable event occurred on May 28, 2025, when Chinese startup DeepSeek announced a significant DeepSeek R1 update. What Does This AI Model Update Entail? DeepSeek, a company that gained prominence earlier this year, has rolled out an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model. This particular model is known for its capabilities that previously challenged established models from companies like OpenAI. The announcement, initially shared via a WeChat message, confirms that this is a “minor” upgrade, according to DeepSeek’s own description. While DeepSeek terms it a minor adjustment, any update to a model of R1’s caliber is noteworthy. Details on the specific improvements are limited within the public release information, which primarily includes configuration files and weights rather than a detailed description of the model’s enhancements. However, the release itself signals ongoing development and refinement of their core technology. The Significance of the Hugging Face Release A key aspect of this announcement is the Hugging Face release . DeepSeek has made the updated R1 model available on this popular developer platform. Hugging Face serves as a central hub for open-source machine learning models and datasets, facilitating collaboration and accessibility within the AI community. Putting the updated R1 on Hugging Face means it’s now more readily available for researchers, developers, and organizations to access, experiment with, and potentially integrate into their own projects. This move aligns with the trend of making powerful AI tools more accessible, although the model’s size presents practical challenges for many users. Exploring the Power of Reasoning AI The DeepSeek R1 is fundamentally a Reasoning AI model. Reasoning models are designed to perform complex cognitive tasks that go beyond simple pattern recognition. They aim to understand context, infer information, and make logical deductions, skills crucial for advanced applications like complex problem-solving, sophisticated data analysis, and generating highly coherent and contextually relevant text. DeepSeek’s focus on reasoning capabilities sets its models apart and contributed to R1’s initial success and the attention it received. The continuous updating of such models suggests a commitment to advancing AI’s ability to handle more abstract and logical challenges. Understanding the Scale: A Massive Large Language Model The updated R1 model is described as having 685 billion parameters. Parameters are essentially the internal components that guide a model’s behavior, often synonymous with ‘weights.’ This parameter count places R1 firmly in the category of a Large Language Model (LLM). To put 685 billion parameters into perspective, this is an extremely large model. Running such a model typically requires significant computational resources, including high-end GPUs and substantial memory. Consequently, without specific modifications or quantization techniques, the updated R1 model is unlikely to run on standard consumer-grade hardware. This means its immediate use case is primarily for organizations and researchers with access to powerful computing infrastructure. What About Licensing and Concerns? DeepSeek has released the updated R1 under a permissive MIT license. This is a significant point as it means the model can be used commercially. An MIT license is one of the most liberal open-source licenses, allowing users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software without restriction, provided the original copyright and permission notice are included. Despite the open licensing, DeepSeek’s technology has previously attracted scrutiny. Some regulators, particularly in the United States, have expressed concerns that DeepSeek’s AI capabilities could pose a national security risk, given the company’s origins. These concerns highlight the broader geopolitical considerations surrounding advanced AI development and its potential dual-use nature. Concluding Thoughts The release of DeepSeek’s updated R1 reasoning AI model on Hugging Face, despite being labeled a “minor” update, is an important event in the AI space. It makes a powerful, commercially usable reasoning model more accessible to the global developer community, reinforcing the trend towards open model sharing. While the sheer scale of the 685 billion parameter model limits its immediate accessibility to those with significant computational resources, and regulatory concerns persist, DeepSeek’s continued development and release strategy signal its intent to remain a key player in the advanced AI market.

The number landed well above expectations and immediately pushed Nvidia’s stock up around 6% in after-hours trading. The company also beat on earnings, posting 96 cents per share, adjusted, compared to the 93 cents analysts expected. Despite new restrictions from Washington that blocked shipments of its H20 AI chips to China, Nvidia still delivered one of its strongest quarters ever. The company had been set to make nearly $8 billion more in revenue if not for the policy change. During the quarter, the US government informed the company that the H20 chip, which had previously been cleared, would now require an export license. That decision forced Nvidia to take a $4.5 billion hit from excess inventory and wiped out $2.5 billion in potential sales. China ban slams revenue, Jensen Huang says AI market is closed to US Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang told investors during the earnings call that the new export controls effectively blocked US companies from competing in China’s massive AI chip market. “The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China,” Jensen said. He added that the $50 billion AI chip opportunity in China is now “effectively closed to US industry.” The company’s gross margin came in at 61%, but would have been 71.3% if not for the China-related losses. Still, Nvidia’s net income for the quarter climbed 26% to $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, compared to $14.9 billion or 60 cents per share a year ago. Revenue jumped from $26 billion a year earlier, driven largely by the company’s data center unit. That division, which includes the hardware powering AI tools like ChatGPT, rose 73% to $39.1 billion, accounting for 88% of total revenue. Nvidia said that almost half of the data center business came from large cloud providers. Sales of networking products, which connect thousands of GPUs for AI training, hit $5 billion. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told investors that Microsoft has “deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs and is expected to ramp to hundreds of thousands” of the company’s GB200 chips, mainly due to its work with OpenAI. Gaming, auto, and visualization units post solid gains The gaming division, once the company’s main business, pulled in $3.8 billion, a 42% increase from the previous year. Nvidia still builds the processor for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, but many of these chips now double for AI purposes too. The automotive and robotics unit brought in $567 million, up 72%, boosted by more demand for chips and software used in self-driving technology. The professional visualization segment, including hardware like the DGX Spark and DGX Station, posted $509 million in revenue, up 19% from last year. These machines are used for AI and 3D design workloads. The company also returned cash to shareholders in a big way. It spent $14.1 billion on share repurchases and issued $244 million in dividends during the quarter. Despite facing regulatory setbacks and a China chokehold, Nvidia is less than 5% off its record high from January and is currently sitting at its highest level in four months. Outside of the company’s report, financial markets got another jolt late Wednesday when the US Court of International Trade ruled against President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. The court said Trump had overreached and ordered the tariffs to be vacated. S&P 500 futures rose 1.6%, Nasdaq 100 futures added 2%, and the Dow Jones futures climbed 511 points, or 1.2%. This came after a sluggish session where the S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%, and the Dow lost 245 points. But by the end of the week, things looked different. Major indexes are now on pace to end both the week and the month higher. The S&P 500 is up 1.5%, the Dow rose 1.2%, and the Nasdaq gained 2%. The tech sector alone has surged over 10% in May, driven by the AI wave and announcements from companies like Alphabet.

One such player making waves recently is DeepSeek AI . This Chinese AI lab has burst onto the global scene, gaining viral attention and sparking discussions about the future of artificial intelligence. What is DeepSeek AI and Where Did it Come From? DeepSeek AI quickly rose to prominence, topping app store charts and capturing the attention of analysts and technologists alike. Its rapid ascent has led many to question the current global AI landscape and the dynamics of the AI race. But what exactly is DeepSeek, and how did a relatively new player achieve such widespread recognition? The origins of DeepSeek AI are tied to the financial world. It is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a quantitative hedge fund based in China that leverages AI for its trading strategies. Founded in 2015 by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, High-Flyer Capital Management established DeepSeek in 2023 as a dedicated AI research lab, separate from its core financial operations. The lab eventually spun off into its own entity, retaining the name DeepSeek, with High-Flyer as a key investor. From its inception, DeepSeek invested in building its own data center infrastructure for model training. However, like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has faced challenges due to U.S. export restrictions on advanced hardware. This has meant using chips like the Nvidia H800, a less powerful alternative to the H100 available elsewhere, for training some of its larger AI Models . The DeepSeek team is notable for its composition, reportedly featuring a young technical staff aggressively recruited from top Chinese universities. The company also hires individuals from non-computer science backgrounds to enhance its models’ understanding across diverse subjects, aiming to build a more versatile AI Chatbot . Exploring DeepSeek’s Powerful AI Models DeepSeek first unveiled its suite of AI Models in November 2023, including DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat. However, it was the release of the next-generation DeepSeek-V2 family of models that truly captured the AI industry’s attention. Key characteristics of DeepSeek-V2: A general-purpose system capable of analyzing both text and images. Strong performance across various AI benchmarks. Significantly lower operational costs compared to contemporary models. Forced domestic competitors like ByteDance and Alibaba to reduce their own model pricing, with some even becoming free. The launch of DeepSeek-V3 in December 2024 further solidified DeepSeek’s reputation. According to the company’s internal testing, DeepSeek V3 demonstrated performance exceeding both openly available models like Meta’s Llama and closed models accessed via API, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Another impressive model is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model, released in January. DeepSeek claims R1 performs comparably to OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. As a reasoning model, R1 incorporates a self-fact-checking mechanism designed to mitigate common AI pitfalls. While reasoning models might take slightly longer to generate responses (seconds to minutes), they tend to be more reliable, particularly in complex domains like physics, science, and mathematics. The Challenges and Controversies of China AI Despite their technical prowess, DeepSeek’s AI Models face specific challenges inherent to being developed in China. They are subject to oversight and benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure they align with “core socialist values.” This regulatory environment impacts the behavior of the AI Chatbot . For instance, the R1 model within the DeepSeek app will not provide answers to sensitive political questions regarding topics like Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. Beyond domestic regulation, DeepSeek has also become a point of contention in the broader geopolitical and industry landscape. In March, traffic to DeepSeek saw significant visits, positioning it strongly, though still far behind giants like ChatGPT in terms of overall user base. However, the company’s disruptive approach and technical claims have not gone unnoticed. DeepSeek’s Disruptive Business Model and Industry Impact One of the most puzzling aspects of DeepSeek AI is its seemingly unconventional business model. The company prices its products and services significantly below market rates, even offering some for free. Despite considerable venture capital interest, DeepSeek is reportedly not seeking external investment. The company attributes this strategy to breakthroughs in efficiency that allow for extreme cost competitiveness, although some experts have questioned these claims. Regardless of the specifics, developers have embraced DeepSeek’s models. While not strictly open source, they are available under permissive licenses allowing commercial use. Platforms like Hugging Face host DeepSeek’s models, with thousands of derivative models created by developers, accumulating millions of downloads. DeepSeek’s success has been described in various ways, from “upending AI” to being potentially “over-hyped.” Its emergence coincided with an 18% drop in Nvidia’s stock price in January and elicited public comments from industry leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, highlighting the competitive pressure and strategic importance of AI infrastructure. However, DeepSeek also faces significant pushback, particularly from governments concerned about data security and potential propaganda. U.S. Commerce department bureaus, New York state, and countries like South Korea have banned DeepSeek on government devices. Microsoft’s Vice Chairman and President also cited data security and propaganda concerns for prohibiting its use by Microsoft employees, despite Microsoft Azure AI Foundry listing DeepSeek as available. OpenAI has gone as far as to label DeepSeek as “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” recommending that the U.S. government consider banning its models. Conversely, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” noting that reasoning models like R1 are beneficial for Nvidia due to their high compute demands. The Future of DeepSeek AI Predicting the exact future trajectory of DeepSeek AI is challenging. Continued development and improvement of its Generative AI models are likely. However, the increasing scrutiny and potential bans from governments, particularly in the U.S., pose significant obstacles. Reports suggest the U.S. government is likely to implement broader bans on DeepSeek for government use, reflecting growing wariness over perceived foreign influence in critical technology sectors. Conclusion DeepSeek AI’s rapid rise from a hedge fund lab to a globally recognized AI Chatbot provider is a testament to its technical innovation and disruptive strategy, particularly its focus on compute-efficient AI Models . It has successfully challenged established players, influenced pricing dynamics, and sparked debate about the global AI race and the role of China AI . While its technical achievements are clear, the company navigates a complex landscape of geopolitical tensions, regulatory constraints, and industry competition, making its future path uncertain but undeniably impactful on the evolution of Generative AI .

ETH is now up over 5% and might attempt to clear the $2,800 resistance. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,550 and $2,720 levels. The price is trading near $2,720 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $2,800 resistance zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Rallies Over 5% Ethereum price started a fresh increase from the $2,550 support zone, beating Bitcoin . ETH price was able to recover above the $2,620 and $2,650 resistance levels. The price even surpassed the $2,720 level. However, the bears were active near the $2,785 resistance zone. The price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,610 swing low to the $2,787 high. Ethereum price is now trading near $2,720 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,780 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,800 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,7=840 level. A clear move above the $2,840 resistance might send the price toward the $2,880 resistance. An upside break above the $2,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,920 resistance zone or even $2,950 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,780 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,700 level. The first major support sits near the $2,650 zone. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,610 swing low to the $2,787 high. A clear move below the $2,650 support might push the price toward the $2,610 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,500.

Recently, VivoPower International — a NASDAQ-listed energy firm — announced it had raised $121 million in a private share placement to launch a digital asset treasury strategy centered on XRP. What makes this move even more interesting is that the funding was led by His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, a long-time investor in digital assets and XRP. In an official statement, the Saudi prince revealed that his team met with President Trump and his leadership group during a recent visit to Saudi Arabia. Following those discussions, they believed the timing was right to embrace digital assets and blockchain technology in the Kingdom. This meeting appears to have played a key role in accelerating plans for the XRP-focused treasury strategy. VivoPower aims to become the first public company to officially hold XRP as part of its treasury reserves, joining a growing trend of firms adding cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. BREAKING: The Saudi Prince (per his own quote) met with President Trump and decided the timing was right for an $XRP focused public company! THIS IS MASSIVE NEWS FOR XRP! https://t.co/L57EnifPbY pic.twitter.com/SFHRtqraC1 — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) May 28, 2025 Adding to the excitement, former SBI Ripple Asia executive Adam Traidman has joined VivoPower as chairman of its advisory board. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also acknowledged the move, highlighting it as a major step forward for the XRP ecosystem. This development shows how digital assets like XRP are being adopted at the institutional and governmental level. While it remains unclear how directly involved Trump was in pushing this deal, the timing and the prince’s remarks hint that their meeting may have influenced the decision. For XRP holders, this news offers a bullish signal. As more institutions and global players consider integrating digital assets into their financial strategies, XRP appears to be climbing back into the spotlight.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 02:59:44

Charles Edwards, founder of the digital-asset hedge fund Capriole Investments, believes that price could be at least 50% higher by November. In his latest market note, “Saddle Up,” released on 27 May, the manager argues that a rare confluence of macro, technical and on-chain factors has created “the most bullish technical setup we could ask for for Bitcoin at all-time highs.” Bitcoin 50% Rally Is “Conservative” Edwards first set the stage for the call in late April, when Bitcoin was trading near $93,000. “We noted the bullish Bitcoin setup and expectation to be ‘pushing new all-time highs quite soon’,” he recalled. One month later the market has risen 16%, validating that view and, in Edwards’s telling, clearing the decks for the next leg higher. Central to the thesis is what Edwards dubs the “Hard Asset Era.” A breakout in the Gold-to-S&P 500 ratio above its 200-week moving average signals that investors are again favouring scarce stores of value over equities. Historically, such regimes are “sticky,” he writes, adding that the ensuing outperformance of gold over stocks has ranged from 150% to 650% in past cycles. “If you think gold has already rallied a lot, think again,” Edwards said. On that analogue, Bitcoin — which tends to lag gold by several months — could be poised for even steeper gains. Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Recent policy changes have underpinned the rotation. Basel III rules elevated gold to Tier-1 reserve status in 2022, forcing banks to back paper positions with physical metal, while last year’s approvals of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened institutional flood-gates to the cryptocurrency. Washington’s creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early 2025 provided an additional layer of state-level legitimacy. Against the same backdrop, persistent inflation, tariff frictions and the precedent of freezing Russian foreign-exchange reserves have catalysed demand for politically neutral assets. Bitcoin Technicals And Fundamental From a market-structure standpoint, Bitcoin’s April slide to $75,000 and sharp recovery above $90,000 is described as a text-book “fake-out” — a failed breakdown that often precedes powerful upside trends. The weekly close reclaim above $90,000 “marked the start of a new trend,” Edwards contends, making the $104,000 level the first line of defence. “As long as price is above $104K, this is the most bullish technical setup we could ask for,” he wrote, reducing near-term risk management to a single number. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock Capriole’s machine-learning-driven Bitcoin Macro Index, which blends more than 100 on-chain, macro and equity-market variables, continues to register in “bullish growth.” Apparent demand (production minus dormant supply) has turned positive, US liquidity remains supportive, and Capriole’s new “Volume Summer” metric shows trend-confirming expansion in trading activity. Taken together with the historical three-to-five-month lag between gold breakouts and Bitcoin rallies, the firm argues that “a 50 %-plus rise over the next six months is a conservative target.” Policy Wild-Cards The clearest threats to the projection lie on the policy front. Edwards highlights a 30- to 60-day window for the United States to strike tariff compromises with China and the European Union; failure could dent risk appetite. He also warns that the flourishing “Bitcoin-treasury arbitrage” — whereby corporates issue low-cost debt to accumulate BTC — could amplify downside in a future deleveraging, though leverage levels remain manageable for now. For the moment, however, the combination of a hard-asset bull cycle, confirmed technical strength and improving fundamentals keeps Capriole “very optimistic about the mid- to long-term potential for both gold and Bitcoin.” As long as the market holds above that $104,000 weekly pivot, Edwards suggests investors should — in his own closing words — “saddle up.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,005.

US index futures also climbed in reaction, pointing to a stronger Wall Street open. South Korea’s central bank, on the other hand, trimmed its key interest rate, and South Korean Kospi climbed 1.4% to 2,707.77 in reaction. The three-judge panel said the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the use of tariffs. Their decision , delivered late Wednesday, supported several lawsuits claiming Trump had exceeded his authority. The White House appealed, but it was not clear whether the administration would freeze the contested tariffs while that process played out. Many of the tariffs have already been on hold for as long as 90 days during trade talks. The news set off a rally in futures. Contracts for the S&P 500 jumped 1.6%, while those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%. Overnight in New York, major indexes had eased before the ruling. The S&P 500 had slipped 0.6% to 5,888.55, leaving it 4.2% shy of its record. Last month, the benchmark had been roughly 20% below that mark during a sharp pullback. The Dow industrials had fallen 0.6% to 42,098.70, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.5% to 19,100.94. Asian markets surged after the tariff ruling Markets across Asia followed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 leaped 1.63% to 38,336.99. Tokyo has been urging Washington to scrap higher duties on Japanese goods and 25% levies on steel, aluminum, and autos. Japan’s Nikkei 225.

South Korea’s Kospi climbed 1.78% to 2,717.65 after the Bank of Korea cut its policy rate to 2.5% from 2.75%. Officials said the move was meant to ease pressure on growth in an export-heavy economy that relies heavily on sales to the United States. Trading was subdued as investors waited for Nvidia’s quarterly results, which were released after the close. Before the numbers came out, the chipmaker’s stock dipped 0.5%. In after-hours action, it jumped 4.9%. In bonds, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.47% from 4.43% late Tuesday. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s early-May meeting showed officials kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged for a third time. Energy prices also firmed. The U.S. benchmark crude gained 60 cents to $62.44 a barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, rose 56 cents to $64.88. In currency trading, the euro slipped to $1.1239 from $1.1292.

Elon Musk says he’s stepping back from politics to focus on the company, but that isn’t stopping long-time supporters from walking away. On Wednesday, investment adviser and Tesla whale Gary Black said he had finally sold his entire position in the company. That’s the first time since 2021 that he’s held zero Tesla shares. According to a statement he shared on X, the valuation has completely broken away from fundamentals. Gary said he sold the rest of his position at $358 per share. “We believe TSLA’s valuation has become disconnected from underlying fundamentals,” he said. His biggest concern is that Tesla’s 2025 P/E ratio has hit 188x while earnings estimates keep sliding — down 5% just last week, and already 40% down this year. The company’s deliveries are weak, especially April numbers. He said he expects second-quarter deliveries to fall by 12% year-over-year, with the full year down 10%. That’s worse than Wall Street’s own cuts of 7% and 5%, respectively. Gary also warned about the upcoming robotaxi test in Austin, calling the risk one-sided in the wrong direction. And even the supposed “affordable” car due in July doesn’t excite him — he believes it’s just a low-budget Model Y, not a new model that would actually grow Tesla’s reach. “This increases odds that FY’25 estimates decline further,” Gary said, predicting a repeat of the 2023-2024 slump when Tesla dropped prices but didn’t boost sales. He’s holding a 6-to-12-month price target of $310. That’s based on an estimate of 5.4 million vehicles in 2030, adjusted earnings of $12, and a two-times PEG ratio on future earnings growth. Discounting all that with a 14.2% cost of equity brings it back down to $310, not the $358 it’s currently trading at. Shareholders demand Elon show up and work 40 hours weekly At the same time, a group of activist shareholders sent a letter to Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm asking that Elon start working at least 40 hours a week at Tesla. The letter, signed by SOC Investment Group and other smaller investors, came as a response to what they call a growing crisis inside the company. Together, these shareholders control about 7.9 million shares — a small slice of Tesla’s 3.22 billion total — but they’re making a lot of noise. The shareholders called out Elon’s year-long focus on politics, especially his role leading the US DOGE Service under President Trump, which they blame for the company’s battered image and plunging sales. Tesla’s latest earnings call revealed a 71% fall in profit and a 13% dip in sales compared to the same time last year. The letter called the situation “a crisis,” saying the board has failed to act in the best interests of shareholders. “Tesla’s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company’s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,” it said. They didn’t stop at just wanting Elon to show up more. The letter also demanded a real succession plan, a rule limiting outside board commitments, and a requirement to appoint a new board member who has no personal ties to anyone already there. The board has long faced criticism for being too cozy with Elon. That got legal attention too. A Delaware judge struck down a $56 billion pay package for Elon in December 2024, citing his tight relationships with board members — including his brother. That legal fight started in 2018 when a shareholder who owned just nine shares filed the case. Some of the same shareholders behind Wednesday’s letter were also involved last year in a campaign against Elon’s 2018 pay package. Back then, they warned that Elon was stretched too thin. They’re still saying it now: “The Board continues to allow Elon to be overcommitted, not demanding that he devote his attention to his role as CEO and ‘Technoking’ of Tesla.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-29 03:33:36

The crypto market remained unscathed, despite the stock drops among crypto miners. Uncertainty about the economic outlook looms The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on May 6 and 7, released on May 28, stated, “the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken.” The Fed had decided after its meetings in early May to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, with the minutes revealing the reason was due to “a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation.” Riot Platforms (RIOT) closed the May 28 trading day down 8.32%, CleanSpark (CLSK) tumbled 7.61%, and Mara Holdings closed down 9.61%, according to Google Finance data. MARA Holdings bounced back 2.56% in after-hours trading.

The S&P 500 declined 0.56% over the trading day. Tension between Trump and the Fed It comes after recent tension between US President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve, following Trump’s public criticism of the Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. On April 17, Trump said, “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Related: Bitcoin sags below $108K as rate-cut bets evaporate before Fed minutes The crypto market remained relatively stable over the same period.

Bitcoin demonstrates resilience, with improved on-chain capital structure and a steady rise in risk appetite. High-beta assets and quality altcoins are drawing increasing attention, signaling an emerging rotation trend. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research explores the evolving potential and structural value of crypto credit and InfoFi as key sectors in this next phase. Structural Shift Under Macro Support: Bitcoin Holds Firm as Altseason Builds Momentum As of May 21, 2025, the Federal Reserve’s net liquidity has rebounded to 6,022.869, recovering strongly from its early-May low. Although it has not yet reached the key range of 6,100–6,200, this trend signals an initial return of liquidity, providing macro-level support for the crypto market. Despite last week’s long-bond auctions disappointing on both sides of the Pacific—with the U.S. 20-year yield pushed above 5 %, and Japan’s long-end rates setting 25-year highs—stoking global liquidity-squeeze fears, the impact is somewhat mitigated. The U.S. Treasury is primarily absorbing cash mainly via 3- to 6-month T-Bills, which tends to drain money-market funds rather than risk assets. Furthermore, the Fed retains the ability to pause quantitative tightening (QT) or open its repo facilities at will, capping potential spillover effects. Bitcoin has held firm. Spot ETFs continue to post modest daily inflows, over 70 % of Bitcoin supply has remained dormant for six months or more, exchange balances are falling, and Asian/Middle-East buyers continue to buy dips. Even if net Treasury issuance jumps to roughly $1.25 trillion in Q3, short-dated supply and repo backstops dilute the drag on high-beta assets, while ETF passive holdings and “hard hands” diffuse selling pressure; a weaker-dollar narrative adds further support. On-chain data shows that public chains like Solana and Base are seeing sustained increases in activity, with capital gradually shifting from BTC-dominated safe-haven assets to high-beta altcoins. BTC Dominance remains elevated and has not yet experienced a significant pullback, but if it drops below 52% in the coming sessions, coupled with further liquidity expansion, a new altcoin season could kick off. Analysis on Trending Sectors Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto Credit: Maple Becomes the Institutional Capital Gateway Cantor Fitzgerald has launched a Bitcoin-collateralized credit program with a total size of $2 billion. signaling Wall Street’s formal and large-scale entry into the crypto credit market. Initial recipients of this facility include crypto broker FalconX and the decentralized lending protocol Maple Finance. FalconX has already drawn over $100 million under this framework, and Maple Finance has completed its first loan issuance through the program. The $SYRUP token , associated with Maple Finance, is available on HTX through spot trading, perpetual futures, and earn products. Since its spot listing, $SYRUP has surged by 110%, with strong performance also seen in derivatives—underscoring growing market recognition and investor confidence in the project. Maple’s newly launched syrupUSDC/USDT perpetual institutional credit pool offers 8–12% annual yields with high collateral transparency, rapidly attracting large volumes of idle institutional stablecoins. This month, the TVL surged from $800 million to $1.3 billion—markets are “voting with their feet,” fully validating the appeal and growth potential of the SYRUP model. InfoFi Rising Star: $COOKIE Poised to Trigger the Next Revaluation Cycle Based on current on-chain trends and macro liquidity data, $COOKIE is expected to be on the verge of explosive growth within the InfoFi sector. Compared to similarly positioned projects like Kaito, CookieDotFun’s current market cap is just one-fifth. Once the Cookie leaderboard, ad slot bidding, and other InfoFi monetization mechanisms go live, $COOKIE’ valuation ceiling could be lifted. HTX has launched COOKIE/USDT perpetual futures , while KAITO —previously featured in the HTX DeepThink column—has also been listed on HTX , with a remarkable 138% gain over the past 30 days. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

Bilal bin Saqib , head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, revealed the initiative at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. While addressing a packed audience, Saqib credited the US for leading the way. “Today is a very historic day,” he said. “I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. And we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them.” Today, rewrites history. At Bitcoin 2025 Vegas, Minister of Crypto and Blockchain @bilalbinsaqib announces that Pakistan will be setting up its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/1vNjryqimf — Pakistan Crypto Council (@cryptocouncilpk) May 29, 2025 The announcement did not include details on how the reserve would be funded. It also did not specify how much Bitcoin would be held. However, Saqib made it clear that the holdings are not meant for speculation. “We will be holding these Bitcoins and we will never, ever sell them,” he said. Pakistan Reverses Course on Crypto as Global Momentum Builds Just two years ago, Pakistan’s finance ministry declared that cryptocurrencies would never be legalized. Since then, global attitudes toward digital assets have shifted. As a result, that position has softened considerably in 2025. Countries including the US, under President Donald Trump, have moved to embrace blockchain, influencing Pakistan’s change in stance. Now, Pakistan’s pivot is part of a broader national strategy. Notably, the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council earlier this year marked a major step in building out the country’s crypto infrastructure. Led by Saqib and advised by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , the council aims to drive blockchain innovation and expand the use of stablecoins and decentralized finance within Pakistan’s financial systems. WLF Agreement, Federal Budget Plans Show Pakistan’s Crypto Focus In April, Pakistan signed a Letter of Intent with US-based World Liberty Financial . The crypto firm is backed by financial interests linked to former US President Donald Trump’s family. The agreement outlines collaboration on asset tokenization, stablecoin development and DeFi regulatory frameworks. It followed high-level meetings with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Army Chief General Asim Munir and senior WLF executives. Further, the government has also committed 2,000 megawatts of power for crypto mining and AI infrastructure. This move is expected to support large-scale digital operations. In addition, a legal framework for digital asset regulation is currently being developed. It is likely to be introduced in the upcoming federal budget. Taken together, these efforts reflect a strategic national push. With 25m active crypto users and an annual transaction volume of $300b, according to Chainalysis, Pakistan is working to establish itself as a credible player in the global crypto landscape.

However, this rally is missing a crucial element that has historically fuelled sustained bull markets – retail investor participation. Bitcoin Rally Low On Retail Interest According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, retail activity during the current BTC rally is notably subdued. This is unusual, as fresh ATHs typically draw significant attention from smaller investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The analyst shared the following chart highlighting this trend. It shows that BTC transfer volume in the $0 to $10,000 range – a proxy for retail demand – has only seen a slight uptick, even as prices surge. While Bitcoin’s price has been climbing steadily (white line), the 30-day percentage change in retail demand (green line) has remained largely flat. This indicates that the current momentum is likely driven by institutional investors, with retail participants yet to join in meaningfully. Recent developments support this view. For instance, institutional heavyweight Strategy continues to increase its BTC holdings, now closing in on the 600,000 BTC mark. Historical patterns – particularly from the 2020–2021 bull run – suggest that while institutional accumulation often kicks off a rally, retail investors are typically the fuel that propels it to sustained highs. Without significant retail volume, the current rally may lose steam. Concluding, the CryptoQuant analyst stated that for BTC to continue its price expansion, a clear uptick in retail participation is necessary. They added: We’re seeing early signs of movement, but it’s not yet a breakout. If retail volume kicks in over the next few weeks, new ATHs may just be the beginning. Predicting BTC’s Next Move Recent flows from crypto exchanges show that BTC reserves are dwindling at a fast pace. For instance, US-based exchange Coinbase recently saw a new outflow of 7,883 BTC, raising speculations of institutions loading up on the apex digital asset before its next leg up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Elevated Unrealized Profits Without Signs Of Panic Selling – New ATH Soon? Similarly, technicals point toward BTC hitting another ATH soon. The top cryptocurrency by market cap recently broke out of a double bottom pattern on the hourly chart, fuelling hopes of a surge toward the $112,000 mark. Meanwhile, whale behavior has been mixed. While short-term whales have taken profits, long-term holders remain steadfast, showing minimal signs of selling. That said, BTC’s medium-term outlook remains overwhelmingly positive, with some researchers predicting a $200,000 price target by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $108,802, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

The agreement is pending approval by the IMF’s Executive Board and is dependent on the implementation of agreed-upon conditions. Progress and Fiscal Reforms According to a joint statement from IMF officials Rodrigo Cubeddu and Luis Torres, El Salvador’s early performance under the program has been strong. The country has met key fiscal and reserve targets while steadily advancing governance and financial resilience reforms. “The authorities have made significant progress in implementing their economic reform plan under the IMF-supported program. Most program targets set for the first review were comfortably met, and implementation of the structural benchmarks is progressing well,” said the officials. They added that the nation’s economy continued to expand, supported by investor confidence and resilient remittance inflows. The statement also emphasized the importance of maintaining momentum on fiscal consolidation and structural changes to address macroeconomic imbalances and support sustainable growth. Under the deal, El Salvador will continue its fiscal tightening measures. These include cuts to the public wage bill, restrained current spending, and upcoming civil service and pension system updates. The efforts will be supported by the upcoming Fiscal Sustainability Law, with the government also planning to increase deposits at the country’s central bank to boost external reserves. IMF Doubles Down on Bitcoin Stance Despite the progress, the IMF reiterated its concerns about El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. It stated that efforts were being made to ensure the government does not add to its BTC holdings. “On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the statement read. Additionally, steps are underway to phase out public sector involvement in the Chivo wallet by the end of July. In December 2024, the two parties struck a $1.4 billion deal that included conditions to limit the nation’s crypto-related activities. The deal required BTC’s acceptance in El Salvador’s private sector to remain voluntary and restricted public sector involvement in related transactions. These conditions were later integrated into national policy through amendments to the Bitcoin Law approved by El Salvador’s Congress. The IMF Executive Board then approved the financing deal in February 2025, allowing an initial disbursement of $120 million, subject to approval. Despite the required limitations on crypto engagement, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office has continued its strategy of buying one BTC per day. As of May 28, 2025, the country holds approximately 6,190 BTC, valued at around $675 million. President Nayib Bukele has also publicly stated that cryptocurrency remains a central part of his vision for the nation.

In a May 28 Bloomberg TV interview , Behnam sided with the crypto industry on its long-standing argument that cryptocurrencies are commodities. “If you look at existing law, the few largest tokens are commodities, which means the SEC does not have jurisdiction over those tokens, which include Bitcoin and Ether,” he said. He added that the Securities and Exchange Commission currently cannot properly regulate crypto because its law doesn’t allow it to regulate commodities, and the CFTC cannot regulate because it is a derivatives regulator. Without new authority for the CFTC to regulate “cash markets in digital assets, non-securities,” this will remain an unregulated space, he claimed. Rostin Behnam on Bloomberg TV. Source: Bloomberg Behnam comments amid increasing scrutiny of the Trump family’s crypto ventures, which include the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, memecoins and a stablecoin. On May 28, American political strategist and political commentator Sanders Townsend said Donald Trump is boosting his family’s investments in cryptocurrency and “is using the presidency to do it.” The administration’s involvement in the regulatory process and legislative effort is “raising red flags” among some members of Congress, and there are “well-baked rules” for any elected or appointed government official that need to be complied with, he said. “Ultimately, until we do something, the [crypto] market will remain unregulated. Customers, investors, retail and institutional, will be more vulnerable to harm, fraud, manipulation and conflicts of interest, until the market is regulated.” Regulation critical to financial markets, says Behnam Behnam also weighed in on Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, backing up the need for crypto regulations. Related: Trump’s use of presidential seal at memecoin event raises legal questions Vance said in a speech at the event that “we reject regulators” and that crypto “has a champion” in the White House. “Regulators are extremely important,” Behnam said. “They’re the reason American markets are the most desired in the world.” “Consumer protections and enforcement of the law are extremely critical to the health of our financial markets,” he added.

The token is displaying signs of consolidation and is has ranged between $2.24 and $2.47 in the past seven days. The trading volume for XRP ( XRP ) reached $2.16 billion, up 6% in the past 24 hours. Derivatives data from Coinglass shows a 20.2% spike in volume to $3.95 billion, while open interest dropped 0.95% to $4.78 billion, indicating mixed sentiment among leveraged traders. The latest price action follows a major announcement from Nasdaq-listed energy firm VivoPower. On Wednesday, May 28, the company announced it had raised $121 million in a private share offering led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud. VivoPower says it will use most of the proceeds to establish an XRP-focused treasury reserve, making it the first publicly traded firm to adopt such a strategy. The offering involved 20 million shares sold at $6.05 each, slightly above the stock’s previous closing price.

The move drew praise from XRP insiders, including former Ripple board member Adam Traidman, who has joined VivoPower as Chairman of the Board of Advisors. “We are honored to be leading this capital raising for a company that will be the first in the world to execute an XRP-focused treasury strategy,” said Prince Abdulaziz. Kevin Chin, VivoPower’s Executive Chairman, emphasized a shared long-term vision with the XRP community. Despite the announcement, the token failed to pick up steam. XRP’s technical indicators suggest a short-term neutral-to-bearish bias. Now in neutral territory and lacking any clear momentum, the relative strength index stands at 46. The moving average convergence divergence has also turned slightly bearish. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The majority of moving averages are flashing sell signals, particularly the 10–30 EMAs and SMAs. The longer-term averages, such as the 100- and 200-day SMAs, remain above the current price levels, indicating that the bullish sentiment hasn’t entirely subsided. If XRP can recover the $2.40 resistance level with more volume, it might retest the upper end of its weekly range at $2.47 and possibly break higher in a bullish scenario. In the short term, a push above that might pave the way toward $2.60. However, XRP may return to the $2.10 support level if selling pressure increases and the price falls below $2.24.

According to a White House official, Musk’s exit process, known as “off-boarding,” began on Wednesday night. He served as a special government employee with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for about 130 days. No Formal Goodbye, Sudden Exit Musk didn’t have a direct conversation with President Trump before leaving. His departure was decided by senior staff, not through a formal process. The exit came shortly after Musk criticized Trump’s latest tax and budget bill, calling it too expensive and harmful to DOGE’s efforts to cut government costs. Musk Bids Farewell on X On Wednesday, Musk took to X to mark his exit, writing: “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” Bold Vision, Mixed Results Musk led aggressive staff cuts across federal agencies and advocated for zero tariffs with Europe, sparking clashes with cabinet members, including calling trade adviser Peter Navarro a “moron.” While his efforts didn’t deliver the sweeping savings he promised, the administration claims that DOGE reduced the federal civilian workforce by 12%, approximately 260,000 jobs, through layoffs and early retirements. On the other hand, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna expressed frustration over Congress’s inaction, saying lawmakers lack urgency and vision despite the hard fight to bring Trump back to office. She criticized the failure to secure DOGE spending cuts, an issue debated for years, calling it “embarrassing” and urging real results over political showmanship. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk Turns Against Trump Over Budget Blowout, Says It Undermines DOGE , Politics, Criticism, and Tesla Pressure Musk’s political role drew criticism from some investors who want him to refocus on Tesla amid falling sales and share prices. After spending nearly $300 million supporting Trump and GOP campaigns last year, Musk recently said he plans to scale back political donations: “I think I’ve done enough,” he remarked at a forum in Qatar. DOGE to Continue Without Musk Despite Musk’s departure, the White House says DOGE will press on. Musk echoed that sentiment in his farewell, saying the mission will “only strengthen over time.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The decision date is now pushed from May 29 to July 13, and the final deadline for the ruling is on October 22, 2025. JUST IN: The SEC has delayed the Cardano $ADA ETF decision to a later date. https://t.co/DFftBwtodG — TapTools (@TapTools) May 28, 2025 Cardano slipped 4% and AVAX dropped over 2% after the news. A favorable decision was expected to push ADA past the $0.80 mark. However, the delay could now negatively impact the price. The MACD and short-term averages indicate selling pressure, but the long-term outlook is still positive for ADA. Traders on Polymarket are still positive, as it shows a 67% chance of a Cardano ETF approval by the year-end. The community is not surprised, as some see these setbacks as buying opportunities. They say that the regulators may slow the process, but they cannot stop the technology or the believers who keep accumulating. Grayscale filed for the Cardano Trust listing with NYSE Arca in February 2025, then updated the proposal for public feedback. The SEC had 45 days to decide, but pushed the deadline from April 14 to May 29, and now it’s delayed again. However, Cardano is back on eToro’s trading platform as it joined 12 other cryptocurrencies. This comes after eToro paid a $1.5 million fine to the SEC, settling issues that caused ADA to be delisted in 2021. SEC Keeps Delaying ETFs The agency is currently on a streak of delaying spot crypto ETFs, which has cooled off investor sentiment. The CoinShares spot XRP ETF is the latest to face a setback.

Analysts believe Cardano is showing signs of entering a major bullish phase, fueled by its integration with Bitcoin Ordinals and emerging as a Bitcoin DeFi layer. Key catalysts include the upcoming Midnight airdrop and the recent Leos upgrade, which boosts Cardano’s speed and scalability.

Musk’s status as a Special Government Employee leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) meant that by law, he could only serve for a maximum of 130 days, which was set to finish on May 30. Musk confirmed his exit in a May 29 X post, thanking President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.” Reuters reported that a White House official said his “off-boarding will begin tonight.” Musk told The Washington Post for a May 27 report that the “federal bureaucracy situation is much worse” than he expected, and it was “an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.” In separate comments to CBS, Musk criticized the multi-trillion-dollar tax break package that House Republicans approved on May 22, claiming it would increase the budget deficit and undermine the work that DOGE is doing. DOGE, which is named after the cryptocurrency, claims to have saved taxpayers $175 billion since Trump’s Jan. 20 return to the White House, a figure heavily disputed by multiple news outlets, which report the figures are overstated, have multiple errors and are inaccurate. The project’s claimed savings are only 8.5% of Musk’s initial ambition to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, which he later revised down to $150 billion. According to the Reuters report, DOGE has cut almost 12%, or 260,000, of the 2.3 million federal workforce through layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers. Despite the criticisms, Musk said on X that DOGE’s mission will “only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” Source: Elon Musk It comes as a federal judge allowed a lawsuit to proceed that accuses Musk and DOGE of illegally exerting power over government operations. The lawsuit, filed by 14 states, alleged that Musk and DOGE violated the Constitution by illegally accessing government data systems, terminating federal employees and canceling contracts at federal agencies. Musk admits he spent too much time in politics In a May 28 interview with Ars Technica, Musk, the CEO of EV maker Tesla, admitted that he spent “a bit too much time” in politics, which some critics claim has impacted Tesla’s performance . “I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics,” Musk said. However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement. “It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.” When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income. As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin ( BTC ), currently valued at about $1.24 billion. Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launch Tesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter. However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.

On Wednesday, Trump filed an appeal against the ruling, arguing that his actions aim to address what he called a national emergency. The court said it does not acknowledge the effectiveness of Trump’s use of tariffs as leverage, claiming it was impermissible because federal law doesn’t allow it. The verdict marked a significant setback to the Republican leader as he sought to revise the U.S. trading relationship with the world by forcing governments to the negotiating table through tough tariffs.

Trump’s spokesman, Kush Desai, noted that the President pledged to put America first, and the administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address the crisis and restore American greatness. Desai’s remarks did not mention any legal challenges, although reports indicated that Trump had already filed a notice of appeal on Wednesday. One of the President’s aides, Stephen Miller, took to social media to condemn what he called a judicial coup that he believed was out of control. The Justice Department has defended Trump’s trade strategy in court, arguing that the judiciary has very limited authority over his actions. The department also condemned the court’s claim that the White House was attempting to take over the power of the other branches of government. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on April 2 on most trading partners, adding a baseline of 10% with steeper duties on several economies, including China and the European Union. Global markets plummeted but calmed after he paused the larger tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations. The court’s verdict also canceled levies that Trump imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China separately using emergency powers. The U.S. President acknowledged that Americans will reap the benefits of his “America First” trade posture, pointing to early successes in deals struck with Britain and China. The US Treasury Secretary mentioned on Friday that the lower 10% baseline tariff rate was contingent on countries or trading blocs that negotiated in good faith.

The BlackRock fund saw another large inflow day on May 28 with $481 million entering the ETF. This has culminated in 33 consecutive trading days without an outflow, the last of which was on April 9. Another nearly *$500mil* into iShares Bitcoin ETF… Starting to get ridiculous. Inflows 30 of past 31 days. Nearly $9.5bil in new $$$. IBIT comfortably in top 5 ETFs by inflows this year (out of 4,200+ ETFs). — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 29, 2025 Institutional Bitcoin Consumption IBIT is comfortably in the top 5 ETFs by inflows this year out of more than 4,200 funds, observed Geraci. Additionally, IBIT has seen $3.86 billion in inflows over the past fortnight, with a daily average of $430 million. In total, the fund has seen $48.8 billion in inflows since it launched in January 2024. It holds $71 billion in assets under management, which is equivalent to around 650,000 BTC. BlackRock was the only Bitcoin ETF to see an inflow on Wednesday, with Fidelity and Ark 21Shares outflowing $14 million and $34.3 million, respectively, according to Farside Investors. IBIT has been on fire lately, now has $72 billion in assets, which ranks it 23rd overall, “absolutely bonkers for a one-year-old,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The big BlackRock figures emphasize the sentiment that this rally is institutionally driven, as large corporations are also adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, the latest being GameStop , and retail appears to be absent . Balchunas opined that it feels like it’s inevitable that a “Big Boy US company” adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet soon. “Could definitely see Meta being the one to break the ice,” he added. “If a Meta or Microsoft adds BTC to its balance sheet, it will arguably have a bigger impact than all the smaller companies doing it, kinda like when Tom Hanks got COVID, everyone was like ‘oh shit Tom Hanks got it’ which made it feel real even tho the cases had already been mounting.” Crypto Market Outlook Spot markets have dipped 2% on the day, with total capitalization falling to $3.55 trillion. The fall has been led by Bitcoin, which failed to reclaim $108,000 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session and dipped 1% on the day. Ethereum was moving in the opposite direction, adding 4% on the day to top $2,750 at the time of writing, while most of the altcoins were flat.

In the United States, the Labor Department officially reversed its 2022 guidance discouraging crypto assets in 401(k) retirement plans, restoring fiduciary discretion for plan managers. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) opened a public consultation on proposed rules for stablecoins and crypto custody, aiming to support innovation while reinforcing market trust and consumer protection. US Labor Department Rescinds Biden-Era Crypto Retirement Investment Limits in Major Shift The US Department of Labor has formally rescinded a 2022 guidance that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, signaling a major pivot in federal retirement investment policy and reflecting a broader pro-crypto shift under the Trump administration. The announcement, made on May 28, revokes a controversial compliance bulletin that had urged fiduciaries to “exercise extreme care” when considering digital assets for retirement offerings. At the time, the Biden-era agency cited volatility, valuation uncertainty, and security risks as key reasons for opposing crypto exposure in employer-sponsored plans. But the current Labor Department, under Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, has now reversed that stance, calling the 2022 guidance an “overreach” and a break from the agency’s historically neutral approach to fiduciary responsibilities. The move is being framed as a return to a “principled-based” framework, in which plan managers, rather than federal regulators, assess whether digital assets are suitable for long-term retirement strategies. Chavez-DeRemer emphasized that fiduciaries are in the best position to weigh the merits and risks of cryptocurrencies based on the unique needs of plan participants, as opposed to receiving top-down prohibitive mandates from Washington. This change effectively grants retirement plan providers more discretion to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets in 401(k) offerings, potentially opening the door to broader mainstream adoption among long-term savers. The American Banking Association (ABA), which had previously criticized the 2022 guidance for being issued without public review or comment, applauded the rollback. The ABA argued that the prior administration’s action amounted to de facto rulemaking without transparency or due process. Backstory: A Cautious Past The original guidance issued in March 2022 by the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) was widely viewed as a chilling message to retirement providers. The memo warned that cryptocurrencies were speculative, volatile, and susceptible to fraud, and that offering them in 401(k) plans could place fiduciaries at legal risk under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). It also coincided with high-profile crypto market collapses, including the TerraUSD meltdown and the eventual implosion of FTX, which reinforced skepticism among regulators and the public. Several asset managers, including Fidelity Investments, pushed back against the guidance at the time, insisting that digital assets offered a valid diversification strategy, particularly for younger investors. Fidelity, one of the few major financial institutions to defy the Biden-era resistance, launched its Digital Assets Account (DAA) for 401(k)s in 2022, allowing plan sponsors to offer Bitcoin exposure to their employees. The investment giant structured the product with robust compliance measures and minimal fees, arguing that retirement savers deserved optional access to emerging asset classes. Fidelity’s pioneering effort sparked debate about whether mainstream investors should have crypto exposure in their retirement portfolios—debate that is likely to intensify in the wake of the Labor Department’s new stance. Broader Crypto Policy Under Trump The Labor Department's reversal is part of a larger trend under President Donald Trump’s current administration, which has adopted a decisively pro-crypto posture. Trump has pledged to make the US “the world capital of crypto,” and federal agencies have taken steps to dial back regulatory crackdowns on high-profile crypto platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap. Simultaneously, the administration has launched exploratory frameworks for tokenizing real-world assets ( RWAs ), such as bonds and commodities, and for defining clearer rules around digital asset classifications—efforts praised by many in the blockchain industry. Despite these advances, some lawmakers remain wary of the Trump administration’s close alignment with the crypto industry, citing the need for guardrails to prevent systemic risks and ensure retail investor protection. Critics have also called for more transparency regarding Trump's own business interests in the sector. The Labor Department's updated position does not constitute a blanket endorsement of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. Rather, it shifts the responsibility and liability back to fiduciaries, who must still uphold their duty to act in the best interests of plan participants. Industry analysts expect many asset managers to proceed cautiously, balancing client demand with evolving legal and regulatory standards. Nevertheless, the reversal may pave the way for a surge in crypto retirement product development, including new portfolio options, managed funds, and potentially tokenized pension models in the coming years. UK’s FCA Unveils Draft Rules for Stablecoins and Crypto Custody, Opens Door to Public Feedback Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has taken another critical step toward formalizing its cryptocurrency regulatory framework. On May 28, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a consultation paper requesting public feedback on proposed regulations for stablecoins and crypto custody services. The initiative marks what the FCA described as a “milestone on the road to crypto regulation” as the UK pushes forward with plans to become a global leader in responsible digital asset innovation. The proposals aim to provide a robust and secure environment for crypto users and investors, while preserving the flexibility necessary for continued technological growth in the fintech space. The consultation will remain open in the coming weeks, inviting perspectives from both industry stakeholders and the general public. David Geale, Executive Director of Payments and Digital Finance at the FCA, emphasized the regulator’s dual commitment to innovation and integrity. “At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets,” Geale said. “At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.” The new proposals reflect extensive input from roundtable discussions, industry consultations, and the broader global movement toward regulated digital assets. The FCA acknowledged that while crypto has become increasingly integrated into the UK’s financial ecosystem, the lack of clear rules has left investors vulnerable and market participants operating in a legal grey area. One of the FCA’s core objectives is to ensure that regulated stablecoins maintain their promised peg to a fiat currency, such as the British pound or US dollar. Under the proposed rules, issuers of qualifying stablecoins would be legally obligated to honor 1:1 redemption rights at par value, regardless of the fluctuating value of backing asset portfolios. “We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency,” the FCA wrote, “with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.” To reinforce consumer protections, stablecoin issuers would be required to appoint independent, third-party custodians to safeguard their reserve assets. Issuers must also disclose clear and accessible information about the structure and quality of the asset backing. This push for transparency comes amid growing global scrutiny over stablecoin reserve practices, especially after the collapse of poorly backed stablecoins like TerraUSD in 2022 triggered industry-wide contagion. Coordination with the Bank of England The FCA is working in tandem with the Bank of England (BoE) to construct a comprehensive framework for stablecoins, especially those that could operate at systemic scale. Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the BoE, confirmed that the central bank will release a complementary consultation paper later this year. In a separate discussion paper, the FCA introduced sweeping new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services. These proposals are designed to bolster investor confidence by ensuring that crypto assets are held securely and remain readily accessible at all times. Custodians will be expected to follow strict internal controls, implement high-security measures, and maintain transparent procedures for asset segregation, incident reporting, and recovery mechanisms. The proposed rules also seek to reduce both the likelihood and impact of institutional failure, in direct response to previous collapses such as Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX, where customers faced prolonged access delays or complete loss of assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-29 05:30:00

Citing official documentation and statements from French authorities, the tweet states: “Remember, the Bank of France ‘prefers’ the features of XRP to issue Europe’s Central Bank Digital Currency. Documented.” The documentation in question includes a report from Piper Alderman referencing a publication by CPA Australia, which states that France has “openly discussed Ripple/XRP as a possible platform to Europe’s central digital currency.” The report underscores the appeal of XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) due to its highly centralised architecture and permissioned network capabilities. These characteristics stand in contrast to open, public blockchain networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which, while decentralised, are less suitable for central banking requirements concerning transaction privacy, speed, and regulatory control. Remember, the Bank of France “prefers” the features of XRP to issue Europe’s Central Bank Digital Currency. Documented. https://t.co/DDvBlO58Cb pic.twitter.com/BX1HKzAkvg — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 28, 2025 XRP Ledger Highlighted for Its Permissioned Network and Centralised Design The XRP Ledger’s design offers a compelling framework for central banks, allowing only authorised validators to confirm transactions. This model enables a high level of control and compliance, which are essential for the issuance and management of digital currencies by state monetary authorities. According to the CPA Australia report, this configuration has earned XRP the trust of many banks that consider it a viable technological foundation for CBDCs. Ripple’s proposal, as highlighted in the Piper Alderman document, showcases how the XRP Ledger can meet critical requirements for speed and security that are not attainable with fully decentralised public networks. The same report adds that while some blockchain technologies may not align with CBDC goals, configurations like XRPL can still meet the high standards required for official monetary systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bank of France Emphasises Need for Secure Settlement Assets Further supporting this position is a recent speech delivered by Denis Beau, the First Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, at the Fintech R:Evolution summit in Paris on May 21, 2025. The speech, officially published by the Bank for International Settlements, outlines three pillars for developing the European financial ecosystem, one of which is the tokenisation of finance. Beau confirmed that the lack of a secure settlement asset is currently impeding tokenized finance in Europe. In response, he stated that the Eurosystem has committed to providing a wholesale CBDC by 2026 to meet this need. The Bank of France has identified that integrating such a secure asset is crucial not only for domestic financial stability but also for ensuring Europe’s monetary sovereignty. In this context, the suitability of platforms like the XRP Ledger becomes especially relevant. As the documentation notes, Ripple’s proposal demonstrates how certain configurations of blockchain technology can satisfy the security, efficiency, and scalability requirements for CBDC implementation. France Positions Itself as a Leader in European CBDC Development Denis Beau also emphasized the importance of harmonized regulatory frameworks such as MiCA and the Pilot Regime in facilitating the growth of tokenized assets across Europe. He pointed out that despite progress, significant obstacles remain, particularly the need for central bank-backed infrastructure to enable safe and scalable blockchain-based financial systems. The formal inclusion of market representatives in discussions about regulatory implementation and technological deployment signals a coordinated effort by French and European financial authorities to shape the digital economy. Beau concluded his speech by stating his conviction that the French ecosystem has strong potential in developing high-value-added CBDC use cases. XRP Features Align with Eurozone’s Digital Currency Vision Taken together, the statements from the Bank of France, the referenced CPA Australia report, and the documentation shared by SMQKE converge on a central message: the features of the XRP Ledger align closely with the operational demands of a European CBDC. While no final platform has been officially designated, XRP’s architecture remains under active consideration by key monetary authorities in Europe.

Which Is The Best Pick For Maximum Gains?",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/litecoin-ripple-solana-tron-bitcoin-dogecoin-or-mantix-which-is-best-pick/,"The post Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, Bitcoin, Dogecoin Or Mantix? Which Is The Best Pick For Maximum Gains? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Top investors looking for the best cryptos to buy in 2025 are paying attention to Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Mantix. Hedge Fund managers are making big moves into crypto and with crypto presales powered by AI craze gaining traction in 2025, now may be the last chance to get positioned for immense returns. In the broader market, Bitcoin continues to break through to new highs dragging along other top altcoins. Most altcoins are showing positive signals and Mantix has led the way by raising $600,000 in its presale in just weeks. Let’s look at some of the most popular assets and explain why Mantix is set to rise 100x shortly. Litecoin slumps amidst waning interest Litecoin has had it rough with the LTC price falling by 2.1% in the past 24 hours to $95.65 , due to general market pressures and a negative technical forecast. The SEC postponed its decisions on spot Litecoin ETFs from Canary Capital and Grayscale, now planning to decide in late 2025. This lowered the earlier odds of Litecoin’s ETF approval on Polymarket from 90% to 76% as of today. Yet, people remain optimistic, with analysts aiming for a push to $120 by Q3. Litecoin still remains a good choice for conservative traders. Current Litecoin price action suggests LTC will continue its slow grind higher, especially if Bitcoin keeps building momentum. Legal clarity improves Ripple price outlook With Ripple’s legal win versus the SEC, XRP is once again attracting massive investor interest. The price is now trading around $2.34, up 6% in the past month and consolidating after an unprecedented March surge. Market analysts have adjusted their Ripple price predictions, with the new target being a move towards $3.20 if the overall market sentiment heralded by Bitcoin’s surge above ATH remains positive. Ripple’s cross-border payment technology is already being implemented by a number of central banks, and if ETFs pegged to XRP are greenlighted later this year, prices could take off leaving Ripple as a formidable contender in 2025’s list of best crypto to buy. Solana and Tron are making their networks more stable by minting USDT. Both Solana and Tron are making a name for themselves as reliable and fast blockchains, with similar goals in scalability, affordable transactions and a strong DeFi sector. Solana and Tron rely on hybrid consensus methods PoH, PoS and DPoS respectively to handle thousands of transactions at once, making them suitable for stablecoin use. Since January 2025, Tether’s USDT has been minted in large amounts on both Tron ($3 billion) and Solana ($7.75 billion in USDC, a USDT rival), according to Spot On Chain data. The mints make trading and using DeFi smooth, since Tron’s fixed $1 fee and Solana’s very low fees guarantee cost savings. Analysts expect Solana to increase to $290-$364 by late 2025 and Tron’s strong use cases could see it reach $0.40 if stablecoin adoption and Tron’s gasless USDT transfers continue. Bitcoin and Dogecoin prove to be crypto’s steady giants; is there more upside to come? Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $109,500 after rebounding from April’s $74,000 dip, with analysts eyeing $120,000 soon and possibly $325,000 by July 2026. Top analysts from Coincodex and Standard Chartered project Bitcoin to hit $170,000–$200,000 by year-end. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has remained relevant thanks to its community loyal to its OG meme status. Many market experts believe Dogecoin is a dependable “crypto giant” that could still bring high ROI, as long as the overall crypto market keeps growing. Together, BTC and DOGE reflect crypto’s dual appeal: institutional trust and cultural relevance. Mantix is 2025’s unicorn set for explosive returns Among all the viable competitors for crypto investment in 2025, Mantix represents the highest-upside play for life-changing returns. The product is a new decentralized trading platform that combines deep liquidity, high-leverage futures of up to 1000x and zero-downtime. Mantix also offers instant buyback-and-burn mechanisms and revenue sharing for $MTX token holders, perks even top exchanges rarely offer. Mantix has come out with a new ICO currently in its first Stage. Right now, the $MTX token can be purchased for just $0.02, with more than $600,000 already invested by early believers. Unlike most of the top altcoins, Mantix is still under the mainstream radar, giving early adopters a first-mover advantage. When comparing user rewards, decentralization and token use case, Mantix is better positioned than most in the top 10 altcoins making it the best option for savvy investors looking for the best returns.

45232118,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163987,1748497151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45232118.jpeg,HTX DeepThink: Rotation Signals Emerging–Crypto Credit and InfoFi Poised as New Market Focal Points,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/htx-deepthink-rotation-signals-emerging-crypto-credit-and-infofi-poised-as-new-market-focal-points/,"BitcoinWorld HTX DeepThink: Rotation Signals Emerging–Crypto Credit and InfoFi Poised as New Market Focal Points SINGAPORE, May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — As May draws to a close, the crypto market continues its upward momentum, fueled by a renewed wave of macro liquidity. Bitcoin demonstrates resilience, with improved on-chain capital structure and a steady rise in risk appetite. High-beta assets and quality altcoins are drawing increasing attention, signaling an emerging rotation trend. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research explores the evolving potential and structural value of crypto credit and InfoFi as key sectors in this next phase. Structural Shift Under Macro Support: Bitcoin Holds Firm as Altseason Builds Momentum As of May 21, 2025, the Federal Reserve’s net liquidity has rebounded to 6,022.869, recovering strongly from its early-May low. Although it has not yet reached the key range of 6,100–6,200, this trend signals an initial return of liquidity, providing macro-level support for the crypto market. Despite last week’s long-bond auctions disappointing on both sides of the Pacific—with the U.S. 20-year yield pushed above 5 %, and Japan’s long-end rates setting 25-year highs—stoking global liquidity-squeeze fears, the impact is somewhat mitigated. The U.S. Treasury is primarily absorbing cash mainly via 3- to 6-month T-Bills, which tends to drain money-market funds rather than risk assets. Furthermore, the Fed retains the ability to pause quantitative tightening (QT) or open its repo facilities at will, capping potential spillover effects. Bitcoin has held firm. Spot ETFs continue to post modest daily inflows, over 70 % of Bitcoin supply has remained dormant for six months or more, exchange balances are falling, and Asian/Middle-East buyers continue to buy dips. Even if net Treasury issuance jumps to roughly $1.25 trillion in Q3, short-dated supply and repo backstops dilute the drag on high-beta assets, while ETF passive holdings and “hard hands” diffuse selling pressure; a weaker-dollar narrative adds further support. On-chain data shows that public chains like Solana and Base are seeing sustained increases in activity, with capital gradually shifting from BTC-dominated safe-haven assets to high-beta altcoins. BTC Dominance remains elevated and has not yet experienced a significant pullback, but if it drops below 52% in the coming sessions, coupled with further liquidity expansion, a new altcoin season could kick off. Analysis on Trending Sectors Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto Credit: Maple Becomes the Institutional Capital Gateway Cantor Fitzgerald has launched a Bitcoin-collateralized credit program with a total size of $2 billion, signaling Wall Street’s formal and large-scale entry into the crypto credit market. Initial recipients of this facility include crypto broker FalconX and the decentralized lending protocol Maple Finance. FalconX has already drawn over $100 million under this framework, and Maple Finance has completed its first loan issuance through the program. The $SYRUP token , associated with Maple Finance, is available on HTX through spot trading, perpetual futures, and earn products. Since its spot listing, $SYRUP has surged by 110%, with strong performance also seen in derivatives—underscoring growing market recognition and investor confidence in the project. Maple’s newly launched syrupUSDC/USDT perpetual institutional credit pool offers 8–12% annual yields with high collateral transparency, rapidly attracting large volumes of idle institutional stablecoins.

Despite this, the altcoin has shown resilience by closing above its 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks — a historically bullish signal. Technical Strength Builds Momentum Maintaining a price above the 50-week EMA has often preceded significant rallies for Solana. A similar move in late 2023 saw SOL climb above both its 50-week and 100-week EMAs, which led to a sharp 515% gain by March 2024. Currently, Solana’s relative strength index (RSI) sits at 52.60, suggesting moderate but growing buying interest. Fibonacci Analysis Supports Bullish Case Traders are closely watching trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions to gauge SOL’s next big move. Measured from the January high of $295 down to recent lows near $95, the immediate FIB target sits around $300 — a 70% increase from current levels. A breakout into price discovery beyond this level could spark a further rally toward the 1.618 extension at $418. Downside Risk Remains Near Key Support Levels Despite the bullish setup, Solana faces the risk of a downturn if it fails to hold its position above the 50-week EMA. In such a case, the price could fall back to its support zone between $152 and $157. Technical traders warn this level is crucial for sustaining upward momentum. Futures Market Shows High Speculative Interest Solana’s futures open interest (OI) is currently at $7.5 billion, according to CoinGlass — just $1 billion below its January 2025 high. Such elevated OI typically points to strong speculative activity and the potential for heightened volatility. While funding rates across exchanges have turned negative, indicating bearish sentiment, this also increases the likelihood of a short squeeze. Analysts See Diverging Scenarios Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General noted that rising OI, steady volume, and neutral cross-exchange funding suggest Solana may be stabilizing. This technical posture could lead to a rapid upward move if momentum builds. He believes the $300 level remains an achievable target should bullish conditions persist. Bearish Signals Not to Be Ignored However, not all market watchers are optimistic. Well-known trader Carl Moon highlighted a potential double top pattern forming on the 4-hour chart. If confirmed, this bearish signal could pull SOL down toward the $150 range in the near term. Key Resistance Defines Next Steps Ultimately, Solana’s path forward hinges on its ability to break and hold above the $180 resistance. A decisive move beyond this level would likely validate a bullish continuation, while rejection could open the door for a healthy correction.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-29 05:39:15

The U.S. Court of International Trade in Manhattan declared President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" import tariffs unlawful, ordering their permanent blockage due to an overreach of authority. The court declared the measures ""unlawful to all,"" extending beyond the five businesses that sued, and ordered the tariffs to be vacated and permanently blocked. The White House is expected to appeal the ruling. Simultaneously, the U.S. tightened export controls, largely blocking American firms from selling key technologies to China. The Bank of Korea lowered its base rate by 25 basis points to 2.50% during its May 2025 meeting, after holding rates steady in April, as expected. Gold prices fell below $3,260 per ounce on Thursday, marking a fourth straight day of decline, as reduced tariff risks eroded demand for safe-haven assets. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.68% to above 38,200 while the broader Topix Index gained 1.1% to 2,800 on Thursday, extending this week’s rally. The Japanese yen weakened toward 146 per dollar on Thursday, hitting a two-week low as easing tariff risks dampened demand for safe-haven assets. Japan’s consumer confidence index rose to 32.8 in May 2025, rebounding from April’s more than two-year low of 31.2. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.76% to above 3,350 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.9% to 10,100 on Thursday, with mainland stocks snapping a five-day decline following a US federal court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, the offshore yuan slid past 7.20 per dollar on Thursday, marking its third consecutive session of decline. In a separate move, the Trump administration instructed US firms to suspend certain semiconductor software sales to China, introducing new uncertainty into already strained Sino-US trade relations. Pharmaceutical stocks rallied, with Wuxi Biologics up 7.3%, Sino Biopharma 1.4%, and CSPC Pharma 1.3%, following reports that China will revamp its pricing and procurement credit evaluation system. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.97% to 23,360 in early Thursday trade, rebounding from the previous session’s decline. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.20% to 81,533.1 in morning trade on Thursday. On the data front, India’s industrial output grew 2.7% year-on-year in April, surpassing market expectations of a 1% rise but easing from March’s 3.9% growth, largely due to softer gains in manufacturing. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.26% to around 8,420 on Thursday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses. The Australian dollar hovered around $0.641 on Thursday, holding recent losses, as a strengthening US dollar continued to weigh on the currency. Private new capital expenditure on buildings and structures in Australia increased by 0.9% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of 2025, accelerating from 0.2% in the previous quarter. Private new capital expenditure on equipment, plant, and machinery in Australia fell by 1.3% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to March 2025. Total new capital expenditure in Australia unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2025, missing market expectations of a 0.5% expansion. In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended lower as investors weighed earnings, Fed minutes, and trade tensions ahead of Nvidia’s results. Investors also awaited Senate deliberations over Trump’s wide-ranging tax and spending package, which is likely to see significant amendments in the upper chamber. U.S. stock futures climbed on Thursday after Nvidia posted stronger-than-expected quarterly results: Dow +1.39% ; S&P 500 +1.66% ; Nasdaq +1.99% .

45232185,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=163843,1748497249,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45232185.jpeg,GameStop Bitcoin: Ryan Cohen Calls BTC a Potent Hedge Against Currency Devaluation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gamestop-bitcoin-hedge-view/,"BitcoinWorld GameStop Bitcoin: Ryan Cohen Calls BTC a Potent Hedge Against Currency Devaluation In a move that grabbed headlines across both the finance and crypto worlds, Ryan Cohen, the CEO of GameStop, recently shared a significant perspective on the role of digital assets. According to reports citing Bitcoin Magazine via X, Cohen suggested that Bitcoin has the potential to act as a powerful hedge against global currency devaluation . This statement comes after Bitcoin World previously highlighted GameStop’s own substantial investment, having acquired 4,710 BTC. Why Does Ryan Cohen See Bitcoin as a Hedge? Ryan Cohen, known for his role in turning around Chewy and his involvement in the GameStop saga, is not a traditional finance insider. His perspective often comes from a place of challenging established norms. His view that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against currency devaluation likely stems from concerns about modern monetary policy and its potential impact on the purchasing power of traditional fiat currencies. Several factors could contribute to this viewpoint: Inflationary Pressures: Central banks globally have engaged in significant quantitative easing and stimulus measures over the past decade, particularly following economic crises. This increases the money supply, potentially leading to inflation, which erodes the value of savings and earnings held in traditional currencies. Government Debt: Rising levels of national debt in many countries can raise concerns about future economic stability and the temptation for governments to inflate away debt burdens. Centralization vs. Decentralization: Fiat currencies are controlled by central authorities (governments and central banks). Their supply and policies can be manipulated. Bitcoin, in contrast, is decentralized with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, making its issuance schedule predictable and beyond the control of any single entity. From this perspective, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature offer a potential escape hatch from the risks associated with centralized control and potential inflationary policies that lead to currency devaluation . Understanding the Bitcoin Hedge Concept The idea of using Bitcoin as a hedge is not new, but it gained significant traction during periods of economic uncertainty. A hedge is an investment intended to offset potential losses from another investment. Traditionally, assets like gold, silver, and real estate have been considered hedges against inflation or economic instability. How might Bitcoin function as a hedge, particularly against currency devaluation ? Limited Supply: Unlike fiat currencies, whose supply can be increased by central banks, Bitcoin has a hard cap on the total number of coins that will ever exist. This scarcity is often compared to precious metals and is seen as a fundamental defense against inflation driven by supply expansion. Decentralization: Bitcoin’s network operates independently of any government or financial institution. This makes it resistant to censorship, seizure, and policies that might negatively impact traditional assets or currencies within a specific jurisdiction. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin is a global asset, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This contrasts with national currencies, which are tied to specific countries and their economic fortunes. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the debate surrounding Bitcoin’s effectiveness as a hedge. Its relatively short history compared to gold, and its significant price volatility, mean it doesn’t always behave like a stable store of value in the short term. While it may protect against long-term currency devaluation , holders must be prepared for substantial price swings. GameStop’s Bold GameStop Bitcoin Investment Adding weight to Ryan Cohen ‘s public statements is GameStop’s tangible action: the purchase of 4,710 BTC. This investment signals a belief within the company’s leadership that holding Bitcoin is a strategic move for their corporate treasury. Details about the exact timing and rationale behind GameStop’s purchase of 4,710 BTC are key. While specific internal discussions aren’t public, the general motivations for a company like GameStop to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet likely align with the hedge concept mentioned by Cohen, alongside other potential benefits: Treasury Diversification: Moving a portion of corporate cash reserves out of traditional low-yield, inflation-susceptible assets into a potentially high-growth, uncorrelated asset class. Protection Against Inflation/Devaluation: Directly acting on the belief that Bitcoin can preserve purchasing power better than fiat over time, especially relevant given concerns about ongoing currency devaluation . Potential for Appreciation: While framed as a hedge, the potential for significant capital gains is undoubtedly a factor for companies adopting Bitcoin. Signaling: Adopting Bitcoin can signal forward-thinking, technological savvy, and potentially attract investors interested in digital assets. GameStop’s decision, under the leadership influenced by Ryan Cohen , positions it among a growing list of publicly traded companies embracing corporate Bitcoin adoption . The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption GameStop is not alone in adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Over the past few years, there has been a notable trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption among publicly traded companies. This movement was significantly popularized by firms like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has amassed a very large Bitcoin holding. Other notable examples include: MicroStrategy: A business intelligence firm that has become one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, consistently adding to its reserves. Tesla: The electric vehicle company, led by Elon Musk, made a significant Bitcoin purchase in early 2021, though they have also sold portions of their holdings at times. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company has also invested in Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. This trend underscores a shifting perception of Bitcoin , moving from a purely speculative retail asset to one considered viable for sophisticated corporate treasury management, often driven by the very concerns about currency devaluation that Ryan Cohen highlighted. Companies engaging in corporate Bitcoin adoption are making a calculated bet that the potential benefits – protection against inflation, diversification, and long-term appreciation – outweigh the risks associated with volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Navigating the Challenges of Using Bitcoin as a Hedge While the arguments for Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation are compelling to many, it’s essential to consider the challenges and risks involved. No investment is without its downsides, and Bitcoin is no exception. Key challenges include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. While this offers potential for high returns, it also means significant drawdowns are possible, which might not align with the stability typically sought in a hedge asset. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin’s usability, legality, and market value. Security Risks: Holding Bitcoin requires secure storage solutions (wallets). Loss of private keys or security breaches can result in irreversible loss of funds. Market Manipulation Concerns: The crypto market is still relatively young and can be susceptible to large players influencing prices. These challenges mean that while Ryan Cohen and GameStop see Bitcoin as a potential hedge, it’s a strategy that requires a high tolerance for risk and a long-term perspective, acknowledging that short-term performance may not always align with traditional hedge characteristics. What Does This Mean for Investors and Businesses? Actionable Insights The statements from figures like Ryan Cohen and the actions of companies engaging in corporate Bitcoin adoption raise important questions for both individual investors and businesses considering their own financial strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Educate Yourself: Understand what Bitcoin is, how it works, and the economic principles behind the arguments for and against its use as a hedge. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and ensure it fits within your overall financial strategy. Consider Diversification: A hedge is typically part of a diversified portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore different asset classes. Evaluate Long-Term Trends: If you believe that concerns about currency devaluation are valid long-term risks, explore assets like Bitcoin or others traditionally considered hedges (like gold) that might offer protection. For Businesses: Carefully evaluate treasury management goals, risk appetite, and regulatory considerations before considering holding volatile assets like Bitcoin. Consult with financial and legal experts. The fact that a company like GameStop, influenced by Ryan Cohen , is publicly acknowledging Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge and backing it with investment is a significant data point in the ongoing evolution of how digital assets are perceived and utilized in the global economy. Summary: Bitcoin’s Growing Role in a Devaluing World Ryan Cohen’s assertion that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against global currency devaluation , coupled with GameStop’s concrete action of purchasing 4,710 BTC, highlights a growing recognition of digital assets in mainstream finance. This perspective is rooted in concerns about inflationary pressures and the stability of traditional fiat currencies in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and government debt. While the concept of Bitcoin as a hedge is debated due to its volatility, its fixed supply and decentralized nature offer characteristics appealing to those seeking alternatives to centralized currency systems. GameStop’s move is part of a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , where companies are exploring digital assets for treasury diversification and potential long-term value preservation. For both individuals and businesses, this development underscores the importance of understanding the changing financial landscape, evaluating the risks and potential benefits of assets like Bitcoin, and considering how best to navigate a world where concerns about currency devaluation are becoming increasingly prominent.

Willy Woo Highlights Risk of Profit-Taking at $110K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price has been climbing steadily , touching highs above $110,000, but on-chain analyst Willy Woo is urging caution. He warns that speculation is getting out of hand, with the market showing signs of greed, a classic setup for a short-term pullback. I have some good news and [maybe] some bad news for you. GOOD NEWS: Risk SIgnal is trending downwards, meaning over the broader environment buy-side liquidity is dominating. We are setting up for another solid run on the long time frame. pic.twitter.com/KUWNMc4HqB — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 28, 2025 Woo says that while the long-term trend still looks strong thanks to increasing buyer strength, there could be some turbulence ahead as many investors are already sitting on large profits and may soon cash out. Cycles Are Changing—The Old Rules Don’t Apply BTC is global macro this cycle. Which means don't necessarily bet on nicely manicured 4 year cycles. BTC is transitioning. Internal forces, the halvening, is getting weak, global liquidity powers BTC – hence BTC is becoming the canary in the coal mine for global macro moves. https://t.co/c56yYmn0Na — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 28, 2025 Woo explains that Bitcoin is no longer behaving like it did in past bull runs. Earlier, its four-year halving cycle had a big influence, but now, he says, the bigger force is global liquidity. That means BTC is acting more like a traditional asset, moving with global economic trends rather than its usual crypto patterns. Echoing Woo’s sentiment, crypto analyst Maui Jim believes it’s outdated to expect a predictable sell-off in September or a new bottom a year later. The market is maturing and becoming harder to predict. The fact that Bitcoin hit a new all-time high even before the halving was a major clue that the game has changed. Flat Buying Pressure Raises Eyebrows Despite the sharp price move from $75,000 to $110,000, Woo notes that capital inflows have been flat over the past few days, a surprising trend. This lack of buying pressure could spell trouble if U.S. markets don’t step in with more demand now that the long weekend is over. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan to Launch Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Will BTC Price Regain Bullish Momentum? , Still Room for $114K, But Warning Signs Flashing Woo hasn’t turned bearish just yet.

But if momentum fades, the market could cool off, forming bearish divergences and triggering another round of profit-taking.

Given the warning signs of speculation and market greed, it’s wise to consider taking partial profits, especially if you’re already sitting on significant gains. However, the long-term trend remains strong, so holding some position while setting stop-losses to protect profits can balance risk and reward. How might U.S. market demand influence Bitcoin’s price movement this week? Since capital inflows have been flat, renewed buying from U.S. institutions or retail could reignite momentum, pushing prices toward $114K. Conversely, if U.S. markets remain subdued, it may trigger selling pressure and a correction. Watching market open volumes and demand will be key. What does “flat buying pressure” signify for Bitcoin’s price? Despite the recent price jump, a lack of new capital inflows could lead to trouble if U.S. markets don’t inject more demand.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 05:42:26

That’s precisely what VivoPower International (Nasdaq: VVPR) is aiming to do, following a massive $121 million fundraising round. The goal? To launch an ambitious XRP corporate treasury strategy, a move that could position them as pioneers in the world of institutional crypto adoption. What is This VivoPower XRP Treasury Strategy All About? At its core, VivoPower plans to hold XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple, as a primary component of its corporate treasury reserves. This isn’t just about holding a small amount; the substantial $121 million raised, led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, is specifically earmarked to fund this strategy. The company intends to potentially become the first Nasdaq-listed entity to center its treasury operations around a digital asset like XRP . Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold assets like cash, short-term government bonds, or other low-risk, liquid investments. The idea is to preserve capital and ensure liquidity for operational needs. Shifting towards digital assets like XRP represents a significant departure and signals a strong belief in the future value and utility of cryptocurrencies. Why Choose XRP for Corporate Treasury? The decision to focus on XRP specifically for a corporate treasury strategy is noteworthy. While Bitcoin has gained some traction as a treasury asset among a few companies, XRP presents a different proposition. Supporters often highlight its speed and low transaction costs, features initially designed for facilitating cross-border payments. Factors that might influence a company like VivoPower to consider XRP could include: Potential for Growth: A belief that XRP ‘s value could appreciate significantly over time, offering potentially higher returns than traditional treasury assets. Utility Focus: Interest in leveraging XRP ‘s underlying technology for potential future business applications, especially if the company has international operations or payment needs. Strategic Positioning: Aiming to be at the forefront of digital asset integration within traditional finance structures. Connection to Ripple XRP: While legally distinct, the association with Ripple and its established network might offer perceived advantages or future opportunities. It’s crucial to remember that selecting any digital asset for a treasury involves careful consideration of its unique characteristics, market dynamics, and regulatory status. The Role of Institutional Crypto Adoption and Adam Traidman This move by VivoPower fits into the broader narrative of institutional crypto adoption . More and more traditional companies and financial institutions are exploring ways to engage with digital assets, whether through investment, integrating blockchain technology, or offering crypto-related services. A significant factor bolstering VivoPower’s strategy is the addition of former Ripple executive Adam Traidman, who will serve as chairman of VivoPower’s advisory board. Traidman’s experience within the Ripple XRP ecosystem brings valuable expertise and credibility to VivoPower’s ambitious plan. His involvement suggests a deeper understanding of the asset and its potential applications beyond simple speculation. The presence of experienced figures from the crypto space on corporate boards or advisory committees is becoming increasingly common as companies navigate this new landscape. It helps bridge the gap between traditional corporate governance and the nuances of digital assets. Potential Benefits and Challenges of a VivoPower XRP Treasury Adopting an XRP corporate treasury strategy comes with both potential upsides and considerable risks. VivoPower will need to navigate these carefully. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: If XRP performs well, the treasury holdings could significantly boost the company’s balance sheet value. Inflation Hedge: Some view digital assets as a potential hedge against inflation, though this is a debated topic. Innovation Leader: Positions VivoPower as an innovative company embracing future financial technologies. Attracting Investors: May appeal to investors interested in exposure to digital assets through a publicly traded stock. Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including XRP , are known for extreme price swings, which could negatively impact the company’s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for XRP and other digital assets is still evolving globally, posing potential legal and compliance risks. The ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple adds a layer of complexity. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting and Tax Issues: The accounting treatment for crypto holdings is complex and can vary by jurisdiction. Tax implications need careful management. Market Perception: Some traditional investors may view this strategy as overly risky or speculative. Managing these challenges will be critical to the success of VivoPower’s pioneering approach. Is This a Trend for Corporate Treasury Going Forward? The question on many minds is whether VivoPower’s move is an isolated event or the start of a broader trend. While companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve, VivoPower ‘s focus on XRP is unique among publicly traded firms. Several factors could influence whether other companies follow suit: Regulatory Clarity: Greater regulatory certainty around digital assets would likely encourage more corporate adoption. Market Performance: Sustained positive performance of assets like XRP could make them more attractive as treasury holdings. Accounting Standards: Clearer and more consistent accounting standards for digital assets are needed. Peer Influence: If VivoPower demonstrates success (or struggles) with this strategy, it will certainly inform decisions at other companies. For now, VivoPower appears to be venturing into relatively uncharted territory for a Nasdaq-listed company, making its progress a key indicator for potential future trends in corporate treasury crypto strategies. Conclusion: A Bold Step in Institutional Crypto VivoPower’s decision to raise $121 million specifically for an XRP corporate treasury strategy, supported by significant investors and guided by former Ripple XRP expertise, represents a bold and potentially transformative step. It highlights the increasing interest in integrating digital assets into traditional financial structures and pushes the boundaries of what constitutes a corporate treasury asset. While the path forward involves navigating volatility and regulatory complexities, VivoPower’s initiative is a significant development in the evolution of institutional crypto adoption . The industry will be watching closely to see how this pioneering strategy unfolds and what it could mean for the future of corporate finance.

The strength of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) run from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just below $112,000 on May 22 “is starting to break down,” Woo wrote to X on May 28. “This week is absolutely critical,” he said. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” Woo said that in the short term, “late comer speculators” are taking long positions while potential profit taking “is ready to dump” as seen in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is a measure of the price paid divided by the price sold. “This week’s spot buying will strongly influence the next 1-2 months of price action. We are in a pivot zone.” Bitcoin short-term models. Source: Willy Woo On the positive side, he said the risk signal is trending downward, explaining that “buy-side liquidity is dominating” in the broader environment. “We are setting up for another solid run on the long time frame,” he said. Related: Bitcoin price will reach $130K or even $1.5M, top bulls say This week’s rebound in US consumer sentiment may help boost market risk appetite in the short term, Bitunix analysts said in a note shared with Cointelegraph. “We need to be alert to the technical pressure zone and the risk of a potential pullback,” they said, adding Bitcoin’s short-term pressure is around $110,800, where most of the past rebounds have stopped, and which is the core of the war between the bulls and the bears. “Support at $108,000 is the main long defense zone over the past two days. If it breaks down, it may trigger profit-taking pressure and turn into a short bias structure.” Big Bitcoin price predictions Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s eldest sons , Donald Jr. and Eric, both think Bitcoin could clear $170,000 by the end of 2026, according to their predictions on stage May 28 at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back had an even bolder prediction that BTC was going to $1 million in 5 years. Bitcoin was trading at $107,785 on Coinbase at the time of writing, according to Tradingview. It has slid 1.2% over the past 24 hours and failed to gain more momentum above $108,000 in early trading on May 29.

Taking to social media, Xena sought to provide context to her earlier statements, emphasizing both the significance of such a price movement and the broader outlook for the digital asset. In her post, Xena acknowledged that moving from sub-dollar levels to $8 would represent a notable milestone for XRP. She emphasized that many investors, particularly those who have held the asset for years, would experience meaningful gains if this target were reached. However, she also stressed that not everyone would consider $8 to be a final destination, especially those who are waiting for much higher valuations. “For many of you, that would be life-changing,” she wrote. “While others would have to wait for higher levels, but with the confidence, it’s finally getting somewhere.” Her message pointed to the varied expectations within the XRP community, highlighting that gains are relative depending on entry point and investment horizon. Y'all have a way to write articles and sometimes I don't quite get it lol This one is about me and what I said about $8 XRP for this year. I want to be very clear : from cents to $8 would be a great achievement after years spent below a dollar. Many of you would have life… pic.twitter.com/HUj3UW16bw — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) May 27, 2025 A Message for Long-Time Holders and Recent Investors She added that even if XRP were to stabilize at $2, it would still be viewed as a positive outcome for early adopters. “Nobody can tell you XRP was a bad investment because you made money already,” she noted, particularly addressing those who entered the market when the token was priced significantly lower. Xena also spoke candidly about long-time holders who purchased during XRP’s previous all-time high around $3.30 in 2017–2018. She stated that most of those individuals have likely exited the market already, accepting their losses. “But that’s part of the game,” she remarked, suggesting that such volatility is a known and accepted part of crypto investing. Market Movements and Unnatural Price Behavior Addressing recent market turbulence, she reaffirmed her earlier prediction that XRP would not drop below $2. While acknowledging that a temporary dip occurred following tariff-related announcements, she noted that XRP recovered quickly and remained in the $2 range. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 She also alluded to historical concerns over XRP’s price behavior during its past rallies. Referencing an earlier claim by another community member, she said XRP’s previous surge to $3.30 did not appear to be a “natural” move. Without elaborating on the cause, she simply stated, “He was right. I’m just leaving this here,” followed by a general observation about XRP’s tendency to correct after brief rallies. Skepticism Toward Chart-Based Forecasts Xena pushed back against any suggestion that current price levels are being suppressed arbitrarily. “If it wasn’t on purpose, they would have brought this down back at 50 cents already. Believe it,” she wrote, arguing that XRP’s ability to stay above key psychological levels is evidence of underlying strength. Regarding the $8 prediction itself, she clarified that the figure originated from chart-based speculation, not insider information. She attributed the number to an analyst known as Water Above, whose forecast was amplified by another influencer, Bearable Bull. “It’s just a random number based on charts,” she said, urging caution in placing too much faith in projections that rely heavily on Bitcoin’s behavior. Ripple’s Long-Term Commitment and Global Expansion Xena concluded her post by reaffirming her long-term belief in XRP’s potential, pointing out the persistent efforts of Ripple, the company associated with XRP’s development and adoption. While Ripple has spent the past several years battling the SEC in court, she stressed that the company has continued to expand globally. “There is so much they are not talking about,” she added. Echoing the popular phrase used by another content creator in the community, she closed with: “As DAI likes to say: The world’s a stage. Everything is ready to go.

The move extends its impressive recovery, with Ethereum ( ETH ) now up 53% over the past month after a rough Q1 that saw prices drop more than 45%. A major driver behind the rally appears to be growing institutional interest. U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds have attracted $402 million in inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust alone brought in $53 million in the past 24 hours, pushing its cumulative inflows to $4.3 billion. Some industry leaders are now pushing for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve staking for Ethereum ETFs. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce recently clarified that Ethereum’s proof-of-stake functions, such as node operations and validation, are not considered securities. If ETF staking requests from companies like 21Shares are approved, more inflows could follow. The trend is further highlighted by the large-scale ETH purchases made by institutions. Over 350,000 Ethereum, worth about $837 million, were purchased by Abraxas Capital between May 7 and May 21. In addition, the company pulled 185,000 ETH from exchanges during a 44% price increase at the beginning of May, demonstrating long-term conviction.

In another sign of growing adoption, online gambling firm SharpLink Gaming raised $425 million on May 27, led by ConsenSys, to establish an Ethereum treasury. The news sent its stock soaring 400%, and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joined the company’s board. On the daily chart, Ethereum is currently displaying bullish momentum as it tests the upper Bollinger Band. The price is still above the $2,573 20-day simple moving average, which has served as a crucial support level for the rally. ETH is forming a rising wedge pattern, which could indicate continuation if it breaks above the $2,800 resistance. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The 50-day and 100-day EMAs, as well as the majority of other significant moving averages, are flashing buy signals. The relative strength index, which is at 71.5, indicates that ETH may be approaching overbought territory. A brief pause or pullback may result from this, particularly as the market gets closer to the psychological $2,800 and $3,000 levels. Ethereum may retest support at $2,650 or the 20-day SMA at $2,573 if it is unable to maintain above $2,700. However, a breakout above $2,800 could result in $2,900 and higher if momentum continues.

At the same time, XRP holders in the green are a lot more than investors in ETH, DOGE, ADA, and LINK. XRP’s price has failed to produce any significant moves in the past week or so, and is even 5% down within this timeframe. It now sits close to a crucial support level ($2.3), which could lead to another retracement to $2 if it’s broken to the downside, according to analysts. However, this dull price action hasn’t harmed XRP investors’ (paper) profits. Santiment reveals that those invested in the fourth-largest cryptocurrency are well in the green, with 98.3% of the total supply standing in profit. This places XRP in a very high position according to this straightforward metric. The asset is second only to bitcoin, whose investors stand slightly higher at 98.4%. What’s particularly interesting is that BTC currently sits just inches away from its all-time high of last week (almost $112,000), and it’s expected that nearly all holders will be in the green. However, the situation for XRP is a lot different since it is more than 30% away from its January 2018 peak of $3.4 (CoinGecko data). Furthermore, XRP’s total supply in profit is well above some of the asset’s most notable competitors. The percentages for ETH, DOGE, ADA, and LINK are as follows: 71.5%, 77.9%, 71%, and 80.5%. However, Santiment warned that when this metric is very high, as is the case with XRP and BTC, the “odds of profit-taking and a short-term pullbacks rise.” In contrast, when holders are mostly at a loss, it “often indicates fear, undervaluation, and a potential opportunity to enter or add to a position before a price recovery.” Percent of Total Supply in Profit is a straightforward metric that shows how much of a cryptocurrency’s current circulating supply is held at a profit—meaning the coins were bought at a lower price than they’re worth today.

This isn’t science fiction anymore. Odyssey, a startup co-founded by self-driving tech veterans Oliver Cameron and Jeff Hawke, is making this a reality with their new AI model designed for streaming interactive video. What Does This Revolutionary AI Model Do? At its core, Odyssey’s technology allows users to ‘interact’ with what looks like streaming video. Available via an early web demo, the AI model rapidly generates and streams video frames, pushing out a new frame every 40 milliseconds. This rapid generation enables viewers to navigate and explore areas within the video environment using basic controls, offering an experience akin to navigating a 3D-rendered video game rather than passively watching. Odyssey describes the underlying mechanism: “Given the current state of the world, an incoming action, and a history of states and actions, the model attempts to predict the next state of the world.” This predictive capability is key to creating a sense of continuity and responsiveness as the user moves through the generated environment. Exploring the Core Technology: The World Model Powering this interactive experience is a sophisticated world model . Odyssey claims this model demonstrates several capabilities crucial for creating believable, explorable environments: Generating pixels that appear realistic. Maintaining spatial consistency within the generated space. Learning actions directly from video data. Outputting coherent video streams for durations of five minutes or more. The development of advanced world model s is a significant area of research in the AI field, attracting attention from major players like DeepMind, Fei-Fei Lee’s World Labs, Microsoft, and Decart. The belief is that these models could one day underpin highly realistic simulations, interactive media, and even advanced training environments for robots. The Promise of Interactive Video Odyssey refers to its creation as “ interactive video .” The company envisions this technology fundamentally changing how we consume video content. Their blog post suggests that interactive video “opens the door to entirely new forms of entertainment, where stories can be generated and explored on demand, free from the constraints and costs of traditional production.” Looking ahead, Odyssey believes that “everything that is video today — entertainment, ads, education, training, travel, and more — will evolve into interactive video , all powered by Odyssey.” This represents a significant shift from passive consumption to active exploration within digital content. Navigating Challenges and Creative Concerns While the potential is exciting, the technology is still in its early stages. Odyssey acknowledges that their current demo is “a bit rough around the edges.” Users might encounter environments that are blurry, distorted, or even spatially inconsistent, where layouts can change unexpectedly as you move around. These are significant challenges in maintaining immersion and usability. Beyond the technical hurdles, the rise of AI in creative fields, including technologies like Odyssey’s, has sparked concerns among creative professionals. Investigations have highlighted how some companies are leveraging AI in ways that impact jobs, such as using AI to cut corners or address workforce attrition, as seen with game studios like Activision Blizzard. A 2024 study commissioned by the Animation Guild estimated that over 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs could be disrupted by AI in the near future. Odyssey has publicly stated its intention to collaborate with creative professionals rather than seeking to replace them, aiming to provide new tools and possibilities. Building the 3D Worlds : Technology and Approach Despite the demo’s current limitations, Odyssey is focused on rapid improvement. The model can stream video at up to 30 frames per second, powered by clusters of Nvidia H100 GPUs. The cost for this early tech is estimated at $1-$2 per “user-hour.” Odyssey is taking a unique approach to training its world model . Unlike many labs that rely solely on publicly available data, Odyssey has developed a specialized 360-degree, backpack-mounted camera system to capture real-world landscapes. They believe this proprietary data will enable the creation of higher-quality models and more realistic 3D worlds . The company is actively researching ways to improve the models, focusing on “richer world representations that capture dynamics far more faithfully, while increasing temporal stability and persistent state.” They are also working on expanding the range of user interactions beyond simple motion. With $27 million in funding from investors like EQT Ventures, GV, and Air Street Capital, and with industry figures like Ed Catmull (Pixar co-founder) on their board, Odyssey is positioned to push the boundaries of this technology. They are also developing software to allow creators to export scenes generated by their models into standard tools like Unreal Engine, Blender, and Adobe After Effects for further refinement and hand-editing, reinforcing their stated goal of collaboration. Odyssey AI: A Glimpse into the Future Odyssey’s work on streaming, interactive 3D worlds powered by a novel AI model represents a significant step towards a new era of digital content. While challenges remain and the impact on creative industries requires careful consideration and collaboration, the vision of a future where video is no longer a passive medium but an explorable, interactive experience is compelling. As Odyssey AI continues to refine its technology, the possibilities for entertainment, education, and simulation appear vast.

45232750,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=760498,1748498425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45232750.jpeg,"Bitcoin Up 15% in a Month, Analyst Cautions on MVRV Resistance Level",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-up-15-in-a-month-analyst-cautions-on-mvrv-resistance-level/,"Bitcoin is currently trading at $109,000, marking a marginal decline of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term dip, the broader market trend remains intact, with Bitcoin recording an approximate 15% gain over the past month. This performance comes after BTC set a new all-time high just above the $111,000 mark a few days ago, continuing its strong upward momentum through Q2 2025. Burak Kesmeci, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, recently discussed the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio in his latest analysis, “Bitcoin MVRV: Will the Long-Term Downtrend Break This Time?” The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value, effectively measuring holders’ profitability and offering insights into market sentiment and potential turning points. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Above $109K as Long-Term Holders Accumulate Amid Liquidations MVRV Ratio Approaches Crucial Resistance In his analysis, Kesmeci highlighted the importance of the 365-day Simple Moving Average (SMA365) as a benchmark for the MVRV metric. Historically, when Bitcoin’s MVRV crosses above and maintains weekly closes over the SMA365, it typically signals sustained upward momentum. Kesmeci provided the example from April 2025, when the MVRV ratio exceeded the SMA365, corresponding with Bitcoin’s substantial price increase from around $94,000 to $111,000, subsequently setting a new record high. Currently, the MVRV stands at 2.36, comfortably above the SMA365 level of 2.14. However, the analyst points out a significant resistance looming at 2.93, a critical historical level where previous rallies encountered headwinds. The upcoming test at this resistance could indicate whether Bitcoin will sustain its upward trajectory or experience a period of stabilization or correction. Kesmeci emphasized caution, suggesting that traders carefully monitor the MVRV behavior, as approaching these levels often prompts market participants to reassess risk. Bitcoin Retail Investors Remain Cautiously Absent Another factor shaping Bitcoin’s market conditions is the noticeable lack of retail investor engagement. Kesmeci observed that despite Bitcoin achieving new record highs in the second quarter of 2025, retail investor participation, measured by transfer volumes in smaller denominations (under $10,000), remains relatively subdued. While Bitcoin’s price trajectory has remained robust, retail volumes have seen minimal increases, indicating the current rally is primarily driven by institutional or large-scale investors. Historically, retail investor participation has served as an essential driver for sustained bull markets, amplifying price movements initially propelled by institutional investments. Related Reading: US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief Kesmeci notes that past major rallies, such as the one observed in 2020-2021, gained significant momentum when retail investors actively joined in. Thus, a critical aspect moving forward will be monitoring retail activity. Any uptick in retail investment could potentially catalyze further Bitcoin appreciation, reinforcing recent gains and setting the stage for a broader market rally.

Pakistan’s pivot was made amid major reforms, including forming a Digital Asset Authority, allocating 2,000 megawatts of energy to crypto mining, and appointing Binance’s CZ as an adviser. Meanwhile, US officials like David Sacks and Vice President JD Vance were also at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, and talked about the growing federal interest in expanding Bitcoin reserves. Vance urged Bitcoiners to stay engaged in the political engagement. Pakistan Sets Up Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Pakistan made a historic shift in its stance on cryptocurrencies, with the announcement of a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Bilal Bin Saqib, the head of Pakistan’s crypto council, made the announcement during the Bitcoin 2025 conference held in Las Vegas on May 28. The move makes Pakistan one of the growing number of nations embracing crypto, following in the footsteps of the United States under the administration of President Donald Trump. Saqib mentioned this inspiration,and stated that, “Today is a very historic day. Today, I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them.” Bilal Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin 2025 conference This announcement is a dramatic departure from Pakistan’s previously hostile stance on cryptocurrencies. Not long ago, the government held firm that digital assets would never be legalized in the country. However, with geopolitical shifts and increasing global momentum toward digital asset adoption, Pakistan quickly reversed its position and is now actively pursuing a pro-crypto agenda. The journey toward this strategic pivot began in February of 2025 when the idea of a National Crypto Council was proposed. The Council was tasked with designing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and encouraging foreign investment. Key initiatives from the Council included leveraging the country’s excess energy to support Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus power in May 2025 to support these initiatives. Adding even more credibility to its crypto ambitions, the Council appointed Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao as an adviser in April. Zhao will guide the development of blockchain infrastructure, regulations, and overall digital asset adoption. On April 27, Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) signed a letter of intent with Pakistan to support the country in tokenizing real-world assets and developing decentralized finance (DeFi) products. Additionally, in May 2025, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance also greenlit the creation of a Digital Asset Authority , which is a dedicated body that will oversee crypto regulation and issue licenses to service providers in the digital asset space. US Could Buy More Bitcoin The US could soon inspire even more countries to turn to Bitcoin as the White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks opened the door to the possibility of the United States government buying even more Bitcoin. This could be the case provided it can be done in a way that doesn’t increase the national debt or impose new taxes. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference during a fireside chat with Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss on May 27, Sacks said the government already has the legal framework to expand its Bitcoin holdings—but only if the Commerce or Treasury departments can identify a budget-neutral method to fund such a purchase. Sacks said that while there are no guarantees, the executive order issued on March 6 gives the federal government the authority to create a crypto reserve that includes not only Bitcoin seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture, but also Bitcoin that can be legally purchased if financed responsibly. The decision to increase the reserve will ultimately rest with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, who would need to find funding from underutilized programs or other existing sources in the federal budget. According to Sacks, the structure is already in place: “The question is, can we get either the Treasury Department or the Commerce Department to get excited about that because if they do and they can figure out how to fund it, they actually do have presidential authorization.” This could signal a potential policy shift toward more proactive Bitcoin acquisition by the US government, depending on internal budgetary decisions. Government Bitcoin holdings (Source: CoinGecko ) The US government currently holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoin, which is worth over $21 billion at current prices. These holdings primarily stem from major seizures, including 69,370 Bitcoin from the Silk Road case in 2020, 51,351 Bitcoin in a follow-up seizure in 2022, and another 94,636 Bitcoin that was confiscated from Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein in 2022. In March 2023, the government sold a portion of its holdings—9,861 Bitcoin—for around $215.7 million. The Department of Justice has also been cleared to sell the full 198,109 Bitcoin it holds. JD Vance Urges Bitcoiners to Get Political United States Vice President JD Vance also delivered a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, and called on the Bitcoin community to stay politically engaged and proactive. He placed a lot of emphasis on the growing importance of Bitcoin on a geopolitical level, and urged Bitcoiners to leverage their political momentum from 2024 and carry it forward into future election cycles as political forces will inevitably impact the future of transformative technologies like Bitcoin. JD Vance at Bitcoin 2024 “What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we do not make the right decisions,” Vance said, stressing that the crypto industry can no longer afford to stay on the political sidelines. He added, “Politics is not going to ignore this community, not now, and not in the future.” Bitcoin quickly gained a lot of institutional credibility and is increasingly being seen as a macroeconomic and strategic asset on the global stage. With sovereign powers engaging in what analysts describe as a geopolitical race to acquire BTC, the digital currency is now recognized as more than just a speculative investment—it is a matter of national interest. Bitcoin advocates argue that countries failing to accumulate BTC may find themselves at a huge disadvantage as its scarcity and store-of-value properties become more widely appreciated. The shift in sentiment was amplified by the pro-crypto stance of President Donald Trump, whose administration established a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a crypto advisory council. These moves set a precedent that influenced other governments to rethink their own digital asset strategies.

At a recent Bitcoin conference 2025, Howells said that he’s preparing a $75 million plan involving tokenizing part of his missing fortune to raise But time is running out. The landfill is now facing closure, and the council still hasn’t granted him access. The Man Who Lost 8,000 Bitcoins James Howells , a British computer expert from Newport, Wales, accidentally threw away a hard drive in 2013. That hard drive, he says, contains the private keys to 8,000 Bitcoins, worth hundreds of millions of dollars today. For years, he’s fought to search the local landfill where he believes the drive is buried, but city officials have refused his requests, citing environmental and safety concerns. New Plan To Recover Lost Bitcoin Now, with the Newport City Council preparing to permanently shut down the landfill, Howells says he’s out of time and patience. Instead of begging for permission again, he plans to raise $75 million by tokenizing 1,675 of the 8,000 lost Bitcoins. These tokens will be sold as ordinals, a type of digital asset stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Lights, Camera, Landfill Howells’s story is more than just another crypto headline it’s a modern treasure hunt with emotional stakes. Recently, a U.S.-based production company named LEBUL has secured the exclusive rights to turn his journey into a documentary. Filming is expected to take place over the summer, with a release planned for October or November. Howells said he’s “excited” to finally tell the story in his own words. “This is the first time I can show the world exactly what we want to do at the landfill site,” he added. “Once people see this documentary, they won’t think this is a crazy plan—they’ll see it’s very achievable.”",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 06:05:52

The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority. Court “blows a hole in trade talks” Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.” Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current all-time high of $111,970 was reached on May 22, but it has since fallen to trade around $107,750, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 3.36% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap The Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed. “It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.” On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers , levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10% . Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified. “The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said , “Buy everything round dos.” Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrow Crypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said , “So Trump tariffs are illegal? Does that mean we get green candles all around tomorrow?” Hundal said “a wall of money” is coming into Bitcoin through corporations, spot Bitcoin ETFs and retail. The trading week ending May 23 saw US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) record a total of $2.75 billion in inflows . Related: Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible “The court order has just accelerated that rotation into risk assets across the US and Asia,” Hundal said. He added all data signals “a solid floor for demand on spot Bitcoin and a very solid consensus for $120K in the option markets.” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered , recently said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.

Investors welcomed the news, viewing it as a sign of Musk refocusing on Tesla. Musk criticized federal inefficiencies and plans to scale back political involvement. Tesla shares surged over 2.15% in overnight trading to $364 after CEO Elon Musk revealed he is stepping down from his role as Special Government Employee overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration. The move follows a 1.65% decline in Tesla stock during regular trading hours on Tuesday, closing at $356.90, according to data from Google Finance . Musk’s announcement, shared via his social media platform X, appeared to reassure investors concerned about his growing political involvement and its impact on Tesla’s core business. “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” Musk posted. DOGE to Continues its Mission Musk said that while his own role has concluded, the mission of DOGE will continue within government operations. The White House confirmed Musk’s departure was already underway as of Wednesday evening. The billionaire’s brief foray into federal reform had focused on streamlining bureaucracy, but insiders say his efforts were often met with internal resistance. Throughout the past week, Musk has been increasingly vocal about his dissatisfaction with Washington. He openly criticized Trump’s tax plan as bloated and counterproductive, and described the federal government’s internal inefficiencies as worse than expected. As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 29, 2025 In an interview with the Washington Post , Musk admitted, “It’s an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC.” He added that DOGE had become a scapegoat for failures within the administration. Behind the scenes, Musk reportedly clashed with key White House officials and publicly derided trade adviser Peter Navarro over tariffs. His growing frustration extended beyond domestic politics; Musk also reportedly opposed a deal between OpenAI and Abu Dhabi , objecting to his own AI company’s exclusion. Further complicating his political entanglements, Musk had invested $25 million in a failed Wisconsin judicial campaign and pledged another $100 million to pro-Trump groups — money that has yet to materialize, according to The New York Times . Despite the controversies, DOGE has managed to shrink the federal civilian workforce by 12% through buyouts, early retirements, and restructuring — a feat Musk frequently touted. Tesla Investors Ask Musk to Focus on EV Company Some Tesla investors had urged Musk to cut back on his political involvement and focus on leading the EV company. His exit from DOGE may mark a shift back to Tesla-centric priorities, with markets responding positively. Musk, who spent nearly $300 million supporting Republican campaigns last year, said at a recent economic forum that he plans to reduce his political contributions. “I think I’ve done enough,” he said. As reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to allow DOGE representatives access to its internal systems and data, effectively treating them as staff for integration and network purposes.

Designed to enhance automated trading, smart contract analysis, and predictive financial modeling, the platform is built on its proprietary Ozak Stream Network (OSN) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). These systems offer real-time data processing and heightened security for financial market activities. The platform’s Prediction Agents are tailored for adaptive financial modeling, allowing users to align their strategies with specific investment goals. This flexibility enhances the platform’s relevance across different industries. The OZ token serves as the network’s utility token, enabling access to premium services, executing transactions, and participating in governance. With a presale price of $0.003 and more than $1 million already raised, Ozak AI is positioning itself to benefit from the increasing investor interest in AI-driven blockchain applications. Youtube embed: $1 Target Set for OZAK, Buy OZAK AI at $0.003 is The Best Altcoin investment of 2025 Chainlink Under Pressure Following Increased Exchange Inflows Chainlink (LINK) is currently experiencing market uncertainty as technical and on-chain indicators suggest downward momentum. Following a rejection at the $16 resistance level, data from Santiment showed a notable spike in exchange inflows, reaching 300,000 tokens on May 18. Such movement typically indicates a rise in selling pressure, as investors transfer assets from self-custody to trading platforms in preparation for liquidation. Additional resistance levels at $17.61, $16.36, and $15.92 have also posed challenges for LINK, leading to potential concerns of an extended price correction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator currently shows a bearish crossover, suggesting the possibility of a drop below the $14.98 support level. If that threshold fails to hold, analysts are monitoring a potential retreat toward $10.05, mirroring similar patterns observed in previous months. XRP Signals Potential Breakout Amid Market Activity The attention on XRP is due to both technical signs and activity supporting a likely increase in its price. With Ripple trading inside a symmetrical triangle, the cryptocurrency is moving higher, and new resistance levels have formed at $2.50. Experts are also expecting XRP to break through $3.70 or higher. When the crossover happens on the Stochastic RSI and the price breaks through the long-term downtrend line, this enhances the setup. There is also support from increased engagement with others on the network. Active XRP wallets have increased significantly by 620%, which traditionally signals a possible rise in XRP’s price. Buying Hidden Road by Ripple can affect the use and trading of XRP coins. It ties in with a growing monetary supply, which may be beneficial for XRP immediately. Market Observes Stellar (XLM) for Upcoming Movement Experts are closely watching Stellar (XLM), since many investors are predicting possible shifts in the altcoin market. Even though XLM’s trading activity is low at present, it tends to move up or down together with Bitcoin and the rest of the altcoins. Improvements in the network and strong partnerships in cross-border payments place Stellar in a better position to advance in the future. As more institutions explore using blockchain technology in banking, low-priced, fast Stellar transactions could attract attention from investors looking for high-potential assets. Ozak AI, in particular, stands out for its innovative approach to merging artificial intelligence with decentralized finance. Thanks to the use of analytics, tailor-made tools for finance and a growing ecosystem supported by OZ tokens, the platform could be attractive for anyone interested in starting with crypto. Since more industries are now adopting AI, Ozak AI is expected to be closely watched over the next few months.

While his tenure was always intended to be temporary, Musk’s departure comes amid growing criticism of the administration’s fiscal policies, particularly the recently proposed “big beautiful bill” that he argues undermines DOGE’s objectives. In a post on X, he said that his planned time as a Special Government Employee has ended. Musk thanked the President for allowing him to cut wasteful spending. He emphasized that the DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government. Musk ends official role but says DOGE will keep growing Elon Musk officially ended his short-term role in the Trump administration after reaching the legal limit of 130 working days a year for a Special Government Employee. President Trump asked Musk to lead the new department focused on cutting waste across the government, the Department of Government Efficiency, after taking office in January 2025 . Musk and his team planned to stay until summer, but the 130-day rule forced him to resign by the end of May, and government staff were already working on the offboarding process before the deadline. Officials searched for workarounds to extend his stay but followed the legal limit of his employee status, and the White House officially confirmed Musk’s exit on Wednesday. Musk’s role and title as a Special Government Employee allowed him to advise, lead reforms, and set targets without becoming a full-time official while avoiding conflict-of-interest rules that apply to full-time civil servants. Musk used strong language to promote a leaner, more efficient system and promised to cut up to $2 trillion in unnecessary federal spending when he first joined DOGE. This framed his mission as a fight against “bureaucratic bloat.” He only reported saving $175 billion, which quickly drew scrutiny. Sources could not verify the savings, suggesting that some of the cuts likely came from programs already scheduled to shrink . Critics argued that the other estimated cuts, or “future savings,” might never materialize. Musk believes the values and systems he introduced in DOGE would remain and spread across agencies as a permanent part of how the government manages its money, even though he is stepping away from the role. Musk hasn’t named his successor, and DOGE is yet to announce a takeover candidate. However, sources inside the administration claim they are exploring internal and external candidates to continue the mission. Republicans close to the White House hope his early efforts can serve as a blueprint for future reforms because they said Musk’s influence changed how some departments think about efficiency. Musk slams Trump’s budget and shifts focus back to Tesla Elon Musk said Trump’s new tax-and- spending bill would increase the national deficit and go against the very mission of the Department of Government Efficiency. He expressed frustration that the legislation favored large-scale spending and would undo much of what DOGE aimed to fix, saying, “A bill can be big, or it can be beautiful — but not both.” Independent budget analysts warned that Trump’s bill could increase the US deficit by more than $3.3 trillion over the next decade. Musk pointed to these figures and said the administration’s new approach could reverse progress by pumping huge amounts of money into tax breaks and defense spending without proper controls or offsets. Musk now says he would spend “a lot less” on politics and believes he has “done enough” in politics after donating over $250 million to help fund Trump’s presidential campaign and related efforts in 2024. Musk wants to return his full attention to Tesla and SpaceX, focusing on Tesla, whose sales dropped recently due to the ‘political noise’ surrounding his government role. He blamed his ties to the Trump administration for the sales drop, saying they made some buyers hesitant or turned them away.

Will Uniswap (UNI) March Above $10 in the Coming Month? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the top token maintains a consolidated trend, popular altcoins like Uniswap have broken out of the range. The price has remained elevated since the start of the month, and hence the bulls have triggered a small parabolic recovery, aiming to reclaim the 2-digit figure in the next few hours. Despite the sluggish weekend, the UNI price began the weekly trade on a bullish note, which attracted over 20% gains and is expected to remain bullish throughout the week. Uniswap’s Q1 2025 data shows the ecosystem is gearing up for a multi-year bullish trend. The big ecosystem investments, V4 launches, and Unichain expansion have all contributed to raising optimism. Therefore, the long game favours UNI if it continues to dominate the DeFi space with strong reserves and governance upgrades, which are on the horizon. While the short-term price action remains choppy due to whale movements and lower LP rewards, the long-term price action suggests that the UNI price is due for a 150% rise for the upcoming quarter. The long-term price action suggests the UNI price has begun to initiate the second parabolic recovery curve, which may lead the token not only above $10 but also above $20. During the previous parabolic curve, the Bollinger bands squeezed before the breakout close to $20. A similar pattern has formed, which suggests a similar breakout could be on the horizon. Besides, the weekly MACD experienced a bullish crossover then, and it is about to occur anytime now. With the technicals in place, the Uniswap (UNI) price is primed to rise along the curve, which could act as a strong base until it reaches the neckline at $19.5. On the other hand, the volume is slowly rising, which could shake up the settled volatility and help the price reach the desired destination.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 06:12:40

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Adams pledged to advocate for and support the creation of municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin ( BTC ). “We have financial instruments for all other bonds. You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said. “I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants a Bitcoin bond and to axe the State BitLicense program. BitSource: YouTube Adams didn’t share details about how a Bitbond would work; however, a March 31 policy brief paper from advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute proposed a model where holders receive an annual interest rate of 1% for 10 years. When the bond matures, holders also receive a percentage of any Bitcoin market gains . At the same time, 90% of the funds raised through the bonds are allocated to government spending, while 10% is used to purchase Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s bond policy brief. Adams again pushes to axe BitLicense Adams also called for repealing New York’s BitLicense program, which the state launched in 2015 and requires crypto businesses to apply for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services and meet strict compliance standards. The BitLicense program has received criticism from the industry , and Adams has also said the measure is too costly with high licensing fees, and is too stringent with its Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures. “You have a mayor who is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York, where you won’t be attacked and criminalized,” he said. “Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to have the free flow of Bitcoin in our city.” Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summit USDC stablecoin issuer Circle was one of the first crypto companies to receive a BitLicense; others have since followed, including crypto exchange Coinbase and trading firm Bakkt. Adams has been actively pushing to attract crypto firms to New York City. As part of his most recent effort, Adams told the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20 that he was creating a digital advisory council to attract jobs and investments. Meanwhile, on May 12, Adams announced financial services company Figure and private equity firms Traction and Scale would be assisting the city in its crypto efforts.

Let’s take a closer look at what’s happening on the charts. Ethereum Faces Strong Resistance Around $2,700 – $2,800 On the daily time frame, Ethereum is struggling to break above a strong resistance area between $2,700 and $2,800. Every time the price enters this range, it faces selling pressure and gets rejected. If ETH can manage to close candles above $2,800, it could trigger a bullish move towards $3,200 – $3,300. But for now, it continues to bounce between this resistance and the support level around $2,400. ETH Moving Sideways in a Tight Range Ethereum’s price is currently moving sideways between $2,400 and $2,800. It has been stuck in this range for a while now, without any clear breakout in either direction. ETH seems to be forming an ascending triangle pattern, with higher lows and a horizontal resistance near $2,700. A breakout above $2,800 could push prices towards $3,100, while a breakdown below the support line around $2,540 might lead to a drop toward $2,400 or even $2,200. Is Ethereum in the Final Stages of a Bullish Wave? According to Elliott Wave analysis, Ethereum might be in the final leg of a 5th wave up which started back in April from around $1,380. Currently, it’s believed ETH is completing an A-wave to the upside. A small pullback (B-wave) could follow soon, bringing prices down to the support zone between $1,650 and $2,170 before another possible rally. However, If ETH can break above recent swing highs, it could confirm the bullish continuation. However, a break below $2,510 would weaken the bullish case, and a drop below $2,319 would further confirm a bearish move.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 06:55:53

Canada-listed Sol Strategies filed a preliminary base shelf prospectus on Tuesday to offer up to $1 billion in securities, including equity and debt, to deepen its exposure to Solana. There is no immediate plan to raise capital, but the filing provides the firm with flexibility to act quickly on future opportunities. The move comes just weeks after Sol Strategies secured a $500 million convertible note and spent its first $20 million tranche to purchase over 122,000 SOL. Separately, DeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: DFDV) said it is adopting liquid staking token (LST) infrastructure developed by Sanctum, becoming the first public company to invest in Solana-based liquid staking tokens (LSTs). Through its new token dfdvSOL, the company will allow users to stake SOL with DeFi Dev’s validators while retaining liquidity, enabling participation in DeFi or redemption at any time. Staking refers to locking up tokens (such as SOL) to help run the network and earn rewards in return. Validators are specialized computers that process and verify transactions to maintain the blockchain's security and ensure its smooth operation.

The asset registered a mild decline of 1.2% over the past 24 hours, retreating slightly after surpassing the $2,700 mark last week. Despite this short-term retracement, Ethereum has notably appreciated by around 50% within the past month, demonstrating strong price strength and significant market interest. The recent price action has attracted attention from prominent cryptocurrency analysts, particularly from CryptoQuant contributors, who have closely monitored Ethereum’s technical indicators and market behaviors. These analysts have provided insights that suggest potential further movement for ETH, pointing towards critical levels and market metrics that investors might want to observe closely. Related Reading: Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns Ethereum’s Bullish Technical Indicators and Potential Breakout CryptoQuant analyst Ibrahim Cosar recently published a technical analysis outlining a bullish scenario for ETH. According to Cosar, Ethereum has formed a pattern known as a “bull flag,” suggesting a possible upcoming breakout. A bull flag is a chart formation frequently interpreted by traders as indicative of continuing upward momentum after a period of consolidation. Ethereum’s price has oscillated within a defined range between $2,400 and $2,700 for nearly three weeks, creating favorable conditions for such a breakout. Cosar also highlighted Ethereum’s sustained position above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a commonly monitored technical indicator. Historically, remaining consistently above this indicator has signified positive market sentiment and preceded significant price rallies. Given Ethereum’s current position relative to this EMA, Cosar suggested a potential upward move toward a price range between $3,000 and $3,500 could soon materialize. Market-Wide Implications and Retail Activity Another CryptoQuant analyst known as “elcryptotavo” offered a complementary perspective, identifying signals that typically indicate market peaks. Specifically, the analyst mentioned Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI), noting that a notable market signal occurs when Ethereum’s OI surpasses Bitcoin’s, a scenario historically correlated with market tops. Currently, ETH has yet to reach this critical threshold, suggesting, according to this analyst, potential room for further upside before significant corrections could occur. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Elcryptotavo also provided observations regarding retail trading behaviors. Typically, retail trading activity surges dramatically near market tops, reflecting broad market participation. However, current data on retail trading volumes remain comparatively subdued. This observation implies that institutional investors or large market players are predominantly driving Ethereum’s current rally. A significant increase in retail participation, should it occur, could further sustain and accelerate Ethereum’s upward momentum, a phenomenon previously seen during the 2020–2021 bull cycle.

The BOK also published its quarterly update of macroeconomic forecasts, which predicted much weaker economic growth this year, at 0.8%, down from February’s 1.5%. BOK’s seven-member board voted to cut its benchmark interest rate to 2.50% at its monetary policy review, an outcome expected by all 36 economists polled by Reuters on May 27th. The South Korean central bank aimed to boost economic growth amid sluggish domestic demand and uncertainties stemming from Washington’s sweeping tariff scheme. The BOK held the policy rate steady at its previous meeting in April, citing the need to support the weak local currency and assess the evolving impact of new U.S. tariff measures. However, six of its board members were open to lowering the rate. Lee and Kim welcome the fourth rate reduction since last year South Korea’s central bank cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points in a decision announced Thursday as the country faces a double-whammy of protracted political turmoil and Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The Bank of Korea reduced rates to 2.5% from 2.75%, its lowest level… — Ajay Bagga (@Ajay_Bagga) May 29, 2025 Today’s rate cut marked the fourth reduction since October 2024, when the BOK began a monetary easing cycle for the first time since August 2021. The central bank has since lowered the policy rate by 1 percentage point through May. The Bank of Korea reduced rates from 2.75% to 2.5%, its lowest since August 2022. Thursday’s decision came just five days before the country’s presidential election on June 3, and both leading candidates, liberal frontrunner Lee Jae-Myung and right-winger Kim Moon-soo, welcomed the lower interest rates. They pledged immediate spending to restore the country’s economic growth dragged by six months of political turmoil since the December 3 martial law decree. South Korean leaders are also racing to strike a deal with the U.S. government before the July 8 deadline. Both sides stated they aimed to agree on a tariff package and economic cooperation by then. Still, the South Korean Minister for Trade and Industry said there was not enough time recently, and the upcoming election could delay it further. “Ongoing trade talks with the US, as well as Fed cuts likely coming only in December 2025, in our forecast, all warrant gradual easing from the BOK.” – Bum Ki Son , Economist at Barclays Bum also pointed out that a fiscal stimulus package had already been delivered, and a second one was likely in the second half of the year. South Korea’s economy unexpectedly contracted in Q1, shrinking 0.1% from a year earlier, as exports and consumption stalled amid fears over the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Bum believes the pace of future cuts could fall short of market expectation Bum said the pace of future cuts could fall short of market expectations, as he saw another 25 basis point cut by the BOK in October. The central bank also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%, considerably lower than the previous projection of 1.5%. The Bank of Korea monetary policy board attributed its Thursday rate cut decision to expectations that economic growth would decline considerably while inflation remained broadly stable. The board also stated that it would maintain its rate cut stance to curb downside risks to economic growth and adjust the timing and pace of further base rate cuts while closely monitoring domestic and external policy environment changes. 23 of 36 economists polled expected the key interest rate to fall from the current level to 2.25% by the end of next quarter, a view broadly unchanged from the previous poll. However, a slight majority, around 56%, forecasted an additional 25 basis point cut by the end of the fourth quarter, bringing the rate to 2.00%, a quarter percentage point lower than in the previous poll conducted in April. Data showing inflation close to the bank’s 2% target and a weaker outlook for domestic activity due to external uncertainties supported arguments for further easing.

A May 28 press release from the Commission said it was appropriate to designate a longer period to consider the proposed rule change. The SEC made the designation under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows for extensions beyond the initial 45-day review window. Nasdaq filed the Avalanche ETF proposal on 27 March 2025 and seeks to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Avalanche Trust under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d), which governs Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The proposed rule change was published in the Federal Register on 16 February 2025, triggering the statutory review timeline. The original 45-day decision deadline was set for 31 May 2025. Separately, Grayscale’s Cardano ETF proposal was submitted through NYSE Arca on 10 February 2025, and plans to convert the existing Grayscale Cardano Trust into a spot ETF. An amended version of the filing was submitted on 20 February and later published for public comment on 28 February, formally initiating a 240-day review window that ends on 22 October 2025. With the delay now confirmed, the next key date in the approval process for both ETFs is 15 July 2025, when the Commission must either approve, reject, or initiate proceedings to further evaluate the proposals. Public comments remain open during this time, with the SEC actively soliciting feedback on the applications. You might also like: Cardano price could surge as ADA ETF odds jump ahead of Grayscale deadline No altcoin ETF has secured approval so far, which reaffirms the SEC’s measured approach toward crypto products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Under its new leadership , the Commission has extended review periods for several other cryptocurrency-based ETFs, including those for Solana, XRP , and Ethereum staking products. Earlier this month, the SEC postponed decisions on four Solana ETF filings from Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary, stating it would “institute proceedings” to assess whether those proposals met regulatory standards. Analysts suggest that these delays are part of the SEC’s standard review process for innovative financial products, such as crypto ETFs. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart has previously explained that the regulator often takes the full 240 days to evaluate such filings, indicating that final decisions on many of these ETFs may not occur before October 2025.

The pseudonymous trader known as Dave the Wave tells his 153,800 followers on the social media platform X that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator suggests Bitcoin’s uptrend may continue. The MACD is used to determine the direction, momentum and duration of a trend or to identify potential buy and sell signals. “Longer-term monthly BTC MACD turning upward again.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at his monthly chart, the MACD histogram was starting to weaken after surging, but has just begun to trend upward again. Dave the Wave also says that BTC may soar to $160,000 in just a couple of months, a more than 47% increase from its current value. “The BTC microcosm of the macro.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Bitcoin is trading in the middle of a range with a lower bound of $75,000 and an upper bound of $160,000. Lastly, he says that if Bitcoin remains in the bullish trend, a market correction could see the flagship crypto asset retest $100,000 as support, stopping short of a more severe decline. “If the fractal held, a very weak partial right shoulder would form, not a full one – $100,000, not $90,000.” Bitcoin is trading for $108,832 at time of writing, down 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

This decision directly impacts Trump's April 2 tariff policy, which included a 10% baseline duty and “reciprocal” tariffs targeting multiple countries. However, it doesn’t cover previously established sector-specific tariffs, such as those on steel or autos. The ruling follows lawsuits from small businesses and a coalition of 12 US states, which argued that the tariffs harmed public services and disrupted supply chains. Market reaction was immediate and positive , with US stock futures rising 1.5% and Asian markets climbing as investors welcomed the legal pushback against escalating trade tensions. Despite criticism from the White House and its intent to appeal, the judgment strengthens opposition from lawmakers and businesses alike, questioning the limits of presidential power in trade matters. Now facing legal resistance, Trump's administration has already softened some tariffs and is pursuing talks with global trade partners, including a temporary tariff truce with the EU and China.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-29 07:06:14

However, economist and long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff swiftly challenged these claims, arguing that no real wealth was created at all. No Real Wealth Created, Says Schiff Schiff on X highlighted his strong displeasure with the government’s crypto stance. He stated that Bitcoin did not generate wealth but instead facilitated a large transfer of wealth, from early adopters to latecomers. “What has happened is a massive transfer of wealth,” he wrote, warning that capital has been misallocated and valuable resources wasted in the process. At Bitcoin 2025, JD Vance spoke about all the wealth created by Bitcoin and crypto. No actual wealth was created, as these tokens do not represent wealth. What has happened is a massive transfer of wealth from those who bought Bitcoin and crypto early to those who bought later.… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 28, 2025 Criticism of Government Policy Meanwhile, Schiff also took a jab at the Trump administration, which Vance represents. He said rather than promoting Bitcoin as a backup plan for bad policies, leaders like Vance and Trump should focus on fixing those policies in the first place. According to him, good governance would reduce inflation and the need for any hedge at all. A Bit of Humor from Schiff… PETER SCHIFF: Based on what I heard at #Bitcoin 2025 “I'm likely responsible for more people owning Bitcoin than any other individual.” “Every time I tell you not to buy Bitcoin you buy more.” pic.twitter.com/zrxC6AQcZ5 — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 Interestingly, Schiff was also a participant at the same conference and shared a humorous observation during a fireside chat. “I’m likely responsible for more people owning Bitcoin than any other individual,” he joked, adding, “Every time I tell you not to buy Bitcoin, you buy more.” Despite his opposition, Schiff acknowledged his role in indirectly promoting Bitcoin through criticism. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : James Howells Hasn’t Given Up: A New $75M Plan to Rescue His Lost Bitcoin , Gold vs Bitcoin He went further, dismissing Vance’s statement that Bitcoin serves as a hedge against inflation and poor government policy. According to Schiff, Americans want real protection, they should stick to gold and silver assets that have stood the test of time. He added that Bitcoin doesn’t offer the kind of safety people are hoping for in tough economic times. Vance, on the other hand, had framed Bitcoin as a transformative financial tool and even a strategic asset that could strengthen the U.S.’s global economic leadership. His bullish stance highlighted the growing political interest in digital assets , while Schiff’s remarks brought in a starkly contrasting traditional perspective. Crypto Reaction In response to Schiff, one crypto user, Metabolic Uncle explained that producing Bitcoin costs more relative to its market price than gold does, averaging 63% of its value in major cities. This means Bitcoin carries more real-world input like energy and hardware, giving it a stronger intrinsic value compared to gold. At the time of the debate, Bitcoin was trading at around $108,237, slightly down on the day, but still reflecting strong market interest. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin has gained around 60%, reaching new highs around $111K. Although it briefly bounced back below $80K during the tariff tensions, it has now climbed back above important resistance levels.

XRP had been falling in price since January 17, but on May 10, it broke that downward trend. Analysts said that Bitcoin is overbought, meaning its RSI is high, often a signal that the price has gone up too fast and might pull back soon. On the other hand, XRP is oversold and its RSI is low which suggests that it is undervalued and is set for a rebound. With buyers jumping back in, XRP could be gearing up for a rally. Mid-Cap Altcoins Might Rise Again The Others/BTC ratio (total crypto market cap excluding the top 10 vs. Bitcoin) shows how well the smaller altcoins perform against BTC. A rising ratio shows that altcoins outperform, while a falling ratio indicates that Bitcoin is leading and altcoins are lagging. Currently, the ratio has hit a key support zone, and if it holds, we could see a surge in small and mid-cap altcoins. But some analysts note that altcoins have hit their weakest point against Bitcoin this entire cycle, and the lowest weekly close since 2021 and a comeback may be far off. 10x Research shared that altcoins are struggling as Bitcoin races past $111,000 on strong ETF and institutional demand. While AAVE and Hyperliquid soared with gains of 13% and 42%, many altcoins like Trump Token, SUI, DOGE, ADA, and LINK faced sharp declines. XRP saw a brief spike but remains weak. Solana and BNB showed mixed results. So, a tough cycle may be ahead for most smaller tokens as Bitcoin continues to dominate.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-29 07:14:09

The crypto market looks ready for another big surge, and this time, the spotlight might shift from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins. There are strong market signals to suggest the next big crypto rally will be the start of a full-blown altcoin season. For one, the amount of Bitcoin sitting on exchanges has kept dropping; a classic sign of a supply squeeze, which often pushes prices higher. But here’s where it gets really interesting for altcoins: Bitcoin’s dominance is slipping, and when that happens altcoins have always started rallying. While Bitcoin still has room to grow (analysts say it could even double), the real talk is around altcoins that could explode 5x, 10x, or even 20x.

The 17th series of bonds, issued on May 29, comes with a face value of $525,000 each and will mature on Nov. 28, 2025. Unlike traditional debt instruments, these bonds yield no interest, allowing Metaplanet to borrow without additional repayment costs. Under the terms, Evo Fund is entitled to early redemption by giving at least five business days’ notice. The bonds can be redeemed in full or in part, in multiples of $525,000. Metaplanet may also trigger redemptions tied to future fundraising rounds involving the same investor, depending on cumulative payments. There is no collateral or guarantee attached to the bonds, and no bond administrator has been appointed, as permitted under Japanese corporate law. The company has designated its Tokyo office as the location for payment handling.

Ethereum, continues to dominate the DeFi and smart contract market, benefiting from recent upgrades aimed at reducing gas fees and improving scalability. Meanwhile, new DeFi-focused altcoin Mutuum Finance is capturing attention with its low market entry and viral growth potential. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.4 million with over 11,300 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. In contrast, Ripple (XRP), despite regulatory clarity and recent exchange relistings, is showing slower momentum. As capital rotates into high-utility tokens, ETH and MUTM appear poised to lead the charge. Ethereum’s 2025 Outlook: Institutional Interest and Upgrades Fuel Bullish Momentum The price of Ethereum is currently $2,565 which represents a 2.58% gain over the previous 24 hours. After the recent Pectra upgrade, Ethereum’s biggest code change since the Merge, investors now have improved staking experiences and new wallet features that make them feel more secure. A rising outlook for Ethereum in the future is expected by investors, as some believe a 2025 altcoin season could push prices up to $7,500. As the U.S. dollar becomes weak, investors are relying on Ethereum as a way to offset the devaluation of fiat currencies, helping the cryptocurrency’s rise. Since Ethereum continues to rise in reputation, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are attracting growing attention in the thriving crypto world. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built not to fall to the collapse risk of its algorithmic counterparts. This transparent and secure architecture, supported by open-source smart contracts and now formally attested through the completion of a Certik audit, guarantees healthy financial transactions. With the intersection of next-generation lending technology and robust infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is reshaping the future of decentralized finance. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.4 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,300 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. Ethereum (ETH) leads with strong fundamentals, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the breakout DeFi star to watch. With $9.4M raised and 11,300+ investors onboard, MUTM is priced at $0.03 ahead of its $0.06 launch—offering early buyers up to 100% gains. Join the presale now before the next price hike.

Huang even argued that Chinese tech has grown more advanced. He said, “The Chinese competitors have evolved,” adding that Huawei Technologies Co., despite US restrictions, has become “quite formidable.” Nvidia’s Huang says Chinese companies are looking for chip manufacturing alternatives Recently, the US government imposed restrictions on Nvidia’s H20 model exports to China, citing concerns of possible military use. The controls have so far cost the company $2.5 billion in the first quarter. For this quarter, the chip maker is expecting a loss of $8 billion. During an earnings call on Wednesday, Huang called for the government to ease its restrictions. He contends that such restrictions should buttress American platforms rather than drive half of the world’s AI talent toward its rivals. In addition, he argued that the controls are not restraining China from leveraging cutting-edge AI tech but are instead pushing consumers to homegrown alternatives. He believes its major clients like Tencent Holdings Ltd have been forced to shift to Huawei products since they cannot rely on their US suppliers. Additionally, Huang clarified that the tech gap between China and America is progressively smaller, saying Chinese companies are “quadrupling capabilities every year.” He noted that Huawei’s newest AI chip rivals the performance of its H200, a top-tier offering until recently replaced. Huang added, “You cannot underestimate the importance of the China market. This is the home of the world’s largest population of AI researchers.” He emphasized that allowing Chinese open-source models like DeepSeek and Qwen to operate on Nvidia chips offers US companies important visibility in global AI development. The Trump administration is considering export controls on EDA technologies to China Aside from restrictions imposed on Nvidia, the Trump administration is considering more controls against Chinese exports. According to sources familiar with the matter, President Donald Trump directed software firms that design semiconductors to stop selling their services to Chinese groups. The US Commerce Department reportedly issued letters to Cadence, Synopsys, and Siemens EDA asking them to halt the supply of their electronic design automation (EDA) technologies. The Commerce Department has not confirmed whether it sent any letters to these companies. However, it claimed that it was assessing exports with strategic implications for China and, in the meantime, has, in some cases, either paused existing licenses or added new licensing conditions. In a call with analysts, Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi claimed he had neither received a letter nor had any recent communication with the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry (BIS) and Security. While policy changes are still uncertain, it’s clear that any move to cut off American software will disrupt Chinese businesses and chip consumers. A former Commerce Department official even claimed that restricting chip and software designs to China is the “true choke point.” He added that they’ve been considering restrictions on EDA tools since the first Trump administration, but they were termed too aggressive. Synopys owes the Chinese market 16% of its yearly revenue, while Cadence depends on the market for at least 12% of its revenue. Moreover, Synopsys still works with Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Intel for its software and hardware. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

However, the initial steps might be tentative. With the current pro-crypto US government and evolving regulatory landscape, large lenders are considering crypto pilot schemes, partnerships and limited crypto trading. Big Banks Hesitate to Venture Heavily into Crypto According to the four unidentified executives, banks are still hesitant to be the first to expand more into crypto. They fear falling into difficulties in case of a change in rules. Firms await to follow major banks venturing into crypto after a few test cases, they added. The pro-crypto stance is encouraging for traditional lenders, said Dario de Martino, from A&O Shearman, M&A partner who works on crypto-related issues. “But they are still approaching it with caution and viewing the changes in regulation as an opportunity to engage and not a free pass,” Martino added. Traditional banking giants JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi and Wells Fargo are considering a consortium-backed stablecoin to compete in the crypto space. #Stablecoin #Banks https://t.co/sWFJQ8R9oD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 23, 2025 Lenders are Likely to Enter into Crypto Custody Through Partnerships The sources further noted that some of the banks are keen on custody businesses to store and manage cryptos. Bankers and executives noted that financial institutions are keen to enter custody businesses through partnerships with existing crypto firms. The increased interest from lenders follows the rescind of controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin – SAB 121 . Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler supported the bulletin, which placed certain accounting burdens on banks that made it difficult for them to provide custody services for digital assets. The rule gained widespread criticism for asking banks that hold crypto to record them as liabilities in their balance sheets. “Traditional banks are slow to adopt crypto due to its complexity,” Gadi Chait, Xapo’s Investment Manager, told Cryptonews in an exclusive interview . “So far, outdated infrastructure, regulatory uncertainty, and internal scepticism have hindered their ability to keep pace with the surging consumer demand for crypto-enabled banking services.” According to Chait, interest from big banks is indicative of a broader trend associated with the institutional adoption of digital assets.

According to recent findings, XRP’s current adoption rate mirrors the internet’s user base as far back as 1992, signaling that the market remains at a nascent stage despite growing global interest in blockchain and crypto technologies. The internet, following its 1991 launch, was initially met with skepticism. Many early media reports downplayed its long-term potential. However, over three decades later, internet adoption has surged to over 5 billion users, or approximately 68% of the global population, based on statistics from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). This historical growth pattern is now being used as a benchmark to evaluate crypto adoption, particularly XRP’s progress. Crypto Market Mirrors 2002 Internet Growth The broader cryptocurrency market has also drawn parallels to the internet’s early growth trajectory. Analysts and enthusiasts are increasingly referencing historical comparisons to argue that digital assets remain in an early phase of adoption. For example, a graphic recently shared by Alpha Lions Academy founder and XRP advocate Edoardo Farina compared the number of current crypto users to internet users in 2002. “He shared a graphic comparing the current number of crypto users with the number of internet users in 2002, both around 560 million,” a report on the disclosure noted. This is how early you are. $XRP pic.twitter.com/Ho4ER24iUi — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 26, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This comparison aligns with the latest Triple-A report, which places the number of global crypto owners at around 560 million as of late 2024. Of these users, 61% are male and 39% female, with the largest demographic (34%) falling within the 25 to 34 age range. This places crypto adoption on par with the internet’s reach at the start of the 21st century, further reinforcing the idea that the industry still has significant room for expansion. XRP Adoption Remains Far Earlier Than Broader Crypto While general crypto adoption may be equivalent to 2002 internet levels, XRP’s specific adoption rate suggests an even earlier position. On-chain metrics show that the number of XRP wallets stands at roughly 6.5 million. While this number does not equate directly to the number of individual users, since many hold multiple wallets, it still offers a reliable estimate for measuring participation in the XRP ecosystem. When compared to historical data from the early internet era, this figure is similar to the internet’s user base in 1992. Back then, the internet had only around 6 to 7 million users globally. That figure has since expanded by over 78,000%, illustrating how much potential growth XRP adoption could experience if it follows a similar curve. Potential Implications for XRP’s Market Outlook The suggestion that XRP’s adoption is currently where the internet was more than 30 years ago has sparked optimistic projections among market watchers. If XRP’s user base expands even fractionally in proportion to historical internet trends, it could lead to increased demand and potential upward price movement. As of now, XRP trades at $2.25.

With Dogecoin news heating up and investors eyeing the charts, the stage is set for a potential shakeup. But while all eyes are on DOGE, a new project, Unilabs , is quietly turning heads. Built on AI-powered strategies and early access tools, insiders believe it could outpace meme coins altogether. DOGE Price Forecast Drops 1.77% Following Musk’s Cut The DOGE price has been moving quietly, but a recent twist involving Elon Musk could change everything. In a cabinet meeting with Donald Trump, Musk shared that Dogecoin is scaling back its big savings goals. In the same Dogecoin news, Musk further revealed that these cuts could lead to better services for everyday Americans. Musk, who’s become the public face of the DOGE team, had once predicted savings as high as $1 trillion. He even mentioned a massive $2 trillion goal while on the campaign trail. Following the Dogecoin news, DOGE moved from $0.160 to $0.226, displaying a 41% upswing within a month. However, analysts believe that the DOGE price is likely to drop to $0.222 by the end of Q4 2025, registering a 1.77% downturn. Source: CoinMarketCap This Dogecoin news leaves DOGE holders in uncertainty. Unilabs, on the other hand, has been on a continuous upward trajectory. Raising more than $1M even before hitting major listings, it offers better prospects. Why Savvy Investors Are Choosing Unilabs Over Dogecoin in 2025 Even though the DOGE price hasn’t brought much excitement to the market lately, Unilabs is stepping up to help investors in the DeFi space. To make the user experience easier, Unilabs has a Stablecoin Savings Account that links digital assets to the U.S. dollar. This account automatically moves users’ money into safe, high-yield DeFi opportunities. That means investors don’t have to stress about market ups and downs or negative Dogecoin news hurting their earnings. Unilabs also boasts a tool called the Flash Loan Accelerator, which helps investors make quick profits through arbitrage. This means traders can buy digital assets at a lower price on one exchange and sell them at a higher price on another, keeping the difference as profit. Another invaluable tool has to be the AI Market Pulse that watches crypto trends in real time. It tracks price movements, market shifts, and investor behavior, allowing users to make smarter decisions faster. With the DOGE price being unpredictable and recent Dogecoin news having investors worried, Market Pulse would have been an instrumental tool. Finally, with Unilabs’ Early Access Scoring System, investors can discover promising crypto projects before they go mainstream. This system ranks new tokens based on their growth potential using real data and not hype. So, while some are still chasing gains in Dogecoin despite the uncertain DOGE price and mixed Dogecoin news, Unilabs users can move early on the next big opportunity. Unilabs Offers Stability and Passive Income Options The Unilabs presale is shaping up to be one of the strongest ICOs of 2025. While the DOGE price remains unpredictable and recent Dogecoin news leaves investors uncertain, Unilabs is gaining attention for all the right reasons. In just a few weeks, Unilabs has raised over $1.2 million and sold over 232 million tokens, each priced at only $0.0051. That gives early buyers a low entry point with the potential for 21% gains as UNIL is expected to ascend to $0.0062 in the next stage. Unlike Dogecoin, which depends heavily on hype and individuals like Elon Musk, Unilabs rewards long-term holders through a 30% fee-sharing system. The more UNIL tokens you buy during the presale, the more passive income you can earn. No trading skills needed.

The shift in investor interest is clear: utility, innovation, and strong growth matter more now than old hype cycles. The numbers speak for themselves. Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC), once seen as top performers, have shown lackluster growth over the past few months. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gone from $0.01 to $0.03 in its presale phases, rewarding early backers with a 3x return. With over $9.35 million already raised and 11,600+ holders onboard, MUTM has clearly become one of the most talked-about DeFi projects in 2025. From zero to DeFi hero Mutuum Finance (MUTM) didn’t rely on social media gimmicks or overblown promises. Instead, the project focused on building a real decentralized lending platform with both pool-based (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) options. That means users can either earn interest through standard liquidity pools or negotiate terms directly with other users. It’s a smart, flexible model that adapts to any investor or trader. In the P2C model, users deposit assets like DAI into a shared pool. The protocol then lends these assets to borrowers, and interest is paid back to the depositors. For instance, putting $3,000 in DAI into the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) P2C pool at a 10% annual rate earns a passive income of $300 per year. No trading is needed. No stress. Just smart DeFi at work. What makes the P2P model even more exciting is that it allows users to work with tokens that are rarely supported on traditional platforms. You can lend or borrow with memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Pepe (PEPE)—something that’s nearly impossible on most DeFi protocols. This ability to reach untouched corners of the crypto market gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a massive edge and explains the growing user adoption. A real platform with real passive income Unlike infrastructure-focused projects like Cardano (ADA) or Polygon (MATIC), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built to deliver real utility directly to users. Rather than functioning as a base-layer blockchain, it operates as a DeFi protocol designed to help users earn and borrow on-chain. That’s exactly why many investors see it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in ahead of launch. When you deposit into the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem, you receive mtTokens. These are tokenized representations of your deposit that grow in value as interest accrues. On top of that, you can stake these mtTokens into safety modules and earn MUTM rewards. The platform uses part of its revenue to buy back tokens from the market and distribute them to stakers. So you’re not only earning interest from lending—you’re stacking more MUTM over time. This model creates two streams of passive income and rewards the long-term investor. That’s why those who understand DeFi are shifting focus away from slow-moving tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC) and turning their attention to MUTM. Another reason why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is outpacing competitors is its secure and transparent design. All deposits live in non-custodial smart contracts. That means no centralized control, and users retain full ownership of their assets. You can withdraw your funds anytime, assuming pool liquidity is available. The smart contracts behind the protocol have already passed a full audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted names in blockchain security. The token scan score is 70.00, which shows strong technical stability and gives investors another reason to feel confident. The team’s approach to borrowing is also refreshingly practical. Users can borrow without selling their assets. If you hold ETH and don’t want to sell at today’s price, you can lock it up as collateral and borrow stablecoins like USDT or DAI. There’s no fixed repayment date—just repay when you’re ready and take your ETH back. This keeps your long-term investments intact while still giving you liquidity to use now. A roadmap built for delivery Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a clear, structured roadmap that the team is executing phase by phase. So far, the project has successfully completed its audit MUTM Smart Contract, launched presale phases, built a growing community, and listed on crypto tracking platforms. The team has already begun working on the core infrastructure of the platform, including backend development and smart contract integration. By the time the token goes live, a beta version of the platform is expected to be up and running. That means users will be able to lend, borrow, earn, and interact with the ecosystem from day one. In addition, the $100,000 giveaway is bringing in a wave of new investors who want to be part of this breakout story. Every new phase adds more holders, more funding, and more real-world progress. Why now is the time to join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently one of the best-performing DeFi tokens in the market. With 165% gains already delivered and a strong lineup of features on the way, it’s showing a level of resilience and growth that few other tokens can match. Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC) are still important projects in the crypto space, but they’re not providing the kind of fresh opportunity that MUTM offers right now. As the presale moves to the next phase, the price will rise. Those who act today get more tokens, higher upside, and a front-row seat to one of the fastest-growing DeFi protocols in crypto.

45236015,https://coinpedia.org/?p=462757,1748504943,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Top Bitcoin Price Predictions from Bitcoin Conference 2025: Experts Forecast $170K to $13M,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-bitcoin-price-predictions-from-bitcoin-conference-2025-experts-forecast-170k-to-13m/,"The post Top Bitcoin Price Predictions from Bitcoin Conference 2025: Experts Forecast $170K to $13M appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas has just concluded. The event witnessed numerous spectacular speeches, as several prominent figures, including JD Vance (the US Vice President), Michael Saylor (the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy), Vlad Tenev (the Chairman and CEO of Robinhood), Adam Back (the CEO of Blockstream), and Paolo Ardoino (the CEO of Tether) participated in it. Historically, major Bitcoin conferences, especially those featuring high-profile speeches, can sometimes lead to increased volatility in the Bitcoin price. In the last seven days, the BTC price has experienced a drop of 3.4%. In the last 24 hours alone, the price has declined by approximately 1.2%. Experts say this price movement may reflect both post-event market corrections and ongoing macroeconomic concerns. For investors, it underscores the importance of approaching bullish predictions with caution, while still recognizing Bitcoin’s long-term potential . Interestingly, during the event, some speakers made exciting predictions about the future prospects of Bitcoin. These predictions not only demonstrate optimism but also reflect emerging shifts in how Bitcoin is being perceived at institutional and governmental levels. Here are some of those striking predictions, along with insights into their broader implications: Top Bitcoin Market Forecasters at Bitcoin Conference 2025 Donald Trump Jr. & Eric Trump Both predicted that Bitcoin could clear $170,000 by the end of 2026. Donald Jr. specifically stated that it could trade between $175,000 and $150,000 by that time. These predictions reflect a growing alignment between political figures and pro-Bitcoin narratives, possibly signaling stronger policy support ahead. Adam Back Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, reiterated his earlier forecast that Bitcoin could hit $1 million if the U.S. establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Such a move could reshape global monetary policy and offer Bitcoin a role comparable to sovereign reserves of gold. Michael Saylor The MicroStrategy co-founder is known for his long-term bullish stance. Earlier, in November, he even called on top tech companies to consider adopting his company’s aggressive Bitcoin purchase strategy . MicroStrategy is the largest public company by BTC holdings. Saylor previously forecasted that BTC could reach $13 million in the next 24 years — a prediction grounded in the idea that Bitcoin will become the primary global store of value. Arthur Hayes Arthur Hayes, the CIO of Maelstrom, repeated his prediction at the event that the Bitcoin price could hit $1 million by 2028 . His prediction is based on the expectation that the U.S. will need to significantly increase dollar liquidity, potentially devaluing fiat and boosting demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin. David Sacks David Sacks, the AI & Crypto Czar at The White House, hinted that the U.S. government may be exploring Bitcoin purchases , stating: “The Treasury and Commerce Departments are exploring budget-neutral ways to acquire Bitcoin without raising taxes or debt.” If realized, such initiatives could further legitimize Bitcoin’s role in national financial strategies. Bo Hines Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Asset at The White House, emphasized the administration’s commitment to Bitcoin. He stated that the U.S. government has no intention to sell its Bitcoin holdings and aims to accumulate more through strategic reserves — a move that could indicate Bitcoin’s integration into long-term national asset planning. Conclusion In conclusion, the Bitcoin Conference 2025 showcased bold predictions and growing institutional interest, highlighting Bitcoin’s rising role in global finance . With projections ranging from $170,000 to $13 million, influential voices suggest a bullish long-term outlook, especially amid signals of potential U.S. government involvement in strategic Bitcoin accumulation and policy support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The firm plans to use the BTC reserve to launch new financial products in the Nordic market. K33 joins a global trend of public companies turning to Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Norwegian crypto brokerage K33 is the latest firm to embrace Bitcoin as a treasury asset, raising 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to fund its entry into the growing circle of publicly-backed BTC holders. The Oslo-based company announced on May 28 that it secured the funding through a combination of convertible loans and a new share-and-warrant issuance. The entire amount will be used to purchase Bitcoin as part of K33’s newly launched Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. K33 Secures $6.2M in Zero-Interest Loans and Equity to Fund Bitcoin Push The financing includes 45 million SEK ($4.6 million) in zero-interest convertible loans maturing in June 2028, and an additional 15 million SEK ($1.5 million) raised through equity instruments. Investors who convert their warrants before March 2026 will receive bonus warrants, potentially increasing K33’s raise to 75 million SEK ($7.7 million). CEO Bull Jenssen, writing on X, described Bitcoin as the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and confirmed that the company intends to “accumulate as many as possible.” He positioned the move as a proactive step, saying: “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build your own?” At Bitcoin’s current price of around $108,000, the firm could buy approximately 57 BTC. Beyond holding, K33 plans to leverage its Bitcoin reserve to launch BTC-backed financial products, including lending services, particularly within the Nordic market. In its Q1 interim report released the same day, Jenssen emphasized the strategic value of Bitcoin beyond its potential returns. “With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams, product capabilities, and partnerships,” he wrote.

GameStop and France’s Blockchain Group are recent examples, the latter saw its stock skyrocket over 200% in a single day following its BTC pivot in November 2024. However, K33’s own stock showed a more muted response, closing down nearly 2% on the day of the announcement. Market watchers will now be observing whether the Bitcoin bet translates into longer-term gains, both for the firm’s balance sheet and its share price. Crypto Firms Tap Capital Markets to Fuel Bitcoin Buying Spree Digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. This week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint. Just recently, French crypto holding company Blockchain Group announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy.

Despite the small retracement, analyst Crypto Jelle considers that Bitcoin’s trend into price discovery remains “intact,” pointing out that price has been consolidating above the previous highs. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern in the lower timeframes, with the upper boundary sitting between the $109,00-$110,000 mark. To Jelle, the cryptocurrency is “building pressure for the next leg higher,” with a breakout propelling the cryptocurrency to another 30% rally. The analyst previously highlighted a Power of 3 (Po3) formation in BTC’s chart, suggesting that its price expansion targets the $140,000-$150,000 level after reclaiming the new ATH resistance. Ali Martinez stated that BTC remains “range-bound” despite today’s price drop, but added that the range’s low is the key level to watch. He warned that a breakdown below the $106,800 support could trigger increased volatility, which might send BTC’s price to lower levels. BTC Retest To Trigger Volatility? Titan of Crypto also affirmed that Bitcoin currently sits at a key level. According to the market watcher’s analysis, BTC is “still hovering around the daily Tenkan,” which is the level to watch during the potential volatility from the FOMC Minutes. A breakdown from this support zone could send the cryptocurrency’s price to the next key support at around the $102,700 mark. On the contrary, holding the current levels could set the stage for a new retest of the range’s upper boundary. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades noted that as Bitcoin consolidates near ATHs, BTC-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen significant inflows over the past few weeks, recording their second-best performance last week. As he explained, one of the cycle’s better “indicators” to determine strength or weakness at local tops or bottoms has been the ETF flows, detailing that, generally, big inflows after a big run, while BTC’s price doesn’t continue its rally, have suggested a local top. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst To the trader, “it is important for the bulls to get that move going quickly because getting billions of inflows without proper price progress isn’t generally the best,” adding that “for the effort that’s put in and an ATH break, you’d want to see more.” Daan considers that if the massive inflows stop and BTC’s price holds, then its short-term performance will likely continue. However, if price doesn’t hold its current range, “we might need to see a bit of a flush & panic first before the proper breakout move.” As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $107,700, a 1.6% decrease in the weekly chart.

33767162,[object Object],1748505619,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"GameStop Diversifies With 4,710 Bitcoin—Smart Hedge Or Risky Play?",https://bitcoinist.com/gamestop-diversifies-with-4710-btc-smart-hedge-or-risky-play/,"GameStop made headlines this week when it confirmed a major Bitcoin purchase. The retailer bought 4,710 BTC for about $513 million. The money came from cash raised in March through a $1.4 billion convertible notes sale. This is the first time GameStop has put crypto on its balance sheet. High Stakes Crypto Purchase According to a company statement, GameStop used part of its debt proceeds to buy Bitcoin . That $1.4 billion note sale was meant to give the company more options beyond video games and accessories. Now, almost half a billion dollars sits in crypto. It’s a bold move for a chain that’s still known for its physical stores and brick-and-mortar footprint. Share Price Swings And Investor Response Based on reports, talk of a crypto push sent GameStop’s shares higher early this year. Rumors in February drove the stock up about 18%. Then in March, when management first mentioned a possible crypto plan, shares jumped another 10%. On May 27, the stock closed at $35. In pre-market trading the next day, it was at $36.30. Over the past month, GameStop shares have risen around 28%. For the year, they are up about 11%. Retail Sales Continue To Slide GameStop’s core business hasn’t been as lucky. The latest quarter showed a 25% drop in revenue compared to the same period last year. That kind of slide makes it tough to justify a high valuation. At more than 100× trailing earnings, the company trades like a high-growth tech firm, not a retail chain with falling sales. Some investors worry that the Bitcoin play is a distraction from shoring up the basics of the store business. Debt Load Raises Concerns Using debt to buy crypto adds another layer of risk. Convertible notes can turn into shares if the stock price hits certain levels. That dilutes existing shareholders. If Bitcoin takes a dive, GameStop could face paper losses on its $513 million investment. At the same time, it still needs to manage the cost of its debt and keep the lights on in its stores. GameStop’s bet on Bitcoin shows just how far the company is willing to go to shake off its image as a fading retailer. The play could pay off if crypto keeps rallying. But it could also backfire if Bitcoin tumbles or the core business doesn’t recover. Either way, this move will be watched closely by both crypto fans and long-time GameStop customers.

The posted addresses follow a recent refusal by Michael Saylor to reveal an on-chain proof of the company’s holdings. Arkham Intelligence has posted multiple wallets reportedly belonging to Strategy (MSTR). Previously, Arkham shared smaller holdings, but recently increased its efforts to track down the real on-chain portfolio of Strategy. Arkham revealed 87.5% of Strategy’s BTC holdings, including some real-time purchase transactions. | Source: Arkham Intelligence The disclosures by Arkham of the public blockchain were seen as pressure for transparency. Even Michael Saylor stated he preferred the addresses to remain confidential. There is still no consensus on the need for on-chain transparency. Security threats include dust addresses, which rely on a human mistake to transfer funds to the attacker’s wallet. Public addresses also invite transfers from small-scale projects, including prank NFT transactions . However, other BTC holdings have been transparent for years with no problems, especially the widely watched WBTC treasury. The interactions and purchase style of Strategy may also be watched and affect the market, further swaying BTC prices. Dusting wallets may also link them to mixers or exploit addresses, making it more complex for the company to prove compliance. In general, crypto transactions are still unregulated, but there are attempts to declare the origin of coins and link them to identities where possible. Strategy also relies on the announcement effect, after buying BTC at market prices, but without disclosing each purchase. The ability of anyone to notice and track the purchases in real time may erase that effect for BTC and the MSTR stock price. Strategy has also mostly accumulated BTC with no signs of selling, which could be seen as a vote of no-confidence for the leading coin. Arkham’s research reveals no purchases for days Arkham Intelligence announced all addresses hold over 454.23 BTC. The latest purchase was from five days ago, originating from Coinbase Prime. The purchases may yet be completed through other wallets, as Arkham has not exhausted the search. New wallets can also be generated, or other forms of custody. Holding BTC in third-party custody is also seen as a potential risk, as the coins are exposed to the exchange or service levels of security. Reportedly, Strategy uses mostly Coinbase Prime and Fidelity for its holdings. The Coinbase Prime funds can be segregated, but Fidelity mixes all coins and the exact share of Strategy remains uncertain. Based on Arkham’s report, Strategy holds over 327K BTC with Coinbase Prime, with up to 107K held in Fidelity wallets. On the other hand, Metaplanet has been entirely transparent with its holdings of 7,800 BTC. The Japanese company uses a self-custodial wallet to withdraw from exchanges. Other treasury holders also have known on-chain presence, with inflows from mining also reflected in their balances. Most corporate and other large-scale treasuries remain transparent, currently holding 3.37M BTC. The holdings are seen as a signal for long-term confidence and the use case of BTC as a reserve asset, especially after the addresses remain dormant with no selling. Despite the data of slower purchases, Strategy marked the success of its STRK preferred shares. The asset climbed continuously to over $102, trading at a six-month peak. MSTR common shares fell toward $364.52, as BTC moved down from its peak to the $107,000 range. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In a recent video posted to X, Steph pointed out that XRP has broken back above the weekly trend ribbon—a signal that previously led to a large price surge. According to the analyst, this technical breakout marks a confirmed bullish trend. Steph emphasized that the last time this occurred was at the beginning of November. The chart shown in the video supports this claim, displaying a similar breakout in November 2024 that led to a sharp price increase. From that point, XRP rose from approximately $0.55 to $3.39 by January, marking a gain of over 500%. #XRP Will 20-50X! pic.twitter.com/Uj44D3v2Ou — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 27, 2025 Comparison to Previous Breakout Pattern The chart analysis shows that XRP’s recent movement closely mirrors the structure seen in late 2024. This historical reference is critical as it offers context to the present price action and strengthens the case for a potential rally. During the previous instance, the breakout above the trend ribbon was followed by sustained bullish momentum. The asset continued climbing for several weeks, eventually reaching a high that outperformed many major cryptocurrencies during the same period. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Potential Targets The current pattern appears to be unfolding similarly, with XRP currently trading at $2.25. If it repeats its 500% surge from the previous breakout, it could rise to $13.5. However, Steph suggests an even bigger breakout. His post suggests a 20x to 50x breakout, putting XRP’s potential price between $45 and $112.5, much higher than many anticipate. Other analysts have shared targets of $100 and above. While some detractors believe the asset’s market capitalization will limit its growth, experts have debunked this claim, explaining that the market cap doesn’t matter . Market Outlook Moving Forward While broader market conditions will inevitably influence XRP’s performance, the technical setup presented by Steph is drawing attention to the asset’s potential. The alignment of recent price action with a historically bullish pattern provides a clear framework for analysis, especially for traders who prioritize trend confirmation and breakout strategies. XRP is also in a good position to capitalize on a breakout as the SEC and Ripple are close to the end of their long-running legal dispute . The end of the lawsuit could give XRP significant momentum, making the 20-50x surge more likely. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The move comes at a time when several countries, including the U.S., European Union, Japan, and the UK, have placed strict sanctions on Russia , many of them targeting digital assets and crypto usage. So, what exactly does this mean for the market and investors? Russia Allows Crypto-Linked Products In a statement released this week , the Bank of Russia confirmed that financial institutions are now allowed to offer products that are linked to cryptocurrency prices. These include derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets. But there’s a catch, these products cannot be settled in actual crypto. In short, investors won’t be receiving Bitcoin or Ethereum but only products tied to their price movements. And these products won’t be for everyone. Only “qualified investors,” a restricted group with the required experience and financial background, will be able to trade them. The Bank of Russia has announced it will allow financial institutions to offer crypto-linked derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets to qualified investors. These must be non-deliverable products, meaning investors won't directly receive crypto.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 Strict Controls and Risk Warnings Even with this new step, the Russian central bank isn’t diving into crypto without a safety net. It told banks and other credit institutions to be extremely careful with these products. They must fully back these instruments with capital and also set limits to avoid big risks. Over the coming year, the Bank of Russia also plans to formalize rules that would better manage risks tied to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices. Global Pressure Through Sanctions Many countries have already cracked down on Russia’s use of digital assets. After the Ukraine conflict, the U.S., EU, Japan, and the UK imposed sanctions that also covered crypto to prevent Russia from using it as a loophole to move money. Because of this, Russia has been trying to find new ways to explore the digital finance world without breaking global rules. Russia BTC Holding Even though crypto rules in Russia aren’t very clear, the country has a lot of Bitcoin. The Central Bank of Russia and some government offices have gotten bitcoin either by buying it directly or by seizing it from criminal activities.

On Wednesday, the central bank said financial institutions in Russia can now offer their wealthiest and most experienced clients access to crypto-linked investments. This decision, according to a press release from the Bank of Russia, allows licensed firms to provide non-deliverable products—things like derivatives and securities—whose returns depend on crypto prices. But investors won’t actually receive any crypto. The whole system has been built to keep coins out of clients’ hands. This isn’t open season for crypto in Russia though. The central bank made it clear that only qualified investors will be allowed to touch these products. Every bank offering them has to apply strict risk controls, fully cover these investments with capital, and set individual limits on exposure. The Bank said it plans to formalize this conservative approach later in the year, building a regulatory framework around the price volatility of crypto. At the same time, it warned both institutions and their clients to stay away from direct crypto purchases, repeating its long-standing position against retail trading. Government considers crypto sandbox, Sberbank joins regulated exchanges The Russian government is currently reviewing a proposal from the Bank of Russia to create a testing zone for actual crypto transactions. The idea is to launch a special regime where only certain investors will be allowed to buy or sell crypto directly. That plan was introduced in March, and if approved, will run for three years under a system called the EPR, or experimental legal regime. Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, told the Russian Stock Market 2025 conference on May 16 that the crypto market needs both new laws and stronger infrastructure before it can grow in Russia. She said the EPR would only be open to investors who pass strict qualifications. According to the plan, anyone who wants to join the sandbox must hold more than 100 million rubles in securities and deposits or make at least 50 million rubles per year. Nabiullina also said discussions are ongoing about how to finalize those rules, and the government is expected to help speed that process. While the Bank works on tightening the rules, Russia’s biggest lender is already preparing to step in. Alexander Zozulya, head of global markets at Sberbank, said the bank plans to act as a liquidity provider for the country’s regulated crypto platforms. These platforms are being designed exclusively for highly vetted investors, not for the public. “We will serve as a market maker on these regulated exchanges,” Zozulya said, adding that the goal is to bring structure and reliability to crypto trading within approved limits. Trump fuels Russian crypto surge, oil companies use bitcoin in trade The Bank of Russia also pointed to a massive surge in crypto activity coming from inside the country. Over the last quarter of 2024 and the first three months of 2025, crypto flows tied to Russian residents increased by over 51% compared to the previous six months. The Bank reported that Russians moved 7.3 trillion rubles, or around $91 billion, through major global crypto exchanges during that time. The Bank said that President Donald Trump’s administration is boosting international confidence in crypto, which is helping attract Russian interest. Trump’s support for Bitcoin has had an effect across global markets, with Russia being one of the countries responding fastest. Crypto is also now part of Russia’s foreign trade strategy. Many Russian oil companies have started using bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins like Tether to deal with China and India. These tokens help them convert yuan and rupees into rubles, especially in deals that bypass Western banking systems. Though still small, this crypto-based method is growing as part of Russia’s $192 billion oil trade, according to the International Energy Agency.

Binance and CZ still openly endorsed him during the… pic.twitter.com/DFSUEchvvB — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) May 28, 2025 Crypto analyst Wise Advice expressed disappointment in Binance for supporting Hasbulla during a recent event. He pointed out that Hasbulla had previously launched a memecoin called BARSIK, which disappeared without any explanation after launch. Now, with BULLA in the spotlight, he fears the same trick is being played again. He called out a familiar pattern that includes using a famous face, promising big things, and then vanishing once retail investors put in their money. Wise Advice also criticized Binance founder CZ for backing a project tied to someone with a known track record of rug pulls. He believes the platform should not give exposure to such tokens, especially when many inexperienced investors get caught in the hype. What’s Brewing Inside? Blockchain investigator ZachXBT also came forward with strong concerns. He accused the BULLA team of deleting important messages and offering zero transparency about the token’s plans or structure. When he asked questions, the team reportedly banned him from the group instead of providing answers. @zachxbt called out the $Bulla team (yep, the Hasbulla meme token) for scamming presale investors. He pointed to deleted messages and zero transparency. Instead of a real answer, they banned him. Famous face or not, a meme coin stays a meme coin. Same old “take the money and… pic.twitter.com/60CCipIrw0 — Teazelbtc (@Teazelbtc) May 28, 2025 Another Crypto user, Teazelbtc, supported Zach’s claims and reminded followers that a memecoin, no matter how famous the face behind it, is still a memecoin. He called it the same old trick of taking money from investors and disappearing without fulfilling any promises. Investors Urged to Be Cautious With these warnings surfacing, more crypto users are now urging caution. The mix of celebrity hype and lack of accountability is proving dangerous for everyday investors. While the BULLA team has yet to respond publicly, the growing criticism shows that trust is quickly eroding. As always, experts advise investors to do their own research and not to be swayed by celebrity influence when it comes to risky assets like memecoins. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
