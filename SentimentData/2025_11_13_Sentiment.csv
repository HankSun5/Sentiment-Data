Ethereum ETFs see $107 million in outflows, weighing on broader sentiment. Key support sits at $2.38, with resistance at $2.59 and $2.70. By Jainam Mehta ​XRP ( XRP-USD ) rose 1.8% to trade near $2.42 on Wednesday, holding above its ascending support line as it reclaimed short-term moving averages on the 4-hour chart. The rebound follows a week of volatility across the crypto market, with Ethereum ETFs recording $107 million in outflows on November 11—their largest in weeks—prompting speculation that liquidity may be rotating toward alternative assets like XRP. From a technical perspective, XRP remains within a rising structure that has persisted since late October. The 20-, 50-, and 100-period EMAs cluster between $2.41–$2.43, forming a tight confluence zone. A decisive close above this range could unlock upside potential toward $2.59, the previous local high and upper Bollinger Band level. Beyond that, $2.70 marks the next resistance zone, where prior rallies have consistently stalled. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Immediate support is seen at $2.38, followed by the ascending trendline base near $2.26, a level that has repeatedly attracted buying interest. The Bollinger Bands have begun to widen, signaling a potential increase in volatility after several sessions of compression. The RSI remains neutral, suggesting the current upward drift could extend if price action holds above the moving average cluster. The broader tone remains cautiously constructive. XRP’s resilience relative to other large-cap altcoins suggests short-term stability, especially as market participants await confirmation of stronger inflows or trend continuation. Ethereum outflows and capital rotation shape sentiment Market data from CoinGlass shows persistent net outflows from Ethereum spot exchanges, totaling $22.7 million on November 12. A significant factor was BlackRock’s $19.8 million Ethereum sale, which contributed to total ETF redemptions exceeding $107 million in a single session. These outflows underline a period of defensive positioning among institutional investors, particularly within the smart contract and DeFi segment, which has experienced weaker fund inflows since late October. In contrast, XRP’s steadier structure and lower speculative leverage have made it an attractive alternative for traders seeking relative stability amid sector-wide volatility. While Ethereum continues to dominate market headlines—especially after Fundstrat’s Tom Lee reiterated a forecast calling for ETH to reach $9,000–$12,000 in early 2026—short-term fund movements reflect a tactical rebalancing rather than broad bullish conviction. If this rotation persists, XRP could benefit from incremental capital flows, particularly as the asset continues to maintain key structural support and shows less liquidation pressure than high-beta peers. Outlook XRP’s technical bias remains mildly bullish above $2.38, though a breakout above $2.59 is required to confirm trend reversal momentum. The rising support line near $2.26 remains the critical invalidation level for buyers. If the base holds, the next upside target sits near $2.70, while failure to sustain above $2.43 could reopen downside pressure toward $2.26. Previously discussed analysis identified the $2.60 region as the decisive barrier separating consolidation from breakout. That outlook remains unchanged. Sustained strength above that level would mark a clear shift in sentiment , aligning XRP’s recovery with improving sector liquidity trends.

In 2017, Ethereum transformed a few hundred dollars into life-changing wealth. Solana followed in 2021, rising from under a dollar to over $200. Now, analysts suggest that RentStac (RNS) could be next, applying the same principle of scarcity and timing but with real-world assets supporting its growth. Unlike speculative projects that depend solely on market hype, RentStac bridges decentralized finance with verified rental income. It is designed to connect digital tokens with property-backed value, making it one of the few DeFi ecosystems that merge blockchain scalability with real economic output. Lessons from the Past History shows that wealth in crypto often starts with small, early investments in projects that solve real problems. Ethereum introduced programmable contracts. Solana proved that speed could scale blockchain. RentStac builds on both ideas by using blockchain to distribute income from tokenized rental properties. Through RentStac , investors can access legally registered SPVs that hold income-generating assets. Rental profits are distributed on-chain in stablecoins, combining transparency with consistent yield potential. Why RentStac Stands Out Many DeFi projects promise high rewards but lack structure. RentStac’s system is built for sustainability. Holders earn yield in two ways: through staking rewards and through income derived from real-world properties. This dual-yield mechanism creates an ecosystem that rewards both long-term holders and active participants. The platform’s deflationary design, combined with transparent property reporting, positions it among the few DeFi models with measurable fundamentals instead of speculative buzz. Key Presale Data The project operates on verified metrics published openly on its website: Total supply: 2,000,000,000 RNS Presale allocation: 40% (about 800 million tokens) Target funding: $27.45 million over 7 stages Current price: $0.025 per token Active bonus: 100% additional tokens for early buyers These parameters are publicly accessible on RentStac.com and ensure accountability throughout each phase of the presale. A Simple Example: $100 Today At the current price of $0.025, a $100 investment buys 4,000 RNS tokens. With the 100 percent bonus for early participants, that number doubles to 8,000 tokens. If RNS reaches a future market price of $1, the original $100 position would be worth $8,000. Should it follow the path of early DeFi leaders like Solana, which multiplied over 200 times, that same entry could theoretically approach $20,000. This example demonstrates the power of timing and real-world backing in a presale structured for growth and transparency. Security and Real-World Connection Security is central to RentStac’s foundation. The project scored 92.48 percent on Solidity Scan, with a full CertiK audit in progress. Each property is managed through a dedicated SPV, providing legal verification and independent oversight. RentStac also uses multi-signature wallets, DAO-based voting, and oracle validation to maintain transparency in property performance and token distribution. This framework ensures every transaction is verifiable and tied to real-world value. A New Direction for DeFi As the DeFi sector matures, investors are seeking more than hype. They want yield backed by real income streams and assets that can outlast volatility. RentStac’s model brings together blockchain innovation and tangible economics, offering a structure that appeals to both retail and institutional players. With a fixed supply, a transparent presale, and property-backed returns, RentStac (RNS) represents a potential milestone in the evolution of decentralized finance and one of the most promising opportunities in 2025.

54324166,626176,1762988413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54324166.jpeg,Is the XRP ETF About to Get Approved? Bipartisan Senate Vote Could Reopen US Government,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-bipartisan-senate-vote/,"The XRP community might finally have a reason to celebrate as the United States Senate has just voted 60-40 to advance a bill that would reopen the federal government, a major step toward ending the longest shutdown in American history. This vote could be the moment everything changes for the crypto market, and especially for holders. Now that lawmakers are working to restore government operations, the next outlook is what could come next once the SEC returns to full capacity, and it opens up the question of whether Spot XRP ETFs will soon get approved. Senate Vote Brings Hope for XRP ETF Decisions Monday’s 60-40 Senate vote brought a sigh of relief to markets and set the stage for a final House vote as early as Wednesday. The bipartisan measure, if approved, will unlock government funding and allow regulators, including the SEC, to resume their normal operations after more than a month of near standstill. During the shutdown, SEC staff responsible for reviewing ETF filings were furloughed, effectively freezing dozens of applications from major asset managers. This included those for Dogecoin , Cardano, Solana, and most notably, XRP ETFs, which had already crossed their decision deadlines in October. It is important to note that the agency had issued new procedural guidelines for ETF filings shortly before the shutdown to make approvals much easier and faster, but the freeze effectively stalled all progress. Although there is still work to be done for the shutdown to end, the focus is now on how quickly the SEC will resume its backlog once operations restart. There is enough optimism that the XRP ETF filings, which have witnessed significant public attention, could be among the first to move forward once reviews begin again. Spot ETFs Waiting For the Green Light XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap (minus stablecoin USDT), so it is only natural that it becomes the next cryptocurrency with tradable Spot ETFs in the US market. Several major firms have filed for spot XRP ETFs over the past few months, hoping to bring the same level of institutional exposure to the altcoin that Bitcoin and Ethereum are enjoying. Among those in line are Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares. These issuers had expected SEC responses in October, but the government shutdown disrupted the timeline. There are already different XRP futures and leveraged ETFs available , but they do not cause the same sort of buying pressure as Spot XRP ETFs. Unlike futures-based ETFs, Spot ETFs actually hold the underlying asset, in this case, XRP. That means investors could gain direct exposure through traditional brokerage accounts without holding the tokens themselves. The market impact could be massive once these Spot ETFs are approved. Institutional demand flows in once a regulated product becomes available, just as it did with Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Therefore, Spot XRP ETFs will mean a rise in price and liquidity for the cryptocurrency.",XRP|ETF|ETF news|ripple|ripple news|XRP ETF|XRP ETF news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-12 23:00:13

Prices are not shooting higher yet. At press time Bitcoin trades around $104,500, down 0.5% over the past day. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst Traders watched a decline of about 1.8% earlier that pushed the price near $103,400 and it briefly touched $102,850 during the move. Stablecoin Signal Points Toward Accumulation CryptoQuant analyst Moreno points to the Stablecoin Supply Ratio, or SSR, as the first clear indicator. The SSR compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the total market cap of stablecoins. It has dropped back into the 13 range. Based on historical readings, that 13 area has lined up with market lows in mid-2021 and at several moments across 2024. Reports show that when SSR fell to similar levels, liquidity quietly built up and buying followed after a period of low volatility. Liquidity Pattern Has Appeared Before Every Bitcoin Surge — And It’s Back “We’re witnessing a liquidity configuration that has only appeared a handful of times since 2020, and each instance marked a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s trajectory.” – By @MorenoDV_ pic.twitter.com/vWKcCkyn55 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 11, 2025 Binance Reserve Trends Add A Second Layer The second metric Moreno highlights comes from Binance. On that exchange, stablecoin balances are rising while Bitcoin reserves are shrinking. In plain terms: more cash-like tokens sit on the exchange and fewer coins are being held there. That pattern has appeared only a handful of times since 2020, according to the data he referenced. Each time, the movement suggested capital waiting on the sidelines and holders moving coins off exchanges into longer-term storage. Market Calm Can Hide Big Moves The current trading backdrop is cautious. Many investors expected a lift after news that the US Congress approved short-term federal funding through January 30, yet crypto did not rally with other risk assets. Some capital rotated back to stocks. At the same time, large holders took profits after recent highs, and momentum cooled. That mix shows how macro events can shift flows without immediately turning into crypto buying. Risk Still Exists — Structure Could Break Moreno warns this liquidity zone acts like a final structural support. If the metrics break down decisively, it could signal a deeper reset before any sustained recovery. In that scenario, buying would likely be delayed and volatility would rise. This is not a guaranteed outcome, but it is a clear risk that traders watch closely. Outlook: Limited Downside, Growing Upside Based on reports and on-chain signals, Moreno believes the risk-to-reward favors buyers at these levels. He points to the built-up stablecoin supply and falling exchange BTC reserves as reasons for that view. Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Historical patterns suggest the last three months of the year often bring gains for Bitcoin, but past behavior does not promise future returns. For now, the indicators show capital parked in stablecoins and fewer coins available on major exchanges. That creates a setup where fresh buying could push the market higher quickly if sentiment turns. Yet the opposite is possible: a break below these levels would reshape the cycle and force many participants to rethink positions. Markets will decide which path comes next.

SEC Chair Paul Atkins Weighs Token Taxonomy Speaking at The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s FinTech Conference on November 12, Atkins announced that he is weighing the creation of a token taxonomy “anchored in the longstanding Howey investment contract securities analysis” as the next phase of the SEC’s “Project Crypto” initiative. I was honored to give the keynote at the @PhiladelphiaFed ’s Ninth Annual Fintech Conference this morning. My remarks outlined the next steps in the @SECgov ’s Project Crypto and what to expect in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/WI79ANJrfD — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) November 12, 2025 While Atkins assured that the taxonomy “aims to complement, not replace, Congress’s critical work,” he said that he views most crypto tokens as non-securities . Atkins declared that he believes digital commodities, digital collectibles, and digital tools do not constitute securities, while tokenized securities do, as they “represent the ownership of a financial instrument enumerated in the definition of ‘security’ that is maintained on a crypto network.” “A reasonable Commission approach to crypto will not by itself decide the fate of the market—or of any particular project,” Atkins said. “Markets will do that.” “But it will help to ensure that the United States remains a place where people can experiment and learn, fail and succeed, under rules that are both firm and fair,” he added. New Crypto Market Structure Draft Outlines SEC, CFTC Collaboration Atkins’ commentary comes just days after Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) announced their own crypto market structure legislation discussion draft. The draft specifically orders the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to “collaborate on necessary inter-agency rulemakings.” “As Congress works to expand authority for the commission to oversee the trading of digital assets that are commodities, it’s essential that we also ensure it has the tools, personnel, and resources necessary to carry out this new mission, along with its current responsibilities,” Boozman said.

Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity are choosing Ethereum to power their real-world asset (RWA) offerings — a major sign of growing trust from traditional finance. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund, for example, tokenizes U.S. Treasury bonds directly on Ethereum, letting investors earn yield through decentralized rails. This rising institutional adoption is one of the strongest signals yet that Ethereum’s long-term trajectory could still be just getting started. The total assets under management (AUM) of these products have increased by an eye-popping 2,000% since January 2024, according to data from Token Terminal. This emphasizes institutions’ growing interest in tokenization. A report from Fidelity Digital Assets in early October highlighted that “beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, some of the most noteworthy developments in digital assets are happening in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).” Ethereum’s lead in this market gives it a unique edge that favors a bullish outlook for its native asset. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Needs a Clean Breakout Above $3,700 to Resume Its Rally ETH found support at the $3,200 level in the past few days. Market volatility has spiked, and trading volumes have exceeded the average as the token struggles to recapture the $4,000 area. The price has retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) multiple times lately but has failed to move above it multiple times. A descending price channel has also been forminig since early October as ETH failed to make it to $5,000. The end of the U.S. government shutdown could help Ethereum break out of its descending price channel and resume its upward trajectory to $4,700. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just sent a buy signal upon crossing above the 14-day moving average. If positive momentum accelerates, a break above $3,700 would mark the beginning of its next leg up. As crypto markets bounce back, early presales with strong utility like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could deliver the biggest upside. This ambitious project brings Solana-level speed and low fees to Bitcoin, unlocking the network’s full potential with the first true scaling solution.

The traders who win 2026 won’t be the ones chasing the noisiest charts—they’ll be the ones turning tight spreads, reliable depth, and disciplined risk into steady, repeatable outcomes. That’s where FX quietly outclasses crypto. If you’re building a daily playbook, pressure-test ideas against external filters to avoid narrative traps. Many desks also benchmark BTC/alt flow and session bias via crypto signals telegram before committing real capital, using it as one of several sanity checks rather than a crutch, according to Coinspot , the fast-growing crypto media. Why FX’s “small edges” add up faster in 2026 • Execution survives stress. Event-time liquidity in major pairs means you can size conviction without fills becoming the trade’s biggest risk.• Costs compound. Lower spread + impact + slippage create a structural advantage over hundreds of tickets.• More ways to be right. Policy divergence, terms of trade, and cross-pair rotation offer edges beyond a single “risk-on/risk-off” call. Where crypto still wins—and how to use it wisely • Right-tail convexity: When flows align, momentum can sprint—treat it as a tactical sleeve sized by realized vol.• Idiosyncratic catalysts: Upgrades and tokenomics shifts create event trades off the standard macro calendar.• 24/7 access (with rules): Useful flexibility, but manage weekend gaps and venue fragmentation with defined-risk structures. FX Playbook for 2026 (Do, Don’t, and How) 1) Carry—with guardrails • Do: Target positive real-rate differentials; scale with volatility targeting.• Don’t: Overstay when guidance flips or realized vol spikes.• How: Pre-set cut rules (e.g., two-vol move or guidance change). 2) Event-driven execution • Do: Treat CPI, labor prints, and central-bank days as opportunity maps.• Don’t: Wing it; slippage limits must be written down.• How: Bracket entries, define max impact per ticket, and prewrite exit logic. 3) Pair selection > beta • Do: Hunt relative divergence across G10 and selective EM.• Don’t: Force a single USD narrative to fit every week.• How: Maintain a rotation board (strong/neutral/weak) refreshed after each macro block. 4) XAUUSD as a regime compass • Do: Let gold’s trend inform risk stance in both FX and crypto sleeves.• Don’t: Treat it as dogma—use it to pace aggression, not to predict. Crypto Tactics that actually survive the year • Vol-targeted sizing: Keep exposure proportional to realized vol; adjust quickly on regime change.• Staggered entries/exits: Ladder positions; use time/vol bands for exits to dodge thin-book whipsaws.• Defined-risk optionality: Options/spreads capture upside while capping gap risk. Costs & controls: the overlooked alpha • Track after-cost performance (spread + impact + slippage) per strategy.• Sunset systems that earn less than they cost to run—even if screenshots look great.• Review fills weekly; promote playbooks that keep net efficiency above your hurdle. A portfolio that compounds (not just pops) • Core: FX carry/relative-value/event strategies for steady Sharpe and scalable size.• Tactical: A lean crypto sleeve for momentum bursts, sized by vol and protected by options where sensible.• Overlay: Regime reads from XAUUSD and EUR/USD trend structure to throttle risk. Execution checklist (pin this) • Pre-define maximum slippage per instrument; skip trades that breach it.• Pre-fund collateral to avoid forced exits in stress windows.• Keep event playbooks: what to trade, how to size, where to cut, how to re-enter.• Log and audit after-cost PnL—the only number that compounds. Risks that can flip your board • Policy shocks: Tariffs, sanctions, capital controls—FX reprices first; crypto follows via sentiment.• Liquidity air-pockets: Weekends (crypto) and surprise data (FX) stretch spreads—plan exits before entries.• Rule changes: Constructive long-term, choppy short-term; edges migrate as spreads compress.

Prices have struggled to rise in the face of AI-bubble fears in recent weeks, with Bitcoin and Ethereum down by 9% and 16% in the last 30 days. This may be disappointing for investors, yet most major tokens are now in oversold territory, meaning that they should bounce back soon. And one of the most promising coins in such a context is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based token that’s about to launch crypto’s mine-to-earn platform. Best Altcoin to Buy Today – 12 November Opened in September, PEPENODE’s presale has now raised in excess of $2.1 million, as investors race to buy its native token at discounted prices. While the market is awash in meme coins, what sets PEPENODE apart from the crowd is the fact that it carries some interesting tokenomics and fundamentals. PEPENODE is building something special from the ground up. Buy Meme Nodes. Upgrade Facilities. Earn meme Coins. All on one platform https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/JUTG2F6eXG — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 11, 2025 In particular, it will launch a mine-to-earn token that will provide users with the ability to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, which can earn them rewards in third-party meme coins (e.g., Pepe and Fartcoin). All participants need to build their own rigs is to spend PEPENODE itself on acquiring nodes. The more virtual mining nodes a user owns, the greater their rewards will be. It’s as simple as that, with PEPENODE aiming to remove the complexity and costs that come with normal cryptocurrency mining. And given that users will need to buy PEPENODE to buy more nodes, demand for the token could be high, pushing its price up over time. On top of this, holders of PEPENODE will be able to stake the coin for a passive income, with the coin’s protocol currently paying an APY of just over 600%. This promises to make PEPENODE one of the most exciting and profitable new coins around, something which helps to explain why its presale has taken off. PEPENODE Launch Could Coincide with Bull Rally As a token, PEPENODE will have a max supply of 210 billion tokens, and it has been audited by Coinsult , with no red flags. Given its rising popularity, investors may want to join the presale as early as possible, which they can do by going to the PEPENODE website. They can connect a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), and then buy the desired amount of PEPENODE, which is currently available at $0.0011454. This price will rise at regular intervals until the sale ends, so traders looking to lock in the biggest possible return should act quickly. And because its launch looks likely to coincide with a market-wide recovery, PEPENODE does seem to be one of the best altcoins available right now.

In a recent announcement via the social-media platform X, RippleX noted that its user base is being targeted by fraudulent campaigns that leverage counterfeit livestreams and AI-generated deep-fake videos purporting to represent company executives. The advisory arrives amid a marked increase in scam activity aimed at XRP investors. Fraudsters are reportedly using artificial-intelligence tools to create highly convincing videos appearing to depict executives such as Brad Garlinghouse . These videos typically promise large giveaway rewards of XRP in exchange for token deposits or wallet access, attempts at theft dressed as generosity. The scams often appear in the commentary or reply threads of posts from official accounts, lending them a misleading air of legitimacy. Beware of scams using fake Ripple or XRP livestreams, giveaways, or deepfake videos. Ripple employees will never ask you to send funds, share wallet info, or join investment streams. Always verify information through @Ripple and @RippleXDev . Keep your XRP yours. — RippleX (@RippleXDev) November 11, 2025 RippleX’s Official Guidance to the Community In its warning, RippleX emphasized unequivocally that no member of the company’s management team will ever ask users to transfer funds, participate in investment schemes, or provide wallet seed phrases or private keys. It advised holders of XRP to rely exclusively on official channels, specifically the @RippleX and @RippleXDev handles on X, when verifying any giveaway or promotional activity. The message ended with a direct instruction for users to guard their tokens carefully. Background on Scam Landscape and Company Measures Scams targeting XRP holders are not new, but their sophistication has grown. After Ripple achieved incremental legal and regulatory milestones , fraudsters ramped up impersonation tactics, especially after company announcements. In some cases, fake channels on platforms such as YouTube and X have hosted fraudulent content featuring manipulated imagery and audio claiming celebratory airdrops. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple previously raised legal action against YouTube in 2020 over similar impersonation issues, and later reached an agreement to collaborate on content-removal efforts. Experts now warn that as deep-fake generation tools become more accessible, the risk of fraud targeting crypto users continues to escalate. Why This Matters for XRP Investors The relevance of this advisory is underscored by the fact that high-value crypto assets like XRP attract not only legitimate investment but also malicious actors seeking to exploit user trust. Deep-fake and impersonation scams erode confidence, pose real risk to holdings, and can trigger sizable financial losses. For investors holding or transacting XRP, the alert serves as a reminder that vigilance is essential, no matter how credible a message or appearance may seem. RippleX’s latest message serves as a timely reminder that the prominence of XRP and its ecosystem makes it a recurring target for fraudulent actors . By clarifying that the company will never solicit funds or personal wallet credentials, the advisory aims to equip users with clear guardrails. Investors and community members are advised to confirm all offers through verified sources and to remain highly cautious of any promotion that requests an upfront token transfer or personal wallet access. Staying alert and skeptical remains the best defense. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On-chain data shows whales are loading up, reinforcing a bullish TRUMP price prediction as momentum builds. Data from CryptoQuant shows that whales have been placing large bets on TRUMP across both spot and futures markets, likely anticipating a resolution to the U.S. government shutdown. Trading activity remains intense, with volumes hitting $675 million—nearly half of the token’s circulating supply. Adding fuel to the fire, Trump’s latest proposal to issue $2,000 checks to Americans using tariff revenue has stirred fresh excitement, potentially setting the stage for another leg up in TRUMP’s price. Trump Price Prediction: $15 Target In Sight If TRUMP Stays Above $7 The daily chart shows that TRUMP has broken out of a falling wedge, signaling a possible trend reversal. After retesting and holding the $7 level as support, the token surged to $9.5, now a critical resistance level to watch. This zone aligns with the 200-day EMA, so a decisive move above it could trigger a strong rally toward $15, unlocking a potential 101% gain if bullish momentum holds. The RSI remains above the signal line, suggesting buyers still have the upper hand. As long as TRUMP holds above $7, the uptrend remains intact. While a 10X move may not happen immediately, the token could reach $15 if the President successfully ends the U.S. government shutdown. With meme coins poised for renewed attention as altcoin season approaches, TRUMP may continue leading the pack. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is exploding onto the scene, racking up nearly $4 million in its presale in record time.

Boston Fed President Susan Collins recently made headlines by advocating for holding rates steady amid limited data and persistent inflation concerns. This cautious approach reflects the complex challenges facing monetary policymakers. Why Is Holding Rates Steady the Preferred Approach? Susan Collins, who previously supported rate cuts, now emphasizes the need for patience. The current environment demands holding rates steady because inflation remains elevated while economic data remains incomplete. This strategic pause allows policymakers to gather more information before making their next move. Collins specifically highlighted several key factors supporting her position: Limited inflation data due to government shutdowns Uncertain labor market conditions Balancing risks between inflation and employment Need for clear signs of economic deterioration What Challenges Does Limited Data Create? The government shutdown has created significant data gaps, making policy decisions more difficult. Without complete economic information, holding rates steady becomes the most prudent course of action. Collins stressed that policymakers need reliable data to assess whether the economy requires additional stimulus or continued restraint. This data limitation affects multiple areas: Inflation tracking becomes less precise Employment trends are harder to identify Economic growth measurements are delayed Consumer spending patterns are unclear How Does This Impact Future Rate Decisions? The current stance of holding rates steady sets the stage for future policy moves. Collins indicated that any future rate reductions would require clear evidence of labor market deterioration. This approach ensures that the Fed doesn’t act prematurely while inflation concerns persist. Key considerations for future decisions include: Labor market stability indicators Inflation trajectory over coming months Economic growth projections Global economic conditions What Are the Risks of Moving Too Quickly? Collins warned against hasty policy changes in the current high-uncertainty environment. Holding rates steady helps balance the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Moving too quickly could either reignite inflation or unnecessarily slow economic growth. The primary risks include: Undermining inflation control efforts Creating unnecessary economic volatility Reducing policy credibility Limiting future policy flexibility Conclusion: The Wisdom of Patience in Uncertain Times The decision to advocate for holding rates steady reflects careful consideration of current economic conditions. Susan Collins’ shift from supporting rate cuts to emphasizing patience demonstrates how evolving data and circumstances influence monetary policy. This cautious approach provides the Federal Reserve with valuable time to assess the economic landscape while maintaining stability in financial markets. Frequently Asked Questions Why has Susan Collins changed her position on interest rates? Collins has shifted her stance due to ongoing inflation concerns and limited economic data caused by government shutdowns. She believes holding rates steady provides the best balance between controlling inflation and supporting employment. How long might the Fed continue holding rates steady? The duration depends on incoming economic data. Collins suggests rates should remain at current levels until there are clear signs of either rising inflation or significant labor market deterioration. What economic indicators will trigger rate changes? Key indicators include inflation rates, employment data, wage growth, and economic growth metrics. Clear trends in these areas would prompt reconsideration of the current policy stance. How does limited data affect Fed decisions? Incomplete economic information makes it difficult to assess the true state of the economy. This uncertainty makes holding rates steady the safest approach until more reliable data becomes available. What are the risks of changing rates too soon? Premature rate changes could either accelerate inflation if cuts are too early, or unnecessarily slow economic growth if hikes occur too soon. Both scenarios could harm economic stability. How does this affect consumers and businesses? Holding rates steady maintains current borrowing costs for mortgages, business loans, and credit cards. This provides stability for financial planning while the economic outlook remains uncertain. Found this analysis helpful?

The issue briefly disrupted normal activity across the network before being corrected. Automation Error Triggers Network Disruption The incident began when BitGo’s automated account management system continued to issue new account creation requests even after the wallet’s balance reached zero. On the XRP Ledger, activating a new account requires a base reserve of one XRP, and transactions that do not meet this requirement are automatically rejected. However, the automation did not stop despite the insufficient balance, leading to thousands of consecutive failed transactions. Blockchain explorers recorded a sharp rise in “UNFUNDED_PAYMENT” entries, indicating a high number of unsuccessful operations. Activity metrics showed that the number of attempted account activations spiked to roughly 11,000 in a single day, far above normal levels. Something interesting on chain. I'm not sure yet who is behind it. > BitGo activating thousands of XRP accounts in masses the past couple days. > Account Set tx spike > Multi Sig tx spike There's a story here. pic.twitter.com/QWPEsSfJsy — Vet (@Vet_X0) November 7, 2025 The accumulation of failed entries temporarily congested network trackers, though the ledger’s consensus and transaction integrity remained intact. Community and Developer Response Community members quickly noticed the anomaly. XRPL contributor “Vet” drew attention to the abnormal pattern of account creation attempts and speculated that a coding oversight might have caused the continuous transaction loop. Within hours, developers confirmed that the excessive activity originated from BitGo’s systems. Following the detection of the error, BitGo initiated an internal review and determined that the cause was an automation fault rather than a security breach. The company later replenished the affected wallet with 1,048 XRP to restore functionality and prevent the system from issuing further unfunded payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Once the deposit was made, the repeated failed transactions stopped, and normal operations resumed on the ledger. The event serves as a reminder of the potential network-wide impact of automated processes that interact directly with public blockchains. Even minor scripting oversights can produce widespread operational effects if not properly safeguarded. In this case, while no user assets were affected and no malicious activity occurred, the episode demonstrated how essential it is for custodial providers to maintain robust monitoring and fail-safe mechanisms. At present, the XRP Ledger is operating normally, and BitGo’s systems have stabilized. The incident underscores the importance of proactive reserve management and effective error-handling protocols in automated wallet operations to ensure network reliability and prevent unnecessary transaction load.

By December that year, it hit $19,666. In 2020, when the McRib came back on Dec. 2, BTC was $18,773 and later climbed to $64,895 by April 2022, a gain of 245%. In 2021, the sandwich returned with Bitcoin at $61,000; nine days later, it topped $69,000, a 13% increase and a new record then. The legendary McRib returns 11/11 at most McDonald’s in the US.

He wrote: “Here’s a look back at how Bitcoin has reacted to news that McDonald’s McRib is back on the menu. They just announced it again last week. And you’re bearish?” Voell even shared a chart mapping the digital currency’s price against McRib announcement dates, which caught widespread attention among traders. Other analysts have mixed views. Some market watchers say the pattern reflects how social mood and investor psychology often shape crypto movements more than logic or data. They point out that people tend to find patterns that fit their beliefs, even when the evidence is thin. Others describe the McRib-Bitcoin link as a meme that got too much credit, noting that in some years BTC moved the opposite way despite the sandwich’s return. On Correlation & Causation According to those skeptical voices, the McRib’s timing could simply line up with typical end-of-year optimism in markets. Coincidence, they say, should not be mistaken for a reliable pattern. Analysts have also pointed out that traders often cherry-pick the examples that support the story while ignoring years when the crypto moved differently. Still, the conversation highlights how crypto culture loves turning memes into signals. Some traders treat the McRib’s return as a symbolic marker of good times ahead, a lighthearted reminder that markets are not only driven by numbers but by mood and imagination too.

Speaking at the XRP Meetup NYC in the run-up to Ripple’s Swell conference—and in remarks shared via a clip by Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba) on X—Traidman argued that the publicly listed “digital asset treasury companies” which ran hot earlier this year are now trading like the investment-trust boom-and-bust of the early 2000s. “In the last 60 days or so, we’ve seen several and many, actually, of the digital asset treasury companies collapse. A lot of the stocks have been down by 80%, 90%. This is reminiscent of what we saw in the early 2000s… Initially, they traded at much higher to their net asset value. And eventually, they collapsed completely. And those companies are not publicly traded anymore. To be totally honest, the same thing is happening with DAT companies right now.” DATs are collapsing, according to the former @Ripple board member. VIVOPOWER has been BUYING $XRP exposure at 84% OFF by purchasing shares in @Ripple. With the new Ripple $40B Valuation, the XRP discount is effectively 59% off. VivoPower Strategy explained here:… pic.twitter.com/ypSrGAgRsC — 🌸Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) November 12, 2025 The XRP Treasury Company 2.0 The response, he said, is a second-generation construct that acquires underlying exposure at a discount instead of paying token spot. “What we are doing at VivoPower, and what I think the future is, is this sort of second generation of DATs. I call it a DAT 2.0 strategy. Some folk call it an anti-DAT strategy, which is, instead of buying the net asset at spot price, you buy the net asset at a massive discount.” Related Reading: XRP To $10? Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark He used Bitcoin to illustrate how unusual an “80% off” entry actually is—mining might lower unit cost by 20–30%, but not by 80%. “How would you buy Bitcoin at an 80% discount today? You can’t… You might mine it… and then you might be able to get it at a 20%, 30% discount by mining it… But how the hell are you going to get it for 80% off?” The answer, in VivoPower’s case, is tied to Ripple. As Traidman put it, there is a unique linkage between a private company and the crypto asset that enables discount capture through corporate financing structures rather than on-exchange purchases. “There’s 25 million cryptocurrencies on coinmarketcap.com. There’s only one that is tied to a private company that is severely undervalued in terms of its share price, and that’s XRP, because of Ripple, right? And so that’s the opportunity that we are taking advantage of.” Related Reading: XRP Flashes Strongest Macro Bull Trend in Its History: Chartist This is the core ordering of operations in his remarks: first, acquire XRP exposure at a claimed “84% off” via mechanisms that revolve around Ripple’s equity and related look-through economics; second, put the resulting XRP to work on yield networks. Flare sits explicitly in the second step. “And then we work with our partners, like Flare, in order to generate yield on those XRP assets. And so that’s essentially buying XRP basically 84% off, and then investing it onto networks like Flare in order to generate a yield.” By emphasizing the sequencing—discounted acquisition tied to Ripple first, yield generation on Flare second—Traidman also addressed why this model does not rely on the market assigning a premium to the operating company. “So it’s like a DAT 1.0 plus the 2.0 strategy, right? And so the companies in this model don’t even need to trade at a premium to MNAV, like Saylor’s MicroStrategy does, because by default, they’re making money on day one. T plus one second, every dollar that gets put into our company gets a forex return, right? That’s only available when you can buy the net asset at a discount.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.44.

This news follows recent reports that Johor attracted about 164.45 billion ringgit as of the second quarter, equivalent to around $40 billion in data center investment. Analysts researched this growing interest in Johor. They discovered that the state has positioned itself as an investment hub, particularly with the establishment of a new special economic zone by Singapore. According to their estimates, Johor is expected to host approximately 60% of Malaysia’s data centers by 2030. This move shows promise of favorable development or future success for UEM, especially considering that its property development arm, UEM Sunrise Bhd., owns almost 4,600 acres in the area. Khazanah’s UEM intends to use its extensive land assets to back a data center based in Johor During an interview in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, November 11, Amran mentioned that Sunrise is making a strategy for the Gerbang Nusajaya Industrial Park, which will operate on renewable energy and cover 40 acres. Moreover, he highlighted that UEM Lestra Bhd., their green energy division, is preparing to initiate the construction of a 1-gigawatt hybrid solar plant, funded by investors such as the Macquarie Group and I Squared Capital Advisors. Notably, the initial stage of this plant will be a 500-megawatt facility priced at 2.5 billion ringgit, as stated by Lestra earlier this year. Meanwhile, UEM is exploring the potential investment in water treatment for industrial parks, which is crucial for cooling data centers. Amran stated, “This aligns with providing energy to industrial parks.” He added that there is a significant demand for water and power for industrial use, even without considering the needs of data centers. According to BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, Malaysia ranks one of Asia’s top three growth markets. The development of data centers in the region is expected to significantly increase power demand until 2028, as mentioned in an industry outlook report released this week. However, this rapid expansion stresses the country’s land and power resources, including the electrical grid. BMI noted that it has become increasingly important yet more challenging to meet this new demand for clean energy since renewable energy commitments are becoming a key focus for data center operators’ business plans. On the other hand, the Malaysian conglomerate, which has primarily been associated with property and road infrastructure projects, is now prioritizing green energy and sustainability initiatives for future growth. Last year, Lestra acquired a majority share in Nur Power, Malaysia’s only independent power utility company, for an undisclosed amount. They also pledged 1.5 billion ringgit to help reduce carbon emissions in industrial parks nationwide by 2026. Amran expresses his optimism about 2026 based on the current deals they have struck Currently, Lestra supplies biogas power to Kulim Hi-Tech Park, located in Kedah state, which is home to companies such as Infineon Technologies AG and AT&S that specialize in semiconductors and electronic components. The biogas facility has a capacity of 350 MW and is fully utilized. “We can upgrade the plant to have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity if we get approval from the regulators,” Amran mentioned. He also stated that the company is interested in selling biogas power to other industrial areas via Malaysia’s national grid. He believes the group will perform better on the profit side in 2025, thanks to increased contributions from Sunrise and other divisions. He also expressed optimism about 2026 based on the current deals they have lined up.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 423 points, or 0.9%, reaching a new intraday high as investors awaited a House vote on a bill to end the 40-day government closure. Stocks Surge as Confidence Returns Strong performances from banking giants such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and American Express fueled the rally. The S&P 500 inched up 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%, showing slight weakness in tech shares. Meanwhile, gold climbed to around $4,180 and silver rose above $53, boosted by safe-haven demand and expectations of resumed government data releases once the shutdown ends. Investors seemed to rotate back into equities and commodities with clearer ties to fiscal policy and credit conditions. Bitcoin Pulls Back Bitcoin dropped 3.4%, falling from an intraday high of $105,300 to a weekly low near $101,200. The decline came as investors shifted capital toward traditional assets, signaling a temporary cooling of crypto enthusiasm following a strong rally earlier in the week. The move reflects a broader recalibration in risk appetite. As the threat of a prolonged shutdown fades, market participants appear more comfortable positioning around traditional investments rather than digital assets. ETF Inflows Suggest Long-Term Optimism Despite short-term weakness, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains supported by institutional interest. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded $524 million in cumulative net inflows on Tuesday — the highest daily total since early October. The renewed ETF activity suggests that investors are gradually rebuilding exposure to Bitcoin after the volatility seen earlier this month. With the Federal Reserve expected to provide new policy guidance later this month, any hint of a dovish stance could reignite demand for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

A few users have even been trading with real contracts, and the company is still refining its systems in advance of a wider launch. Now, with that beta release, Polymarket makes a tentative return to the American market after years of being based overseas. The company had limited access from the United States as a result of an agreement with regulators in 2022. This development comes as Polymarket announced on Wednesday that data from its prediction market platform will be integrated into Yahoo Finance , expanding the reach of its product to potentially more people. According to the X announcement, Polymarket said that it had become Yahoo Finance’s “exclusive prediction market partner,” while sharing a 30-second video featuring the song “Timeless” by The Weekend and Playboi Carti. Polymarket secures compliance for U.S. relaunch Polymarket’s U.S. return comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the company settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), agreeing to pay a $1.4 million penalty after admitting that it had operated as an unregistered derivatives platform. This time, however, the company’s relaunch is built on compliance, as it is acquiring QCX, a CFTC-approved entity that operates as both a derivatives exchange and a clearinghouse. Polymarket can rest easy, as it runs a legal show in the U.S., while ensuring the development of a decentralized and transparent system. It has also introduced a new, simpler fee structure that it hopes will appeal to users and challenge entrenched competitors, such as Kalshi Inc. Later this month, Polymarket will launch with a small menu of markets, including sports and political results, among others. More are expected to be added. The gradual rollout, according to the team, helps it meet the regulatory requirements. The resurgence of Polymarket also coincides with a surge in interest in prediction markets in the U.S. These markets, where people place bets on real-world events ranging from elections to the outcomes of reality television series, have garnered attention for the crowdsourcing of forecasts they provide. Instead of taking bets — competing with traditional celebrity gossip sites for page views and advertising revenue — Polymarket functions more like a stock market. Users buy shares in an outcome they believe will prevail, and prices are based on the collective popular opinion. This arrangement is also more transparent and liquid — and, Coplan said, a more equitable deal for participants. Polymarket intensifies competition in prediction markets This re-entry by Polymarket increases the stakes for prediction platforms to address the challenge, aside from its main competitor, Kalshi Inc., which is already licensed in the U.S. and provides a market for event-based futures contracts. Meanwhile, for some of the largest companies in the gambling business, that same turf is now being seen as a new frontier: FanDuel last week announced that it would soon introduce its own product based on prediction markets. Polymarket has a major advantage, though. Founded five years ago, the company’s platform, built on blockchain technology, allows members to settle trades almost as soon as they are executed and to view every transaction. Combined with low overheads, such as reduced fees and a decentralized system, it presents itself as a technologically advanced and compliance-friendly choice. Insiders say Polymarket is on its way to a valuation of as high as $2 billion, following intense investor interest after it secured a commitment of up to $2 billion in venture capital from Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which owns the New York Stock Exchange. That round is, in some sense, a sign of increasing institutional interest in the future of event-based prediction markets.

The company reported that its earlier forecast fell short by almost $1 billion, and the new figure put it above expectations tracked by Wall Street, and this is after Cisco outperformed revenue and earnings targets in the second quarter too. The company said it now expects $4.14 per share in adjusted earnings for fiscal 2026, a number that stands higher than the $4.05 analysts projected. Demand for secure and fast networking is rising as businesses rush into AI upgrades across data centers, cloud systems, and enterprise networks. AI orders increase as Cisco builds partnerships and updates hardware Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, speaking to analysts during a conference call, said the company expects the AI pipeline to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2026. Chuck said customers are moving fast to unlock AI systems, and that networks must stay secure as workloads expand. The company also said late Wednesday that AI infrastructure orders reached $1.3 billion in the most recent period, compared with $800 million in the quarter before that. Executives said Cisco is redesigning chips and routing systems to handle heavier AI traffic, with upgrades meant to connect large racks of servers used for advanced training models and other compute‑heavy tasks. Cisco is competing against Broadcom and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which owns Juniper Networks, but the business is also working with Nvidia through a partnership that the company says gives it an advantage in building AI‑optimized network equipment. During the fiscal first quarter, which ended October 25, Cisco reported $14.9 billion in revenue, showing an 8% rise from the previous year. Profit landed at $1 per share, excluding certain items. Analysts tracking the numbers estimated revenue would hit $14.8 billion and earnings would reach 98 cents, results the company managed to beat. For the fiscal second quarter that runs through January, Cisco expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.2 billion, above the $14.7 billion prediction from analysts, with earnings of $1.02 per share, compared with an expected 99 cents. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Woo Jin Ho wrote that the company’s AI momentum has not slowed and said the higher forecast still looks cautious, adding that there could be room for limited upside if demand keeps rising. Cisco CFO Mark Patterson said demand for updated networking gear continues to build, noting that a multi‑year campus refresh cycle is starting to gain pace across large customers. Cisco expands through security, training, and AI‑powered development Cisco is broadening its product line through security and observability tools, and the largest step came in 2024 when it bought Splunk for $28 billion. Chuck has pointed to the deal as part of a plan to reduce exposure to hardware cycles while deepening the company’s software business. Inside the company, employees are being pushed to use AI tools rather than face layoffs. Chuck told CNBC earlier that he does not want to cut engineers and instead wants the current team to innovate faster and be more productive. The approach contrasts with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Accenture, which cut staff during the broader shift toward automation. Chief information officer Fletcher Previn, speaking about internal development, said 70% of the company’s 20,000 developers log into AI coding tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot at least once a month. Fletcher said AI‑generated code now accounts for nearly a quarter of all the code produced inside the company, up from 4% the year before. Global head of talent acquisition Scott McGuckin told Fortune that managers who use AI encourage teams to adopt the tools faster. Scott said: “While I haven’t placed any mandatory AI training on my immediate team, I highly expect them to be taking advantage of the AI tools and courses available in the company. Those who do, show me their creativity, productivity, and strategic thinking.” As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco shares were up 25% for the year, ahead of the Nasdaq’s 21% gain.

For 2025, that opportunity may be found in RentStac (RNS) , a DeFi token built around real-world property income and transparent blockchain mechanics. Here’s how simple math shows how a modest $1,000 investment can potentially grow to $50,000 as RentStac’s ecosystem expands. The Path From $1,000 to $50,000 At the current presale price of $0.025 per token, $1,000 buys 40,000 RNS. Early participants receive a 100 percent bonus, which doubles that to 80,000 tokens. If RNS later trades at just $0.50, a level several analysts consider achievable once the project reaches exchange listings and expands its property portfolio, those 80,000 tokens would be worth $40,000. At $0.60, the value climbs to $48,000. And if the token hits $1, that original $1,000 would equal $80,000 in value. The structure of the presale rewards early entry, making the first phases the most lucrative window for investors who recognize the project’s fundamentals early on. Why RentStac Can Support This Growth The key behind RentStac’s potential lies in its connection to real-world income. Unlike speculative tokens, RNS is tied to rental yield generated from legally verified properties. Each property is held through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), ensuring that the income streams are transparent and backed by real assets. The platform converts property earnings into stablecoin distributions, giving holders a steady source of yield while also supporting token demand. This hybrid model combines the predictable returns of traditional real estate with the scalability of decentralized finance. Dual-Yield Design and Deflationary Mechanics RentStac’s system allows investors to earn in two ways: passive rental income and staking rewards. Token holders can stake RNS to earn a share of platform revenue while also benefiting from property-linked yield paid in stablecoins. In addition, a portion of platform revenue is allocated to buy back and burn RNS from circulation. This creates a deflationary effect that supports token appreciation over time. The structure mirrors what made early DeFi leaders like Aave and Chainlink successful, measurable utility supported by real economics. Security and Transparency Security is central to the project’s credibility. RentStac’s code has already achieved a 92.48 percent score on Solidity Scan, with a full audit by CertiK currently underway. Each transaction related to property income is verified through multi-signature wallets and oracle data feeds, ensuring accuracy and compliance across the system. The governance model also allows community voting via DAO, letting token holders influence decisions on property additions, yields, and platform upgrades. Why Analysts Are Watching Closely As the DeFi market matures, investors are shifting toward projects with verified income streams rather than speculative hype. RentStac aligns with that trend perfectly. Its connection to the global rental market, a multi-trillion-dollar sector gives it scalability and resilience that pure digital assets cannot replicate. That’s why early participants see RNS not just as another crypto presale, but as one of the first tokens designed to generate steady value while offering exponential upside as adoption increases. The Bottom Line Turning $1,000 into $50,000 isn’t about luck, it’s about timing, structure, and fundamentals. RentStac offers a transparent, asset-backed approach that combines property income, staking, and deflationary economics in a single ecosystem. While no investment is risk-free, RentStac’s real-world connection gives it a long-term foundation that few new tokens can match. As the presale continues, early participants are positioning themselves for what could be one of DeFi’s most significant success stories of 2025.

With Q4 2025 drawing near, analysts are indicating a $0.035 DeFi crypto project. The traders are seeing the initial indications of increasing demand and some suspect that this structure behind the token might make it one of the strongest growth opportunities in the quarter. Its premise is starting to draw interest in all quarters of investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that is being developed to introduce clarity and efficiency to lending digital assets. The platform employs a Peer-to-Contract business model in which users place assets in a liquidity pool. Such deposits are turned into mtTokens tracking earned interests. APY is boosted when the demand for loans is high. As such, mtTokens automatically update with increased interest income in case a person provides the market with for example $1,000 of ETH and borrowing operations increase. There are also Peer-to-peer lending markets of assets that are more controlled under Mutuum Finance. Borrowers are subjected to variable interest rates which are influenced by availability of liquidity. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios provide the maximum and minimum amount of collateral that can be borrowed. Less riskier assets will have greater LTVs whereas more risky assets will have lower limits. A liquidation process is triggered in case a borrower is put in a situation that is unsafe. To create an overall solvency, liquidators have the ability to purchase discounted collateral to put the situation back on track. These mechanics devise a system constructed on anticipatory lending, equity borrowing and reliable liquidations. Numbers Behind the Presale At the beginning of 2025, the presale was initiated at $0.01. Those early prices developed an excellent foundation among early purchasers. On current days MUTM is set on Phase 6 at a price of $0.035, 250% up the initial stage. The presale figures are serious growth. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $18.6 million and found 17,900 tokenholders, and sold 796 million tokens. The percentage of Phase 6 allocated is more than 86% and the demand is rising day by day. The price of confirmation of launching at $0.06 supports anticipations of initial appreciation. Investors who got in at $0.01 are poised to see a growth of 500% at listing and even investors in Phase 6, having entered at 0.035, still have a significant uptake potential. Direct card purchases also introduced by Mutuum Finance and this enhanced accessibility and appeal to large buyers. The 24-hour leaderboard is another catalyst of action as it gives the best contributor of the day MUTM tokens. This makes the participation dynamic and visible, which provides energy to keep on. Foundations and Security Analyst Outlook According to analysts who follow the developments in early DeFi, the development of Mutuum Finance is among the largest factors that increase the popularity. The team made the designation on X that its V1 borrowing and lending protocol would debut on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. V1 incorporates: the Liquidity Pool, the mtTokens, the Debt Tokens and the Liquidator Bot, ETH and USDT were the first supported assets. The fact that actual development milestones are being seen in the pre-listing stage becomes a confidence build among long-term traders. Mutuum Finance, as well, underwent an audit of their token by CertiK that provides an additional layer of credibility to the smart-contracts of the protocol. Investors highly value security, and it applies to the DeFi crypto industry. Due to these fundamentals, analysts have made solid forecasts. There is some speculation of a 5x to 10x move in the initial expansion phase following the launch in case platform usage is higher. Others look to possible upside elsewhere, pointing to the fact that an early lending business in earlier cycles results in far greater growth once it has grown in critical mass and liquidity. Long-Term Vision Mutuum Finance is not halting at lending. The roadmap has USD-pegged stablecoin backed by treasury inflows that are raised by borrowing interest. Stablecoins lead to liquidity and make lending platforms consistent in activity. They give users a steady value and keep users looking forward to using them in times of open markets. Other significant steps are layer-2 expansion. Networks based on layer-2 enhance speed and the cost of transacting. In the case of a lending platform that has interest updates and liquidation procedures, this has to be enhanced. By making the transition to Layer-2 ecosystems, Mutuum Finance will be able to serve more assets and facilitate the transaction flow and increase user base. Why Analysts See 30x Potential All of this, coupled with impressive performances in presale and, most importantly, audited smart contracts, a form of utility, revenue-driven token utilization and a stablecoin with Layer-2 roadmap make Mutuum Finance look out of place in an oversaturated market. The observers of emerging DeFi protocols refer to the early lending vehicles in the last couple of cycles that brought about colossal growth when their pipeline network developed. Since MUTM is still at $0.035 in Phase 6 and nearing the final phases of presale, this could be one of the best crypto to buy to those looking to have long-term growth, according to many traders. As the quarter 4, 2025 nears, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the new crypto player with the type of platform that could sustain significant growth.

Recently, Adam Back, the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream , weighed in with a bold statement, claiming that BTC embodies the essence of permissionless bearer money. Bitcoin As Permissionless Bearer Money Back’s description of Bitcoin as permissionless bearer money positions it as the modern realization of the cypherpunk’s vision for bearer eCash . Essentially, this concept means that BTC, unlike traditional bank accounts or centralized digital currencies, is owned and controlled directly by the individual who holds the private keys . This means that no intermediary can freeze, reverse, or control the transaction, making it an entirely permissionless system where ownership is verifiable and transferable without reliance on banks or governments. Notably, Back’s statement resonates with the original cypherpunk vision and ideals of self-sovereignty and financial privacy. However, some members of the crypto community quickly raised challenges to this view. One critic highlighted the role of Back’s Blockstream in developing the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 (L2) protocol designed to facilitate faster Bitcoin transactions . While it improves efficiency, the crypto community member pointed out that the Lightning Network is permissioned and partially centralized, suggesting nodes can theoretically censor or modify transactions without immediate detection by other participants. He argues that Bitcoin may not remain truly permissionless if widely adopted L2s introduce central points of control. Notably, Back has not publicly responded to these concerns, leaving the debate open to future discussions. The Many Faces Of BTC As Money Over the years, Bitcoin has been described in many ways, reflecting its evolving role in the global financial landscape. In its early stages, it was seen as a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) electronic cash and a decentralized alternative to fiat currencies. As adoption grew, BTC gained recognition as a store of value , appealing to those who want to hedge against inflation and the collapse of fiat currencies. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and rapid growth rate led many to compare it to gold, giving rise to its long-standing title as “ digital gold .” Other perspectives view Bitcoin as a speculative asset , where short-term price volatility often overshadows its intended use as a medium of exchange. More recently, governments have begun looking to the leading cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset for diversifying national holdings from conventional currencies. Meanwhile, for cypherpunk enthusiasts like Back, Bitcoin remains a form of money that prioritizes personal sovereignty, censorship resistance, and privacy.

The market appears to be stabilizing after weeks of volatility, yet on-chain data signals that profit-taking remains active. According to top analyst Darkfost, since the exceptional liquidation event in early October, many investors have started to secure profits and scale back their exposure as the current cycle nears its end. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable uptick in Bitcoin inflows to Binance. The 30-day moving average of daily inflows has climbed sharply throughout October, showing that, on average, roughly 7,500 BTC are being transferred to Binance every day. This is the highest inflow rate since the March correction, indicating renewed selling pressure and cautious positioning among traders. While such inflows often reflect profit realization and short-term selling, Bitcoin’s ability to consolidate near the $100K level suggests resilient underlying demand. Buyers continue to absorb the supply entering the market, preventing a deeper breakdown — at least for now. As the cycle matures, this phase may prove critical in determining whether Bitcoin stabilizes for another leg up or faces a more prolonged correction. Short-Term Holders Add To Selling Pressure As Bitcoin Consolidates Darkfost explains that the recent surge in Bitcoin inflows to Binance and other exchanges reflects growing selling pressure across the market. Despite this, Bitcoin’s price continues to consolidate relatively cleanly around the symbolic $100,000 level — a sign that existing demand remains strong enough to absorb the increased supply. This balance between distribution and accumulation indicates that the market is undergoing a structural reset rather than a full-blown capitulation. Adding to this dynamic, short-term holders (STHs) have become a major contributor to the ongoing selling pressure. These participants are typically the most reactive segment of the market, responding quickly to volatility and sentiment shifts. With a realized price near $112,000, many STHs have been underwater for about a month, prompting them to send significant amounts of BTC to exchanges at a loss. Historically, this type of behavior has coincided with late-stage corrections — what analysts often call a “cleansing phase.” During such phases, speculative capital exits the market while long-term investors quietly absorb the supply, setting the foundation for renewed stability and potential future growth. If demand continues to offset this wave of short-term selling, Bitcoin could soon form a stronger base above $100,000 — paving the way for a gradual recovery as selling pressure fades and confidence returns.

On the weekly chart, BTC remains supported by the 50-week moving average (blue line), which is acting as a strong dynamic floor for price. Despite multiple retests over recent weeks, bulls have managed to defend this level, signaling that underlying demand remains intact even as profit-taking intensifies. The broader structure still points to a healthy long-term uptrend. The 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) moving averages continue sloping upward, confirming that Bitcoin’s macro bias remains bullish. However, the lack of strong volume during recent rebounds suggests that market participants are cautious, awaiting confirmation of renewed momentum before adding to positions.

Conversely, a weekly close below $100K would mark a significant technical breakdown, potentially opening the door to a deeper retrace toward $92K–$95K.
