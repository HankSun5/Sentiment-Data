Ethereum ETFs see $107 million in outflows, weighing on broader sentiment. Key support sits at $2.38, with resistance at $2.59 and $2.70. By Jainam Mehta ​XRP ( XRP-USD ) rose 1.8% to trade near $2.42 on Wednesday, holding above its ascending support line as it reclaimed short-term moving averages on the 4-hour chart. The rebound follows a week of volatility across the crypto market, with Ethereum ETFs recording $107 million in outflows on November 11—their largest in weeks—prompting speculation that liquidity may be rotating toward alternative assets like XRP. From a technical perspective, XRP remains within a rising structure that has persisted since late October. The 20-, 50-, and 100-period EMAs cluster between $2.41–$2.43, forming a tight confluence zone. A decisive close above this range could unlock upside potential toward $2.59, the previous local high and upper Bollinger Band level. Beyond that, $2.70 marks the next resistance zone, where prior rallies have consistently stalled. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Immediate support is seen at $2.38, followed by the ascending trendline base near $2.26, a level that has repeatedly attracted buying interest. The Bollinger Bands have begun to widen, signaling a potential increase in volatility after several sessions of compression. The RSI remains neutral, suggesting the current upward drift could extend if price action holds above the moving average cluster. The broader tone remains cautiously constructive. XRP’s resilience relative to other large-cap altcoins suggests short-term stability, especially as market participants await confirmation of stronger inflows or trend continuation. Ethereum outflows and capital rotation shape sentiment Market data from CoinGlass shows persistent net outflows from Ethereum spot exchanges, totaling $22.7 million on November 12. A significant factor was BlackRock’s $19.8 million Ethereum sale, which contributed to total ETF redemptions exceeding $107 million in a single session. These outflows underline a period of defensive positioning among institutional investors, particularly within the smart contract and DeFi segment, which has experienced weaker fund inflows since late October. In contrast, XRP’s steadier structure and lower speculative leverage have made it an attractive alternative for traders seeking relative stability amid sector-wide volatility. While Ethereum continues to dominate market headlines—especially after Fundstrat’s Tom Lee reiterated a forecast calling for ETH to reach $9,000–$12,000 in early 2026—short-term fund movements reflect a tactical rebalancing rather than broad bullish conviction. If this rotation persists, XRP could benefit from incremental capital flows, particularly as the asset continues to maintain key structural support and shows less liquidation pressure than high-beta peers. Outlook XRP’s technical bias remains mildly bullish above $2.38, though a breakout above $2.59 is required to confirm trend reversal momentum. The rising support line near $2.26 remains the critical invalidation level for buyers. If the base holds, the next upside target sits near $2.70, while failure to sustain above $2.43 could reopen downside pressure toward $2.26. Previously discussed analysis identified the $2.60 region as the decisive barrier separating consolidation from breakout. That outlook remains unchanged. Sustained strength above that level would mark a clear shift in sentiment , aligning XRP’s recovery with improving sector liquidity trends.

In 2017, Ethereum transformed a few hundred dollars into life-changing wealth. Solana followed in 2021, rising from under a dollar to over $200. Now, analysts suggest that RentStac (RNS) could be next, applying the same principle of scarcity and timing but with real-world assets supporting its growth. Unlike speculative projects that depend solely on market hype, RentStac bridges decentralized finance with verified rental income. It is designed to connect digital tokens with property-backed value, making it one of the few DeFi ecosystems that merge blockchain scalability with real economic output. Lessons from the Past History shows that wealth in crypto often starts with small, early investments in projects that solve real problems. Ethereum introduced programmable contracts. Solana proved that speed could scale blockchain. RentStac builds on both ideas by using blockchain to distribute income from tokenized rental properties. Through RentStac , investors can access legally registered SPVs that hold income-generating assets. Rental profits are distributed on-chain in stablecoins, combining transparency with consistent yield potential. Why RentStac Stands Out Many DeFi projects promise high rewards but lack structure. RentStac’s system is built for sustainability. Holders earn yield in two ways: through staking rewards and through income derived from real-world properties. This dual-yield mechanism creates an ecosystem that rewards both long-term holders and active participants. The platform’s deflationary design, combined with transparent property reporting, positions it among the few DeFi models with measurable fundamentals instead of speculative buzz. Key Presale Data The project operates on verified metrics published openly on its website: Total supply: 2,000,000,000 RNS Presale allocation: 40% (about 800 million tokens) Target funding: $27.45 million over 7 stages Current price: $0.025 per token Active bonus: 100% additional tokens for early buyers These parameters are publicly accessible on RentStac.com and ensure accountability throughout each phase of the presale. A Simple Example: $100 Today At the current price of $0.025, a $100 investment buys 4,000 RNS tokens. With the 100 percent bonus for early participants, that number doubles to 8,000 tokens. If RNS reaches a future market price of $1, the original $100 position would be worth $8,000. Should it follow the path of early DeFi leaders like Solana, which multiplied over 200 times, that same entry could theoretically approach $20,000. This example demonstrates the power of timing and real-world backing in a presale structured for growth and transparency. Security and Real-World Connection Security is central to RentStac’s foundation. The project scored 92.48 percent on Solidity Scan, with a full CertiK audit in progress. Each property is managed through a dedicated SPV, providing legal verification and independent oversight. RentStac also uses multi-signature wallets, DAO-based voting, and oracle validation to maintain transparency in property performance and token distribution. This framework ensures every transaction is verifiable and tied to real-world value. A New Direction for DeFi As the DeFi sector matures, investors are seeking more than hype. They want yield backed by real income streams and assets that can outlast volatility. RentStac’s model brings together blockchain innovation and tangible economics, offering a structure that appeals to both retail and institutional players. With a fixed supply, a transparent presale, and property-backed returns, RentStac (RNS) represents a potential milestone in the evolution of decentralized finance and one of the most promising opportunities in 2025.

54324166,626176,1762988413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54324166.jpeg,Is the XRP ETF About to Get Approved? Bipartisan Senate Vote Could Reopen US Government,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-bipartisan-senate-vote/,"The XRP community might finally have a reason to celebrate as the United States Senate has just voted 60-40 to advance a bill that would reopen the federal government, a major step toward ending the longest shutdown in American history. This vote could be the moment everything changes for the crypto market, and especially for holders. Now that lawmakers are working to restore government operations, the next outlook is what could come next once the SEC returns to full capacity, and it opens up the question of whether Spot XRP ETFs will soon get approved. Senate Vote Brings Hope for XRP ETF Decisions Monday’s 60-40 Senate vote brought a sigh of relief to markets and set the stage for a final House vote as early as Wednesday. The bipartisan measure, if approved, will unlock government funding and allow regulators, including the SEC, to resume their normal operations after more than a month of near standstill. During the shutdown, SEC staff responsible for reviewing ETF filings were furloughed, effectively freezing dozens of applications from major asset managers. This included those for Dogecoin , Cardano, Solana, and most notably, XRP ETFs, which had already crossed their decision deadlines in October. It is important to note that the agency had issued new procedural guidelines for ETF filings shortly before the shutdown to make approvals much easier and faster, but the freeze effectively stalled all progress. Although there is still work to be done for the shutdown to end, the focus is now on how quickly the SEC will resume its backlog once operations restart. There is enough optimism that the XRP ETF filings, which have witnessed significant public attention, could be among the first to move forward once reviews begin again. Spot ETFs Waiting For the Green Light XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap (minus stablecoin USDT), so it is only natural that it becomes the next cryptocurrency with tradable Spot ETFs in the US market. Several major firms have filed for spot XRP ETFs over the past few months, hoping to bring the same level of institutional exposure to the altcoin that Bitcoin and Ethereum are enjoying. Among those in line are Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares. These issuers had expected SEC responses in October, but the government shutdown disrupted the timeline. There are already different XRP futures and leveraged ETFs available , but they do not cause the same sort of buying pressure as Spot XRP ETFs. Unlike futures-based ETFs, Spot ETFs actually hold the underlying asset, in this case, XRP. That means investors could gain direct exposure through traditional brokerage accounts without holding the tokens themselves. The market impact could be massive once these Spot ETFs are approved. Institutional demand flows in once a regulated product becomes available, just as it did with Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Therefore, Spot XRP ETFs will mean a rise in price and liquidity for the cryptocurrency.",XRP|ETF|ETF news|ripple|ripple news|XRP ETF|XRP ETF news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-12 23:00:13

Prices are not shooting higher yet. At press time Bitcoin trades around $104,500, down 0.5% over the past day. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst Traders watched a decline of about 1.8% earlier that pushed the price near $103,400 and it briefly touched $102,850 during the move. Stablecoin Signal Points Toward Accumulation CryptoQuant analyst Moreno points to the Stablecoin Supply Ratio, or SSR, as the first clear indicator. The SSR compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the total market cap of stablecoins. It has dropped back into the 13 range. Based on historical readings, that 13 area has lined up with market lows in mid-2021 and at several moments across 2024. Reports show that when SSR fell to similar levels, liquidity quietly built up and buying followed after a period of low volatility. Liquidity Pattern Has Appeared Before Every Bitcoin Surge — And It’s Back “We’re witnessing a liquidity configuration that has only appeared a handful of times since 2020, and each instance marked a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s trajectory.” – By @MorenoDV_ pic.twitter.com/vWKcCkyn55 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 11, 2025 Binance Reserve Trends Add A Second Layer The second metric Moreno highlights comes from Binance. On that exchange, stablecoin balances are rising while Bitcoin reserves are shrinking. In plain terms: more cash-like tokens sit on the exchange and fewer coins are being held there. That pattern has appeared only a handful of times since 2020, according to the data he referenced. Each time, the movement suggested capital waiting on the sidelines and holders moving coins off exchanges into longer-term storage. Market Calm Can Hide Big Moves The current trading backdrop is cautious. Many investors expected a lift after news that the US Congress approved short-term federal funding through January 30, yet crypto did not rally with other risk assets. Some capital rotated back to stocks. At the same time, large holders took profits after recent highs, and momentum cooled. That mix shows how macro events can shift flows without immediately turning into crypto buying. Risk Still Exists — Structure Could Break Moreno warns this liquidity zone acts like a final structural support. If the metrics break down decisively, it could signal a deeper reset before any sustained recovery. In that scenario, buying would likely be delayed and volatility would rise. This is not a guaranteed outcome, but it is a clear risk that traders watch closely. Outlook: Limited Downside, Growing Upside Based on reports and on-chain signals, Moreno believes the risk-to-reward favors buyers at these levels. He points to the built-up stablecoin supply and falling exchange BTC reserves as reasons for that view. Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Historical patterns suggest the last three months of the year often bring gains for Bitcoin, but past behavior does not promise future returns. For now, the indicators show capital parked in stablecoins and fewer coins available on major exchanges. That creates a setup where fresh buying could push the market higher quickly if sentiment turns. Yet the opposite is possible: a break below these levels would reshape the cycle and force many participants to rethink positions. Markets will decide which path comes next.

SEC Chair Paul Atkins Weighs Token Taxonomy Speaking at The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s FinTech Conference on November 12, Atkins announced that he is weighing the creation of a token taxonomy “anchored in the longstanding Howey investment contract securities analysis” as the next phase of the SEC’s “Project Crypto” initiative. I was honored to give the keynote at the @PhiladelphiaFed ’s Ninth Annual Fintech Conference this morning. My remarks outlined the next steps in the @SECgov ’s Project Crypto and what to expect in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/WI79ANJrfD — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) November 12, 2025 While Atkins assured that the taxonomy “aims to complement, not replace, Congress’s critical work,” he said that he views most crypto tokens as non-securities . Atkins declared that he believes digital commodities, digital collectibles, and digital tools do not constitute securities, while tokenized securities do, as they “represent the ownership of a financial instrument enumerated in the definition of ‘security’ that is maintained on a crypto network.” “A reasonable Commission approach to crypto will not by itself decide the fate of the market—or of any particular project,” Atkins said. “Markets will do that.” “But it will help to ensure that the United States remains a place where people can experiment and learn, fail and succeed, under rules that are both firm and fair,” he added. New Crypto Market Structure Draft Outlines SEC, CFTC Collaboration Atkins’ commentary comes just days after Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) announced their own crypto market structure legislation discussion draft. The draft specifically orders the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to “collaborate on necessary inter-agency rulemakings.” “As Congress works to expand authority for the commission to oversee the trading of digital assets that are commodities, it’s essential that we also ensure it has the tools, personnel, and resources necessary to carry out this new mission, along with its current responsibilities,” Boozman said.

Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity are choosing Ethereum to power their real-world asset (RWA) offerings — a major sign of growing trust from traditional finance. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund, for example, tokenizes U.S. Treasury bonds directly on Ethereum, letting investors earn yield through decentralized rails. This rising institutional adoption is one of the strongest signals yet that Ethereum’s long-term trajectory could still be just getting started. The total assets under management (AUM) of these products have increased by an eye-popping 2,000% since January 2024, according to data from Token Terminal. This emphasizes institutions’ growing interest in tokenization. A report from Fidelity Digital Assets in early October highlighted that “beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, some of the most noteworthy developments in digital assets are happening in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).” Ethereum’s lead in this market gives it a unique edge that favors a bullish outlook for its native asset. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Needs a Clean Breakout Above $3,700 to Resume Its Rally ETH found support at the $3,200 level in the past few days. Market volatility has spiked, and trading volumes have exceeded the average as the token struggles to recapture the $4,000 area. The price has retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) multiple times lately but has failed to move above it multiple times. A descending price channel has also been forminig since early October as ETH failed to make it to $5,000. The end of the U.S. government shutdown could help Ethereum break out of its descending price channel and resume its upward trajectory to $4,700. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just sent a buy signal upon crossing above the 14-day moving average. If positive momentum accelerates, a break above $3,700 would mark the beginning of its next leg up. As crypto markets bounce back, early presales with strong utility like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could deliver the biggest upside. This ambitious project brings Solana-level speed and low fees to Bitcoin, unlocking the network’s full potential with the first true scaling solution.

The traders who win 2026 won’t be the ones chasing the noisiest charts—they’ll be the ones turning tight spreads, reliable depth, and disciplined risk into steady, repeatable outcomes. That’s where FX quietly outclasses crypto. If you’re building a daily playbook, pressure-test ideas against external filters to avoid narrative traps. Many desks also benchmark BTC/alt flow and session bias via crypto signals telegram before committing real capital, using it as one of several sanity checks rather than a crutch, according to Coinspot , the fast-growing crypto media. Why FX’s “small edges” add up faster in 2026 • Execution survives stress. Event-time liquidity in major pairs means you can size conviction without fills becoming the trade’s biggest risk.• Costs compound. Lower spread + impact + slippage create a structural advantage over hundreds of tickets.• More ways to be right. Policy divergence, terms of trade, and cross-pair rotation offer edges beyond a single “risk-on/risk-off” call. Where crypto still wins—and how to use it wisely • Right-tail convexity: When flows align, momentum can sprint—treat it as a tactical sleeve sized by realized vol.• Idiosyncratic catalysts: Upgrades and tokenomics shifts create event trades off the standard macro calendar.• 24/7 access (with rules): Useful flexibility, but manage weekend gaps and venue fragmentation with defined-risk structures. FX Playbook for 2026 (Do, Don’t, and How) 1) Carry—with guardrails • Do: Target positive real-rate differentials; scale with volatility targeting.• Don’t: Overstay when guidance flips or realized vol spikes.• How: Pre-set cut rules (e.g., two-vol move or guidance change). 2) Event-driven execution • Do: Treat CPI, labor prints, and central-bank days as opportunity maps.• Don’t: Wing it; slippage limits must be written down.• How: Bracket entries, define max impact per ticket, and prewrite exit logic. 3) Pair selection > beta • Do: Hunt relative divergence across G10 and selective EM.• Don’t: Force a single USD narrative to fit every week.• How: Maintain a rotation board (strong/neutral/weak) refreshed after each macro block. 4) XAUUSD as a regime compass • Do: Let gold’s trend inform risk stance in both FX and crypto sleeves.• Don’t: Treat it as dogma—use it to pace aggression, not to predict. Crypto Tactics that actually survive the year • Vol-targeted sizing: Keep exposure proportional to realized vol; adjust quickly on regime change.• Staggered entries/exits: Ladder positions; use time/vol bands for exits to dodge thin-book whipsaws.• Defined-risk optionality: Options/spreads capture upside while capping gap risk. Costs & controls: the overlooked alpha • Track after-cost performance (spread + impact + slippage) per strategy.• Sunset systems that earn less than they cost to run—even if screenshots look great.• Review fills weekly; promote playbooks that keep net efficiency above your hurdle. A portfolio that compounds (not just pops) • Core: FX carry/relative-value/event strategies for steady Sharpe and scalable size.• Tactical: A lean crypto sleeve for momentum bursts, sized by vol and protected by options where sensible.• Overlay: Regime reads from XAUUSD and EUR/USD trend structure to throttle risk. Execution checklist (pin this) • Pre-define maximum slippage per instrument; skip trades that breach it.• Pre-fund collateral to avoid forced exits in stress windows.• Keep event playbooks: what to trade, how to size, where to cut, how to re-enter.• Log and audit after-cost PnL—the only number that compounds. Risks that can flip your board • Policy shocks: Tariffs, sanctions, capital controls—FX reprices first; crypto follows via sentiment.• Liquidity air-pockets: Weekends (crypto) and surprise data (FX) stretch spreads—plan exits before entries.• Rule changes: Constructive long-term, choppy short-term; edges migrate as spreads compress.

Prices have struggled to rise in the face of AI-bubble fears in recent weeks, with Bitcoin and Ethereum down by 9% and 16% in the last 30 days. This may be disappointing for investors, yet most major tokens are now in oversold territory, meaning that they should bounce back soon. And one of the most promising coins in such a context is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based token that’s about to launch crypto’s mine-to-earn platform. Best Altcoin to Buy Today – 12 November Opened in September, PEPENODE’s presale has now raised in excess of $2.1 million, as investors race to buy its native token at discounted prices. While the market is awash in meme coins, what sets PEPENODE apart from the crowd is the fact that it carries some interesting tokenomics and fundamentals. PEPENODE is building something special from the ground up. Buy Meme Nodes. Upgrade Facilities. Earn meme Coins. All on one platform https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/JUTG2F6eXG — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 11, 2025 In particular, it will launch a mine-to-earn token that will provide users with the ability to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, which can earn them rewards in third-party meme coins (e.g., Pepe and Fartcoin). All participants need to build their own rigs is to spend PEPENODE itself on acquiring nodes. The more virtual mining nodes a user owns, the greater their rewards will be. It’s as simple as that, with PEPENODE aiming to remove the complexity and costs that come with normal cryptocurrency mining. And given that users will need to buy PEPENODE to buy more nodes, demand for the token could be high, pushing its price up over time. On top of this, holders of PEPENODE will be able to stake the coin for a passive income, with the coin’s protocol currently paying an APY of just over 600%. This promises to make PEPENODE one of the most exciting and profitable new coins around, something which helps to explain why its presale has taken off. PEPENODE Launch Could Coincide with Bull Rally As a token, PEPENODE will have a max supply of 210 billion tokens, and it has been audited by Coinsult , with no red flags. Given its rising popularity, investors may want to join the presale as early as possible, which they can do by going to the PEPENODE website. They can connect a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), and then buy the desired amount of PEPENODE, which is currently available at $0.0011454. This price will rise at regular intervals until the sale ends, so traders looking to lock in the biggest possible return should act quickly. And because its launch looks likely to coincide with a market-wide recovery, PEPENODE does seem to be one of the best altcoins available right now.

In a recent announcement via the social-media platform X, RippleX noted that its user base is being targeted by fraudulent campaigns that leverage counterfeit livestreams and AI-generated deep-fake videos purporting to represent company executives. The advisory arrives amid a marked increase in scam activity aimed at XRP investors. Fraudsters are reportedly using artificial-intelligence tools to create highly convincing videos appearing to depict executives such as Brad Garlinghouse . These videos typically promise large giveaway rewards of XRP in exchange for token deposits or wallet access, attempts at theft dressed as generosity. The scams often appear in the commentary or reply threads of posts from official accounts, lending them a misleading air of legitimacy. Beware of scams using fake Ripple or XRP livestreams, giveaways, or deepfake videos. Ripple employees will never ask you to send funds, share wallet info, or join investment streams. Always verify information through @Ripple and @RippleXDev . Keep your XRP yours. — RippleX (@RippleXDev) November 11, 2025 RippleX’s Official Guidance to the Community In its warning, RippleX emphasized unequivocally that no member of the company’s management team will ever ask users to transfer funds, participate in investment schemes, or provide wallet seed phrases or private keys. It advised holders of XRP to rely exclusively on official channels, specifically the @RippleX and @RippleXDev handles on X, when verifying any giveaway or promotional activity. The message ended with a direct instruction for users to guard their tokens carefully. Background on Scam Landscape and Company Measures Scams targeting XRP holders are not new, but their sophistication has grown. After Ripple achieved incremental legal and regulatory milestones , fraudsters ramped up impersonation tactics, especially after company announcements. In some cases, fake channels on platforms such as YouTube and X have hosted fraudulent content featuring manipulated imagery and audio claiming celebratory airdrops. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple previously raised legal action against YouTube in 2020 over similar impersonation issues, and later reached an agreement to collaborate on content-removal efforts. Experts now warn that as deep-fake generation tools become more accessible, the risk of fraud targeting crypto users continues to escalate. Why This Matters for XRP Investors The relevance of this advisory is underscored by the fact that high-value crypto assets like XRP attract not only legitimate investment but also malicious actors seeking to exploit user trust. Deep-fake and impersonation scams erode confidence, pose real risk to holdings, and can trigger sizable financial losses. For investors holding or transacting XRP, the alert serves as a reminder that vigilance is essential, no matter how credible a message or appearance may seem. RippleX’s latest message serves as a timely reminder that the prominence of XRP and its ecosystem makes it a recurring target for fraudulent actors . By clarifying that the company will never solicit funds or personal wallet credentials, the advisory aims to equip users with clear guardrails. Investors and community members are advised to confirm all offers through verified sources and to remain highly cautious of any promotion that requests an upfront token transfer or personal wallet access. Staying alert and skeptical remains the best defense. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On-chain data shows whales are loading up, reinforcing a bullish TRUMP price prediction as momentum builds. Data from CryptoQuant shows that whales have been placing large bets on TRUMP across both spot and futures markets, likely anticipating a resolution to the U.S. government shutdown. Trading activity remains intense, with volumes hitting $675 million—nearly half of the token’s circulating supply. Adding fuel to the fire, Trump’s latest proposal to issue $2,000 checks to Americans using tariff revenue has stirred fresh excitement, potentially setting the stage for another leg up in TRUMP’s price. Trump Price Prediction: $15 Target In Sight If TRUMP Stays Above $7 The daily chart shows that TRUMP has broken out of a falling wedge, signaling a possible trend reversal. After retesting and holding the $7 level as support, the token surged to $9.5, now a critical resistance level to watch. This zone aligns with the 200-day EMA, so a decisive move above it could trigger a strong rally toward $15, unlocking a potential 101% gain if bullish momentum holds. The RSI remains above the signal line, suggesting buyers still have the upper hand. As long as TRUMP holds above $7, the uptrend remains intact. While a 10X move may not happen immediately, the token could reach $15 if the President successfully ends the U.S. government shutdown. With meme coins poised for renewed attention as altcoin season approaches, TRUMP may continue leading the pack. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is exploding onto the scene, racking up nearly $4 million in its presale in record time.

Boston Fed President Susan Collins recently made headlines by advocating for holding rates steady amid limited data and persistent inflation concerns. This cautious approach reflects the complex challenges facing monetary policymakers. Why Is Holding Rates Steady the Preferred Approach? Susan Collins, who previously supported rate cuts, now emphasizes the need for patience. The current environment demands holding rates steady because inflation remains elevated while economic data remains incomplete. This strategic pause allows policymakers to gather more information before making their next move. Collins specifically highlighted several key factors supporting her position: Limited inflation data due to government shutdowns Uncertain labor market conditions Balancing risks between inflation and employment Need for clear signs of economic deterioration What Challenges Does Limited Data Create? The government shutdown has created significant data gaps, making policy decisions more difficult. Without complete economic information, holding rates steady becomes the most prudent course of action. Collins stressed that policymakers need reliable data to assess whether the economy requires additional stimulus or continued restraint. This data limitation affects multiple areas: Inflation tracking becomes less precise Employment trends are harder to identify Economic growth measurements are delayed Consumer spending patterns are unclear How Does This Impact Future Rate Decisions? The current stance of holding rates steady sets the stage for future policy moves. Collins indicated that any future rate reductions would require clear evidence of labor market deterioration. This approach ensures that the Fed doesn’t act prematurely while inflation concerns persist. Key considerations for future decisions include: Labor market stability indicators Inflation trajectory over coming months Economic growth projections Global economic conditions What Are the Risks of Moving Too Quickly? Collins warned against hasty policy changes in the current high-uncertainty environment. Holding rates steady helps balance the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Moving too quickly could either reignite inflation or unnecessarily slow economic growth. The primary risks include: Undermining inflation control efforts Creating unnecessary economic volatility Reducing policy credibility Limiting future policy flexibility Conclusion: The Wisdom of Patience in Uncertain Times The decision to advocate for holding rates steady reflects careful consideration of current economic conditions. Susan Collins’ shift from supporting rate cuts to emphasizing patience demonstrates how evolving data and circumstances influence monetary policy. This cautious approach provides the Federal Reserve with valuable time to assess the economic landscape while maintaining stability in financial markets. Frequently Asked Questions Why has Susan Collins changed her position on interest rates? Collins has shifted her stance due to ongoing inflation concerns and limited economic data caused by government shutdowns. She believes holding rates steady provides the best balance between controlling inflation and supporting employment. How long might the Fed continue holding rates steady? The duration depends on incoming economic data. Collins suggests rates should remain at current levels until there are clear signs of either rising inflation or significant labor market deterioration. What economic indicators will trigger rate changes? Key indicators include inflation rates, employment data, wage growth, and economic growth metrics. Clear trends in these areas would prompt reconsideration of the current policy stance. How does limited data affect Fed decisions? Incomplete economic information makes it difficult to assess the true state of the economy. This uncertainty makes holding rates steady the safest approach until more reliable data becomes available. What are the risks of changing rates too soon? Premature rate changes could either accelerate inflation if cuts are too early, or unnecessarily slow economic growth if hikes occur too soon. Both scenarios could harm economic stability. How does this affect consumers and businesses? Holding rates steady maintains current borrowing costs for mortgages, business loans, and credit cards. This provides stability for financial planning while the economic outlook remains uncertain. Found this analysis helpful?

The issue briefly disrupted normal activity across the network before being corrected. Automation Error Triggers Network Disruption The incident began when BitGo’s automated account management system continued to issue new account creation requests even after the wallet’s balance reached zero. On the XRP Ledger, activating a new account requires a base reserve of one XRP, and transactions that do not meet this requirement are automatically rejected. However, the automation did not stop despite the insufficient balance, leading to thousands of consecutive failed transactions. Blockchain explorers recorded a sharp rise in “UNFUNDED_PAYMENT” entries, indicating a high number of unsuccessful operations. Activity metrics showed that the number of attempted account activations spiked to roughly 11,000 in a single day, far above normal levels. Something interesting on chain. I'm not sure yet who is behind it. > BitGo activating thousands of XRP accounts in masses the past couple days. > Account Set tx spike > Multi Sig tx spike There's a story here. pic.twitter.com/QWPEsSfJsy — Vet (@Vet_X0) November 7, 2025 The accumulation of failed entries temporarily congested network trackers, though the ledger’s consensus and transaction integrity remained intact. Community and Developer Response Community members quickly noticed the anomaly. XRPL contributor “Vet” drew attention to the abnormal pattern of account creation attempts and speculated that a coding oversight might have caused the continuous transaction loop. Within hours, developers confirmed that the excessive activity originated from BitGo’s systems. Following the detection of the error, BitGo initiated an internal review and determined that the cause was an automation fault rather than a security breach. The company later replenished the affected wallet with 1,048 XRP to restore functionality and prevent the system from issuing further unfunded payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Once the deposit was made, the repeated failed transactions stopped, and normal operations resumed on the ledger. The event serves as a reminder of the potential network-wide impact of automated processes that interact directly with public blockchains. Even minor scripting oversights can produce widespread operational effects if not properly safeguarded. In this case, while no user assets were affected and no malicious activity occurred, the episode demonstrated how essential it is for custodial providers to maintain robust monitoring and fail-safe mechanisms. At present, the XRP Ledger is operating normally, and BitGo’s systems have stabilized. The incident underscores the importance of proactive reserve management and effective error-handling protocols in automated wallet operations to ensure network reliability and prevent unnecessary transaction load.

By December that year, it hit $19,666. In 2020, when the McRib came back on Dec. 2, BTC was $18,773 and later climbed to $64,895 by April 2022, a gain of 245%. In 2021, the sandwich returned with Bitcoin at $61,000; nine days later, it topped $69,000, a 13% increase and a new record then. The legendary McRib returns 11/11 at most McDonald’s in the US.

He wrote: “Here’s a look back at how Bitcoin has reacted to news that McDonald’s McRib is back on the menu. They just announced it again last week. And you’re bearish?” Voell even shared a chart mapping the digital currency’s price against McRib announcement dates, which caught widespread attention among traders. Other analysts have mixed views. Some market watchers say the pattern reflects how social mood and investor psychology often shape crypto movements more than logic or data. They point out that people tend to find patterns that fit their beliefs, even when the evidence is thin. Others describe the McRib-Bitcoin link as a meme that got too much credit, noting that in some years BTC moved the opposite way despite the sandwich’s return. On Correlation & Causation According to those skeptical voices, the McRib’s timing could simply line up with typical end-of-year optimism in markets. Coincidence, they say, should not be mistaken for a reliable pattern. Analysts have also pointed out that traders often cherry-pick the examples that support the story while ignoring years when the crypto moved differently. Still, the conversation highlights how crypto culture loves turning memes into signals. Some traders treat the McRib’s return as a symbolic marker of good times ahead, a lighthearted reminder that markets are not only driven by numbers but by mood and imagination too.

Speaking at the XRP Meetup NYC in the run-up to Ripple’s Swell conference—and in remarks shared via a clip by Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba) on X—Traidman argued that the publicly listed “digital asset treasury companies” which ran hot earlier this year are now trading like the investment-trust boom-and-bust of the early 2000s. “In the last 60 days or so, we’ve seen several and many, actually, of the digital asset treasury companies collapse. A lot of the stocks have been down by 80%, 90%. This is reminiscent of what we saw in the early 2000s… Initially, they traded at much higher to their net asset value. And eventually, they collapsed completely. And those companies are not publicly traded anymore. To be totally honest, the same thing is happening with DAT companies right now.” DATs are collapsing, according to the former @Ripple board member. VIVOPOWER has been BUYING $XRP exposure at 84% OFF by purchasing shares in @Ripple. With the new Ripple $40B Valuation, the XRP discount is effectively 59% off. VivoPower Strategy explained here:… pic.twitter.com/ypSrGAgRsC — 🌸Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) November 12, 2025 The XRP Treasury Company 2.0 The response, he said, is a second-generation construct that acquires underlying exposure at a discount instead of paying token spot. “What we are doing at VivoPower, and what I think the future is, is this sort of second generation of DATs. I call it a DAT 2.0 strategy. Some folk call it an anti-DAT strategy, which is, instead of buying the net asset at spot price, you buy the net asset at a massive discount.” Related Reading: XRP To $10? Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark He used Bitcoin to illustrate how unusual an “80% off” entry actually is—mining might lower unit cost by 20–30%, but not by 80%. “How would you buy Bitcoin at an 80% discount today? You can’t… You might mine it… and then you might be able to get it at a 20%, 30% discount by mining it… But how the hell are you going to get it for 80% off?” The answer, in VivoPower’s case, is tied to Ripple. As Traidman put it, there is a unique linkage between a private company and the crypto asset that enables discount capture through corporate financing structures rather than on-exchange purchases. “There’s 25 million cryptocurrencies on coinmarketcap.com. There’s only one that is tied to a private company that is severely undervalued in terms of its share price, and that’s XRP, because of Ripple, right? And so that’s the opportunity that we are taking advantage of.” Related Reading: XRP Flashes Strongest Macro Bull Trend in Its History: Chartist This is the core ordering of operations in his remarks: first, acquire XRP exposure at a claimed “84% off” via mechanisms that revolve around Ripple’s equity and related look-through economics; second, put the resulting XRP to work on yield networks. Flare sits explicitly in the second step. “And then we work with our partners, like Flare, in order to generate yield on those XRP assets. And so that’s essentially buying XRP basically 84% off, and then investing it onto networks like Flare in order to generate a yield.” By emphasizing the sequencing—discounted acquisition tied to Ripple first, yield generation on Flare second—Traidman also addressed why this model does not rely on the market assigning a premium to the operating company. “So it’s like a DAT 1.0 plus the 2.0 strategy, right? And so the companies in this model don’t even need to trade at a premium to MNAV, like Saylor’s MicroStrategy does, because by default, they’re making money on day one. T plus one second, every dollar that gets put into our company gets a forex return, right? That’s only available when you can buy the net asset at a discount.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.44.

This news follows recent reports that Johor attracted about 164.45 billion ringgit as of the second quarter, equivalent to around $40 billion in data center investment. Analysts researched this growing interest in Johor. They discovered that the state has positioned itself as an investment hub, particularly with the establishment of a new special economic zone by Singapore. According to their estimates, Johor is expected to host approximately 60% of Malaysia’s data centers by 2030. This move shows promise of favorable development or future success for UEM, especially considering that its property development arm, UEM Sunrise Bhd., owns almost 4,600 acres in the area. Khazanah’s UEM intends to use its extensive land assets to back a data center based in Johor During an interview in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, November 11, Amran mentioned that Sunrise is making a strategy for the Gerbang Nusajaya Industrial Park, which will operate on renewable energy and cover 40 acres. Moreover, he highlighted that UEM Lestra Bhd., their green energy division, is preparing to initiate the construction of a 1-gigawatt hybrid solar plant, funded by investors such as the Macquarie Group and I Squared Capital Advisors. Notably, the initial stage of this plant will be a 500-megawatt facility priced at 2.5 billion ringgit, as stated by Lestra earlier this year. Meanwhile, UEM is exploring the potential investment in water treatment for industrial parks, which is crucial for cooling data centers. Amran stated, “This aligns with providing energy to industrial parks.” He added that there is a significant demand for water and power for industrial use, even without considering the needs of data centers. According to BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, Malaysia ranks one of Asia’s top three growth markets. The development of data centers in the region is expected to significantly increase power demand until 2028, as mentioned in an industry outlook report released this week. However, this rapid expansion stresses the country’s land and power resources, including the electrical grid. BMI noted that it has become increasingly important yet more challenging to meet this new demand for clean energy since renewable energy commitments are becoming a key focus for data center operators’ business plans. On the other hand, the Malaysian conglomerate, which has primarily been associated with property and road infrastructure projects, is now prioritizing green energy and sustainability initiatives for future growth. Last year, Lestra acquired a majority share in Nur Power, Malaysia’s only independent power utility company, for an undisclosed amount. They also pledged 1.5 billion ringgit to help reduce carbon emissions in industrial parks nationwide by 2026. Amran expresses his optimism about 2026 based on the current deals they have struck Currently, Lestra supplies biogas power to Kulim Hi-Tech Park, located in Kedah state, which is home to companies such as Infineon Technologies AG and AT&S that specialize in semiconductors and electronic components. The biogas facility has a capacity of 350 MW and is fully utilized. “We can upgrade the plant to have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity if we get approval from the regulators,” Amran mentioned. He also stated that the company is interested in selling biogas power to other industrial areas via Malaysia’s national grid. He believes the group will perform better on the profit side in 2025, thanks to increased contributions from Sunrise and other divisions. He also expressed optimism about 2026 based on the current deals they have lined up.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 423 points, or 0.9%, reaching a new intraday high as investors awaited a House vote on a bill to end the 40-day government closure. Stocks Surge as Confidence Returns Strong performances from banking giants such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and American Express fueled the rally. The S&P 500 inched up 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%, showing slight weakness in tech shares. Meanwhile, gold climbed to around $4,180 and silver rose above $53, boosted by safe-haven demand and expectations of resumed government data releases once the shutdown ends. Investors seemed to rotate back into equities and commodities with clearer ties to fiscal policy and credit conditions. Bitcoin Pulls Back Bitcoin dropped 3.4%, falling from an intraday high of $105,300 to a weekly low near $101,200. The decline came as investors shifted capital toward traditional assets, signaling a temporary cooling of crypto enthusiasm following a strong rally earlier in the week. The move reflects a broader recalibration in risk appetite. As the threat of a prolonged shutdown fades, market participants appear more comfortable positioning around traditional investments rather than digital assets. ETF Inflows Suggest Long-Term Optimism Despite short-term weakness, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains supported by institutional interest. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded $524 million in cumulative net inflows on Tuesday — the highest daily total since early October. The renewed ETF activity suggests that investors are gradually rebuilding exposure to Bitcoin after the volatility seen earlier this month.

This strategic move could redefine how blockchain companies access capital markets, offering fresh opportunities for growth and innovation. If you’re tracking the evolution of cryptocurrency and blockchain enterprises, this development deserves your full attention. The Parameta KOSDAQ listing represents more than just a corporate milestone—it signals growing mainstream acceptance of blockchain technology. Why Is the Parameta KOSDAQ Listing Significant? The planned Parameta KOSDAQ listing marks a pivotal moment for blockchain adoption in traditional finance. KOSDAQ, South Korea’s equivalent to NASDAQ, primarily lists technology and growth-oriented companies. Therefore, Parameta’s potential entry demonstrates how blockchain firms are gaining recognition as legitimate tech enterprises. This listing could pave the way for other blockchain companies to follow similar paths, bridging the gap between innovative technology and established financial markets. Moreover, it validates the company’s transition from ICONLOOP to Parameta, reflecting its expanded vision beyond initial blockchain solutions. What Does This Mean for Stablecoin Development? Parameta’s current fundraising of 20 billion won ($14.4 million) directly supports its stablecoin platform development. Stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like fiat currencies—address volatility concerns that often deter mainstream adoption. The Parameta KOSDAQ listing could accelerate this development through: Enhanced funding access for research and implementation Increased credibility among financial institutions Broader partnerships within traditional finance sectors Consequently, investors and users might soon benefit from more reliable digital assets that combine blockchain’s advantages with price stability. How Could This Impact the Broader Blockchain Ecosystem? The Parameta KOSDAQ listing extends beyond one company’s success. It serves as a benchmark for how blockchain businesses can integrate with conventional economic systems. First, it demonstrates that blockchain technology can meet regulatory standards required for public listings. Second, it may encourage more institutional investment into the blockchain space, potentially driving innovation across various applications like supply chain management, digital identity, and decentralized finance. However, challenges remain, including regulatory compliance and market volatility, which Parameta must navigate carefully. What Should Investors and Enthusiasts Watch For?

A few users have even been trading with real contracts, and the company is still refining its systems in advance of a wider launch. Now, with that beta release, Polymarket makes a tentative return to the American market after years of being based overseas. The company had limited access from the United States as a result of an agreement with regulators in 2022. This development comes as Polymarket announced on Wednesday that data from its prediction market platform will be integrated into Yahoo Finance , expanding the reach of its product to potentially more people. According to the X announcement, Polymarket said that it had become Yahoo Finance’s “exclusive prediction market partner,” while sharing a 30-second video featuring the song “Timeless” by The Weekend and Playboi Carti. Polymarket secures compliance for U.S. relaunch Polymarket’s U.S. return comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the company settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), agreeing to pay a $1.4 million penalty after admitting that it had operated as an unregistered derivatives platform. This time, however, the company’s relaunch is built on compliance, as it is acquiring QCX, a CFTC-approved entity that operates as both a derivatives exchange and a clearinghouse. Polymarket can rest easy, as it runs a legal show in the U.S., while ensuring the development of a decentralized and transparent system. It has also introduced a new, simpler fee structure that it hopes will appeal to users and challenge entrenched competitors, such as Kalshi Inc. Later this month, Polymarket will launch with a small menu of markets, including sports and political results, among others. More are expected to be added. The gradual rollout, according to the team, helps it meet the regulatory requirements. The resurgence of Polymarket also coincides with a surge in interest in prediction markets in the U.S. These markets, where people place bets on real-world events ranging from elections to the outcomes of reality television series, have garnered attention for the crowdsourcing of forecasts they provide. Instead of taking bets — competing with traditional celebrity gossip sites for page views and advertising revenue — Polymarket functions more like a stock market. Users buy shares in an outcome they believe will prevail, and prices are based on the collective popular opinion. This arrangement is also more transparent and liquid — and, Coplan said, a more equitable deal for participants. Polymarket intensifies competition in prediction markets This re-entry by Polymarket increases the stakes for prediction platforms to address the challenge, aside from its main competitor, Kalshi Inc., which is already licensed in the U.S. and provides a market for event-based futures contracts. Meanwhile, for some of the largest companies in the gambling business, that same turf is now being seen as a new frontier: FanDuel last week announced that it would soon introduce its own product based on prediction markets. Polymarket has a major advantage, though. Founded five years ago, the company’s platform, built on blockchain technology, allows members to settle trades almost as soon as they are executed and to view every transaction. Combined with low overheads, such as reduced fees and a decentralized system, it presents itself as a technologically advanced and compliance-friendly choice. Insiders say Polymarket is on its way to a valuation of as high as $2 billion, following intense investor interest after it secured a commitment of up to $2 billion in venture capital from Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which owns the New York Stock Exchange. That round is, in some sense, a sign of increasing institutional interest in the future of event-based prediction markets.

The company reported that its earlier forecast fell short by almost $1 billion, and the new figure put it above expectations tracked by Wall Street, and this is after Cisco outperformed revenue and earnings targets in the second quarter too. The company said it now expects $4.14 per share in adjusted earnings for fiscal 2026, a number that stands higher than the $4.05 analysts projected. Demand for secure and fast networking is rising as businesses rush into AI upgrades across data centers, cloud systems, and enterprise networks. AI orders increase as Cisco builds partnerships and updates hardware Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, speaking to analysts during a conference call, said the company expects the AI pipeline to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2026. Chuck said customers are moving fast to unlock AI systems, and that networks must stay secure as workloads expand. The company also said late Wednesday that AI infrastructure orders reached $1.3 billion in the most recent period, compared with $800 million in the quarter before that. Executives said Cisco is redesigning chips and routing systems to handle heavier AI traffic, with upgrades meant to connect large racks of servers used for advanced training models and other compute‑heavy tasks. Cisco is competing against Broadcom and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which owns Juniper Networks, but the business is also working with Nvidia through a partnership that the company says gives it an advantage in building AI‑optimized network equipment. During the fiscal first quarter, which ended October 25, Cisco reported $14.9 billion in revenue, showing an 8% rise from the previous year. Profit landed at $1 per share, excluding certain items. Analysts tracking the numbers estimated revenue would hit $14.8 billion and earnings would reach 98 cents, results the company managed to beat. For the fiscal second quarter that runs through January, Cisco expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.2 billion, above the $14.7 billion prediction from analysts, with earnings of $1.02 per share, compared with an expected 99 cents. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Woo Jin Ho wrote that the company’s AI momentum has not slowed and said the higher forecast still looks cautious, adding that there could be room for limited upside if demand keeps rising. Cisco CFO Mark Patterson said demand for updated networking gear continues to build, noting that a multi‑year campus refresh cycle is starting to gain pace across large customers. Cisco expands through security, training, and AI‑powered development Cisco is broadening its product line through security and observability tools, and the largest step came in 2024 when it bought Splunk for $28 billion. Chuck has pointed to the deal as part of a plan to reduce exposure to hardware cycles while deepening the company’s software business. Inside the company, employees are being pushed to use AI tools rather than face layoffs. Chuck told CNBC earlier that he does not want to cut engineers and instead wants the current team to innovate faster and be more productive. The approach contrasts with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Accenture, which cut staff during the broader shift toward automation. Chief information officer Fletcher Previn, speaking about internal development, said 70% of the company’s 20,000 developers log into AI coding tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot at least once a month. Fletcher said AI‑generated code now accounts for nearly a quarter of all the code produced inside the company, up from 4% the year before. Global head of talent acquisition Scott McGuckin told Fortune that managers who use AI encourage teams to adopt the tools faster. Scott said: “While I haven’t placed any mandatory AI training on my immediate team, I highly expect them to be taking advantage of the AI tools and courses available in the company. Those who do, show me their creativity, productivity, and strategic thinking.” As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco shares were up 25% for the year, ahead of the Nasdaq’s 21% gain.

For 2025, that opportunity may be found in RentStac (RNS) , a DeFi token built around real-world property income and transparent blockchain mechanics. Here’s how simple math shows how a modest $1,000 investment can potentially grow to $50,000 as RentStac’s ecosystem expands. The Path From $1,000 to $50,000 At the current presale price of $0.025 per token, $1,000 buys 40,000 RNS. Early participants receive a 100 percent bonus, which doubles that to 80,000 tokens. If RNS later trades at just $0.50, a level several analysts consider achievable once the project reaches exchange listings and expands its property portfolio, those 80,000 tokens would be worth $40,000. At $0.60, the value climbs to $48,000. And if the token hits $1, that original $1,000 would equal $80,000 in value. The structure of the presale rewards early entry, making the first phases the most lucrative window for investors who recognize the project’s fundamentals early on. Why RentStac Can Support This Growth The key behind RentStac’s potential lies in its connection to real-world income. Unlike speculative tokens, RNS is tied to rental yield generated from legally verified properties. Each property is held through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), ensuring that the income streams are transparent and backed by real assets. The platform converts property earnings into stablecoin distributions, giving holders a steady source of yield while also supporting token demand. This hybrid model combines the predictable returns of traditional real estate with the scalability of decentralized finance. Dual-Yield Design and Deflationary Mechanics RentStac’s system allows investors to earn in two ways: passive rental income and staking rewards. Token holders can stake RNS to earn a share of platform revenue while also benefiting from property-linked yield paid in stablecoins. In addition, a portion of platform revenue is allocated to buy back and burn RNS from circulation. This creates a deflationary effect that supports token appreciation over time. The structure mirrors what made early DeFi leaders like Aave and Chainlink successful, measurable utility supported by real economics. Security and Transparency Security is central to the project’s credibility. RentStac’s code has already achieved a 92.48 percent score on Solidity Scan, with a full audit by CertiK currently underway. Each transaction related to property income is verified through multi-signature wallets and oracle data feeds, ensuring accuracy and compliance across the system. The governance model also allows community voting via DAO, letting token holders influence decisions on property additions, yields, and platform upgrades. Why Analysts Are Watching Closely As the DeFi market matures, investors are shifting toward projects with verified income streams rather than speculative hype. RentStac aligns with that trend perfectly. Its connection to the global rental market, a multi-trillion-dollar sector gives it scalability and resilience that pure digital assets cannot replicate. That’s why early participants see RNS not just as another crypto presale, but as one of the first tokens designed to generate steady value while offering exponential upside as adoption increases. The Bottom Line Turning $1,000 into $50,000 isn’t about luck, it’s about timing, structure, and fundamentals. RentStac offers a transparent, asset-backed approach that combines property income, staking, and deflationary economics in a single ecosystem. While no investment is risk-free, RentStac’s real-world connection gives it a long-term foundation that few new tokens can match. As the presale continues, early participants are positioning themselves for what could be one of DeFi’s most significant success stories of 2025.

With Q4 2025 drawing near, analysts are indicating a $0.035 DeFi crypto project. The traders are seeing the initial indications of increasing demand and some suspect that this structure behind the token might make it one of the strongest growth opportunities in the quarter. Its premise is starting to draw interest in all quarters of investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that is being developed to introduce clarity and efficiency to lending digital assets. The platform employs a Peer-to-Contract business model in which users place assets in a liquidity pool. Such deposits are turned into mtTokens tracking earned interests. APY is boosted when the demand for loans is high. As such, mtTokens automatically update with increased interest income in case a person provides the market with for example $1,000 of ETH and borrowing operations increase. There are also Peer-to-peer lending markets of assets that are more controlled under Mutuum Finance. Borrowers are subjected to variable interest rates which are influenced by availability of liquidity. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios provide the maximum and minimum amount of collateral that can be borrowed. Less riskier assets will have greater LTVs whereas more risky assets will have lower limits. A liquidation process is triggered in case a borrower is put in a situation that is unsafe. To create an overall solvency, liquidators have the ability to purchase discounted collateral to put the situation back on track. These mechanics devise a system constructed on anticipatory lending, equity borrowing and reliable liquidations. Numbers Behind the Presale At the beginning of 2025, the presale was initiated at $0.01. Those early prices developed an excellent foundation among early purchasers. On current days MUTM is set on Phase 6 at a price of $0.035, 250% up the initial stage. The presale figures are serious growth. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $18.6 million and found 17,900 tokenholders, and sold 796 million tokens. The percentage of Phase 6 allocated is more than 86% and the demand is rising day by day. The price of confirmation of launching at $0.06 supports anticipations of initial appreciation. Investors who got in at $0.01 are poised to see a growth of 500% at listing and even investors in Phase 6, having entered at 0.035, still have a significant uptake potential. Direct card purchases also introduced by Mutuum Finance and this enhanced accessibility and appeal to large buyers. The 24-hour leaderboard is another catalyst of action as it gives the best contributor of the day MUTM tokens. This makes the participation dynamic and visible, which provides energy to keep on. Foundations and Security Analyst Outlook According to analysts who follow the developments in early DeFi, the development of Mutuum Finance is among the largest factors that increase the popularity. The team made the designation on X that its V1 borrowing and lending protocol would debut on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. V1 incorporates: the Liquidity Pool, the mtTokens, the Debt Tokens and the Liquidator Bot, ETH and USDT were the first supported assets. The fact that actual development milestones are being seen in the pre-listing stage becomes a confidence build among long-term traders. Mutuum Finance, as well, underwent an audit of their token by CertiK that provides an additional layer of credibility to the smart-contracts of the protocol. Investors highly value security, and it applies to the DeFi crypto industry. Due to these fundamentals, analysts have made solid forecasts. There is some speculation of a 5x to 10x move in the initial expansion phase following the launch in case platform usage is higher. Others look to possible upside elsewhere, pointing to the fact that an early lending business in earlier cycles results in far greater growth once it has grown in critical mass and liquidity. Long-Term Vision Mutuum Finance is not halting at lending. The roadmap has USD-pegged stablecoin backed by treasury inflows that are raised by borrowing interest. Stablecoins lead to liquidity and make lending platforms consistent in activity. They give users a steady value and keep users looking forward to using them in times of open markets. Other significant steps are layer-2 expansion. Networks based on layer-2 enhance speed and the cost of transacting. In the case of a lending platform that has interest updates and liquidation procedures, this has to be enhanced. By making the transition to Layer-2 ecosystems, Mutuum Finance will be able to serve more assets and facilitate the transaction flow and increase user base. Why Analysts See 30x Potential All of this, coupled with impressive performances in presale and, most importantly, audited smart contracts, a form of utility, revenue-driven token utilization and a stablecoin with Layer-2 roadmap make Mutuum Finance look out of place in an oversaturated market. The observers of emerging DeFi protocols refer to the early lending vehicles in the last couple of cycles that brought about colossal growth when their pipeline network developed. Since MUTM is still at $0.035 in Phase 6 and nearing the final phases of presale, this could be one of the best crypto to buy to those looking to have long-term growth, according to many traders. As the quarter 4, 2025 nears, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the new crypto player with the type of platform that could sustain significant growth.

54327483,626111,1762995623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54327483.jpeg,Adam Beck’s Bitcoin Realization: What Kind Of Money Is BTC?,https://bitcoinist.com/adam-becks-bitcoin-realization/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long sparked debates over what it truly represents, with some arguing that it’s digital gold, a store of value, or a revolutionary form of money. Recently, Adam Back, the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream , weighed in with a bold statement, claiming that BTC embodies the essence of permissionless bearer money. Bitcoin As Permissionless Bearer Money Back’s description of Bitcoin as permissionless bearer money positions it as the modern realization of the cypherpunk’s vision for bearer eCash . Essentially, this concept means that BTC, unlike traditional bank accounts or centralized digital currencies, is owned and controlled directly by the individual who holds the private keys . This means that no intermediary can freeze, reverse, or control the transaction, making it an entirely permissionless system where ownership is verifiable and transferable without reliance on banks or governments. Notably, Back’s statement resonates with the original cypherpunk vision and ideals of self-sovereignty and financial privacy. However, some members of the crypto community quickly raised challenges to this view. One critic highlighted the role of Back’s Blockstream in developing the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 (L2) protocol designed to facilitate faster Bitcoin transactions . While it improves efficiency, the crypto community member pointed out that the Lightning Network is permissioned and partially centralized, suggesting nodes can theoretically censor or modify transactions without immediate detection by other participants. He argues that Bitcoin may not remain truly permissionless if widely adopted L2s introduce central points of control. Notably, Back has not publicly responded to these concerns, leaving the debate open to future discussions. The Many Faces Of BTC As Money Over the years, Bitcoin has been described in many ways, reflecting its evolving role in the global financial landscape. In its early stages, it was seen as a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) electronic cash and a decentralized alternative to fiat currencies. As adoption grew, BTC gained recognition as a store of value , appealing to those who want to hedge against inflation and the collapse of fiat currencies. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and rapid growth rate led many to compare it to gold, giving rise to its long-standing title as “ digital gold .” Other perspectives view Bitcoin as a speculative asset , where short-term price volatility often overshadows its intended use as a medium of exchange. More recently, governments have begun looking to the leading cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset for diversifying national holdings from conventional currencies. Meanwhile, for cypherpunk enthusiasts like Back, Bitcoin remains a form of money that prioritizes personal sovereignty, censorship resistance, and privacy. On the opposite end, critics such as crypto agorist @cryptonator1337 highlighted that although BTC was born from experimentations with P2P digital cash, it has since deviated from the original cypherpunk purpose and has become increasingly transparent and surveilled. He noted that every transaction on the blockchain is permanently recorded , revealing sender and receiver addresses, amounts, timestamps, and metadata.",Bitcoin News|@cryptonator1337|Adam Beck|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Transactions|blockstream|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|digital gold|eCash|Layer 2|Lightning Network|p2p|Peer-to-peer,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-13 01:00:23

The market appears to be stabilizing after weeks of volatility, yet on-chain data signals that profit-taking remains active. According to top analyst Darkfost, since the exceptional liquidation event in early October, many investors have started to secure profits and scale back their exposure as the current cycle nears its end. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable uptick in Bitcoin inflows to Binance. The 30-day moving average of daily inflows has climbed sharply throughout October, showing that, on average, roughly 7,500 BTC are being transferred to Binance every day. This is the highest inflow rate since the March correction, indicating renewed selling pressure and cautious positioning among traders. While such inflows often reflect profit realization and short-term selling, Bitcoin’s ability to consolidate near the $100K level suggests resilient underlying demand. Buyers continue to absorb the supply entering the market, preventing a deeper breakdown — at least for now. As the cycle matures, this phase may prove critical in determining whether Bitcoin stabilizes for another leg up or faces a more prolonged correction. Short-Term Holders Add To Selling Pressure As Bitcoin Consolidates Darkfost explains that the recent surge in Bitcoin inflows to Binance and other exchanges reflects growing selling pressure across the market. Despite this, Bitcoin’s price continues to consolidate relatively cleanly around the symbolic $100,000 level — a sign that existing demand remains strong enough to absorb the increased supply. This balance between distribution and accumulation indicates that the market is undergoing a structural reset rather than a full-blown capitulation. Adding to this dynamic, short-term holders (STHs) have become a major contributor to the ongoing selling pressure. These participants are typically the most reactive segment of the market, responding quickly to volatility and sentiment shifts. With a realized price near $112,000, many STHs have been underwater for about a month, prompting them to send significant amounts of BTC to exchanges at a loss. Historically, this type of behavior has coincided with late-stage corrections — what analysts often call a “cleansing phase.” During such phases, speculative capital exits the market while long-term investors quietly absorb the supply, setting the foundation for renewed stability and potential future growth. If demand continues to offset this wave of short-term selling, Bitcoin could soon form a stronger base above $100,000 — paving the way for a gradual recovery as selling pressure fades and confidence returns.

On the weekly chart, BTC remains supported by the 50-week moving average (blue line), which is acting as a strong dynamic floor for price. Despite multiple retests over recent weeks, bulls have managed to defend this level, signaling that underlying demand remains intact even as profit-taking intensifies. The broader structure still points to a healthy long-term uptrend. The 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) moving averages continue sloping upward, confirming that Bitcoin’s macro bias remains bullish. However, the lack of strong volume during recent rebounds suggests that market participants are cautious, awaiting confirmation of renewed momentum before adding to positions.

Conversely, a weekly close below $100K would mark a significant technical breakdown, potentially opening the door to a deeper retrace toward $92K–$95K.

The Altcoin Season Index just made an exciting move, climbing 2 points to reach 28. This subtle shift could signal the beginning of something bigger for alternative cryptocurrencies. Let’s explore what this means for your investment strategy and why savvy crypto enthusiasts are paying close attention. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as our crypto market thermometer. CoinMarketCap calculates this crucial indicator by comparing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over 90 days. However, they exclude stablecoins and wrapped coins from this calculation. The result gives us a clear picture of market sentiment and potential investment opportunities. Think of the Altcoin Season Index as a scoreboard showing which team is winning: Bitcoin or the altcoins. When the index reads closer to 100, we’re in full altcoin season territory. Conversely, lower numbers indicate Bitcoin dominance. The recent jump to 28 suggests we might be seeing early signs of altcoin momentum building. Why Does This 2-Point Increase Matter? While 28 might seem modest, this 2-point gain represents meaningful movement in crypto markets. The Altcoin Season Index movement tells us that more altcoins are starting to outperform Bitcoin. This gradual shift often precedes more significant market changes that can impact your portfolio. Consider these key aspects of the current Altcoin Season Index reading: Threshold indicator: We need 75% of top coins beating Bitcoin to declare true altcoin season Early warning system: Small increases often signal changing investor sentiment Portfolio guidance: Helps determine whether to focus on Bitcoin or diversify into altcoins Market timing: Provides clues about when to adjust your investment strategy How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index? Smart investors don’t just watch the Altcoin Season Index—they use it. This tool becomes particularly valuable when you understand its practical applications. The current reading of 28 suggests we’re in a transitional phase where careful observation pays dividends. When the Altcoin Season Index trends upward, it often indicates growing confidence in alternative cryptocurrencies. However, remember that we’re still far from the 75% threshold that defines a true altcoin season. This means you have time to research potential opportunities before any major market moves. What’s Next for the Altcoin Season? The journey from 28 to potential altcoin season territory requires sustained momentum. Historical patterns show that once the Altcoin Season Index begins climbing, it can accelerate quickly. However, market conditions can change rapidly, so continuous monitoring remains essential. Keep these factors in mind as you watch the Altcoin Season Index evolve: Market cycles: Crypto markets move in predictable patterns Bitcoin influence: Bitcoin performance still drives overall market sentiment External factors: Regulatory news and global economics impact all cryptocurrencies Technical analysis: Combine the index with other indicators for best results Final Thoughts on the Rising Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index movement to 28 represents more than just numbers—it reflects shifting market dynamics that could shape your investment decisions. While we’re not in full altcoin season yet, the upward trend warrants attention and preparation. The most successful crypto investors use tools like the Altcoin Season Index to stay ahead of market curves and make informed decisions. Remember that cryptocurrency investing carries risks, and no single indicator guarantees success. However, understanding tools like the Altcoin Season Index helps you navigate these volatile markets with greater confidence and strategic insight. Frequently Asked Questions What is considered a true altcoin season? A true altcoin season occurs when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index would need to reach much higher levels than the current 28 reading. How often does CoinMarketCap update the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap updates the index regularly, typically showing daily changes. The recent 2-point increase happened within a 24-hour period, showing how quickly market conditions can shift. Should I invest in altcoins when the index rises? While a rising Altcoin Season Index suggests growing altcoin strength, it shouldn’t be your only investment criterion. Always conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for predicting market moves? The index provides valuable insights but works best when combined with other analysis tools. It indicates current market conditions rather than predicting future performance with certainty. What’s the difference between the current reading and previous altcoin seasons? During strong altcoin seasons, the index typically reads above 75. The current 28 reading suggests we’re in early stages rather than full altcoin season conditions. Can the Altcoin Season Index decrease after rising? Yes, the index can fluctuate based on market performance. Cryptocurrency markets are volatile, and the Altcoin Season Index reflects these changing conditions regularly. Found this analysis helpful?

The number of Solana daily active addresses has dropped to a concerning 12-month low, signaling a significant shift in user engagement. According to data from The Block, the seven-day moving average for this key indicator fell sharply from around 9 million at the beginning of the year to just 3.3 million. This decline highlights potential challenges for the blockchain’s ecosystem and could impact investor confidence. Why Are Solana Daily Active Addresses Decreasing? The gradual drop in Solana daily active addresses stems largely from the cooling memecoin trend that captivated users earlier this year. Memecoins drove massive transaction volumes and user interactions, but as interest wanes, network activity naturally slows. Therefore, understanding this trend helps investors gauge the health of the Solana network and make informed decisions. What Does This Mean for Solana’s Future? Lower Solana daily active addresses may raise questions about the network’s utility beyond speculative trading. However, it’s crucial to note that blockchain ecosystems often experience cycles. Key factors to consider include: Reduced speculative activity as memecoin mania fades Potential for renewed growth with upcoming projects Long-term adoption metrics beyond short-term spikes Moreover, this dip could present buying opportunities for believers in Solana’s technology. How Can Investors Respond to This Trend? Monitoring Solana daily active addresses provides valuable insights into network health. Investors should track this metric alongside other indicators like transaction volume and developer activity. By doing so, they can identify potential entry points or diversification strategies. Remember, market cycles are normal, and patience often rewards those who focus on fundamentals. Conclusion: Navigating the Dip in Solana Daily Active Addresses In summary, the decline in Solana daily active addresses to a 12-month low reflects broader market trends rather than inherent flaws in the blockchain. While it may cause short-term concern, it also underscores the importance of looking beyond surface metrics. Stay informed, analyze the data, and consider the long-term vision for Solana’s ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What are Solana daily active addresses? Solana daily active addresses refer to the number of unique addresses interacting with the Solana network each day, indicating user engagement. Why did Solana daily active addresses drop? The drop is primarily due to decreased interest in memecoins, which previously drove high transaction volumes on the network. Is this decline permanent? Not necessarily; network activity often fluctuates with market trends and new project launches, so it could rebound. How does this affect SOL’s price? Lower activity might pressure SOL’s price short-term, but long-term value depends on adoption and technological advancements. Should I be worried as a Solana investor? Monitor broader ecosystem developments rather than reacting to one metric; diversification and research are key. Where can I track Solana daily active addresses? Websites like The Block and blockchain explorers provide real-time data on network metrics. Found this analysis helpful?

The plan centers on the joint venture the two formed one year ago, called RV Tech, which brings together engineers and software teams from both sides. The project has moved far enough that the companies are now speaking openly about offering the electrical and software system to outside manufacturers instead of limiting it to their own models. At a briefing held Wednesday in Palo Alto, Rivian’s software chief and RV Tech co-chair Wassym Bensaid told reporters the work they are doing solves challenges common across the auto industry. Wassym said, “We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry. That could become an opportunity.” He noted that the platform is built to scale across different body types and sizes in Western markets. The team is building something they expect to run multiple kinds of vehicles and to reach buyers in several regions. RV Tech prepares system tests and outlines licensing plans Wassym explained that licensing the system is financially different from building and selling cars. He said the earnings that could come from licensing are “a very different ballgame” and come with “a very different margin profile from a business standpoint than making cars.” RV Tech plans to begin testing its platform in winter conditions during the first quarter of 2026. That phase will involve models from Audi, Volkswagen, and Scout, giving the joint venture real‑world data on how the system performs in harsh climates. Volkswagen has opened its technology to others before. Past deals saw Ford and Mahindra & Mahindra use the company’s first‑generation EV platform for their own electric models. But the new collaboration comes at a time when the German automaker is dealing with tariffs in the United States, weaker sales in China, and slowing momentum in Europe. As part of efforts to cut costs and rebuild demand, Oliver Blume, the company’s chief executive, approved as much as $5.8 billion to support the partnership with Rivian. For Rivian, which has been losing money, the investment provides funding at a time when many manufacturers are rethinking their EV strategies. The joint venture is using Rivian’s centralized electronics layout. The structure uses fewer computing units, which helps Volkswagen lower development costs. The project is not limited to electric models. RV Tech co-chair Carsten Helbing said the underlying structure can support combustion engine vehicles as well. That gives the companies more potential buyers if they choose to license the system widely. First models using the new platform line up for release The first vehicle to use the platform will be Rivian’s R2 sport utility vehicle, which is expected early next year. Volkswagen will follow with its compact EV called ID. EVERY1, targeting a price of about €20,000 or roughly $23,000, with release planned in 2027. After that, larger and more rugged vehicles from the Scout brand will enter production using the same system. Volkswagen is also working with Xpeng for the Chinese market, where that partnership focuses on a separate platform for buyers in that region. The push for outside help follows earlier problems the German automaker faced in trying to build software internally. Volkswagen’s own systems delayed the launch of ID models and caused issues that harmed sales once the cars reached the market. Updates over the past year improved software performance, which helped raise EV sales figures in Europe. Oliver wants to succeed where his predecessor Herbert Diess struggled. Herbert became the leader of the Volkswagen brand shortly before the diesel emissions scandal. At that time he said electric cars would become the company’s “strategic core.” He launched internal software teams and expanded work on autonomous driving. During a 2021 “Power Day” event, Herbert laid out plans for six battery factories across Europe, dozens of new EV models, and a target of selling up to three million electric vehicles by this year. That period briefly turned Volkswagen into Germany’s most valuable company on the stock market.

The license enables the company to comply with local financial regulations — particularly those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. According to a company’s representative speaking with reporters, Bitcoin Depot’s compliance team “established close partnerships on the ground in Hong Kong to fulfill all requirements, including licensing; AML/KYC regulations.” According to Coin ATM Radar, there are 223 Bitcoin ATMs currently operational in Hong Kong. Bitcoin Depot’s arrival means another player is entering a market that has become more sophisticated and crowded. The Hong Kong government is actively establishing a regulatory environment that encourages innovation and protects investors. The city’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) pioneered the licensing of crypto exchanges, and banks were advised to open accounts for licensed digital asset businesses — in contrast to mainland China, where trading in cryptocurrencies is broadly outlawed. In the United States, there were almost 11,000 complaints about crypto kiosks in 2024, which resulted in $246 million of claimed losses, according to the F.B.I. Several other cities around the country have already limited or banned the machines outright. Australia, which now has more than 2,000 of the machines, up from just 21 last year, is among those where lawmakers are considering further clamping down on them. In November, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke stated that the government is seeking to increase visibility over cryptocurrency transactions and assist regulators, such as AUSTRAC, in closing ATMs if required. Bitcoin Depot, with over 7,000 Bitcoin ATMs in 47 U.S. states, has stated that compliance with regulations remains a key part of its business strategy. On Wednesday, Bitcoin Depot announced that its expansion into Hong Kong is part of a strategy to target markets with high demand for quick and easy cash-to-crypto conversion. The company said it aims to become one of the top five Bitcoin ATM operators in the city. Hong Kong becomes launchpad for crypto expansion Analysts say the manoeuvre has potentially significant implications, opening the door to broader expansion in the region if it is successful. Hong Kong’s “clear regulatory regime and robust fintech environment” make it a perfect launchpad for Western crypto infrastructure firms, said Ray Ng, a fintech analyst in Singapore. Bitcoin Depot’s timing, however, matches a surge of institutional investor interest in Hong Kong’s digital asset landscape. The timing of Bitcoin Depot’s growth appears strategic. With Bitcoin prices having only recently stabilized following a prolonged bear market, institutional adoption has been on the rise. With global crypto trading volumes on the rise again, Bitcoin Depot’s Cash-to-Crypto machines may provide an entry point for individuals who want to interact with exchanges physically, particularly in areas where staking trust in digital exchanges remains a challenge.

The probe, which stems from complaints by European news publishers, alleges that Google unfairly demotes outlets that include “third-party” promotional content, such as sponsored articles or paid editorial pieces, something publishers argue is essential to their revenue models. The EU brings charges Critics, including news industry groups, claim this Google practice gives an advantage to publishers without such content and stifles competition in the digital advertising space. The EU’s probe alleges that the American tech giant is violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA) legislation, which was implemented to prevent large “digital gatekeepers” from unfairly disadvantaging other businesses operating on their platforms. If found that it violated the DMA, Google could face fines of up to 10% of its global turnover —potentially billions of euros—along with orders to change its algorithms or business practices. The company appears to be attracting charges by the day. It is already under multiple DMA investigations in the EU, including probes into whether its search engine favors its own services over competitors and whether it obstructs developers from directing consumers to offers outside its app store. This new investigation comes just two months after the European Commission fined Google €2.95 billion for its search advertising practices, a penalty that pushed U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten additional tariffs against Europe. The company has previously defended its ranking systems as neutral and based on user relevance. Meanwhile, the news has created a buzz among some who have welcomed the move as a step toward leveling the playing field against Big Tech dominance. Google fights allegations of using Gemini AI to spy on users Google has to fight off the antitrust allegations just as it was accused in a lawsui t of using its Gemini AI assistant to unlawfully spy on the private communications of users of Gmail’s instant messaging and videoconference programs. In the past, users of Gmail, Chat and Meet had the option to turn on Google’s artificial intelligence program. However, in October, the Alphabet Inc. unit “secretly” turned on Gemini for all those applications, which meant it could harvest private data “without the users’ knowledge or consent,” according to the complaint filed late Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California. It is not that the company prevents users from turning off Gemini, but they need to look into Google’s privacy settings to find the deactivation key for the AI tool, according to the proposed class-action suit. If they don’t do that, Google uses Gemini to “access and exploit the entire recorded history of its users’ private communications, including literally every email and attachment sent and received in their Gmail accounts,” the complaint claims. The suit has alleged that Google is violating the California Invasion of Privacy Act, a 1967 law put in place to prohibit surreptitious wiretapping and recording of confidential communications without the consent of all parties involved.

This marks Canary’s first foray into launching a fund to track the price of a memecoin. The investment firm formally submitted S1 registration with the US SEC on Wednesday, seeking approval for the ETF. NEW: @CanaryFunds files for a MOG ETF. pic.twitter.com/IUBkL4mF3E — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 12, 2025 The filing described MOG as a “memecoin,” adding that the ETF may hold up to 5% of its holdings in Ether for transaction costs, since MOG is dependent on the Ethereum network. As the U.S. government shutdown seems to be ending , the SEC is expected to re-engage on digital asset ETFs. Particularly, a handful of XRP-linked ETFs are set to hit the trading floor , said ETF expert Nate Geraci. In September, the regulator cleared the clouds to dozens of new spot ETFs tied to cryptos, including Solana and Dogecoin. Canary has filed for several different types of crypto ETFs, including two that launched last month, tracking Litecoin and HBAR . The company is set to list another ETF tracking the price of XRP this week. A Memecoin Fueled by Social Media Buzz: Community Reacts Canary Capital’s new MOG ETF, coming at the brink of the SEC opening the door for crypto ETFs, has attracted widespread community attention on the memecoin. Launching an ETF for a coin powered by community vibes—not real utility— underscores how memecoins are inching closer to the world of regulated finance. One crypto investor wrote on X that not even Pepe has an ETF. “MOG is at a position close to 200 of the crypto market cap. I don’t think people understand.” It is noteworthy that MOG Coin isn’t listed on Binance yet, but is listed on the spot market on Coinbase. The Canary MOG ETF filing also mentions that the memecoin is “driven primarily by online popularity, cultural relevance and social sentiment, rather than by underlying technological utility.” ETF Filing Catalyst MOG Coin to Spike 8.44% The 339 th -ranked crypto with a market capitalization of approximately $170 million, saw an 8.44% surge in price over the last 24 hours.

For the experiment to be carried out successfully, sources close to the matter said that the proof-of-concept will be conducted in collaboration with Worldpay, Mastercard, Fireblocks, and Avalanche. Most importantly, this initiative will use the Avalanche blockchain to explore how to automate refunds via smart contracts and make settlements using stablecoins. While the process is ongoing, customer details or real money will not be required because the intended purpose of this PoC is to check whether the technology adopted functions properly and can be used effectively, according to the press release. Meanwhile, South Korea recently announced that it is close to finalizing its long-awaited stablecoin legislation , as the central bank and financial regulator jostle over who should regulate digital tokens pegged to the won. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) plans to submit a government-sponsored bill by the end of 2025. It will join five other competing stablecoin bills under review in the National Assembly, which individual lawmakers have submitted. NH NongHyup aims to lead in the digital transformation of Korea’s tourism economy In a statement, Choi Woon-jae, the executive vice president of NH NongHyup Bank, stated that the refund model based on stablecoins demonstrates how blockchain technology can actually enhance national competitiveness and boost customer experience. Therefore, with this ability in mind, Choi outlined their goal: to secure the top ranking in the digital transformation of Korea’s tourism economy by implementing strategies like enhancing cross-border payment and settlement efficiency. The PoC , on the other hand, focuses on attracting the booming tourist volume visiting South Korea by streamlining the VAT refund process. Sources pointed out that this process is essential as it enables foreign tourists to reclaim the VAT , usually 10%, they paid on eligible items when they decide to take them out of the country. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that in 2024, South Korea welcomed approximately 16.37 million tourists into the country. This figure represented a significant increase of about 48.4% compared to the previous year. Concerning NH NongHyup’s intention to modernize the traditional paper-based tax refund system, the bank stated that this initiative will be delivered in two main ways. To begin with, the PoC will thoroughly investigate a digital system based on blockchain technology that automates the tracking of refund data. This method will make it easier and more efficient for both businesses and tourists. For the Second method, NongHyup highlighted that the process will include a test on a method using stablecoins to allow users to effectively exchange currency and make their payments. Being a key player in the financial sector, with a broadened customer base and significant assets, NH NongHyup made public its intentions to improve its refund services and stablecoin payment while strictly adhering to new regulatory guidelines from financial authorities. South Korea’s financial regulators focus on the development of new laws for won-pegged stablecoins Sources knowledgeable about NH NongHyup’s proof-of-concept mentioned that South Korea is developing regulations to promote a stablecoin market linked to the Korean won. The move is intended to increase its control over money matters, especially in the face of strong competition from US dollar stablecoins. While financial regulators and local lawmakers cooperate toward these regulations being put in place for the won-pegged stablecoins, major banks and institutions are also preparing to launch their own stablecoin projects by cooperating with others and obtaining ticker symbols. However, individuals who received this plan had mixed reactions. The Bank of Korea argued that it is wise for banks to be granted the opportunity to issue stablecoins, while private companies stated that non-bank organizations should be given the chance to establish stablecoins to achieve healthy competition and promote innovation in the market.

Though the company grew revenue year over year, account growth seems slow for a company priced at 5x forward sales. With Fold's basic mNAV already falling under 1.0, there is a growing incentive for the company to sell BTC to raise needed capital. Despite the issues, FLD remains on my watch list as a rare US company pursuing a legitimate Bitcoin-based business model. When I last wrote about Fold Holdings ( FLD ) for Seeking Alpha, I initiated stock coverage with a 'hold' and cited a lack of interest in the rewards business as my primary reason for not buying FLD stock. Furthermore, I went into detail about the company's purported Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings and found the company's major BTC acquisition to be more 'PR' than substance given that Fold's convert holders were actually in control of a large amount of the BTC that Fold claimed to own. In the time since that article, shares of FLD have fallen by over 50% in a little under 8 months. Given the massive drawdown and the recently reported Q3 earnings, it's time for an updated look at Fold's Bitcoin-based business. Q3-25 Earnings For the quarter ended September 2025, Fold Holdings reported $7.4 million in top-line revenue. While this was down sequentially from $8.2 million in Q2, in Q3 revenue did grow by over 41% year-over-year. Financials Q3-24 Q2-25 Q3-25 YoY QoQ Revenue Net $5.2m $8.2m $7.4m 41.2% -9.5% Total operating expenses $9.4m $14.5m $13.3m 41.7% -8.0% Operating loss -$4.2m -$6.3m -$5.9m 42.5% -6.1% Source: Fold Holdings, 10-Qs Despite a 9.5% sequential decline in top-line revenue, the company was able to reduce expenses by 8% from Q2. This helped Fold reduce its operating loss from $6.3 million in Q2 to $5.9 million last quarter. Still, the company's Q3 loss widened year-over-year. Digging into the specific expense items, compensation and benefits jumps off the page with a 408% year-over-year increase from $734k in Q3-24 to over $3.7 million in Q3-25. I find this level of compensation to be rather large given the company's $7.4 million in revenue during the quarter. Shifting to some of the company's key user metrics, there are both good and bad signs, in my estimation: Quarter Total Accts Verified Accts % Verified QoQ Accts QoQ Verified Q3-24 580 68 11.72% Q4-24 591 71 12.01% 1.90% 4.41% Q1-25 609 76 12.48% 3.05% 7.04% Q2-25 619 80 12.92% 1.64% 5.26% Q3-25 625 82 13.12% 0.97% 2.50% Source: Fold Holdings, Analyst's calculations, accts in 000s First the good; Fold appears to be doing a good job converting some of its non-verified accounts to verified following KYC completion. Last year, 11.7% of Fold's accounts were verified. As of the end of September, over 13% of the company's customers have gone through KYC. This should allow the company to better monetize its customer base. That said, sequential growth of total accounts slowed to just 1% in the quarter. For a growth-stage company, this seems a bit underwhelming to me. Through the first three quarters this year, Fold is burning about $7.3 million per quarter on average. I view this as problematic given the company's liquidity position. Balance Sheet, mNAV, and Valuation On paper, Fold's liquidity position is actually pretty good. While the company only has $6.7 million in cash and equivalents, Fold's Bitcoin stash was worth $170.4 million at the end of the quarter. With total liabilities of just $96.3 million, FLD shareholders have $94.7 million in stockholder equity: Balance Sheet Q3-25 Cash/equivalents $6,663,463 Digital Assets (Treasury) $170,392,495 Total Assets $190,966,112 Total Liabilities $96,276,871 Stockholder's Equity $94,689,241 Source: Fold Holdings, 10-Q Given the 48 million shares outstanding at the end of September, Fold's book value per share comes in at a little under $2 per share at the end of Q3. Of course, this valuation is largely dependent on the company's Bitcoin holdings rather than cash or other tangible assets. Thus, even though the company is working toward a Bitcoin-based business that should be less sensitive to the day to day moves of the token price, the market value of Fold's BTC holdings has the most significance to the share price today. In the company's investor deck , it noted 48.3 million shares outstanding and 1,526 BTC as of November 7th. At intraday market prices on November 12th, FLD shares are trading at a basic mNAV discount of 4%: Units Unit Price Total Value Bitcoin Held 1,526 BTC $101,500 $154,889,000 Shares Outstanding 48,307,642 $3.08 $148,787,537 Basic mNAV 0.96 Source: Fold Holdings, market data from November 12th at 1p eastern Fold is certainly no stranger to shares trading at a discount to basic mNAV as it has happened three different times this year already. But a sustained move lower for FLD shares relative to the performance of BTC would open up the company to what I believe would be a significant capital allocation pickle. As recently as September, FLD shares traded at a basic mNAV rate closer to 0.8. The problem is since Fold is still a cash-burning company, the longer FLD shares trade at a basic mNAV discount, the more difficult it is to argue Fold should be selling shares to fund operations rather than selling BTC at the market rate since it is an unproductive, liquid asset that could be utilized to grow the business. And keep in mind, 800 of Fold's BTC is restricted from usage because it is pledged as convertible note collateral. The fully diluted shares outstanding number is slightly above 73 million shares. When we look at the book value of FLD shares on a fully diluted, real-time BTC value adjustment, the equity is worth about $1.08 per share. Risks In my opinion, FLD shares could conceivably go much lower than current levels even though they're already trading at a basic mNAV discount. The question is whether or not the company will sell BTC to raise funding with its share price trading below basic mNAV. Fold does not believe that it will need to sell Bitcoin to fund operations over the next 12 months, though it does acknowledge in the 10-Q that it may have to: Our Investment Treasury is considered a long-term investment and we do not believe we will need to sell or engage in other transactions with respect to any of our Investment Treasury within the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements, although we may from time to time sell or engage in other transactions with respect to our Investment Treasury as part of treasury management operations. This is, of course, purely speculation on my part; but I believe Fold's price will continue lower from here. I think the 'DAT' hype in the market is largely over. And even though it probably isn't proper to look at FLD solely through the DAT lens alone, the company still loses money, trades almost 5x forward sales, and operates a business that seemingly could be easily replicated by major Fintech competitors. Closing Summary Having said all this, as one of the few companies in the US equity markets that appears to be attempting something resembling a Bitcoin-based business, my view is that Fold remains a solid watchlist candidate. I certainly didn't like FLD at $7 per share; I don't know that I like it all that much at $3 per share either. Closer to book value, I'm much more inclined to take a shot on Fold. For me, the problem is evident: the company loses a lot of money each quarter relative to the revenue that it generates, and user growth seems far from robust. Given Fold's quarterly burn rate, the company likely has to raise capital next quarter just to keep going. Given the mNAV discount, the market seems to be telling the company to sell Bitcoin to raise capital.

It focused on payment flow between government accounts and on how settlements are recorded. Transaction monitoring, privacy safeguards, and operational controls were part of the checks. Based on reports , authorities also monitored speed, finality, and system stability. No retail wallets or merchants were involved in this stage. The pilot was described as one step in a staged plan that will expand if the tests meet the central bank’s benchmarks. What Comes Next For The Digital Dirham According to public statements and media coverage, the Central Bank has indicated a phased approach toward broader use, with some earlier timelines pointing to a possible wider launch in Q4 2025. If the authorities move forward, future phases could involve private banks, merchant acceptance, and consumer wallets. But regulators will need to resolve questions about privacy, cybersecurity, and how a CBDC will sit alongside existing bank deposits. Decisions on these issues are likely to shape how quickly the program moves beyond government transfers.

Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst The move marks Uniswap’s biggest reform since its 2020 token launch, designed to transform UNI from a passive governance token into a deflationary, yield-generating asset. Under the proposal, 0.3% of all trading volume will now be split between liquidity providers (0.25%) and a UNI buyback pool (0.05%), creating continuous demand for the token. With over $1 trillion in annualized trading volume, analysts project roughly $38 million in monthly buybacks, about $450 million annually. Whales Accumulate as Uniswap (UNI) Skyrockets 63% The market reaction was explosive. Uniswap (UNI) surged by over 63% in one week, peaking at $10 before stabilizing around $8.57. On-chain data from Santiment shows rising whale accumulation and a steady increase in UNI held outside of exchanges, indicating long-term investor confidence. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes reportedly purchased $244,000 worth of UNI, joining institutional buyers positioning for a supply shock. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju predicted that if protocol fees remain active, annual burns could exceed $500 million, drastically tightening supply. “Even with unlocks, a UNI supply shock seems inevitable,” Ju noted. The rally also extended to other DeFi assets, such as AAVE, Synthetix, and Compound, as traders speculated that Uniswap’s model could set a new standard for protocol-owned liquidity and value distribution.

Source: UNIUSD on Tradingview UNIfication Ushers in the Next Era of DeFi Governance Beyond tokenomics, UNIfication unites Uniswap Labs, the Foundation, and the Unichain L2 network under one ecosystem. The proposal eliminates interface fees, introduces fee discount auctions to enhance LP returns, and compensates governance delegates, turning Uniswap’s decision-making into a professionalized, revenue-sharing system. Adams emphasized that the initiative represents more than a technical upgrade, it’s a cultural shift. “Uniswap can be the primary place tokens are traded globally,” he said. “This proposal ends a restrictive chapter and begins the decade of Uniswap.” Related Reading: Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee With UNI up more than 66% this week and investors anticipating formal governance approval, the DeFi giant appears poised to reclaim its dominance as crypto’s flagship decentralized exchange.

That’s exactly what happened in the recent Balancer hack recovery, where white hat hackers miraculously returned over $20 million to the DeFi community. This stunning development reveals the power of ethical hacking in the cryptocurrency space. What Really Happened in the Balancer Hack? Haseeb Qureshi, a managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, recently dropped a bombshell revelation on social media platform X. He announced that white hat ethical hackers successfully recovered more than $20 million from the devastating Balancer hack . Surprisingly, this remarkable recovery story hasn’t received the widespread attention it deserves. The original Balancer hack caused massive losses exceeding $100 million, making it one of DeFi’s most significant security breaches. However, the white hat intervention dramatically reduced the final damage. These ethical hackers essentially became the unsung heroes of the cryptocurrency world. Why Don’t More People Know About This Recovery? Qureshi specifically noted that this recovery fact remains largely unknown to the general public. This information gap highlights several important aspects of cryptocurrency security: White hat operations often work discreetly Major exchanges and platforms coordinate behind the scenes Quick action prevents further fund movement The community benefits from silent protection The quiet nature of these recoveries actually serves a purpose. Security experts prefer working without attracting unnecessary attention that could alert malicious actors. How Do White Hat Hackers Make a Difference? White hat hackers represent the guardians of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They use their technical skills for good, constantly working to protect user funds and maintain system integrity. In the case of the Balancer hack , their intervention demonstrated several key benefits: Immediate damage control – Preventing further losses Fund recovery – Returning stolen assets to rightful owners Security improvements – Identifying vulnerabilities for future protection Community trust – Reinforcing DeFi’s resilience These ethical professionals often coordinate with projects like Balancer to strengthen security measures after incidents occur. What Does This Mean for Future DeFi Security? The successful recovery from the Balancer hack sets an important precedent for decentralized finance. It proves that even major breaches can have positive outcomes when the right people get involved. This incident provides valuable lessons for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Moreover, it demonstrates that the DeFi community possesses self-correcting mechanisms. When white hats step in, they not only recover funds but also help build stronger systems for everyone. The Balancer hack recovery serves as a powerful reminder that good often triumphs in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions What is a white hat hacker? White hat hackers are ethical security experts who use their skills to protect systems and recover stolen funds rather than cause harm. How much was originally stolen in the Balancer hack? The initial Balancer hack resulted in losses exceeding $100 million before the white hat recovery intervention. Why wasn’t this recovery widely publicized? Security operations often remain discreet to prevent alerting malicious actors and to maintain operational effectiveness. Can all stolen cryptocurrency be recovered? Not always, but white hat hackers can often recover significant amounts if they act quickly and have the right technical capabilities. What happens to recovered funds? Recovered funds are typically returned to the affected protocol or users through coordinated processes with the project team. How can I protect my DeFi investments? Use reputable platforms, enable all available security features, and stay informed about potential vulnerabilities in the protocols you use. This incredible story of recovery deserves to be shared!

BITO's 62% distribution rate does not equate to an actual yield but represents a gains crystallization tool. BITO is most attractive post a downturn, helping investors crystalize gains and mitigate psychological challenges of market timing. Despite a $2.6B AUM and 0.95% expense ratio, BITO is best used to harvest gains in up markets, not as downside protection. Thesis The advent of covered call and single-name ETFs has seen an explosion in investors interested in yield products. However, the reality is not as simple as looking at the current distribution for an ETF. With bitcoin stuck in a $100,000 - $120,000 range since May 2025, many investors are actively considering the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) due to its high distribution rate of 62%. In today's article we are going to revisit BITO, a fund we first covered last year, and articulate why this ETF will not compensate an investor for the drawdowns that occur during a crypto winter. In our original article on the name, we highlighted the fund's structure and outlined why, at the time, BITO was the only alternative for investors looking to use options. Fund structure - using futures The ETF uses futures to gain exposure to bitcoin: Holdings (Fund Website) Unlike names that own spot bitcoin via crypto wallets, BITO contains futures. This structure eliminates any risks associated with crypto wallets, hacking, and counterparty risk. Performance - not the only game in town Firstly, let us look at how the ETF has done in the past year versus a cohort of peers: Data by YCharts In the past year we have seen the origination of a number of funds that employ options to extract dividends from the bitcoin asset class. Among those names we can find the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF ( BCCC ), the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ), and the Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF ( BAGY ). The entire cohort has very similar total returns, with the only outlier being BCCC, which has outperformed as of late. The correlation is very high among the entire population here. Secondly, let us compare BITO with an outright bitcoin position: Data by YCharts We are using here the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the largest exchange-traded fund for outright bitcoin exposure. We can see the correlation is very tight, but as expected, IBIT outperforms (or, better said, BITO lags). As we detailed in our prior article, BITO will always lag an outright bitcoin exposure due to its construction using futures and the dividend extraction feature. Kindly note we are using a total return graph here in order to account for distributions. A high distribution does not equate to an actual yield If we go back in time, we will realize that the concept of yield used to equate the distribution, and originated with traditional fixed-income ETF. A traditional fixed income ETF for high yield, for example, would simply pass on to investors the cash flows realized in its holdings. The yield for the ETF would therefore equate the distribution for the name. Everything changed when options started being used, because options can expire worthless or they can get triggered; thus, the ultimate payout fluctuates. Moreover, implied volatility is a large input in options pricing; thus, as volatility moves around, premiums move, thus the distributions change. As per the Seeking Alpha landing page, BITO currently has a 62% distribution rate. Does that equate to an actual yield? No. As one can see from the above graphs, the fund only produced a 10.8% total return in the past year, meaning that its price moved lower, compensated by a high distribution. When thinking about BITO, please ignore the distribution completely. It does not mean much. BITO will ultimately follow bitcoin prices on a total return basis. What the fund does do, however, is constantly harvest gains. In an up-market, this comes in very handy, as we shall see shortly. Let us paint that picture visually for you - from January 2025 to April 2025, bitcoin was down roughly -20%: Data by YCharts In the above graph, the blue line is bitcoin outright. Please note BITO had virtually the same downside on a total return basis (the orange line), although the fund was paying a very high distribution. BITO is not designed to outperform spot bitcoin during a downturn; it simply extracts dividends from the product. During the next downturn, one will get the exact same type of graph. Do not bank on the current 62% distribution to bail you out because it is not real. Kindly note how the ETF's price is down -29% this year, although the total return is positive. The fund has an ever-decreasing price that is compensated by the high distribution. When would BITO be attractive, then? We have now established that in a downturn, BITO's dividend will not save an investor from losses. Then when is BITO attractive? Well, it depends on the investor, but for us, BITO is a good tool to use when the underlying risk factor (i.e., bitcoin) is trying to find a bottom. We are not good at market timing, and sometimes we see investors cut risk only to miss out on significant gains. Via its structure that constantly harvests gains, BITO mitigates those psychological aspects. Let us look at an example: Data by YCharts After the massive 2022 downturn in crypto, let us say an investor would have been interested in going long on Bitcoin. If said investor would have used BITO as an instrument, we can see the payout profile in the graph above. After one and a half years, the investor would have fully amortized the cost basis - in the above graph, the orange line is the total return, while the teal line is the price return. The price return in June 2024 is 'only' 150%, while the total return is close to 300%. The same investor still holding BITO would be up +54% since 2023 on a price basis, but from a net total return, they would have had a 4x return. This simply means they should not really care what happens next because the BITO structure forced them to crystallize gains already via the dividend. A theoretical investor in bitcoin outright (via a crypto wallet) can see a complete wipeout of said gains if, theoretically, bitcoin moves to $20,000 tomorrow. Not the BITO investor: $100 invested in January 2023 would now be worth $154 in the brokerage account, while $356 would sit as realized dividends in cash (410% total return minus the 54% price gain). BITO is a great tool to crystallize gains in an up market, tool that takes away many of the psychological negative aspects that come with trading for retail investors. Conclusion BITO is an ETF that is long on bitcoin futures. The fund is one of the largest bitcoin ETFs in the market, with a $2.6 billion AUM and a 0.95% expense ratio. Despite its stated 62% distribution rate, the name has the exact same downside as outright bitcoin in a downturn. Investors should not confuse distribution rates with yields and understand that the next crypto winter will see BITO have the exact same downside profile as outright bitcoin. BITO is a great tool to use after a downturn when an investor is unsure about market timing for a bottom. Via its distributions, the fund 'amortizes' an investment fairly quickly by constantly crystalizing gains, thus removing the psychological pressures around exiting a bitcoin long.",BCCC|YBTC|BAGY|IBIT|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-13 02:14:00

As of today, the global crypto market cap is about $3.6 trillion, with Bitcoin dominance near 58% and BTC trading above $106,000 while ETH hovers around the mid-$3,500s. The majors are acting like macro assets, but volatility keeps rotating into altcoins as traders chase narrative, liquidity and early entries. That’s where this trio comes in. Apeing ($APEING) is building a degen-forward brand with a structured whitelist and audit-first plan. XRP ($XRP) is in the headlines for a $4 billion Wall Street acquisition spree and a fresh $500 million raise at a $40B valuation, pushing deeper into brokerage, treasury and institutional rails. And Hedera ($HBAR) just landed inside Google Cloud’s BigQuery public datasets, sparking a double-digit price jump and bullish chart talk. For readers tracking new crypto coins and big-cap catalysts side by side, this combo hits every part of the risk spectrum. Apeing ($APEING): Degen Branding, Grown-Up Structure Apeing opens with the tagline: “We’re Degens, We’re Not Thinking, We’re APEING.” But the actual site is far more organized than the meme would suggest. The project describes Apeing as a meme coin brand created by a team of true degens focused on culture, energy and community, with a clear promise to “focus on audit first, then… open the door” to the broader ecosystem Well, Apeing is blunt. The project describes $APEING as a utility and entertainment token, not a security or guaranteed investment, and repeatedly warns that crypto assets are high-risk and users can lose everything they put in. For anyone scanning new crypto coins , that mix of meme energy and sober disclaimers is exactly what seasoned degens now look for. Why Does the Apeing Whitelist Matter for New Crypto Coins? Whitelist subscribers are the first to get email updates when Apeing moves from “getting ready” into live action. Instead of learning about $APEING from a green candle on Twitter, they get details from the source. In many structured launches, the 1st stage typically has limited token allocation, so those who enter early and size responsibly have a better shot at decent entries than late buyers chasing hype. That doesn’t magically make $APEING the next moonshot, but it does stack the odds slightly more in favor of people who were prepared. Apeing publishes an official smart contract address on the site but clearly warns users not to send any funds to that address, stressing that transactions there cannot be reversed. Combined with “official channels only” messaging, that’s a strong hint: check, double-check, and treat random DMs as instant red flags whenever you interact with new crypto coins. Time to think, even if you’re a degen, because the whitelist is email-based and tied to audited milestones, readers have breathing room to research the project instead of apeing into the first contract link they see. How Does Someone Actually Join the Apeing Whitelist? If you want to position for $APEING among new crypto coins, the process is straightforward: Simply visit the website and follow the company’s official Telegram and X accounts. Near the top of the homepage, there’s a Join Whitelist box with an email field and a Submit button. No wallet connect or “send funds first” gimmicks at this stage. Next, submit your email (and nothing else). When someone enters their email and hits Submit, they’re opting in to receive presale/launch updates and instructions from Apeing . The fine print says they can unsubscribe at any time. Used correctly, Apeing’s whitelist becomes a tool: a way to be early, keep risk controlled, and have a front-row seat instead of refreshing charts from the cheap seats. XRP: $4B Wall Street Shopping Spree XRP is not a “new” project, but its 2025 activity reads like a hyper-aggressive scale-up story, which is exactly why it sits beside newer names in many new crypto coins watchlists. According to multiple recent reports, XRP has spent around $4 billion on acquisitions in 2025 alone, snapping up prime broker Hidden Road for about $1.25 billion, treasury platform GTreasury for roughly $1 billion, and custody firm Palisade, among others. The goal is simple: compete directly with Wall Street heavyweights in areas like brokerage, treasury management and institutional crypto infrastructure, rather than staying in the niche of cross-border payments. Reports also note that XRP now holds more than 75 licenses worldwide, and has high-profile partnerships, for example, BNY Mellon safeguarding reserves for XRP’s RLUSD stablecoin and other institutional products. On top of that, the company just closed a $500 million round at a $40 billion valuation, led by major funds like Citadel and Fortress. On the token side, $XRP currently trades around $2.48, with more than 60 billion tokens in circulation, putting its market cap well into the tens of billions. While recent price action has been choppy after a large run-up, XRP holders are still significantly up year-on-year, and speculation continues around spot XRP ETFs and broader institutional use. For someone scanning new crypto coins, XRP is more like the “benchmark alt”: a reminder of what happens when a token goes from scrappy outsider to $40B infrastructure player, while also showing that big valuations don’t erase volatility. Hedera ($HBAR): Google Cloud BigQuery Boost & Breakout Talk Hedera has been having a moment of its own. A 99Bitcoins deep-dive explains that Hedera (HBAR) has been added to Google Cloud’s BigQuery public datasets, putting its full transaction history alongside chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum inside Google’s flagship data warehouse. BigQuery lets developers and enterprises run SQL-style queries across massive datasets, so this integration makes Hedera’s on-chain data far more accessible to analysts, app builders and Web3 teams already plugged into Google Cloud. The article notes that HBAR jumped over 10% on the news, and technical analysis shows the token consolidating around the $0.19 area after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern, often seen as a bullish reversal setup. Indicators like RSI near 50 and a flattening MACD suggest a “catching its breath” phase, with upside targets near $0.20–$0.22 if support holds, while a drop below $0.18 could trigger a deeper pullback. Even though $HBAR isn’t a brand-new token, this kind of enterprise-grade partnership and chart reset is exactly what keeps it in discussions around new crypto coins to rotate into. It shows how older Layer-1s can generate “new coin energy” when they land real integrations and then back them up with constructive technicals. Conclusion: New Crypto Coins Need Narratives and Filters Taken together, Apeing , XRP and Hedera show three different angles on what readers mean when they talk about new crypto coins. Apeing is the pure degen play: a meme-driven project that still insists on audits first, official channels only and a whitelist-led funnel so early supporters get structured information before anything goes live, especially important when first stages typically have limited token allocation and better entry opportunities for those who were paying attention. XRP sits at the other end: a multi-billion-dollar firm spending $4B on Wall Street-style acquisitions, raising $500M at a $40B valuation and pushing $XRP deeper into the institutional conversation. Hedera lands somewhere in the middle, with Google Cloud BigQuery integration and bullish HBAR price action giving it a fresh narrative burst despite its age.

Legislator Ge Ru-jun’s call for a comprehensive review of confiscated Bitcoin assets highlights the growing importance of digital currencies in government policy. This move could set a precedent for how nations handle seized cryptocurrency assets worldwide. Why Is Taiwan Investigating Seized Bitcoin? Taiwanese legislator Ge Ru-jun has taken a bold stance on the government’s cryptocurrency holdings. He argues that the seized Bitcoin represents substantial potential value that requires careful evaluation. The central question revolves around whether Taiwan should maintain these digital assets as long-term investments or liquidate them for immediate financial gain. Governor Yang Chin-long of Taiwan’s central bank has responded positively to these concerns. He confirmed that a detailed research report will be published by the end of the year. This timeline gives authorities sufficient opportunity to analyze multiple factors affecting their decision. What Makes Seized Bitcoin So Valuable? The investigation focuses on several key aspects of the confiscated cryptocurrency: Market volatility – Bitcoin’s price fluctuations affect asset valuation Storage security – Safeguarding digital assets requires specialized measures Legal considerations – Proper handling of seized property Investment potential – Long-term versus short-term financial strategy This seized Bitcoin represents more than just digital currency—it symbolizes the intersection of traditional finance and emerging technology. The government’s approach could influence how other nations manage similar situations. What Challenges Does Taiwan Face? Managing seized cryptocurrency presents unique obstacles that differ from traditional asset management. The volatile nature of Bitcoin prices requires careful timing for any potential sales. Additionally, secure storage solutions must prevent hacking attempts and ensure asset protection. Legal frameworks surrounding cryptocurrency continue to evolve globally. Taiwan’s decision will need to consider international precedents while establishing its own regulatory standards. The government must balance immediate financial needs against potential future gains from holding the digital assets. What Can We Expect From the Investigation? The year-end report will likely address several critical questions about the seized Bitcoin. Experts anticipate recommendations regarding: Optimal timing for asset liquidation Secure storage protocols Legal compliance requirements Market impact considerations This comprehensive approach ensures that Taiwan makes an informed decision about its seized cryptocurrency holdings. The outcome could serve as a model for other governments facing similar dilemmas. Conclusion: A Landmark Decision for Cryptocurrency Regulation Taiwan’s investigation into seized Bitcoin marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency governance. The government’s careful approach demonstrates recognition of digital assets’ growing significance in global finance. Whatever decision emerges from this process will undoubtedly influence how nations worldwide handle confiscated cryptocurrency. The seized Bitcoin investigation represents more than just asset management—it reflects the evolving relationship between traditional financial systems and digital innovation. Taiwan’s thoughtful methodology sets a valuable precedent for responsible cryptocurrency governance. Frequently Asked Questions Why is Taiwan investigating seized Bitcoin? Taiwan wants to determine the best approach for managing confiscated cryptocurrency assets, deciding whether to hold them as investments or sell them for immediate funds. Who initiated the Bitcoin investigation? Legislator Ge Ru-jun called for the investigation, highlighting the potential value of the seized Bitcoin and the need for proper asset management. When will the investigation results be available? Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-long confirmed a research report will be released by the end of the current year. What happens to seized Bitcoin in other countries? Different nations handle confiscated cryptocurrency differently—some immediately sell at auction, while others hold assets as investments. How does Bitcoin volatility affect the investigation? Price fluctuations significantly impact the decision-making process, as timing sales during market highs can maximize returns. What security measures protect seized Bitcoin? Governments typically use cold storage wallets and multi-signature protocols to secure confiscated digital assets from theft.

STCE exhibits high volatility, with a 64% annualized standard deviation and significant tracking error, making it a high-risk, high-reward play. The ETF is concentrated in fintech, heavily weighted toward Financials and Information Technology, and relies on bullish trends in bitcoin and ether. Technical analysis shows STCE near key Fibonacci support, with the 200-day moving average trending up, suggesting a favorable risk-managed entry point. Cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin and ether, got off to a rough start in 2025. Digital assets cratered leading into and immediately after the so-called “Liberation Day.” But the crypto bulls came back, and for a brief time, the two most valuable non-stablecoin tokens tagged record highs in the second half of the year. Volatility has been high, but swings are incredibly wild in shares of many crypto-linked stocks. Today, I’m digging into the Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF (STCE). With about three years under its belt, price action has not been for the faint of heart. I have a buy rating on it. The valuation is not extreme, while the chart points to the possibility of near-term support. To add to that, year-end has tended to be a very strong stretch in crypto. STCE: Much Higher Volatility Than Even Bitcoin & Ether This Year StockCharts.com According to the issuer , ""STCE is designed to deliver global exposure to companies that may benefit from the development or utilization of cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) and other digital assets, and the business activities connected to blockchain and other distributed ledger technology. Investors in the fund have the potential to benefit from the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies, both as a store of value and medium of exchange, without owning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin directly and other digital assets."" STCE is a small ETF with just $347 million in assets under management as of November 10, 2025. Its annual expense ratio is modest at just 30 basis points, while the trailing 12-month dividend yield is very low at just 0.34%, about one percentage point below that of the S&P 500. Share-price momentum is rated well, but the fund is about 25% off its highs. The portfolio is, of course, highly risky across volatility metrics. Its standard deviation is at nosebleed levels, above 60%. What’s more, annualized volatility is now 64%, with tracking error running high compared to benchmarks. Overall, the ETF Risk Grade by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system is poor at an F. Still, its overall Asset Class rank, as of this writing, is top-notch at No. 2 out of 410. Finally, on liquidity , I would caution investors to use limit orders, particularly around the market’s open. Average daily volume is just 124,000 shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is wide at 24 basis points, per Schwab. Looking closer at the portfolio, the 3-star ETF by Morningstar has high exposure to the lowest row of the style box, indicating its material exposure to small caps. Furthermore, more than half of the allocation is classified as growth. What does that mean for investors? Well, it suggests that price trends rely heavily on a thematic story—bullish bitcoin and ether, in this case. I’d steer investors away from the low reported 9.8x P/E (I trust Schwab’s numbers more, which is 22.4x). STCE: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar STCE: Low-Mid 20s P/E Schwab In terms of the sector breakdown, STCE is really a fintech play. Hence, almost the entire portfolio is invested in either the Financials or the Information Technology sector. Concentration is high, however, with almost two-thirds of the product allocated to just the top 10 holdings. So, it’s key to follow both the fundamentals and technicals of those major positions, particularly during the earnings season. STCE: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha In terms of seasonality, STCE has a limited price history. For that reason, I pulled bitcoin’s long-term month-by-month average price change. You’ll see that November is historically bullish, with gains extending into year-end and the beginning of the new year. To be clear, bitcoin bucked usual October bullish trends, so it’s not a sure thing. Bitcoin: Bullish Turn-of-the-Year Trends Barchart The Technical Take With a reasonable valuation and seasonal tailwinds, STCE’s technical situation is weak at first glance, but I see support in play. Notice in the chart below that shares are now approaching the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the April to October rally. That level is close to the $78 level—just $4 above the current price. Moreover, a peak in September has confluence with that point. What’s negative, though, is that the fund has dropped below the short-term 50-day moving average. But take a look at the long-term 200dma. It remains upward sloping, suggesting that even after a 25% giveback, the bulls still control the primary trend. Long-term support is likely to appear near $60—the peak from late 2024 and where resistance appeared in July. That's also the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement mark. So, buying here and adding in the low-mid $60s could be a risk-managed way to build a position. Additionally, the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart has ranged in a bullish zone from 40 to 80 (and here we are at the base of the range today). Finally, there is overhead resistance, given the significant amount of volume by price up to $110 (heavy volume since September leaves many investors underwater).

Founder Shayne Coplan said at a recent Miami conference that Polymarket’s US venue is already running, with a limited group of users onboarding as part of a beta phase, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. He added that the exchange is fully functional for selected accounts while it completes the final steps before opening wider access. Bloomberg reported last month that Polymarket planned to start a limited rollout in the US in November. The beta follows a reset period in which Polymarket moved offshore and paid a $1.4m penalty in 2022 to settle CFTC allegations . According to Bloomberg, prediction market platform Polymarket has quietly relaunched in the U.S. in beta mode, allowing select users to place real bets on live contracts. After paying a $1.4 million CFTC fine and relocating offshore, Polymarket returned by acquiring QCX, a… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 12, 2025 Prediction Market Momentum Builds As US Platforms Race To Launch New Products Interest in wagering on real-world events has climbed since last year’s presidential election. Kalshi has served US customers for years, and FanDuel said Wednesday it will launch a prediction product in December. Polymarket is moving to capture that demand with an exchange model that lets users set prices and back either side of an outcome. “It’s the fastest anyone has ever gotten to market,” Coplan said. “Definitely a difficult task, but our team has been incredible and made that happen.” CFTC-Approved Acquisition Bolsters Polymarket’s Bid To Enter Regulated Markets The firm acquired QCEX earlier this year, a company with CFTC approval to operate a derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, after the Justice Department and the CFTC dropped investigations into the crypto-betting platform. Polymarket frames its design as closer to a market venue than a casino. “I don’t think anyone would argue that the sports book model is the optimal model,” Coplan said. “There’s a monopoly on pricing. You trade against the house every time and they can set whatever prices they want and to make matters worse, if you make any money, they can ban you.” Founder Hints $POLY Token Could Join Top Cryptocurrencies By Market Value The company has been seeking fresh capital at a valuation between $12b and $15b after announcing an investment of as much as $2b from Intercontinental Exchange . A successful US return would give the platform a stronger footing as prediction trading battles for mainstream attention. Google Finance said last week it will begin showing live data from Polymarket and Kalshi in the coming weeks , starting with Labs users, so people can ask about future events and tap the wisdom of the crowd. That visibility could help normalize prediction prices for a broader audience. Speculation is also building around a potential native token. Last month, Coplan hinted at a $POLY token and suggested it could rank among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The tease comes as markets for elections, sports and macro outcomes gain traction. For crypto traders, a compliant US presence would be a milestone. A beta that proves stable onboarding, reliable settlement and meaningful liquidity could set the stage for a larger reopening, while competition from incumbents pushes the sector toward clearer rules and stronger consumer protections.

Corporate Bitcoin holdings continue to expand, even as MicroStrategy’s dominance slips to 60% of total reserves. Morgan Stanley advises caution, calling this phase a potential profit-taking season, while a stronger U.S. dollar adds short-term pressure. Still, BTC’s symmetrical triangle pattern hints at a possible breakout toward $104,000 and beyond. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Share Falls as Corporate Adoption Expands MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of BTC, but its share is declining as more companies add BTC to their balance sheets. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows MicroStrategy now holds 640,808 BTC, or 60% of total corporate Bitcoin reserves — down from 75% earlier this year. Corporate Bitcoin accumulation slowed in October, with public and private firms adding just 14,447 BTC — the lowest monthly increase of 2025. Coinbase purchased 2,772 BTC, while Japan’s Metaplanet led with 5,268 BTC, underscoring steady institutional confidence in BTC’s long-term value.

The BTC/USD pair dipped to $101,700 amid slower accumulation, suggesting near-term consolidation. However, the growing number of companies adopting BTC for reserves supports a positive long-term outlook for the asset. Morgan Stanley Warns Bitcoin Entering Profit-Taking Phase Morgan Stanley strategist Denny Galindo says Bitcoin has entered its “fall season,” a phase in its four-year market cycle when investors typically take profits before a potential downturn.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Eyes $104K as Triangle Pattern Narrows Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is hovering near $102,100, trading within a narrowing range that’s forming a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. The pattern signals that the market is coiling before a decisive breakout, with traders watching closely for a move beyond either side of the formation. BTC found support near $101,000, where a hammer candle formed, a sign that buyers are still stepping in on dips. The 20-EMA sits just below the 50-EMA, showing short-term caution but also hinting at a potential bullish crossover if momentum builds. The RSI at 48 remains neutral, suggesting that volatility could soon expand as traders position for the next move. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A confirmed break above $104,000 would likely trigger a rally toward $107,500, with further upside possible near $110,900. However, if Bitcoin slips below $99,200, a deeper pullback toward $96,200 or $93,400 could follow, where stronger historical support lies. For now, traders are waiting for confirmation. The breakout direction, above $104,000 or below $99,000, will likely set the tone for the rest of the quarter. With volatility tightening and institutional inflows building, Bitcoin’s current pause could be the calm before a sharp year-end move. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $26.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013255 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

54330763,626165,1763002808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54330763.jpeg,Bitwise Inches Closer to Launching First-Ever Chainlink ETF as DTCC Listing Creates a Buzz,https://bitcoinist.com/bitwise-inche-closer-launching-first-ever-chainlink/,"Bitwise’s proposed Chainlink exchange-traded fund (ETF) has moved a step closer to launch after being added to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) registry under the ticker CLNK. The listing, marked as both active and pre-launch, indicates that preparations are underway for its debut once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) grants final approval. DTCC Listing Sparks Optimism for Chainlink ETF Approval While DTCC listings do not guarantee regulatory clearance, they often precede official approval. The ETF aims to track Chainlink (LINK) , the native token that powers Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network, connecting smart contracts to real-world data feeds. This marks a major milestone for Bitwise, one of America’s leading crypto asset managers, which filed its Form S-1 with the SEC in August and is expected to follow up with Form 8-A, the last step before the ETF can trade on U.S. exchanges. The progress comes amid a prolonged U.S. government shutdown, now in its sixth week, which has stalled dozens of pending crypto ETF applications. However, optimism is growing after the Senate passed a bill to reopen government operations, potentially expediting long-delayed ETF reviews. Chainlink’s Expanding Institutional Footprint If approved, the Bitwise Chainlink ETF would become the first U.S. fund offering institutional exposure to a decentralized oracle network, a critical infrastructure in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Chainlink provides real-time, tamper-proof data to smart contracts, enabling the automation of payments, lending, and asset management across blockchain platforms. Analysts suggest that such an ETF could not only expand investor access to LINK but also solidify Chainlink’s position as a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure. The move follows Bitwise’s growing portfolio of altcoin ETFs, including funds tracking Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Aptos, while competitors like Grayscale are also seeking approval for a similar Chainlink ETF that includes staking features, a structure that may face additional regulatory hurdles. Market Reactions and the Road Ahead Despite the bullish regulatory signal, LINK prices slipped 2%, trading around $15.75 after failing to hold above the $17.40 resistance level. Analysts note that broader crypto market weakness and heavy derivatives sell-offs have overshadowed the positive ETF news. Still, industry observers see the DTCC listing as a key sign of maturing infrastructure for crypto-based financial products. Once the U.S. government fully reopens and the SEC resumes full operations, the Bitwise Chainlink ETF (CLNK) could lead a new wave of altcoin ETFs into the U.S. market, supporting the growing institutional appetite for blockchain-linked assets and bringing DeFi innovation closer to Wall Street.

Over the past week, Ethereum’s price has stabilized around the $3,500 level after briefly dipping below key supports, as traders and institutions reassess risk exposure across the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Despite the cautious sentiment, on-chain data reveals a contrasting story — large holders, or “whales,” are quietly accumulating ETH during the downturn. According to data from Lookonchain and CryptoQuant, several high-value wallets have increased their Ethereum positions significantly, signaling growing confidence among long-term investors even as broader market momentum slows. This accumulation phase suggests that sophisticated players view current price levels as an opportunity rather than a sign of broader weakness. Historically, similar patterns of whale buying during macro uncertainty have preceded periods of recovery and renewed market strength. Whale Activity Suggests Strategic Accumulation Despite Market Uncertainty According to data from Lookonchain, a whale known for aggressive Ethereum accumulation has just purchased an additional 30,548 ETH ($105.36 million) within the past hour. This move brings his total acquisitions since November 4 to an astonishing 385,718 ETH, worth roughly $1.33 billion. Notably, around $270 million of the funds used for these purchases were borrowed from the decentralized lending platform Aave, highlighting a highly leveraged but strategic positioning. This type of activity often signals strong institutional confidence in Ethereum’s medium-term outlook. Borrowing large sums to accumulate ETH indicates that the whale expects price appreciation substantial enough to offset borrowing costs and volatility risks. It also reflects growing demand for Ethereum exposure within decentralized finance (DeFi), where whales utilize platforms like Aave to optimize capital efficiency. Such large-scale buying can have multiple implications: it absorbs available market liquidity, strengthens psychological support zones, and may trigger a sentiment shift among retail investors who interpret the move as bullish. However, it also introduces potential short-term risk — if prices correct further, leveraged positions could amplify volatility. Overall, the data points toward renewed accumulation momentum, suggesting that sophisticated market participants are positioning for Ethereum’s next major move. Related Reading: Uniswap Founder Submits Governance Proposal To Burn UNI — Token Jumps 50% Bulls Attempt to Reclaim Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing signs of stabilization after weeks of intense selling pressure, trading around $3,479 at the time of writing. The daily chart shows ETH holding just above the 200-day moving average (red line) — a key long-term support level that has historically acted as a launch point for bullish recoveries. After dipping below $3,200 earlier in the week, Ethereum bounced strongly, supported by renewed whale accumulation and improving market sentiment. However, the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages remain above the current price, indicating that the short-term trend is still tilted to the downside. For bulls to regain control, ETH needs to close decisively above $3,650–$3,700, where a confluence of resistance sits. Related Reading: Ethereum Trading Volume On Binance Surpasses $6 Trillion: A Speculative Frenzy Unfolds Volume data suggests that selling pressure is gradually fading, but momentum remains weak. If Ethereum fails to maintain the $3,400–$3,450 zone, the next major support lies near $3,200. On the upside, reclaiming the $3,700 mark could open the door to a recovery toward $4,000. Overall, Ethereum appears to be in a consolidation phase, with large holders accumulating while retail traders remain cautious — a structure that often precedes a stronger directional move.

That’s why Noomez ($NNZ) is turning heads right now – it’s fun, it’s early, and it’s still flying under the radar. Each stage pushes the price higher, and early buyers are locking in before the big exchange listings. Miss this window, and you’ll be watching screenshots of Noomies celebrating while you’re still refreshing charts. It’s the one people will brag about saying, “I bought that before it pumped.” What Makes A Meme Coin Worth Buying? Not all meme coins are equal. The top meme coins 2025 will be the ones with structure, transparency, and a strong community behind them. Noomez hits several of those marks. It runs a 28-stage presale where each stage raises the price and burns leftover tokens. That means early entry gives you raw access and built-in scarcity. The fact that you can follow every stage using the live “Noom Gauge” on-chain gives clarity that many meme launches lack. It’s about more than the joke or the mascot – it’s about mechanics and timing. 3 Proven Ways To Find The Next Big Meme Coin Spotting the next breakout meme coin isn’t about luck. It’s about knowing where to look before everyone else catches on. 1. Monitor Social Media And Communities Buzz often starts in Telegram groups, Discord servers, and on X (formerly Twitter). When you see steady chatter about a meme coin, check the details. Early community momentum can point to something real. Don’t just swim in hype; watch for consistent engagement, memes, and people asking about project updates. 2. Track Presale Stages And Tokenomics The best meme coins right now will have clear tokenomics, a staged release plan, and built-in scarcity. Noomez ’s presale begins at $0.00001 and works up to $0.0028 across 28 rounds. Each stage only lasts up to seven days, and unsold tokens get burned. This gives early buyers a lower price and fewer competitors. Watch how many tokens are left, when the next stage kicks in, and whether the project updates transparently. 3. Follow Smart Money And Whales Big holders often jump in before listings. While you’re tracking presale numbers, take note of wallet activity, whale buys, or smart-money moves. If several early wallets are committing, it can be a strong signal. With Noomez, you can observe the “Noom Gauge” update each time a stage closes and tokens burn. That level of visibility is rare in the meme-coin space. Why Noomez ($NNZ) Could Be The One Everyone Talks About Next Noomez is shaping up as a standout among presale tokens. Its 28-stage structure, fixed total supply of 280 billion $NNZ , and deflationary burns make it perfectly timed for those hunting the top meme coins 2025 . Here’s what makes it stand out: Current Stage & Price: The presale is now in Stage 3 , priced at around $0.0000151 per token. Each new stage increases the price and burns unsold tokens automatically. Structured Tokenomics: 28 presale stages, 50% of supply for presale, 15% locked liquidity, and the rest reserved for staking and ecosystem growth. Every stage fuels scarcity and trust. Referral Rewards: Through the “Noom Recruit” system , both the inviter and the new buyer receive a 10% $NNZ bonus , creating a viral growth loop. Staking Integration: Holders can stake tokens early for bonus rewards, giving utility beyond speculation. Transparency: The entire presale progress is visible on-chain through the Noom Gauge , showing live token burns and stage data in real time.

As digital assets become more mainstream, JPX’s potential regulatory changes could reshape how Japanese companies manage their crypto investments and disclosures. Why Is Japan Exchange Group Tightening Crypto Rules? According to recent reports, the Japan Exchange Group is actively considering stricter regulations for companies holding digital assets. This move comes as cryptocurrency investments become more prevalent in corporate treasuries. The proposed measures aim to address growing concerns about transparency and risk management in this emerging asset class. Bloomberg Japan revealed that JPX is exploring several key changes. These include preventing backdoor listings through crypto assets and implementing mandatory new audit requirements. A JPX spokesperson confirmed that while no blanket regulations currently exist, the exchange group will closely monitor companies with potential governance concerns. What Specific Changes Might Companies Face? The Japan Exchange Group crypto regulations could introduce several important requirements.

Recent technical setups and data suggest growing interest in a potential move higher, with some traders eyeing a $5 target before the year ends. Cup-and-Handle Pattern in Focus Levi shared a chart showing a classic cup-and-handle setup on XRP’s 3-day timeframe. The rounded bottom formed between January and July 2025, followed by a move upward. Since then, the asset has pulled back inside a downward channel, shaping the handle. Notably, this structure is often seen before a breakout. The upper boundary of the handle is now being tested. A clean break above that level would complete the pattern and open room toward the $5 area. Levi noted, BREAKING: $XRP chart shows a classic cup-&-handle setup pointing to a $5 target by year-end. pic.twitter.com/kU37qXUBSU — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 12, 2025 The MACD on the chart also shows a possible bullish cross forming. Furthermore, ChartNerd pointed to a larger consolidation-expansion cycle. In the past, XRP traded sideways before a breakout. A similar structure is now visible on the chart, with the price holding between $1.50 and $3.00 throughout most of 2025. If this pattern continues, a new upward move could follow. The chart suggests this consolidation phase may be near completion, but a push above the top of the range is still needed. Mirrored Setup Hints at Repeat Move EGRAG CRYPTO shared a short-term pattern labeled “ As Above, So Below ” on the 4-hour chart. It compares two identical time periods of 89 days. Both show four stages of price movement within a tight range. The current structure reflects the earlier phase. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X Support levels are marked between $2.30 and $2.50. Resistance areas sit near $2.80, $3.00, and higher at $3.65 and $4.38. The final level on the chart aligns with the 1.414 Fibonacci extension at $4.38. Market Reaction and New Developments CRYPTOWZRD noted that XRP closed below $2.75 and is still influenced by Bitcoin’s trend. The key short-term level remains $2.41. A bounce from that support may allow for a move higher, while a failure to hold it could lead to more range-bound movement. As CryptoPotato reported , analysts are watching the $2.70 resistance level. This zone is seen as a short-term barrier before any major move can materialize. Separately, Steph reported that XRP’s CVD turned positive for the first time in months. “Last time this happened, XRP rallied 75%.” In addition, Canary Capital is set to launch the first US-based spot XRP ETF on November 13, aiming for full exposure to the asset.

Several prominent funds experienced notable outflows: Fidelity’s FBTC : $132.86 million outflow Ark Invest’s ARKB : $85.18 million outflow BlackRock’s IBIT : $36.91 million outflow Grayscale’s GBTC : $23.05 million outflow Interestingly, no spot Bitcoin ETFs reported net inflows for the day, indicating a broad market trend rather than isolated incidents. How Does This Bitcoin ETF Movement Impact Investors? For current investors, this outflow represents a shift in market dynamics. The Bitcoin ETF sector, known for its volatility, continues to demonstrate rapid changes in investor sentiment. However, experienced investors understand that such fluctuations are normal in emerging asset classes. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETF Future Trends? While daily outflows might concern some investors, it’s crucial to consider the bigger picture. The Bitcoin ETF market remains relatively new, and such movements often reflect short-term market adjustments rather than long-term trends. Market analysts suggest watching for patterns over weeks rather than days. Should You Worry About Bitcoin ETF Volatility? Volatility is inherent in cryptocurrency investments. The recent Bitcoin ETF outflow, while significant, represents a small percentage of total assets under management. Investors should maintain perspective and consider their long-term investment strategies rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. The $278 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a reminder of the market’s dynamic nature. While concerning at first glance, such movements are part of the normal ebb and flow in cryptocurrency investing. Savvy investors use these opportunities to reassess their positions and stay informed about market developments. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin ETF? A Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks Bitcoin’s price, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning cryptocurrency. Why do Bitcoin ETF flows matter? ETF flows indicate investor sentiment and can influence Bitcoin’s price through buying and selling pressure. Are Bitcoin ETF outflows always negative? Not necessarily. Outflows can represent profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing rather than loss of confidence. How often do Bitcoin ETF flows change direction? Flows can change daily, reflecting the cryptocurrency market’s high volatility and rapid sentiment shifts. Should I sell my Bitcoin ETF during outflows? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and long-term strategy, not just daily flow data. Where can I track Bitcoin ETF flows? Multiple financial data providers and cryptocurrency news sites regularly update ETF flow information. Found this analysis helpful?

Nasdaq’s approval of the Canary XRP ETF represents a monumental step forward for institutional cryptocurrency adoption, potentially opening floodgates for mainstream investment in digital assets. What Exactly is the XRP ETF and Why Does It Matter? The Canary XRP ETF approval signals a significant shift in how traditional financial markets view cryptocurrency. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, allows investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the digital asset. This eliminates the technical barriers that often deter traditional investors from entering the crypto space. Nasdaq’s endorsement carries tremendous weight in financial circles. The exchange’s rigorous standards mean this XRP ETF has passed numerous compliance checks and due diligence processes. Moreover, this development comes at a crucial time when regulatory clarity around digital assets continues to evolve. How Will the XRP ETF Benefit Everyday Investors? This XRP ETF opens doors for investors who previously hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market. Consider these advantages: Simplified access through traditional brokerage accounts Enhanced security compared to managing private keys Regulatory protection within established financial frameworks Tax reporting simplicity through conventional investment channels Liquidity advantages of trading on major exchanges The XRP ETF structure means investors can buy and sell shares just like any other stock, making cryptocurrency investment as straightforward as purchasing Apple or Microsoft shares. What Challenges Remain Before Trading Begins? While Nasdaq has approved the listing, the XRP ETF still requires SEC registration completion before active trading can commence. This final regulatory hurdle represents the last step in a lengthy approval process. The SEC’s careful scrutiny ensures investor protections align with traditional financial standards. Market experts anticipate the registration process will proceed smoothly given Nasdaq’s thorough vetting. However, timing remains uncertain as regulatory bodies operate on their own schedules. Investors should monitor official announcements for the exact launch date. How Could This XRP ETF Transform Crypto Markets? The introduction of a regulated XRP ETF could dramatically increase institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets. Traditional investment firms, pension funds, and retirement accounts that previously avoided digital assets due to regulatory concerns may now consider allocation to this new asset class. This development follows growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency products. The success of Bitcoin ETFs paved the way for alternative digital asset offerings. An XRP ETF represents the next logical step in cryptocurrency financialization, potentially setting precedent for other digital assets seeking mainstream acceptance. What Should Investors Watch For Next? As we await the SEC registration completion, several key indicators deserve attention: Official trading start date announcement from regulatory bodies Initial market response and trading volume metrics Institutional participation levels in early trading sessions Price correlation between the XRP ETF and underlying XRP asset Competitive responses from other financial institutions The successful launch of this XRP ETF could trigger a wave of similar products, further bridging traditional finance and cryptocurrency ecosystems. Frequently Asked Questions When will the XRP ETF start trading? Trading will begin as soon as the SEC registration process completes. While no exact date has been announced, market observers expect approval within the coming weeks. How is this XRP ETF different from buying XRP directly? The ETF provides exposure to XRP price movements without requiring investors to manage cryptocurrency wallets or deal with exchanges. It offers the convenience and regulatory protection of traditional securities. What brokerage platforms will offer the XRP ETF? Most major brokerage platforms that support ETF trading will likely offer the XRP ETF once SEC registration completes and trading officially begins. Will this affect the price of XRP? Increased accessibility through the ETF could drive additional demand for XRP, potentially influencing its price. However, market dynamics involve multiple factors beyond ETF availability. Is this the first cryptocurrency ETF? While Bitcoin ETFs launched earlier, this represents one of the first XRP-focused ETFs to receive major exchange approval, marking a significant milestone for alternative cryptocurrency adoption. What risks should investors consider? Like all investments, the XRP ETF carries market risk, regulatory uncertainty, and volatility concerns. Investors should assess their risk tolerance and consult financial advisors before investing. Found this insight valuable?

Bitcoin Has Underperformed Against Gold & S&P 500 Recently In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed about BTC’s recent trend relative to Gold and S&P 500. Historically, the cryptocurrency has shown some degree of correlation to these assets, but the pattern has shifted lately. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Demand Growing For First Time Since Early October: CryptoQuant Head Any two given assets are said to be “correlated” when one of them reacts to movements in the other by showing volatility of its own. As the chart shared by Santiment shows, Bitcoin has diverged from the traditional assets during the last few months. From the graph, it’s visible that Bitcoin has overall gone down 15% since August 11th. In the same window, the S&P 500 and Gold are up 7% and 21%, respectively. Gold has been the clear winner, but the S&P 500 has also at least managed a profit. The same is clearly not true for the number one cryptocurrency, which has gone the opposite way. The different trajectories of the assets would imply that they are no longer correlated or only have a negative correlation. Based on the fact that Bitcoin has shown tight correlation to the two over the last four years, however, the analytics firm has said, “BTC is arguably being undervalued.” It now remains to be seen whether the cryptocurrency’s price will eventually close the gap to the others. In some other news, BTC is trading between two key on-chain price levels right now, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post. The levels in question are part of the Supply Quantiles Cost Basis Model, which maps out various Bitcoin price levels according to the percentage of the supply that will be in profit if BTC were to trade at them. Bitcoin broke above the 0.95 quantile during its rally to the new all-time high (ATH), meaning more than 95% of the supply entered into a state of unrealized gain. With the drawdown that the coin has faced since then, its price has slipped not just under this level, but also the 0.85 quantile, corresponding to supply profitability of 85%. Related Reading: XRP To $10? Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark This level, currently situated at $108,500, could act as a barrier preventing upward breaks. In the down direction, the 0.75 quantile is present as a cushion around $100,600. “These levels have historically acted as support and resistance, with a break of either likely to define the next directional trend,” explained Glassnode. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $105,000, up 2.5% over the last seven days.

54332398,626070,1763006446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54332398.jpeg,US Government Shutdown Slows Crypto Market Growth By $408 Billion – Analyst Explains,https://bitcoinist.com/government-shutdown-slows-crypto-market-408-billion/,"The cryptocurrency market has entered a turbulent phase marked by intense selling pressure and heightened fear, as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs heavily on investors. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have lost key support levels, signaling that bulls are losing control and that the market has shifted into a corrective phase. However, some analysts argue that this environment represents opportunity rather than collapse — a reset phase that could prepare the ground for stronger long-term growth. A major catalyst behind the recent market weakness has been the US government shutdown, which introduced significant economic uncertainty. The halt raised global concerns about volatility and delayed crucial regulatory progress, including decisions on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. With official data on inflation and employment temporarily frozen, the Federal Reserve faced increased difficulty in guiding monetary policy, adding to investor hesitation. Despite this challenging backdrop, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to demonstrate resilience. Yet, the unstable political environment and disruption in financial regulation have amplified risk perception across digital assets. For now, the crypto market remains in a fragile equilibrium , caught between fear-driven selling and opportunistic accumulation as traders and institutions await clarity on both policy direction and macroeconomic recovery. Crypto Market Growth Stalls as Uncertainty Takes Hold According to a recent report by CryptoQuant analyst GugaOnChain, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a sharp deceleration in growth over the past month, reflecting mounting investor caution amid macroeconomic uncertainty. The analysis of the Market Cap Growth Rate (MA Gap Ratio between 30-day and 365-day averages) revealed a steep slowdown between October 1 and November 10, resulting in an aggregate market capitalization loss of approximately $408 billion, according to the on-chain Market Cap Comparison indicator. Bitcoin (BTC), while remaining relatively resilient, saw its growth rate decline from 16.75% on October 1 to 6.60% by November 10. The top 20 digital assets, excluding BTC, also experienced a significant slowdown, with their collective growth rate falling from 32.29% to 14.67% in the same period. The most severe impact was observed in mid- and small-cap assets, whose growth rate collapsed from 18.57% to a near standstill at 0.21% — a clear signal of fading market momentum and risk appetite. The compression across all segments highlights how the absence of macroeconomic data, coupled with regulatory delays due to the US government shutdown, has heightened uncertainty. While Bitcoin continues to hold elevated levels, the broader market remains fragile. CryptoQuant analysts conclude that a sustained recovery depends on policy clarity and the return of economic data flow. The resumption of government activities, inflation reports, and potential ETF updates could help restore investor confidence and reignite growth across the digital asset landscape. Crypto Market Cap Tests Crucial Support Amid Broad Slowdown The total cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands around $3.48 trillion, showing signs of stabilization after weeks of persistent selling pressure. As seen in the chart, the market is consolidating near the 50-week moving average, a level that has historically acted as a crucial support zone during mid-cycle corrections. A decisive close above this area could signal resilience, while a breakdown below it may open the door for deeper retracements toward the $3.2 trillion region. From a structural standpoint, the broader market remains in an uptrend, but momentum has clearly weakened since the late-September peak near $4.2 trillion. The declining volume over the past few weeks reinforces this cooling phase, suggesting that market participants are adopting a cautious stance amid macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty. Bitcoin’s relative stability above $100,000 has helped prevent a steeper market-wide correction, but the weakness in altcoins continues to weigh on aggregate valuations. If liquidity and investor sentiment improve, the market could attempt a recovery back toward $3.8–$4 trillion in the coming weeks. However, sustained macro uncertainty or prolonged consolidation in Bitcoin could extend this period of stagnation, keeping total crypto capitalization trapped within the current range for the remainder of Q4 2025.

This development brings relief to workers and signals the restoration of essential government services across multiple departments. Why Are Federal Employees Returning to Work Now? President Donald Trump signed a temporary budget bill that effectively ended the government shutdown. This crucial action allows federal employees return to work and resume their normal duties. The Department of the Interior, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Justice are among the first agencies implementing this directive. The resolution comes after intense negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House. However, the temporary nature of the budget bill means this solution may only last for a limited period. Which Departments Are Affected by This Return? Several key government departments have issued clear instructions for their staff. The affected agencies include: Department of the Interior Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Justice Multiple other federal agencies These departments play vital roles in maintaining government operations and public services. Their full staffing ensures that essential functions can resume immediately. What Challenges Do Workers Face Returning? While the news brings relief, federal employees return to work facing several practical challenges. Many must quickly readjust their schedules and childcare arrangements. Moreover, they need to catch up on backlogged work that accumulated during the shutdown period. The transition also involves logistical considerations. Offices may need time to restore full operational capacity. Equipment might require maintenance after sitting unused for weeks. Therefore, the initial days will likely involve both celebration and significant catch-up work. How Does This Impact Government Services? As federal employees return to work, the public can expect gradual restoration of services. Important functions like national park maintenance, housing assistance programs, and legal proceedings will resume normal operations. This return to stability benefits millions of Americans who rely on these essential services. The resolution demonstrates how temporary budget solutions can provide immediate relief. However, it also highlights the need for more permanent funding agreements to prevent future disruptions. What’s Next for Federal Workers? The November 13 deadline gives federal employees return to work a clear timeline for resuming their duties. While the temporary nature of the budget solution means uncertainty remains, the immediate return provides much-needed stability for workers and their families.

Mizuho Securities just unveiled what they’re calling a ‘hidden gem’ – the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. With an Outperform rating and a stunning $30 price target, this analysis could change how investors view one of the most promising platforms in the digital asset world. Why is the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange generating so much excitement? Mizuho’s coverage initiation comes at a crucial time for the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. Shares recently closed at $13.80, representing a significant 56.88% decline since the company went public. However, Mizuho sees this as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern. The investment bank’s positive outlook stems from several key factors that could drive substantial growth. The analysts specifically highlighted the company’s focus on developing new growth engines. These innovative ventures include decentralized prediction markets, which represent the next frontier in blockchain technology. Moreover, the management team is actively working to secure necessary licenses for these new business lines. What makes the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange a ‘hidden gem’? Mizuho’s characterization of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange as a hidden gem isn’t just catchy marketing language. The assessment reflects several concrete advantages that could position the platform for success: Innovation focus: The company’s commitment to developing decentralized prediction markets shows forward-thinking leadership Regulatory preparedness: Active license acquisition efforts demonstrate responsible growth planning Growth potential: Current valuation doesn’t reflect future revenue streams from new ventures Market position: Established brand in the competitive cryptocurrency exchange landscape The $30 price target suggests Mizuho believes the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange could more than double from current levels. This represents one of the most optimistic Wall Street assessments in the crypto sector recently. How can investors benefit from this Gemini cryptocurrency exchange analysis? For investors considering the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, timing appears crucial. The significant price decline since IPO means entry points are substantially more attractive than during the initial public offering. However, investors should consider both the opportunities and challenges. The regulatory landscape remains complex for cryptocurrency exchanges. Success in securing necessary licenses will be critical for the new ventures Mizuho highlighted. Additionally, competition in the cryptocurrency exchange space continues to intensify from both traditional finance entrants and crypto-native platforms. Nevertheless, the combination of Mizuho’s reputable analysis and the company’s strategic direction creates a compelling case. The focus on decentralized prediction markets could tap into emerging Web3 trends that many investors are seeking exposure to through established platforms. What’s next for the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange? The path forward for the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange involves executing on several key initiatives. License acquisition for new ventures will be closely watched by market participants. Successful regulatory approvals could serve as positive catalysts for the stock price. Furthermore, the development timeline for decentralized prediction markets will influence investor sentiment. Early prototypes or testnet launches could generate additional excitement around the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange’s innovation capabilities. Market conditions for cryptocurrency exchanges overall will also play a role. A resurgence in crypto asset prices and trading volumes would naturally benefit all platforms in the sector, including Gemini. Conclusion: A promising outlook for savvy investors The Mizuho initiation on the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange represents a significant vote of confidence from a major financial institution. The Outperform rating and $30 target price suggest substantial upside potential from current levels. While risks remain in the volatile crypto market, the combination of innovation focus, regulatory diligence, and attractive valuation creates a compelling investment thesis. Frequently Asked Questions What is Mizuho’s price target for Gemini? Mizuho Securities has set a $30 price target for Gemini shares, representing significant upside from the current trading price of $13.80. Why did Mizuho call Gemini a ‘hidden gem’? Analysts believe the market is overlooking Gemini’s potential in developing new growth engines like decentralized prediction markets and its efforts to secure necessary licenses. How much has Gemini’s stock declined since IPO? Gemini shares have declined 56.88% since the company’s public listing, making current prices potentially attractive for new investors. What are decentralized prediction markets? These are blockchain-based platforms that allow users to speculate on future events, representing a growing segment of the cryptocurrency ecosystem that Gemini is exploring. Is now a good time to invest in Gemini? While Mizuho’s analysis is positive, investors should conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance, as cryptocurrency investments remain volatile. What licenses is Gemini seeking? The company is working to secure regulatory approvals necessary to operate its new ventures, though specific license types vary by jurisdiction and business line.

The House approved the deal 222 to 209 after Senate negotiators reached a compromise, keeping agencies funded through January and securing full-year financing for several departments into fiscal 2026. Trump’s signature late Wednesday closed a 43-day stalemate, restoring pay for federal workers and restarting critical food and nutrition programs. Futures in the US were little changed, with investors waiting for normal economic data releases to resume and help refine the interest-rate outlook. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $101,839, down 1.5% Ether : $3,457, up 0.2% XRP : $2.47, up 2.8% Total crypto market cap: $3.53 trillion, down 1.5% Markets Look To Upcoming US Reports For Confirmation Of Softening Labor Conditions Economists expect delayed reports to trickle out next week, with attention on whether the figures confirm recent signs of labor-market softness in private surveys. President Trump signs bill to reopen the government. The longest shutdown in US history is over, but it will take time for things to return to normal. https://t.co/wqqceeYUad pic.twitter.com/CCXkplBHYI — CNN (@CNN) November 13, 2025 In Japan, the Nikkei rose 0.5% and the Topix climbed nearly 1% to a record, as investors rotated away from the frothiest AI leaders into broader parts of the economy. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng eased from a one-month high, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.1%. Wall Street closed split overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record high, even as the Nasdaq slipped, reflecting ongoing profit-taking in high-multiple tech. In Europe, the FTSE 100 finished at a record, bank gains lifted the STOXX 600 to fresh peaks, and Italy’s FTSE MIB hit its highest level in nearly 25 years. Shutdown’s End Clears Path For Regulators To Resume Oversight And ETF Reviews Safe-haven moves faded. The US 10-year Treasury yield hovered near 4.07% after an earlier bond bid eased. Gold, which surged nearly 3% overnight, stayed firm above $4,200 in Asian hours as traders balanced easing shutdown risks with lingering macro uncertainty. Energy softened. Brent crude futures edged down to a three-week low near $62.48 a barrel after OPEC shifted its outlook to a small surplus for 2026, tempering the demand narrative that supported prices earlier in the week. For crypto traders, the fiscal clarity removes one source of headline risk, but it may not immediately shift flows. With bitcoin flat and liquidity still thin in early trade, desks are watching the restart of US data for fresh cues on rates and risk appetite. The shutdown’s end also clears the way for regulators and agencies to return to normal operations, which matters for digital-asset oversight, ETF administration, and enforcement calendars. Any surprises in the coming data run could reprice rate expectations and ripple quickly through high-beta assets, including crypto. For now, the market tone is one of cautious relief. The reopening steadies sentiment, but positioning remains selective as investors parse the path from fiscal restart to a cleaner read on growth, inflation and the next Federal Reserve steps.

Speaking on the Crypto Goes Mainstream podcast, Galindo likened the current phase to a harvest period. “We are in the fall season right now,” he said. “Fall is the time for harvest. So, it’s the time you want to take your gains.” Bitcoin dropped below $99,000 on November 5, falling beneath its 365-day moving average, a move that many analysts view as a technical bear market signal. Bitcoin Faces Pressure Amid Slowing Liquidity The decline comes as profit-taking and cooling enthusiasm in AI and tech stocks weigh on broader risk assets. Bitcoin slipped nearly 3% to around $103,000 after briefly touching $107,000 earlier in the week. Market analysts at CoinSwitch note that immediate support lies between $100,000 and $102,000, while resistance remains near $110,000. Liquidity conditions have also weakened. Market-maker Wintermute reports that key liquidity sources, including stablecoins, ETFs, and digital asset treasuries, have reached a plateau. The slowdown could increase volatility as traders unwind leveraged positions. Ethereum fell by over 3.5% to $3,432, while major altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Hyperliquid recorded losses exceeding 8%, dragging the total crypto market capitalization down 0.6% to $3.52 trillion. Institutional Adoption Grows Despite Short-Term Risks Despite the recent pullback, Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term role as a macro hedge. Michael Cyprys, head of U.S. brokers and asset managers research at the firm, noted that “institutional investors increasingly view Bitcoin as digital gold and a hedge against inflation.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold over $137 billion in assets, while Ethereum ETFs account for $22.4 billion, according to SoSoValue data. Meanwhile, companies like London BTC Company Limited are expanding operations in North America, leveraging renewable energy to sustain mining profitability. Analysts say such developments underscore the maturing structure of the crypto market, even as short-term sentiment cools.

Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say At the time of his post, DOGE was trading around $0.17, making those estimates equal to roughly 1,076% and over 2,800% gains from that level. The call has drawn attention because it ties price hopes to repeating chart behavior rather than fresh fundamentals. Chart Patterns And Historical Runs According to the analyst’s charts, DOGE has formed a long-running descending triangle since its $0.75 peak in 2021. Traders are being shown a breakout followed by a retest pattern. Reports point to similar setups in past rallies: in 2017 DOGE moved from about $0.00022 to $0.019 — roughly 9,800% — and in 2021 it climbed from about $0.0025 to $0.75, a surge of over 32,000%. Those runs are the basis for the “fractal confluence” argument that history could repeat. DOGECOIN READY FOR ITS NEXT HISTORIC MEGA RUN 🚀 Breakout ✅ Retest ✅ Structure locked and loaded for a parabolic explosion! The same pattern that sent $DOGE flying in 2017, 2021 is repeating again on the monthly timeframe and this time, the move looks even more powerful.… pic.twitter.com/yZIFHthnm5 — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) November 11, 2025 A Recent Breakout, Retest Highlighted As Trigger Based on reports, DOGE cleared the triangle in December 2024 during a US President Donald Trump-led crypto market boom, pushing above $0.48. The coin then came back to test the former trendline, which some traders call a normal step after a breakout. Other analysts have flagged similarities between today’s action and the token’s early bull runs, and some see that as confirmation for more upside. Short-Term Indicators Looking Up Technical numbers show a nearer-term forecast of a rise of 13.51% to $0.2002 by December 12, 2025. Current readings described by data providers list sentiment as Bearish and the Fear & Greed Index at 20 (Fear). Over the last 30 days DOGE had 13/30 (43%) green days and about 6.71% price volatility. Those numbers suggest that, for now, traders remain cautious even as longer-term charts are cited as bullish. Bitwise DOGE ETF Reports note that Bitwise moved forward with a DOGE ETF filing under Section 8(a) using CF Benchmarks’ settlement price, an action that could draw institutional interest if it progresses. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst Meanwhile, on-chain snapshots indicate that large holders are trimming supply, while retail activity has ticked up and some momentum indicators have turned higher. According to Bitwise, its fund would use the CF DOGE-Dollar Settlement Price from CF Benchmarks to calculate net asset value, which provides transparent, rules-based pricing across venues. If approved, this structure could make DOGE more accessible to institutions needing a regulated vehicle, potentially boosting order book depth and easing inflows or outflows. This increased access, combined with clearer pricing, could explain the recent movements in the market value of DOGE.

Their newly published trustless manifesto serves as a crucial reminder about the core principles that make cryptocurrency systems truly revolutionary. What Exactly is the Trustless Manifesto? The trustless manifesto represents a collective statement from Buterin and researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa Posner. This document directly addresses Ethereum developers who might be tempted to compromise on decentralization due to technical challenges. The authors argue that once a platform implements hosted nodes or centralized relays, it loses its fundamental trustless nature. Why Does Trustless Matter So Much? Without a truly trustless system, the authors contend that all other benefits become superficial. Consider these key points from the trustless manifesto : Efficiency gains mean little on fragile centralized systems User experience improvements become temporary without decentralization Scalability solutions built on centralization create future bottlenecks What Dangers Does Centralization Pose? The trustless manifesto specifically warns against taking shortcuts for convenience. The authors emphasize that code written today for easier development could become tomorrow’s critical bottleneck. Moreover, they stress that complexity should never justify abandoning core principles. How Will This Impact Ethereum’s Future? This trustless manifesto comes at a pivotal moment for Ethereum development. As the network evolves and faces scaling challenges, Buterin’s position reinforces that decentralization isn’t negotiable. The document serves as both a warning and a guiding principle for all future development. What Can Developers Learn From This? The trustless manifesto provides clear direction for builders facing technical hurdles. Instead of opting for centralized solutions, developers should focus on innovative approaches that maintain trustless characteristics. This ensures long-term sustainability rather than short-term convenience. The Trustless Manifesto represents more than just another technical document—it’s a philosophical foundation for Ethereum’s continued evolution. By prioritizing decentralization above all else, Buterin and his co-authors ensure that the platform remains true to its revolutionary origins while navigating the complex challenges of growth and scalability. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main purpose of the Trustless Manifesto? The Trustless Manifesto aims to remind Ethereum developers not to sacrifice decentralization for development convenience, ensuring the platform remains true to its core principles. Who are the authors of this manifesto? Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin co-authored the document with Ethereum Foundation researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa Posner. What specific practices does the manifesto warn against? The document specifically warns against implementing hosted nodes or centralized relays, which compromise a system’s trustless nature. Why is maintaining trustless systems so challenging? Technical complexity and development difficulties often tempt developers toward centralized solutions that appear easier to implement initially. How does this manifesto affect ordinary Ethereum users? By maintaining trustless principles, users continue to benefit from truly decentralized applications without relying on third-party trust. What happens if developers ignore these warnings? The authors warn that centralized solutions create future bottlenecks and undermine the fundamental value proposition of blockchain technology.

ETH was trading at $3,475, and has formed a risky pattern that points to more downside over time as institutional demand wanes. Ethereum price has formed a death cross pattern The daily timeframe chart shows that the price of Ethereum has been in a strong downward trend in the past few months, moving from a high of $4,950 in August to $3,473 today. Ethereum has now formed the highly bearish death cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) cross each other. This pattern often leads to more downside. The coin has also formed a head-and-shoulders pattern with a slanted neckline. Most recently, it has formed a bearish flag pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a channel. Ethereum price has moved below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level at $3,580. Moving below this level normally leads to more downside, potentially to the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels. Therefore, the most likely Ethereum price forecast is bearish, with the next key support level being the psychological level at $3,000. A move above the death cross point at $3,800 will invalidate the bearish outlook. ETH price chart | Source: TradingView Why ETH price is falling There are a few fundamental reasons why Ethereum price is crashing today. First, its fundamentals are deteriorating, with data compiled by DeFi Llama showing that the total value locked (TVL) dropped by 16% in the last 30 days to $157 billion. The TVL is an important number that looks at the amount of money deployed in its smart contracts. More data compiled by Nansen shows that the number of active addresses and transactions in Ethereum has plunged in the past few months. There were 45.2 million transactions in the network in the last 30 days, down by 23%. Its fees dropped by 42% to $27 million, while active addresses dropped to 8.2 million. In contrast, other networks like Tron and BNB Chain are doing well, with their transactions rising by 38% and 35%, respectively in the last 30 days. Ethereum price has also plunged because of the ongoing performance in the exchange-traded funds (ETF) market. Data shows that these funds have had $107 million in outflows this week after they shed $507 million last week. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF is leading in terms of assets with $13.8 billion, while Grayscale’s ETHE has $3.38 billion. Ethereum price has also crashed as treasury companies go through major challenges. Tom Lee’s BitMine stock price has plunged from $160 in July to $40 today, while SharpLink has dropped from $123 in May to $11 today. The crash in Ethereum treasury stocks is a major blow to the coin as it means that they will acquire less tokens going forward. Ethereum price is also falling as its open interest continues falling. It has plunged to $39 billion, down from $70 billion in August this year. This open interest has plunged after the large liquidation event that happened in October, when positions worth over $3.8 billion were liquidated within a day. Ethereum’s weighted funding rate has continued to move sideways in the past few months, a sign that liquidity has largely dried in the past few months. More data shows that investors are unstaking their Ethereum coins. According to StakingRewards, there was a net decrease of 5.2k ETH worth $18 million staked Ethereum in the last 30 days. A significant decline in the amount of staked Ethereum is a bearish sign as it means that investors are selling their tokens.

This critical juncture in the forex market presents both risks and opportunities for traders navigating these turbulent waters. Asia FX Faces Pressure Amid Global Uncertainty The Asian foreign exchange market displays muted activity as regional currencies struggle to find direction. The forex market remains cautious amid mixed signals from global economic indicators and central bank policies. Most Asian currencies traded within narrow ranges, reflecting the uncertainty dominating international financial markets. Japanese Yen Approaches Intervention Territory The Japanese yen continues to weaken against major currencies, approaching levels that historically prompted government action. Currency intervention becomes increasingly likely as the yen’s depreciation accelerates. Market participants closely monitor these developments, aware that Japanese authorities have previously stepped in when the currency reached similar thresholds. Yen weakness persists despite Bank of Japan policy adjustments Historical intervention levels within striking distance Market sentiment divided on potential government action Carry trade dynamics contributing to yen pressure Dollar Steady as Shutdown Resolution Eases Pressure The US dollar demonstrates remarkable stability following the temporary resolution of the government shutdown. This dollar steady performance comes as relief spreads through financial markets, though underlying concerns about fiscal policy remain. The currency’s resilience highlights its continued role as a global safe haven despite domestic political challenges.

Inflation concerns, growth projections, and central bank policy divergence create complex trading conditions. Market participants must navigate this challenging environment while managing risk exposure across multiple currency pairs. Currency Intervention Risks and Opportunities Potential currency intervention creates both dangers and possibilities for traders. Understanding the mechanics and timing of such actions can provide significant advantages in the forex market. Historical patterns suggest that intervention often follows specific technical levels and market conditions that we’re currently approaching. Actionable Trading Insights for Current Conditions Traders should consider several strategies in this environment. Position sizing becomes crucial when intervention risk increases. Diversification across correlated and non-correlated pairs can help manage volatility. Monitoring official statements and technical levels provides early warning signals for potential market moves. FAQs: Understanding the Current Currency Landscape What levels might trigger Japanese yen intervention? Historically, the Japanese Ministry of Finance has intervened when the USD/JPY approaches 150.00, though exact thresholds vary based on market conditions and pace of movement. How does the US government shutdown affect currency markets? Shutdown resolutions typically provide temporary dollar support, but underlying fiscal concerns remain. The Federal Reserve continues to monitor these developments for monetary policy implications. Which Asian currencies show the most resilience? Traditionally stable currencies like the Singapore dollar and Chinese yuan often demonstrate relative strength, though current conditions challenge all regional currencies. What role does the Bank of Japan play in currency intervention? The Bank of Japan typically executes intervention decisions made by the Ministry of Finance, using foreign exchange reserves to influence currency values. How long do intervention effects typically last? Effects vary from temporary relief to sustained trends, depending on market conditions, follow-up actions, and underlying economic fundamentals. Navigating the Complex Currency Crossroads The Asian currency landscape presents a critical test for traders and policymakers alike. The Japanese yen’s approach to intervention levels creates high-stakes scenarios, while the dollar’s stability offers both reassurance and caution. Success in this environment requires careful analysis, disciplined risk management, and awareness of both technical and fundamental drivers.

His commentary, supported by remarks from former Ripple managing director Navin Gupta, sheds light on the regulatory and operational barriers currently shaping global financial infrastructure. According to Mr. Man, banks’ hesitation to adopt XRP on a large scale has little to do with its technical capability. Instead, it revolves around regulatory prudence. At present, the U.S. dollar remains the regulated means for banks to operate as a bridge currency in foreign exchange processes. Institutions are required to maintain compliance with frameworks that still treat cryptocurrencies as high-risk assets. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) currently assigns a 1250% risk weight to unbacked crypto assets such as Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. This means banks must allocate substantial capital against any holdings. For those individuals that still struggle to see why XRP is not being used currently at high volumes, this should open your eyes. USD is still the REGULATED WAY BANKS USE A BRIDGE CURRENCY. When BIS Prudential treatment of crypto assets reduces the RISK WEIGHT from 1250% to hold… https://t.co/dyWvletzrF pic.twitter.com/eElnKJ3HdD — Mr. Man (@MrManXRP) November 10, 2025 The Role of the BIS in Future Crypto Adoption Mr. Man explained that only when the BIS adjusts this prudential treatment — reducing the risk weighting — will banks begin using digital assets like XRP for liquidity purposes. This change would open the path for financial institutions to use XRP as efficiently as they use the dollar today. He compared the existing foreign exchange mechanism to the one XRP could replace. Currently, a transaction might move from the British pound to the U.S. dollar, then from the dollar to the Philippine peso. In the future, once regulatory conditions permit, that same transaction could flow from the pound to XRP, and then to the peso, eliminating the need for dollar intermediaries. RLUSD and Its Relationship with XRP Mr. Man also clarified a crucial point about Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD . He emphasized that RLUSD’s introduction does not reduce XRP’s utility . Instead, XRP functions as the bridge asset that enables the movement of RLUSD and other currencies through Ripple’s software infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Navin Gupta Explains XRP’s Practical Application In the video attached to the tweet, Navin Gupta elaborated on this structure. He described Ripple as a software system connecting order books across different exchanges. Gupta explained that XRP is freely traded in independent markets — for example, GBP to XRP in the United Kingdom and XRP to the Philippine peso in the Philippines. When a cross-border transaction is initiated, Ripple’s software connects these markets, converting GBP to XRP and then XRP to the peso within seconds. Gupta stressed that Ripple’s operations involve only regulated financial institutions and that every transaction complies fully with legal standards. He noted that the process replicates traditional currency routes but replaces the dollar bridge with XRP, achieving faster settlement and lower cost. By connecting Mr. Man’s insights with Gupta’s explanation, the underlying message becomes clear: XRP’s limited institutional adoption is not due to its inefficiency but to global regulatory frameworks that have yet to evolve. Once prudential standards shift, XRP could become the preferred bridge asset for cross-border liquidity. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index also plunged to its lowest level since February, but analysts like Samson Mow say long-term holders are accumulating as short-term investors exit. Additionally, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicted a major crypto boom in 2026 driven by strong fundamentals like institutional adoption, stablecoins, and tokenization. He pointed out that while retail sentiment is subdued, traditional investors are increasingly entering the space through spot crypto ETFs. Analysts See Crypto Rally Brewing Crypto analysts and on-chain data suggest that an “unexpected November rally” may be on the horizon, despite the fact that fear continues to dominate the market. Market intelligence platform Santiment pointed out that social media sentiment toward major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP has turned increasingly bearish, which is often a precursor to market reversals when long-term holders absorb coins sold by short-term speculators. Bitcoin’s online discussions are still evenly divided between bullish and bearish views, while Ethereum has just over 50% more bullish comments than bearish ones. XRP, however, has become one of the most negatively perceived assets, with less than half of social media comments showing optimism. Santiment described this as one of the most “fearful moments of 2025” for XRP. Despite this, the firm still suggested that such extreme sentiment could actually be a bullish sign, and could be a signal of the exhaustion of weaker hands. The broader crypto market is still struggling with fear and uncertainty. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which measures overall investor sentiment, dropped to 15 out of 100 this week, which was its lowest reading since February and well within the “extreme fear” category. Analysts attribute this mood to the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, including shifting capital flows and concerns about US fiscal policy as the government approaches the end of its shutdown period. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Joe Consorti of Horizon compared the current sentiment to 2022 levels, when Bitcoin was trading close to $18,000. Santiment explained that when retail investors sell into weakness, “key stakeholders scoop up the dropped coins and pump prices.” Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow also believes the market is setting up for a stronger phase. He said that most of the selling is coming from newer investors who entered the market in the past 12 to 18 months and are taking profits, while long-term holders are using the dip to accumulate. “These are not Bitcoin buyers from first principles, but rather speculators that follow the news,” Mow explained, and added that this rotation of coins to more convicted holders sets the stage for a stronger market in 2026. Crypto Boom Likely in 2026 Meanwhile, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan says he is now more confident than ever that crypto markets will see a major boom in 2026, as the absence of a strong rally in late 2025 aligns with the typical four-year cycle that historically defined crypto bull and bear markets. At The Bridge conference in New York City, Hougan explained that a major rally at the end of 2025 would have risked triggering an earlier downturn in 2026, but since that hasn’t materialized, the setup for a strong year ahead looks even more convincing. Hougan explained that growing momentum in key sectors — including the Bitcoin debasement trade, stablecoins, and tokenization — continues to strengthen the market’s long-term foundation. He also pointed to renewed excitement around decentralized finance as a potential catalyst for a DeFi revival in the coming year. Matt Hougan “The underlying fundamentals are just so sound,” he said. “Institutional investment, regulatory progress, stablecoins, tokenization — those forces are too big to keep down. So I think 2026 will be a good year.” Although Hougan is still optimistic about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana setting new highs by 2026, his outlook is more measured than some of the more bullish forecasts made earlier this year. Analysts like Arthur Hayes and Tom Lee suggested that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 and Ethereum $15,000 by year’s end, but with Bitcoin trading close to $101,700 and Ethereum around $3,400, such targets would require extraordinary gains in a very short timeframe. Hougan said the pullback is largely driven by disillusioned “crypto-native retail” investors, many of whom exited after facing setbacks from events like the FTX collapse, the failed meme coin hype cycle, and October’s liquidations. “Crypto native retail is depressed,” he said, and added that this group appears to be sitting out the current cycle. In contrast, traditional finance investors are showing more resilience and interest, with spot crypto ETF inflows climbing steadily. “Traditional retail, like my uncle, is moving into crypto — that part of retail is still alive,” Hougan said.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-13 05:30:00

Hassett stated that they expect a significant decline in the prices of imported goods. “We anticipate a significant decline in the prices of imported goods,” Hassett said, arguing that this situation should be interpreted as a cost adjustment process, not inflation. Regarding trade policies, he stated that alternative avenues would be considered if the Supreme Court ruled against the government in the customs duty case. He also stated that 50-year mortgages could make home ownership easier.

Hassett said he would accept the position if appointed Fed Chair, adding that the Fed is likely to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. He added that a 50 basis point cut is unlikely. Meanwhile, Fed member Miran stated, “The Fed's policy is currently too tight,” suggesting a looser monetary policy. Miran also addressed the potential impact of stablecoins on the global economy, saying, “According to independent estimates, stablecoin growth could have an impact equivalent to 30% to 60% of savings rates from 2000-2010.” *This is not investment advice.

In a closing message aired during Dromos Labs’ event on Wednesday, he remarked, “We’ll be seeing, I think, a growth in more and more cases of people, institutions, all kinds of users around the world actually using this as their primary bank account.” He added that DeFi had evolved to the point of being a credible savings option. His comments illustrate just how far DeFi, which started as an experiment, has come — and point to the faith that decentralized systems might one day compete with established Wall Street giants. Buterin recognised that the DeFi sector is still dealing with security risks The DeFi space has matured beyond its earlier speculative phase , Buterin said, citing a recent blog post that called for lower-risk DeFi. He posited that DeFi may serve as a refuge for people around the world who want to move away from fiat systems and are vulnerable to political interference and financial seizure. However, he tempered his optimism with realism, cautioning that DeFi is still working through numerous technical and security issues – most recently, the costly Balancer breach. Nevertheless, he noted that current security in 2025 is on a completely different level compared to what the industry had back in 2019 or 2020. However, he did advocate for protocols to implement the “walkaway test,” a standard that would allow users’ funds to be retrievable at all times. He further argued, “It’s really important for Ethereum and DeFi to really maintain and build and improve upon the core properties that have made Ethereum the Ethereum from the beginning.” In practice, that means building transparently, following common standards, promoting interoperability, and avoiding restrictive or censorable systems. Additionally, he’s advised developers to experiment with projects that bridge Ethereum’s mainnet and Layer 2 networks, using L1 as the anchor and L2 as the scaling engine. He also stated that Ethereum is scaling on both the base layer and Layer 2s, with projects like Lighter now handling more than 10,000 transactions per second. He pointed out that scalability is accessible to anyone today with the right engineering, and numerous valuable projects exist to promote financial freedom. Buterin suggested combining the ZK proof to address blockchain security Buterin has also recently admitted to a design flaw in one of Ethereum’s features, which is causing verification to slow down by 50 times, hampering the Layer-2 ecosystem worth $50 billion. Nonetheless, he has advocated for a hybrid approach, utilizing Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs alongside multi-party computation, fully homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution environments to create more resilient privacy solutions. While Ethereum is contending with internal design flaws, ZK proof has engineered its system specifically for high-speed zero-knowledge computation, backing it with $100 million in self-funded development. It has already invested $20 million in infrastructure, with $17 million in custom Proof Pod hardware. Buterin emphasized voting as a key area where zero-knowledge proofs can help prevent coercion, while blockchain projects explore these systems to protect decision-makers. Separately, Buterin recently weighed in on mounting criticism, defending the 43-day Ethereum unstaking delays amid growing industry criticism over trapped validator funds. Buterin’s comments followed developer Robert Sags’ recent criticism of withdrawal delays that surpass traditional banking timescales and tarnish the user experience for retail investors. “It’s more like a soldier deciding to quit the army. Staking is about taking on a solemn duty to defend the chain,” Buterin wrote on X, emphasizing that “friction in quitting is part of the deal.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

That’s exactly what EigenCloud has achieved with their groundbreaking EigenZero cross-chain security module, developed in partnership with LayerZero. This innovative approach is set to revolutionize how we think about cross-chain security in the cryptocurrency space. What Makes EigenZero Cross-Chain Security So Revolutionary? EigenCloud, a leading Ethereum restaking infrastructure provider, has taken cross-chain security to the next level. Their collaboration with interchain protocol LayerZero has produced EigenZero – the first cryptoeconomic Distributed Validator Network built on EigenCloud’s slashing infrastructure. This represents a massive leap forward in cross-chain security technology. The system features an impressive $5 million in ZRO tokens deposited as slashable staked assets. This means validators have real skin in the game. The cross-chain security model ensures that staked assets face penalties for validation failures or malicious activities, creating a powerful economic incentive for proper behavior. How Does This New Cross-Chain Security Model Work? Traditional security models often rely on validator reputation, but EigenZero’s cross-chain security approach changes everything. Applications can now select their security level based on: On-chain economic collateral Slashing history records Actual performance metrics Real-time security assessments This transparent system eliminates the guesswork from cross-chain security. Instead of trusting promises or reputations, users can see exactly what economic backing supports their transactions. The cross-chain security framework provides measurable, verifiable protection that grows stronger with each successful validation. Why Should You Care About This Cross-Chain Security Breakthrough? The implications for cross-chain security are enormous. With $5 million in ZRO tokens at stake, the system creates what might be the most robust cross-chain security framework available today. This economic backing ensures that validators have strong incentives to maintain network integrity. Moreover, the cross-chain security module allows for customizable protection levels. Different applications can choose the exact level of cross-chain security they need based on their risk tolerance and operational requirements. This flexibility makes advanced cross-chain security accessible to projects of all sizes. The Future of Cross-Chain Security Looks Bright As blockchain interoperability becomes increasingly crucial, robust cross-chain security solutions like EigenZero will play a vital role. The partnership between EigenCloud and LayerZero demonstrates how collaboration can drive innovation in cross-chain security forward. This development marks a significant milestone in cross-chain security evolution. By moving beyond reputation-based systems to economically-backed validation, EigenZero sets a new standard for cross-chain security that other projects will likely follow. Frequently Asked Questions What is EigenZero’s main innovation in cross-chain security? EigenZero introduces economic collateral as the foundation for cross-chain security, replacing traditional reputation-based systems with tangible financial stakes. How much value is backing the EigenZero security system? The system features $5 million in ZRO tokens as slashable assets, creating substantial economic incentives for proper validation. Can applications customize their security levels? Yes, applications can select their cross-chain security level based on on-chain economic collateral and slashing history rather than validator reputation. What happens if a validator acts maliciously? Malicious actions or validation failures result in slashing of the staked assets, providing strong economic disincentives for bad behavior. How does this improve upon existing cross-chain security? It replaces subjective reputation metrics with objective economic measurements, creating more transparent and reliable cross-chain security. Is this technology available for all blockchain projects? While initially launched through EigenCloud and LayerZero, the cross-chain security framework is designed to be adaptable across various blockchain ecosystems.

Howey Test And Token Taxonomy In Crypto Atkins highlighted the forthcoming consideration of establishing a “token taxonomy” within the Commission, a structured framework rooted in legal rationale to discern between securities and commodities. He emphasized the importance of adhering to “limiting principles” in laws and regulations to ensure a cohesive approach towards crypto asset classification. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point Atkins commended the efforts of Commissioner Hester Peirce, particularly her work in providing a transparent and economically grounded treatment of crypto assets under federal securities laws. The Chair emphasized three key themes in his address: the significance of a clear token taxonomy, the application of the Howey test in recognizing the temporary nature of investment contracts, and the practical implications for innovators, intermediaries, and investors in the evolving crypto landscape. Addressing the prevalent issue of distinguishing between securities and non-securities in the crypto space, Atkins noted that while most tokens are not inherently securities, certain tokens may have been sold within the context of an investment contract during a securities offering. However, he refuted the notion that every token involved in an investment contract perpetually retains its security status, emphasizing the importance of contextual analysis and recognizing the dynamic nature of investment contracts. Atkins Pledges Support For Evolving Digital Asset Laws In his remarks, Atkins also underscored the challenges faced by developers, exchanges, custodians, and investors in navigating the crypto ecosystem, where tokens serve various functions beyond traditional securities. He criticized the previous administration’s “blanket treatment” of all tokens as securities, highlighting the need for a more nuanced and practical approach to regulation to prevent stifling innovation and driving it offshore. Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin In alignment with ongoing legislative efforts, Atkins reassured that the SEC aims to complement, rather than replace, existing crypto legislative initiatives. He emphasized the agency’s commitment to robust fraud enforcement and the development of clearer regulatory guidelines to ensure the safety of US investors. In closing, Atkins emphasized the importance of forward-looking regulatory practices, rejecting a stagnant approach rooted in fear of change. He reiterated the SEC’s commitment to delineating clear boundaries and providing transparent guidance. The statement concluded: That is what Project Crypto is about. That is what the Commission should be about. And that is the commitment I make to you today as Chairman: we will not let fear of the future trap us in the past.

Justice Michael Black found compelling evidence of breach of trust and froze the funds to prevent them from being moved or hidden before the Hong Kong courts determine ownership. In his ruling, Justice Black implied that his freeze order would remain in effect until the HK Proceedings came to a conclusive end. In the HK Proceedings, it is alleged that the invested reserves were fraudulently misappropriated. Black claims it is necessary to consider whether there is a serious issue to be tried or a good arguable case in the HK Proceedings. Techteryx issued the HK Proceedings on December 19, 2023, against FDT (First Digital Trust Limited), Finaport Pte Ltd, Aria Fund (the Fund), and Aria DMCC (DMCC). The proceedings allege that the Fund and DMCC were constructive trustees of the $456 million sent (in six remittances) by FDT and Legacy Trust, both of which were under the control of Mr. Vincent Chok. Techteryx pokes holes in fraudulent conspiracy There are allegedly links between Finaport, FDT, Crossbridge, and Legacy on which Techteryx bases its allegation of fraudulent conspiracy. There are considerable issues regarding why the funds were paid to DMCC rather than the Fund. However, Matthew Brittain, both the managing director of Aria DMCC and the CEO of Aria Fund, previously claimed that FDT (Mr. Chok) ordered the transfers. Mr. Chok denied the allegation. Brittain has also, on several occasions, claimed that the transfers were loans by FDT to DMCC and an investment in DMCC. However, Justice Black said there are anomalies in the documentation regarding the payments. DMCC has been unable to show precisely how the money was spent, what assets were bought, or what became of them. DMCC says this is simply a function of the lapse of time. Meanwhile, Brittain claimed the DMCC payments were FDT loans repaid in specie by the transfer of assets from DMCC to the Fund. He, however, added that FDT’s position in the Fund was regularized by what he called a “Porting” exercise. Techteryx submitted that “Porting” is a fiction first raised in the course of the proceedings to explain away the anomalies. Techteryx also claimed that DMCC’s interest in Tanzanian mining assets and coal reserves was merely an attempt to place the Fund’s assets beyond the reach of enforcement. Justice Black justifies his indefinite freeze order Justice Black asserted that the power to make a freeze order in relation to an anticipated judgment of a foreign court is within the inherent power of the Supreme Court. He explained that when made, the anticipated judgment would be registrable by order of the Supreme Court under the Foreign Judgments Act. Black believes that the making of the order protects a process of restoration and enforcement in the Supreme Court, which is in prospect of being invoked. He added that the same logic applies to the scope of the DIFC (Dubai International Finance Center) Court’s power to issue freezing orders. The DIFC Court has express jurisdiction to recognize and enforce foreign judgements. Techteryx also agrees that there is no reason why the English court should not intervene when a company or its members act in a manner prejudicial to its creditors and in bad faith. In the present case, the wrongdoers should not be allowed to escape punishment, stressed Techteryx. Meanwhile, Justice Black acknowledges that it will be rare for an injunction to be sought in aid of foreign proceedings from the DIFC Courts against a respondent over whom the Court does not have jurisdiction. He added that the jurisdiction of his court to enforce a foreign monetary judgment is succinctly described in the Memorandum, as stated at paragraph 6.4. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Bloomberg reported Thursday that the Tokyo Stock Exchange operator is considering stricter use of its backdoor listing rules and may require fresh audits for companies shifting into large crypto positions. They said no final decisions have been made. The report further said that for two months now, three listed firms paused plans to start buying cryptocurrencies after pushback from JPX. Those companies were told their fundraising could be limited if they pursued a strategy centered on acquiring crypto. According to Bloomberg, Japan Exchange Group (JPX) is weighing tighter rules to curb ""coin-hoarding"" listed companies (DATs) after heavy retail losses. JPX is considering stricter backdoor-listing enforcement and re-audits, has asked three prospective DATs to pause plans, and… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 13, 2025 Crypto-Linked Stocks Lose Momentum, Prompting Closer Scrutiny From Regulators JPX does not have blanket rules against corporate crypto accumulation. A spokesperson reportedly said the bourse is monitoring companies that raise risk and governance concerns, intending to protect shareholders and investors. Shares of crypto-hoarding names have tumbled after surging earlier this year, leaving retail buyers with steep paper losses. Strategy Inc., which built a Bitcoin trove worth about $66b, has seen its stock roughly halve since mid-July. Exchanges across Asia have grown wary. Hong Kong and other regional venues have resisted new digital-asset treasury listings, while Japan now counts 14 public Bitcoin buyers, the most in Asia, according to industry trackers. Backdoor listings typically involve going public via a merger instead of a traditional IPO. JPX already bans such listings and is exploring whether to apply that prohibition to listed companies that pivot their core business to crypto accumulation, the people said. Market Swings Hit Japan’s Bitcoin Treasuries, Raising Red Flags for Regulators Domestic declines have sharpened the debate. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet , Japan’s largest DAT operator, has dropped more than 75% from its mid-June peak after a 420% surge earlier in the year. The company pivoted from hotels in early 2024 and amassed over 30,000 Bitcoin, making it one of the world’s largest public holders. Convano, a nail salon operator that aims to acquire 21,000 Bitcoin, is down about 60% since late August. Pressure is not limited to Bitcoin treasuries. On-chain analysis flagged Evernorth , an XRP-focused vehicle, with about $78m in unrealized losses shortly after building its position. Even established giants like Strategy have been hit by price swings. Hong Kong has tightened listing scrutiny as well. According to reports, HKEX questioned at least five applicants seeking to become core crypto treasuries and reiterated that listed businesses must be viable and sustainable. Its framework requires crypto to be integrated as a genuine operating line while limiting excessive liquid asset holdings.

They will all be operating through smart contracts built on the blockchain.” Tapiero announced that 10T Holdings plans to allocate approximately 20% of its new fund, which is in the process of raising capital through 2026, to companies operating at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain. Tapiero acknowledged that not many companies have yet reached a scaled-growth stage in this field, saying, “In the next five years, this space will become a category unto itself.” Related News: BREAKING: Official Listing Notice Published for XRP Spot ETF, Launch Confirmed for Tomorrow Tapiero painted a cautiously optimistic picture of the crypto market.

Then, I expect a rise towards $180,000, perhaps around next summer.” Tapiero stated that some investors are impatient with the stagnation of the price and that short-term predictions should be avoided: “In my 25 years of experience in traditional markets, I have never seen a market this difficult.

The formation, visible since early spring, has now broken to the upside, coupled with an increase in trading volume. The pattern suggests a potential trend reversal in favor of XRP after months of underperformance against Ethereum. The current trading range sits around 0.0007055 XRP/ETH, reflecting a 6.81% gain at the time of analysis. The technical outlook points toward XRP’s current upward momentum if the breakout holds. The projection area highlighted in the chart extends toward the 0.0012–0.0014 range, suggesting room for further appreciation relative to Ethereum . #XRP will continue to outperform Ethereum in the coming two weeks! https://t.co/oWVaOAOeJQ pic.twitter.com/3YyWBmKxcA — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 10, 2025 Traders Compare Network Performance Following CryptoBull’s post, traders discussed the potential reasons behind XRP’s relative strength. One user argued that Ethereum continues to face congestion issues, while XRP’s design enables faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, giving it a clear efficiency advantage. This sentiment aligns with broader views that XRP’s scalability could attract renewed market attention if liquidity inflows increase in the coming sessions. Market participants are watching closely as Ethereum’s network fees and transaction times fluctuate during periods of higher usage. In contrast, XRP’s consistent transaction speed and low cost make it a more predictable asset for certain types of institutional and retail activity, particularly those focused on remittance and settlement functions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Sentiment Turns Bullish Commenters in the thread expressed optimism about XRP’s short-term prospects. One analyst described the setup as a strong opportunity for 90% gains, while others highlighted the growing confidence surrounding XRP’s relative strength over the next two weeks. Community consensus remains that if current momentum continues, XRP could significantly outperform Ethereum over that period. Near-Term Market Outlook Based on the technical structure and sentiment reflected in CryptoBull’s chart, XRP appears positioned for further gains against Ethereum , provided volume continues to rise and price holds above the breakout level. The recent upward move represents a notable shift in momentum, suggesting that market participants are beginning to reprice XRP’s value relative to Ethereum. XRP’s outperformance is probable in the near term if the breakout sustains and trading activity remains strong. However, if volume fades or price re-enters the prior range, the move could lose momentum. For now, the data and sentiment align: XRP’s chart structure is strengthening, and short-term traders are watching for confirmation of continued relative growth.

Reports have disclosed the measure passed both houses this week and moves quickly to restore pay and services. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert!

The bill covers several full-year appropriations and aims to return back pay to hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or forced to work without pay.

Reports have disclosed Bitcoin climbed back toward the $105,000 area after the breakthrough, while broader crypto tokens also showed gains as traders priced in the reduction of fiscal uncertainty. Short, sharp moves in the market reflected traders unwinding defensive positions. Crypto Reaction In Numbers Bitcoin rose from lows near $99,300 earlier in the week to above $105,000 on news of progress, a move that some outlets measured as a roughly 6.7% uptick over recent sessions. Ethereum recovered toward about $3,600 as investors rotated back into riskier assets. These moves came alongside rallies in stocks and other risk markets. Based on reports from market commentators, the end of the shutdown reduced one layer of macro uncertainty. That made it easier for large funds and ETFs to move money without the risk of sudden policy disruption. Some short-term flows into crypto appear tied to renewed confidence that key infrastructure — like air travel and federal programs — will run normally again.

The buying seen on the reopening was broad, but not unanimous, and many traders are watching whether flows remain steady into year-end.

Key Takeaways: Scammers are exploiting Australia’s ReportCyber platform to impersonate federal police and steal cryptocurrency. Fraudsters use stolen personal data and fake case numbers to make their schemes appear legitimate. The AFP urged citizens to hang up on suspicious calls and confirmed real officers never request crypto access or banking details. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) revealed that scammers are filing false reports through ReportCyber, a platform designed for citizens to report cybercrimes. Using stolen personal data, the fraudsters contact victims pretending to be officers from the AFP, claiming their information is linked to crypto-related investigations. The goal is to trick victims into transferring digital assets into fake “secure” wallets. Scammers Exploit ReportCyber Data to Build Credibility and Pressure Victims According to AFP Detective Superintendent Marie Andersson, the deception works because criminals use legitimate details from the ReportCyber platform to appear credible. “They verify personal information in ways that match common expectations and act quickly to create a sense of urgency,” she said. The AFP-led Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre found that the system’s design, which allows third parties to file reports on behalf of others, has been manipulated to reinforce these scams. Once a false report is submitted, scammers call the victim with a fabricated case reference number, making the fraud look official. In one reported incident, a victim was told their name appeared in a cryptocurrency data breach. The scammer cited a legitimate-looking reference number and then handed the call to an alleged “crypto platform representative” who urged the victim to move funds into a supposed cold wallet for “safekeeping.” The victim grew suspicious and ended the call before transferring any money. Police noted that similar schemes have used spoofed phone numbers mimicking real AFP lines to boost credibility. “Australians should check for warning signs and protect themselves. Real AFP officers will never request access to crypto accounts, seed phrases, or banking information,” Andersson urged citizens. Authorities advised that anyone contacted about a ReportCyber submission they did not make should immediately hang up and call 1300 CYBER1. The AFP emphasized that authentic reports are still crucial for tracking cybercriminals and preventing further scams. Australia Tightens Crypto Oversight as Regulators Target Scams The warning comes amid a broader crackdown on crypto-related fraud across Australia. Last month, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke announced upcoming legislation to regulate crypto ATMs , calling them “high-risk products” tied to money laundering and child exploitation. Meanwhile, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has taken down over 14,000 scam and phishing websites since July 2023, with crypto-related fraud accounting for 20% of the removals. The agency now targets 130 new malicious sites each week, including deceptive social media ads and AI-powered schemes promising passive crypto income. In November, ASIC also introduced temporary class relief for intermediaries distributing stablecoins issued by licensed AFS providers, allowing them to operate without additional licensing until June 2028.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/big-news-for-xrp-holders-heres-the-latest/,"Eleanor Terrett, former Fox Business journalist and host of the Crypto In America podcast, reported that Canary Capital’s long-anticipated XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) has now been declared effective. Terrett revealed that as of 5:30 PM ET on November 12, Nasdaq had certified the listing, officially clearing XRPC for trading at the market open on November 13. Her update follows months of procedural progress that positioned Canary Capital Group LLC at the center of the digital asset market’s growing institutional phase. NEW: As of 5:30 PM ET, @CanaryFunds ’ $XRP ETF is officially effective after @Nasdaq certified the listing, clearing $XRPC for launch tomorrow at market open. pic.twitter.com/h3hxVMDhWP — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 12, 2025 The Path to Approval The journey toward approval began when Canary Capital withdrew the delaying amendment from its S-1 registration statement. That move allowed the firm to initiate the automatic effectiveness countdown under the Securities Act, bypassing the need for a separate SEC declaration of effectiveness. By removing the amendment, Canary signaled readiness to bring its spot XRP ETF to market within a specific time frame unless regulators intervened. The firm followed this with the submission of Form 8-A to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a required filing to register the ETF’s shares for listing on a national securities exchange. The filing indicated Canary’s intention to list on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol XRPC . This progression marked a critical shift from regulatory preparation to market readiness, demonstrating that all major structural components of the ETF were in place. Nasdaq Certification Confirms Listing The next milestone arrived on November 12, 2025, when Nasdaq Regulation issued a certification letter confirming that the exchange had received and approved Canary’s Form 8-A application. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This formal certification represented the final procedural step before the ETF’s launch. Following the complete certification, Nasdaq cleared the product for trading today, November 13, marking the first physically backed XRP ETF on Nasdaq. A New Era for XRP With the launch confirmed, attention now turns to the ETF’s first day of trading and its potential to expand institutional participation in XRP. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg previously predicted that spot XRP ETFs could attract up to $5 billion in inflows within the first month, and his company’s product could play a significant role in reaching that milestone. If trading volumes meet expectations, the launch could strengthen XRP’s position among top digital assets. Market participants are already showing excitement, as XRP is trading at $2.51, up 4.74% from yesterday, and this growth could accelerate as more investors join the ecosystem through the ETF.

54338494,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=859147,1763019000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54338494.jpeg,New $0.035 DeFi Crypto Poised to Explode Past Cardano (ADA),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/new-0-035-defi-crypto-poised-to-explode-past-cardano-ada/,"The market momentum is shifting, and investors are now largely drifting away from slow-growth altcoins in favor of high-growth DeFi crypto projects with real-world utility. Although Cardano (ADA) is still known for its tremendous technological skills, it now looks like it is stuck on price growth for this market cycle; thus, expert traders will continue looking for another investment opportunity with tremendous growth potential. These expert cryptocurrency traders have now been identified with one investment opportunity: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is only worth a mere $0.035. Mutuum Finance’s presale is 90% sold out in Phase 6, with analysts stating that it’s gaining momentum even faster than expected. As soon as this phase concludes, the cost rises, which means those holding out might just miss the opportunity to purchase MUTM at this low cost. This is what’s causing traders to say MUTM is a serious contender to outperform ADA and other older coins, marking it as a DeFi crypto with massive potential. Cardano (ADA) Price Action At present, ADA is ranging between $0.57 and $0.67, with a critical support line firmly in place at $0.52. If ADA can break out above $0.74 effectively, it would lay the groundwork for a probable test at $0.84. However, market sentiments appear to be in a neutral position with ADA’s RSI index stuck closer to 50. Meanwhile, all eyes have been on ADA’s next move to see if bulls can regain market control. Attention is now being drawn to another popular cryptocurrency called Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is 90% sold out in Phase 6 presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves as one of the most watched cryptos today. MUTM recently surpassed $18.7M raised in its presale by more than 18,000 unique investors. At this current moment, Phase 6 is selling MUTM tokens for $0.035. Furthermore, with Phase 7 on the horizon, this price is set to increase by 20% to $0.04. This is a wonderful investment opportunity for interested individuals seeking to invest in MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance is going to be more than just another altcoin due to its emphasis on adoption and is truly the next big crypto before Phase 7. To facilitate easier presale participation for new entrants, Mutuum Finance created a new platform for purchasing MUTM directly with Credit and Debit Cards . Thus, there is no longer any difficulty involved with normal cryptocurrency participation. With such accessibility, MUTM continues to stand out as the DeFi crypto to watch. Full-Featured Lending & Borrowing Protocol The team for Mutuum Finance is moving rapidly towards the launch of their first all-inclusive lending and borrowing platform. This new platform will incorporate smart contracts to facilitate loans and borrowing. The design for the interface will be such that it will be prepared for scaling with a large number of users. The biggest milestone coming in this phase will be the launch of Sepolia testnet, which will enable users to engage with the borrowing and lending system. The aim of the testnet is to focus on performance and security to pave the way for a secure and functional system on launch. Mutuum Finance has managed to draw over 18,000 investors, accumulating more than $18.7 million in presale contributions, with Phase 6 selling out 90% at $0.035. As such, Phase 7 will see the token cost increase to $0.04, and current market conditions present the ideal opportunity for involvement in early-stage growth. Its unique lending mechanism, imminent Sepolia testnet launch, and simplified onboarding process with Credit/Debit Cards makes MUTM both useful in the current state of DeFi crypto and well positioned for upside growth opportunities as the next big crypto in 2025.

Here's the Latest Asian Country,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/more-countries-want-to-include-bitcoin-in-their-strategic-reserves-heres-the-latest-asian-country/,"The Taiwanese Government and the Central Bank have begun exploring the possibility of including Bitcoin among the country's strategic reserve assets. Taiwan Considers Including Bitcoin in Its Strategic Reserves In this context, legal and technical regulations are being prepared to integrate digital assets into national reserve policies. Authorities aim to launch a Bitcoin-backed pilot program in the first phase of the plan. In this pilot, confiscated Bitcoin currently held by the government and awaiting auction will be considered a test reserve position. This could make Taiwan one of the first Asian countries to test Bitcoin directly in strategic reserves. Experts say this step could boost Taiwan's financial innovation capacity and enable the country to take a leading role in digital asset policy. Additionally, it is evaluated that Bitcoin reserves can create currency diversification in the long term and serve as protection against geopolitical risks. The Central Bank of Taiwan reported that the research is still in its early stages, but depending on the results, the possibility of creating an official Bitcoin reserve may be on the agenda. This development indicates that the global trend towards state-level digital asset integration is also gaining momentum in Asia. *This is not investment advice.

Shares rose 11% over the past three months, reaching HK$651 amid strong growth in gaming revenue. The Chinese tech giant is seen as a safer investment amid growing concerns that the AI-driven tech bubble may be overheating, potentially accelerating this year’s $280 billion gain in its market value. According to Google Finance, Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700 HKG) dropped 0.91% to HK$651.00 from the previous close of HK$657.00 on Thursday. The stock moved between HK$645.00 and HK$654.50 during the day, remaining close to the top of its 52-week range of HK$364.80 to HK$683.00. Additionally, Tencent has a market capitalization of HK$5.96 trillion, with an average daily trading volume exceeding 16 million shares. Tencent Holdings shares rise as mobile games grow Tencent Holdings stock has remained relatively stable over the past week, yielding investors a slight profit. Given that Tencent stock has risen 11% over the past three months, market observers are analyzing how these moves fit within the company’s broader growth narrative. Tencent reveals a total shareholder return of 62.38% over the previous year and a share price return of 56%. 25% with a 56.25% this year. According to Simply Wall St., these gains indicate rising trust in the company’s growth story and its ability to handle an altering market environment, even though recent weeks have seen stable trade. According to Sensor Tower’s data, 32 Chinese companies made the short list of the top 100 global mobile game publishers by revenue in October 2025. Collectively, the firms consumed US$2.01 billion, or 35.6% of the total revenue of publishers on the list. In the same period, TENCENT (00700.HK) remained the leading publisher of mobile games worldwide based on revenue. Tencent Holdings has developed a triple-driver model for gaming that includes new game releases, stability of legacy games, and increased momentum overseas. On August 26, Tencent unveiled new games, including Delta Force Fate Trigger, Honour of Kings, World, and Project Spectrum, at gamescom ONL, presented by Geoff Keighley. Innovative operational strategies, such as collaboration with Sanxingdui and offering free, limited-time coupons, boosted users’ engagement in Tencent’s mobile game, Honor of Kings (HoK). Due to increased user engagement, HOK experienced a 32% revenue increase in October. In the last season, “Delta Force” showed strong performance. The HunYuan Game AI model’s advancements in automated scene generation and NPC decision-making intelligence have enhanced the game experience.

Another massive Bitcoin movement has caught the crypto world’s attention. Early Bitcoin investor Owen Gunden just made headlines by depositing a staggering 2,401 BTC worth $244.96 million to the Kraken exchange. This bold move by a seasoned Bitcoin investor raises crucial questions about market direction and investor sentiment. Why Would a Bitcoin Investor Move Such Massive Funds? When a prominent Bitcoin investor transfers substantial amounts to an exchange, the market pays close attention. Exchange deposits typically signal potential selling activity. However, understanding the context behind this Bitcoin investor’s decision requires looking at the bigger picture. This isn’t Gunden’s first major transfer this month. The Bitcoin investor previously deposited 500 BTC on the 8th and 700 BTC on the 11th. These consecutive moves suggest a strategic plan rather than impulsive action. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Markets? The timing of this Bitcoin investor’s activity coincides with interesting market conditions. Large movements often precede significant price action. Here’s what experienced traders watch for: Exchange inflows typically indicate selling pressure Whale movements can signal market tops or bottoms Pattern recognition helps predict future trends Market sentiment often shifts after major transfers This Bitcoin investor now holds 2,499 BTC valued at $258.58 million after these transfers. The remaining balance suggests either partial liquidation or portfolio rebalancing. How Should Crypto Investors Interpret These Signals? While exchange deposits often suggest selling intent, they don’t always lead to immediate market drops. Sometimes, experienced Bitcoin investors use these moves for: Portfolio diversification strategies Taking profits at resistance levels Preparing for other investment opportunities Risk management during volatility The key is watching how the market absorbs these large transfers. If selling occurs gradually, the impact might be minimal. However, rapid liquidation could trigger wider market reactions. What History Tells Us About Bitcoin Investor Behavior Seasoned Bitcoin investors often have different motivations than retail traders. Early adopters like Gunden typically: Make calculated moves based on long-term outlook Consider tax implications and timing Balance profit-taking with continued exposure Influence market psychology through their actions This particular Bitcoin investor’s pattern suggests careful planning rather than panic selling. The staggered deposits indicate methodical execution. Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts Watching major Bitcoin investor activity provides valuable market intelligence. However, it’s crucial to remember that individual moves don’t necessarily dictate market direction. The crypto ecosystem has matured significantly, with institutional players now providing substantial liquidity. For everyday investors, the lesson is clear: understand whale movements but don’t overreact. Market fundamentals, adoption rates, and macroeconomic factors ultimately drive long-term Bitcoin value. Frequently Asked Questions Why do investors move Bitcoin to exchanges? Investors typically transfer Bitcoin to exchanges for selling, trading, or using exchange-specific services like lending or staking. Does exchange deposit always mean selling? Not necessarily. While often associated with selling, investors might transfer funds for other purposes like security changes or preparing for future transactions. How much Bitcoin does Owen Gunden still hold? After these transfers, Gunden maintains 2,499 BTC valued at approximately $258.58 million. Should I worry when whales move Bitcoin? While worth monitoring, individual whale movements shouldn’t dictate your investment strategy. Focus on broader market trends and fundamentals. How can I track major Bitcoin movements? Use blockchain explorers and on-chain analysis tools to monitor large transactions and wallet activities. What’s the typical market impact of large transfers? Impact varies based on market conditions, transfer size, and whether selling actually occurs. Sometimes markets absorb large movements with minimal effect. Found this analysis helpful?

According to Khuda, India’s construction plans are well underway, and the country’s 1.5 billion population, with a digitally active younger generation, presents strong potential for data center growth. His announcement comes shortly after AirTrunk closed a AU$16 billion refinancing deal in August to build or maintain centers in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. CEO Khuda asserts there’s enough demand in Asia for his firm and its rivals Speaking at a Forbes Conference in Sydney on Thursday, CEO Khuda described AI investments as “the single-biggest gold rush in human history.” He further pointed out, citing his firm’s construction project in India, Asia’s appetite for data centers is large enough to accommodate both AirTrunk and its competitors. He remarked, “It’s not like there’s only one winner who will take home everything.” Nonetheless, he insisted that the data center industry still needs hundreds of billions of dollars to meet its expansion targets. Completed in 2024, the deal between Blackstone and AirTrunk became the private equity firm’s largest investment in the Asia-Pacific region and one of the largest global digital infrastructure acquisitions to date. However, recently Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman cast a shadow on AI expansion plans, warning that companies might encounter electricity shortages. The investment company is a major investor in India, directing almost 40% of its $50 billion in India investments to Maharashtra. The firm has also made significant investments in Indian real estate, committing over $20 billion across top cities, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, NCR, Chennai, and Kolkata. AirTrunk has an interest in a data center project in Australia and is working with Humain in Saudi Arabia Recently, AirTrunk was announced as the prospective buyer for a 1 GW data center campus in Western Sydney, Australia. The firm intends to buy the site if planning permission is granted for the data center project. So far, the project is expected to cost AU$5 billion ($3.3 billion) to establish a 1 GW data campus with six four-story buildings covering 400,000 sqm (4.3 million sq ft) and 24 halls ranging from 600MW to 1 GW. Moreover, in October, Blackstone finalized a $3 billion agreement to develop data centers with Humain, Saudi Arabia’s state-backed AI firm. AirTrunk and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board planned to work with Humain to fund, build, and operate facilities for the computer systems and storage that power AI models in Saudi Arabia. Humain’s CEO, Tareq Amin, even hinted they had more data center expansion plans beyond the $3 billion investment deal. The company’s first data centers in Saudi Arabia are already under construction and are scheduled to launch early next year. The company is procuring essential semiconductors from US chipmakers, including Nvidia , for AI operations. Overall, Tareq aims to expand data center capacity by 1.9GW by 2030. However, details about campus locations, total capacity, and which chips will be chosen have yet to be announced. AirTrunk’s expansions in India, Australia, and Saudi Arabia could help alter the digital infrastructure map across Asia and the Middle East. Offering AI, cloud data processing, and scale capacity through massive facilities, the company positions itself as a cornerstone in the global AI ecosystem. Although hurdles such as energy supply, regulatory approval, and competition remain, investors are obviously confident that long-term growth is ahead. The market, as Khuda alluded to, is large and diverse enough to support more than one player. AirTrunk’s aggressive expansion could serve not just the demand but also establish a new level for hyperscale data center operations. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Tuần vừa qua là minh chứng rõ ràng: dù Bitcoin, Ethereum và nhiều dự án hàng đầu gần như đi ngang, một số token mới lại ghi nhận mức tăng mạnh. Ví dụ, Avici – một dự án trên Solana – đã tăng 127% trong tuần này sau khi hoàn tất presale vào giữa tháng 10. Một token khác là Umbra cũng tăng 58% sau đợt presale diễn ra trong tháng 10. Điều này cho thấy dù bề ngoài thị trường có vẻ im ắng, các đội ngũ phát triển vẫn liên tục ra mắt những dự án mới đầy tiềm năng – và những nhà đầu tư vào sớm có thể thu được lợi nhuận đáng kể. Khi thị trường chung lấy lại động lực, những khoản sinh lời này có thể tiếp tục nhân lên. Với tiêu chí tập trung vào use case rõ ràng , cộng đồng hỗ trợ mạnh , và tiện ích token thực sự , dưới đây là 5 dự án presale hàng đầu đáng chú ý trong tháng này. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper đang xây dựng một Bitcoin Layer-2 để giải quyết vấn đề tốc độ và khả năng mở rộng của mạng lưới hiện tại. Dự án vận hành trên Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), cho phép xử lý hàng nghìn giao dịch mỗi giây và hỗ trợ smart contract – một bước tiến lớn so với khả năng 7 TPS của Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper cũng ứng dụng ZK-rollups để tổng hợp giao dịch và đưa trở lại Bitcoin Layer-1 nhằm đảm bảo tính bảo mật và thanh khoản của hệ thống. Từ góc độ use case, đây là một trong những hướng tiếp cận mang tính đổi mới rõ nét. Cộng đồng cũng đang ủng hộ mạnh mẽ: presale đã huy động gần 27 triệu USD. Ngoài ra, tokenomics của Bitcoin Hyper khá vững chắc. HYPER sẽ được dùng cho phí gas, quản trị và staking, tạo động lực nhu cầu bền vững. Điều này cho thấy Bitcoin Hyper có thể trở thành một trong những cơ hội triển vọng nhất thị trường hiện tại. Truy cập Bitcoin Hyper Best Wallet Token Đối với những nhà đầu tư muốn một presale có thời gian niêm yết nhanh, Best Wallet Token là lựa chọn nổi bật khi dự kiến lên sàn trong ba tuần tới. Đây là token tiện ích của Best Wallet – ví Web3 đa chuỗi hỗ trợ swap, giao dịch futures, staking, tham gia presale và chi tiêu crypto chỉ trong một ứng dụng. Dự án đang tạo dấu ấn rõ rệt trong lĩnh vực ví tiền điện tử nhờ hệ sinh thái toàn diện hơn nhiều so với những cái tên hàng đầu hiện nay như MetaMask hay Phantom. Presale đã huy động gần 17 triệu USD và sẽ kết thúc trong 16 ngày nữa. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) mang lại các quyền lợi như giảm phí giao dịch, APY staking cao hơn, quyền quản trị và quyền truy cập ưu đãi presale của đối tác. Nếu Best Wallet thu hút được lượng người dùng lớn, nhu cầu đối với BEST có thể tăng mạnh.

According to a press statement from AFP officials, the said criminals are using stolen personal information and impersonating law enforcement officers to steal funds from digital wallets. The “social engineers” steal private details like email addresses and phone numbers, then submit fraudulent reports through ReportCyber, the government’s official cybercrime reporting tool. Once potential victims are identified, the criminals contact them directly, claiming to be AFP officers investigating a cybercrime case. “The scammers verify personal information in ways that match common expectations and act quickly to create a sense of urgency,” AFP Detective Superintendent Marie Andersson said. Australian fraudsters use police identities to steal crypto One documented case by the AFP discusses how a target received a call from an individual claiming to be from the agency. The caller said someone had been arrested over the weekend and that the victim had been implicated in a crypto-related data breach. The impostor provided an official-looking reference number linked to a supposed ReportCyber submission to sift away any doubt the victim had about the ruse. They were then instructed to access the ReportCyber portal and enter their email address to “verify” the report. A second caller, posing as a representative from the victim’s crypto platform, repeated the reference number to convince the individual of the call’s authenticity. The scammer then urged the target to transfer funds from their platform wallet to a so-called “Cold Storage” account. Fortunately, the victim grew suspicious and ended the call before any funds were lost. “We encourage Australians to adopt necessary safety measures online and take a moment to stop their scroll, check for warning signs of scams, and protect themselves from cybercrime,” Andersson said. She doubled down on the fact that legitimate law enforcement officers will never request access to cryptocurrency wallets, bank accounts, seed phrases, or other financial information. Victims or those who suspect they are being targeted should immediately terminate calls and notify ReportCyber or call 1300CYBER1 (1300 292 371). Australian government mount defences to prevent crypto scams In October, Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs Tony Burke said he plans to give AUSTRAC, the country’s anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financial regulator, powers to restrict or prohibit high-risk products, services, or delivery channels, including crypto ATMs. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said these powers would be used immediately. “Having a power like this enables the CEO to adapt to the evolving risk environment in more responsive ways,” he told local news publications in a press briefing. Thomas noted that when the Crypto Taskforce was established last year, Australia had 1,200 bitcoin ATMs, but the number has now increased to 2,000. AUSTRAC’s analysis showed roughly 150,000 transactions per year at these machines, totaling $275 million. A sample of the 90 most active crypto ATM users found that 85% had fallen victim to scams. Individuals aged 50 to 70 accounted for nearly 72% of all crypto ATM transactions. Australians lost $3 million to crypto ATM scams in the 12 months ending January, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre. Among 150 reported incidents, the most common scams involved fraudulent investment schemes, extortion emails, and romance scams. The elderly are targets for social engineering scams AFP Assistant Commissioner Richard Chin told ABC News that Australia is a prime target due to high levels of household wealth and savings. “This is organised cybercrime. They’re incredibly well-drilled when it comes to their scripts and how they manipulate us and exploit our generosity,” Chin said. “I’m aware of a case involving an elderly gentleman caught up in a romance scam. He was convinced to part with $1.4 million.” Officials are asking all Australians to be cautious online, especially when interacting with unfamiliar contacts who insist they represent law enforcement or financial institutions. Even with legitimate platforms such as ReportCyber, criminals can manipulate information to appear credible and convince victims to share data or send funds in urgency. “Every cybercrime report can help police track criminals, assist in building intelligence on emerging cyber threats, and prevent other people from being targeted,” Andersson concluded in the recent AFP statement.

The Nasdaq-listed company (BTM) revealed plans to establish operations in the city, marking its debut in the Asian market. The expansion represents a calculated move into a jurisdiction with growing cryptocurrency adoption. Bitcoin Depot aims to secure a position among Hong Kong's top five Bitcoin ATM operators. The company identified the region's demand for accessible cash-to-crypto services as a primary driver for the expansion. Scott Buchana, President and Chief Operating Officer of Bitcoin Depot, emphasized Hong Kong's emerging status in the digital asset sector. He cited the city's regulatory environment, market demand, and overall momentum as key factors in the decision. Regulatory Environment and Market Position Hong Kong requires Bitcoin ATM operators to secure a Money Service Operator license from the Customs and Excise Department. This licensing ensures legal compliance for cash-to-crypto transaction services. Current data from Coin ATM Radar indicates 223 Bitcoin ATMs operate within the city. The city has positioned itself as a digital asset hub distinct from mainland China's restrictive stance. Hong Kong's regulatory framework provides clearer guidelines for cryptocurrency businesses. This approach has attracted international firms seeking a regulated Asian market entry point. Franklin Templeton's recent launch of a tokenized US dollar money market fund demonstrates Hong Kong's innovation trajectory. The November debut marked the territory's first fully onchain fund integrating issuance, distribution, and servicing for professional investors. Global Bitcoin ATM Landscape Bitcoin ATMs allow users to buy or sell Bitcoin using cash or debit cards at physical kiosks. The global network has expanded significantly since January 2021. Total installations have grown 177% to reach 39,469 machines worldwide. The United States dominates the market with 30,869 Bitcoin kiosks. Canada holds the second position. Australia has experienced remarkable growth, jumping from 21 machines in 2021 to 2,019 currently. This surge places Australia as the third-largest market globally. Growth patterns vary significantly across regions. Established markets show steady expansion while emerging markets demonstrate rapid adoption rates. Bitcoin Depot's entry into Hong Kong reflects this broader trend toward international diversification. Regulatory Challenges in Key Markets Bitcoin ATMs face increasing scrutiny in major markets. The FBI reported nearly 11,000 fraud complaints related to crypto kiosks in 2024. These incidents involved losses exceeding $246 million. The agency warned about the potential for criminal exploitation of these machines . Several US cities have implemented outright bans on Bitcoin ATMs . Multiple states are advancing legislation to restrict operations. These measures respond to concerns about fraud, money laundering, and consumer protection. Australia confronts similar regulatory debates. Tony Burke, Minister for Cybersecurity and Home Affairs, addressed the issue in November. He clarified that the government does not advocate for a complete ban on crypto ATMs. However, new legislation would grant the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre authority to impose restrictions or bans if necessary.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-13 07:55:22

The asset has remained relatively flat on a daily scale after a minor decline and subsequent recovery, and is down slightly for the week. Analysts are watching several key technical levels, as the current market structure suggests that Bitcoin may be nearing an important support zone. 66-Week EMA and $94K Level in Focus EGRAG CRYPTO shared an updated long-term chart showing Bitcoin’s price approaching the 66-week exponential moving average (EMA), currently aligning near the $94,000 zone. This level also coincides with an unfilled CME futures gap. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X In past cycles, BTC has often touched or moved slightly below this EMA before beginning major rallies. Referring to a possible drop toward the CME gap before a reversal, EGRAG said, “The Bears may have one last dance.” He has been tracking this setup since September 30, calling the 66W EMA a key reference point. According to their view, this could mark the end of the current bearish phase and the start of the next strong move upward. In addition, Ash Crypto noted that a death cross may form soon, as the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is nearing a crossover below the 200-day SMA. Historically, previous death crosses have been followed by local bottoms within days, often leading to strong rallies. Bitcoin is now sitting just below both averages. If the pattern repeats, this could mark another local bottom. “The last three death crosses marked the bottom within a week,” Ash wrote. Bitcoin Stalls at Key Levels Analyst Ali Martinez shared a separate chart suggesting Bitcoin could be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern. The neckline support is near $100,000. A move up toward $112,000 could complete the right shoulder, followed by a potential breakdown. If the neckline breaks, the projected move could reach $83,000. However, the right shoulder is still forming, and no breakdown has occurred. Bitcoin $BTC could be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern! A rebound to $112,000 might form the right shoulder before a move to the $100,000 neckline, potentially leading to a breakdown to $83,000. pic.twitter.com/EhGBHtuMbE — Ali (@ali_charts) November 13, 2025 According to CRYPTOWZRD, Bitcoin’s daily chart closed slightly bearish. The current range sits between $100,000 and $107,200. A move above $104,300 could open the way to the upper band of that range, while a rejection could send the price toward $100,000 or lower. Volatility has increased during the US trading session, with little clear direction in the short term. Miner hash rate momentum remains strong, and whale inflows have slowed , indicating that heavy selling may have cooled. Still, many traders are staying cautious until the price breaks clearly out of the current zone.

Circle’s Financial Disclosures According to the financial disclosures made public by the firm on Wednesday, Circle’s Reserve Income surged to $711 million, marking a substantial 60% year-over-year increase, primarily fueled by a 97% surge in the average USDC in circulation. Furthermore, the financial report revealed that “other revenue” climbed to $29 million, exhibiting a notable $28 million increase year-over-year, on the heels of continuous growth in subscription and services revenue, alongside transaction revenue. On the expenditure front, total distribution, transaction, and other costs escalated to $448 million, marking a 74% year-over-year increase. This rise was predominantly driven by amplified distribution payments, reflecting higher USDC circulation balances and the growth in Coinbase’s average on-platform holdings of USDC. Operating Expenses soared to $211 million, increasing by 70% year-over-year, primarily due to elevated compensation expenses, including $59 million allocated to stock-based compensation expenses in Q3. The report also highlighted that net income surged to $214 million, marking a 202% year-over-year increase. This figure included an income tax benefit of $61 million attributable to stock-based compensation expense, research and development tax credits, and the impact of recently enacted US tax legislation . Adjusted EBITDA also experienced a significant uptick, reaching $166 million, reflecting a 78% year-over-year increase driven by revenue growth from higher USDC in circulation and the inherent operating leverage in Circle’s business model. Native Token Launch On Arc Network Earlier this year, Circle unveiled Arc, a public blockchain tailored for stablecoin transactions, aimed at bolstering cross-border settlements, merchant payments, and decentralized finance integrations. Arc, designed as the Circle Layer-1 (L1) blockchain, is geared towards developers and companies seeking to introduce more economic activity on-chain with programmable financial infrastructure for the global economy. Looking ahead, the stablecoin issuer said it is contemplating the launch of a native token on the Arc network, an initiative envisioned to enhance network participation, drive adoption, align the interests of Arc stakeholders, and bolster the long-term growth and success of the Arc network. Jeremy Allaire , Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman at Circle, expressed enthusiasm about the company’s progress, stating: Circle continued to see accelerating adoption of USDC and our platform in the third quarter as we build the new Economic OS for the internet… With growing circulation, accelerating commercial partnerships and expanding collaboration across industries, we’re proud of the tangible progress toward a more open and efficient global financial system. The firm’s stock, CRCL, which launched earlier this year and trades on the US stock market, is currently trading at $91.57. This represents a notable 7% drop compared to Monday’s trading session.

Chainlink Has Been Trading Inside A Triangle Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared about a pattern forming in the 1-week price of Chainlink. The pattern is a Triangle from TA, which is a type of consolidation channel that appears whenever an asset’s price trades between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Arguably Undervalued,” Says Analytics Firm: Here’s Why Like other consolidation patterns in TA, the upper level of a Triangle is a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. Also, a break out of either of these boundaries can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. There are a few different types of triangles, based on the orientation of the trendlines with respect to the graph axes. The “Ascending Triangle” forms when the upper line is parallel to the time-axis. As the price moves through this pattern, its range shrinks in an upward manner. Similarly, the price moving down as it goes deeper into the triangle results in a “Descending Triangle.” When the range shrinks in a manner where there is no bias attached to any particular side, the Triangle formed is called a “Symmetrical Triangle.” The two trendlines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite angle in this case. In the case of the current Chainlink Triangle, none of these cases fit exactly, as the trendlines are uneven. As the chart shared by Martinez shows, LINK’s Triangle lies somewhere between the Symmetrical and Ascending types. As displayed in the above graph, the 1-week price of Chainlink bounced down from the resistance level of this Triangle earlier in the year and has since been approaching a retest of the support line. “The range between $13 and $26 is a no-trade zone for Chainlink $LINK,” noted the analyst. $13 and $26 here naturally correspond to the levels where the lower and upper levels are roughly located right now. “The next major move will come once price breaks out of this range,” explained Martinez. Generally, Triangle breakouts become more likely to occur the closer the price gets to the end of the pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Demand Growing For First Time Since Early October: CryptoQuant Head This is because the asset’s range narrows as it approaches the Triangle’s apex. The tight consolidation makes retests more probable to occur, and so, the chances of one of the levels not holding up also rise. It now remains to be seen when Chainlink will finally break out of its consolidation channel, and whether a big move would follow. LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $15, down almost 4% over the last 24 hours.

POPCAT Faces 43% Drop Following Manipulative Scheme According to a detailed analysis of the situation by DeFi researcher Hanzo on social media site X (previously Twitter), an unknown trader executed a well-coordinated strategy approximately 13 hours prior to the market disruption. The trader withdrew $3 million in USDC from the OKX exchange and distributed the funds across 19 different wallets on Hyperliquid. Subsequently, they initiated sizable long positions on POPCAT, accumulating total exposure estimated between $20 million and $30 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Out In 300 Days: Top Expert Forecasts $38,000 To $50,000 Price Point To create an illusion of demand for the memecoin, the trader placed a massive buy wall at the price point of $0.21, with orders totaling $30 million lined up on the order book. This artificial façade of high buying interest successfully attracted real traders, prompting them to jump on the bandwagon and increase their own buying activity. However, the situation took a swift turn when the trader removed the buy wall without warning, leading to an instantaneous collapse in the price of POPCAT. This shift resulted in the liquidation of all the long positions taken by traders. The unknown trader lost their $3 million collateral, while Hyperliquid’s HLP system automatically absorbed the open positions. This action triggered an additional loss of approximately $4.9 million to the HLP, exacerbating a broader market selloff across the token. Hyperliquid Faces Third Major Disruption This Year In the wake of the incident, the Hyperliquid team took emergency measures to stabilize the market and close any remaining exposures. Shortly after, the platform paused its Arbitrum (ARB) bridge, although it continued processing deposits and withdrawals normally. The community has expressed skepticism regarding the circumstances surrounding this incident, with many suggesting it may not have been a random liquidation. Instead, some believe the event could resemble a deliberate stress test or an attack aimed at destabilizing Hyperliquid’s liquidity system. Some contend that the rapid loss of millions in such a short time frame seems too calculated to be merely coincidental. Related Reading: China’s Cybersecurity Agency Alleges US Government Stole $13 Billion In Bitcoin This incident marks the third major market disruption on Hyperliquid in 2025, raising serious questions about the exchange’s approach to handling liquidity concentration and its systemic risk management practices, as noted by Hanzo in his analysis. Following the manipulation, the POPCAT memecoin saw a steep decline of approximately 43%, dropping from $0.21 to $0.12, with total liquidations reaching around $63 million. The decentralized exchange’s native token, HYPE, also declined significantly following the event. According to CoinGecko data, it is currently trading at $38.25, which is a 7% decrease on the weekly timeframe.

His analysis suggests that the current phase is a preparatory stage before the next substantial upward move. #XRP – Weakness? Or Just Testing the Faith of Bulls? Lately, I’ve seen many #XRP Bulls turning #Bearish , frustrated by the sideways chop and the boring price action. They say things like “I see weakness on the HTF.” Let me tell you what I see ‍ : I see traders… pic.twitter.com/5WTibse9r7 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 11, 2025 Historical Parallels and Price Patterns In his latest chart analysis, Egrag Crypto highlights two distinct historical surges in XRP’s price action, referring to them as the “Blue” and “Green” phases. These periods correspond to the explosive rallies seen in 2017 and 2021, both of which occurred after extended periods of consolidation. The chart he shared indicates that XRP is once again at a similar structural point, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern that appears ready to break out. Egrag Crypto identifies Fibonacci retracement levels as crucial indicators, suggesting potential targets ranging from $10 to $37. His technical framework relies on recurring historical patterns, which he argues are now aligning once again. Psychological Pressure and Market Sentiment Egrag Crypto acknowledged that the market’s current stagnation has led many bullish traders to question their positions. He criticized what he described as premature pessimism from participants frustrated with XRP’s pace of movement. According to the analyst, many traders are reacting emotionally rather than relying on objective data. Some are opting to sell due to impatience or perceived weakness. He maintains that fear-driven decisions often precede strong rebounds. He references previous market cycles where XRP’s major rallies followed periods of apathy and disbelief among investors. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expectations for the Coming Weeks Egrag’s analysis concludes that XRP is nearing the end of its consolidation phase and that historical data support the likelihood of a breakout within the next four to six weeks. The accompanying chart illustrates this by marking a narrowing price structure labeled “Zooming In,” indicating compression before expansion. Should XRP replicate past behavior, the projected move could be substantial. While he does not guarantee specific price levels, his tone remains resolute. Egrag Crypto’s forecast reflects a continuation of his long-term bullish stance, built on pattern repetition and market psychology. If XRP follows historical precedent, the coming weeks may indeed prove decisive for the asset’s next major move.

Key Takeaways: Taiwan’s central bank and Executive Yuan are evaluating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Legislator Dr. Ju-chun Ko argues that Bitcoin could diversify Taiwan’s reserves and reduce reliance on the US dollar. The plan mirrors global trends, with countries like the US, El Salvador, and Argentina integrating Bitcoin into national or fiscal strategies. The initiative, spearheaded by legislator Dr. Ju-chun Ko and backed by Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin infrastructure firm JAN3, marks one of Asia’s most significant steps toward sovereign Bitcoin adoption. JAN3 confirmed the development following growing debates within Taiwan’s legislature over reducing dependence on traditional reserve assets, according to a report by Bitcoin Magazine . Taiwan Lawmaker Cites Dollar Dependence in Push for Bitcoin Reserves Dr. Ko has been vocal about the risks of overreliance on the US dollar and the country’s need for diversified financial safeguards. Speaking earlier this year, he urged the central bank to consider Bitcoin’s inclusion in national reserves, citing global inflation, rising geopolitical tension, and the volatility of the New Taiwan Dollar. The local currency has fluctuated as much as 5% in a single trading day, prompting calls for alternative hedging mechanisms. Taiwan currently holds approximately 423 metric tonnes of gold and $577 billion in foreign exchange reserves, with around 92% invested in US Treasury bonds. Dr. Ko clarified that Bitcoin would not replace these traditional holdings but serve as a complementary asset to strengthen the country’s financial resilience through diversification. “Bitcoin offers a unique hedge due to its decentralized and fixed-supply nature,” Ko told lawmakers, referencing its independence from monetary policy and foreign influence. JUST IN: Taiwan Congress Legislator announces its central bank has committed to studying "" #Bitcoin as strategic reserve"" They also committed to piloting a BTC treasury pic.twitter.com/KvbbkBY3Y4 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 12, 2025 Global precedents appear to support Ko’s proposal. In March 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, absorbing roughly $17 billion worth of forfeited BTC. Similarly, countries such as El Salvador and Argentina have introduced frameworks to integrate Bitcoin into their fiscal or reserve strategies, highlighting its utility against inflation and banking instability. Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has already taken a progressive stance toward digital assets, allowing professional investors to buy foreign Bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since 2024. While the proposal has yet to be enacted, the central bank is expected to conduct feasibility studies and initiate pilot programs with seized Bitcoin before broader adoption. Taiwan Uncovers $75M Crypto Laundering Ring In August, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted 14 individuals in the nation’s largest crypto money-laundering case , exposing a NT$2.3 billion ($75 million) fraud that deceived over 1,500 victims through fake crypto exchange franchises. The operation, led by Shi Qiren, ran more than 40 storefronts under names like “CoinW” and “BiXiang Technology,” posing as licensed exchanges while secretly funneling investor funds into overseas crypto accounts. Authorities seized cash, crypto, and luxury assets worth over NT$100 million, while Shi faces up to 25 years in prison for fraud, money laundering, and organized crime. The group’s success hinged on exploiting regulatory blind spots in Taiwan’s crypto oversight. By claiming false approval from the Financial Supervisory Commission, the network built investor trust, collected hefty franchise fees, and used “deposit machines” to mimic legitimate exchange operations. Prosecutors described the scheme as “systematic fraud” that leveraged Taiwan’s crypto curiosity and weak enforcement.

This event could set the stage for a significant conflict between new institutional demand and potential selling pressure from existing large holders. A New Chapter for XRP The financial vehicle, called the Canary XRP ETF and trading under the ticker symbol XRPC, will provide investors with a traditional, regulated pathway to gain exposure to Ripple’s cross-border token without the need to manage private keys. The product is structured under the Securities Act of 1933, similar to recently launched ETFs for Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR). The final steps for the launch were confirmed on November 12, when Nasdaq published the official listing notice. ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and Nate Geraci highlighted the significance of filing a Form 8-A, which automatically made the registration effective, clearing the last compliance hurdle. Meanwhile, fresh legislative developments may provide a regulatory tailwind for the asset, as a new bipartisan discussion draft from the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, released on November 10, is proposing to formally classify cryptocurrencies like XRP as commodities under CFTC oversight. This would codify the legal clarity Ripple gained from its 2023 court decision and solidify XRP’s status as separate from securities. New Money vs. Old Money While the ETF introduction is a powerful fundamental catalyst, a detailed analysis from CryptoOnchain presents a starkly cautionary picture that is central to the day’s narrative. According to the market watcher, the 7-day moving average of XRP’s Exchange Netflow into Binance has turned positive, reaching a value of +$10.75 million. In their report, CryptoOnchain stated directly: “This metric typically indicates that large holders, or ‘whales,’ are moving their assets onto the largest exchange, likely in preparation to sell into the anticipated strength.” They laid out two possible outcomes: that the excitement and wave of new investment via the ETF could absorb any selling pressure, sparking a massive rally, or long-term investors might view this liquidity event as an excellent opportunity for an exit, which could lead to intense volatility and a potential bull trap. Further, the expert concluded by emphasizing that the initial reaction on Thursday will be pivotal: “The first trading session will be critical. Traders should closely monitor trading volume and price action at key resistance levels to see which force prevails. Extreme volatility is almost a certainty.” At the time of writing, the world’s fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap was trading near $2.50, having risen by about 5% in the last 24 hours and 8% over the week, according to CoinGecko. However, the token remains 31% below its July high of $3.65, even though it still boasts a 278% yearly gain.

The recovery has led to the introduction of a certain amount of optimism in the crypto market but analysts caution that there is still a possibility that the major cryptocurrency is not out of the woods just yet. The technical milestones are also huge contributions such as the Volume Weighted Average Price and the latest 50 week moving average are also very essential. This stage of re-expressing the market, with Bitcoin balancing the situation, is a strategic point that the investors can decide on prospective assets that can be maximally developed.

Bitcoin is having a hard time finding a way forward and other top cryptocurrencies are entering with good growth patterns and new systems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): An elite DeFi Investment Prospect As the market examines the next move, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the probable candidates within the group of the highest number of crypto to buy. It is an outstanding DeFi crypto project, and this can be attributed to the fact that it has continued to record strong presale momentum. It has already raised an investment of $18,700,000 and this is a large market trust, through a swelling community of 18,000 token owners. In addition to this, the MUTM token is in the Phase 6 that currently costs $0.035. This stage passed over more than 90% of the allocated tokens at this price. Phase 7 will entail an increment of about 20% to $0.040. It is also estimated that the investors who will buy at the current rate will gain a growth of more than 400% immediately the token is launched at a rate of $0.06. The project facilitates constant communication with its 24 hours innovative leader board. It is an active dashboard that puts the names of top 50 holders, and the one who has the first position of the day takes a bonus of $500 MUTM, provided that he or she does at least one transaction throughout that day. Regular participation is gauged by the fact that the leaderboard is reset daily at 00:00 UTC. In addition, Mutuum Finance has also contributed to a higher accessibility because it enables people to buy MUTM tokens using the card without any limitations and simplified the purchasing process. The project is as well giving huge money away comprising a $100,000 reward where ten winners of the project shall be given $10,000 in MUTM . This project will be an inducement to its original investors and enhance the community development. To people thinking about the crypto buy now, Mutuum Finance is a proposal with multifaceted opportunities of short term benefits of presale and long term architecture. The combination of near complete presale stage, the systematic reward mechanism and the protocol rollout make a staggering investment thesis. Mutuum Finance is almost a no brainer investment choice because, on the short run, it guarantees significantly higher returns than available on presale, and, on the long run, the values of the ecosystem are so high that it makes it one of the best crypto to invest in before another price rise takes place in the future.

Amidst widespread fear and uncertainty, discerning buyers see potential. This article reveals four coins poised for growth that are catching the eye of the smart money. Discover the digital assets being accumulated right under the noses of hesitant retail traders. Raydium Shows Potential Despite Recent Price Dip Source: tradingview Raydium (RAY) sees an uptick in its short-term outlook despite a rough month. It currently trades between $1.26 and $1.70, reflecting a slight improvement over the week. The first resistance point sits at $1.90, and breaking this could mean a rise of up to 12%. Another resistance level at $2.34 suggests a potential boost of over 35% if reached. With an RSI of about 56 and some technical indicators signaling strength, there's optimism in the air. Still, the coin battles the shadow of a months-long downward trend, as it lost more than half its value over the last six months. Nevertheless, there seems to be room for a comeback. Ethena's Bumpy Road: What Lies Ahead for ENA's Price? Source: tradingview Ethena (ENA) is currently trading between twenty-nine and thirty-seven cents. Despite experiencing a slight drop in the past week, its one-month decline has been sharper, over thirty percent. The coin is hovering around its simple moving averages, indicating a period of consolidation. The nearest resistance is at forty-one cents. A move above this could see ENA aiming for forty-eight cents, marking more than a thirty percent rise from the lower end of the current range. However, support is at twenty-five cents, offering some cushion against further dips. The market’s mixed signals hint at potential growth, but only time will tell if ENA can break through these critical levels. Hedera (HBAR) Shows Stability with Room for Growth Source: tradingview Hedera (HBAR) is currently priced between 15.8 and 19.5 cents. The coin is finding support around 13.9 cents, while resistance sits at 21.4 cents. If HBAR breaks through the resistance, it might aim for around 25.2 cents, marking a potential climb of over 25%. Recent trends show a slight rise of just over 2% last week, though it’s down almost 8% over the past month. With the RSI near neutral at 51.48, it suggests neither overselling nor overbuying. This stability hints at a balanced market sentiment, providing room for growth if momentum builds. Pi Network's Price Dances in a Tight Range, Eyes on Possible Breakout Source: tradingview Pi Network's token , PI, currently oscillates between 20 to 25 cents. It clings to a steady path, facing a ceiling around 28 cents. Hitting this could lead it to soar toward the next barrier at 32 cents. A rise to the second level would mean roughly a 28% increase from its current position. But caution is key, as the coin's value has plummeted by around 69% over six months. The RSI stands neutral, hinting at a balanced market. Watchers speculate if PI can gather steam and clear these hurdles for a bullish run. Conclusion Smart investors are quietly buying RAY, ENA, HBAR, and PI as others pull back. This trend indicates strong confidence in the future potential of these coins. The accumulation by experienced traders suggests favorable long-term prospects. However, contrasting behaviors between experienced investors and the general market hint at differing perceptions of risk versus opportunity. The ongoing buy signals for these coins might reflect underlying strengths. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Machine Learning Algorithm Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-all-time-high/,"The Shiba Inu price and its trajectory over the last few months have been a source of growing concerns for SHIB investors as the meme coin has failed to secure any meaningful recovery. Despite the Bitcoin price rallying, Shiba Inu has remained quite muted, failing to reach new all-time highs through the bull rally. Therefore, with only two months left in the year 2025, the question remains as to whether the Shiba Inu price can still rally to new all-time highs. Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Shiba Inu Price Trajectory The machine learning algorithm at the Coincodex website has shown a trajectory for the Shiba Inu price that suggests that the meme coin is destined for more sideways action this year. The prediction for the new year is that the meme coin will continue to trade in a very tight range. Related Reading: Institutions Have Been Buying Solana Every Day For 2 Weeks, Is $300 Possible? Even with the Shiba Inu price currently trending more than 88% below its all-time high from 2021, the machine learning algorithm does not see it bouncing anytime soon. For the rest of the year, the cryptocurrency is expected to trade under $0.000012. This puts it in the tight range of $0.00001-$0.000012. Interestingly, though, the same way the machine learning algorithm has predicted no increase, there is no expectation of a decline. The trajectory of the SHIB price over the next two months shows an almost straight line, and then continues into the year 2026 in the same manner. When Will SHIB Hit New All-Time Highs? According to the machine learning algorithm, SHIB investors awaiting the meme coin to hit a new all-time high have a long wait ahead of them. The long-term prediction suggests that the Shiba Inu price will not hit a new all-time high in the next decade. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rally Above $0.74 ATHs In The Works As HTF Trend Holds This long-term prediction moves through the next three decades, going all the way into the year 2050, and yet Sh. For most of the time, the algorithm suggests that the cryptocurrency will only see double-digit growth for each year over the next couple of years. Interestingly, historical data also support muted performance for the Shiba Inu price for the rest of the year. CryptoRank website shows an average return of 0.31% for SHIB for the month of November and -9.84% for the month of December. If these hold, then it means that the SHIB price is more likely to decline than recover as the year moves toward an end.

Market analyst Diana recently highlighted an ambitious forecast from Canary Capital CEO, Steven McClurg, who believes that the upcoming XRP ETF could double the first-week gains seen by Solana’s ETF launch. McClurg attributes this expected outperformance to the fundamental differences between the two assets. “Solana’s a retail token,” he explained. “XRP is built for global finance, for banks, payments, and institutional flows.” While Solana has gained popularity among retail traders and blockchain enthusiasts, XRP’s focus on institutional adoption positions it differently in the market. Understanding the divide between retail- and institution-focused crypto is key. Solana, with its fast, developer-friendly blockchain, has mainly attracted retail traders, fueling modest ETF gains. XRP, by contrast, is built for banks and cross-border payments, backed by institutional partnerships, giving it the potential for larger, more sustainable ETF inflows, McClurg pointed out. The XRP ETF offers a regulated gateway for institutions and major financial players to access the cryptocurrency. Unlike retail-driven surges, institutional flows are larger and steadier, boosting trading volumes and market stability. McClurg’s bullish outlook is reinforced by XRP Ledger’s evolving ecosystem, including new smart contracts and expanded payment solutions that enhance XRP’s real-world financial utility. Notably, the crypto market is moving beyond retail speculation toward assets with robust infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and real-world utility. XRP’s established role in cross-border payments and partnerships with financial institutions positions it as a prime ETF candidate, appealing to conservative investors seeking crypto exposure without direct market risk. ETF launches often drive notable market moves. Solana’s first-week surge was impressive but retail-driven. In contrast, McClurg projects XRP’s ETF could surpass it by tapping institutional demand, deeper liquidity, and a proven role in global finance, potentially signaling a major step toward mainstream adoption and stronger integration with traditional markets. Conclusion The XRP ETF could mark a transformative milestone for crypto. Unlike Solana’s retail-driven debut, XRP’s focus on institutional adoption, cross-border payments, and established financial partnerships positions it for potentially record-breaking first-week gains, signaling a broader shift toward mainstream integration of digital assets in global finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-13 09:30:48

The JUP community has proposed a groundbreaking feature that could transform your staking experience. Imagine accessing your staked tokens instantly instead of waiting seven long days. This revolutionary JUP unstaking proposal brings unprecedented flexibility to Solana’s popular decentralized exchange. What Makes This JUP Unstaking Proposal So Special? The current Jupiter staking system requires a seven-day waiting period for unstaking. However, the new governance proposal introduces an immediate JUP unstaking option with a 3% fee. This means users can access their funds when they need them most, providing crucial liquidity during market volatility or unexpected opportunities. Community discussions are actively exploring how to utilize these fees. Some members suggest token burns to reduce circulating supply, while others prefer adding the funds to staking rewards. Both approaches aim to benefit the Jupiter ecosystem long-term. How Will Instant JUP Unstaking Benefit You? This upgrade addresses one of the most common concerns in DeFi staking: locked capital. The instant JUP unstaking feature offers several advantages: Emergency access to your funds when needed Flexible portfolio management during market movements Reduced opportunity cost from locked tokens Enhanced user experience for both new and experienced traders What Are the Potential Impacts on Jupiter’s Ecosystem? The 3% fee for instant JUP unstaking creates an interesting economic dynamic. If used for token burns, it could gradually reduce JUP’s circulating supply, potentially increasing token value. Alternatively, directing fees to staking rewards would incentivize long-term participation. This proposal demonstrates Jupiter’s commitment to user-centric development. By listening to community feedback, the platform continues evolving to meet real user needs. The instant JUP unstaking option could set a new standard for DeFi platforms across Solana and beyond. Why Should You Care About This Development? As a Jupiter user, this proposal directly affects how you interact with the platform. The instant JUP unstaking feature represents more than just convenience—it’s about financial freedom and control. Whether you’re a day trader needing quick access or a long-term holder wanting optionality, this upgrade matters. The community governance process shows the power of decentralized decision-making. Your voice can help shape Jupiter’s future direction. This proposal highlights how DeFi platforms can adapt quickly to user needs, unlike traditional financial systems. Final Thoughts: A New Era for Jupiter Staking The instant JUP unstaking proposal marks a significant step forward for decentralized finance. It balances immediate accessibility with sustainable ecosystem growth. While the 3% fee ensures the feature isn’t abused, it provides a valuable option when timing is crucial. This development reinforces Jupiter’s position as an innovative DeFi leader on Solana. The platform continues pushing boundaries while maintaining strong community governance. The future of JUP unstaking looks brighter than ever, offering users unprecedented control over their assets. Frequently Asked Questions What is the current unstaking period for JUP? Currently, unstaking JUP requires a seven-day waiting period before funds become available. How much will instant JUP unstaking cost? The proposed instant JUP unstaking feature comes with a 3% fee on the unstaked amount. When will instant unstaking be available? The feature is currently a governance proposal and requires community voting before implementation. What happens to the 3% fees collected? The community is discussing using fees for token burns or adding them to staking rewards pools. Can I still use the free seven-day unstaking? Yes, the traditional free unstaking option with the waiting period will remain available. How does this affect JUP tokenomics? Depending on fee usage, it could reduce circulating supply or enhance staking rewards for participants. Share This Exciting News!

The company that runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange is examining several possibilities, including making its backdoor listing rules tougher and asking companies to go through new audits, according to sources close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans haven’t been made public. The sources say no final decisions have been made yet. Three Japanese companies that trade on the exchange have put their plans to buy cryptocurrencies on pause since September after facing resistance from Japan Exchange Group, one source revealed. These companies were warned that their ability to raise money would be limited if they went ahead with buying crypto as part of their business plans, the source added. Right now, the stock exchange doesn’t have any broad rules stopping listed companies from piling up cryptocurrency. However, a spokesperson for Japan Exchange Group said in an email to Bloomberg that the organization is “monitoring companies that raise concerns from a risk and governance perspective, with a view to protecting shareholders and investors.” Crypto treasury stocks face sharp declines The type of crypto-holding stocks that follow the model created by Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. saw big gains earlier this year but have since dropped dramatically, leaving everyday investors facing major losses. Strategy , which has built up a Bitcoin collection valued at roughly $66 billion, has seen its stock price fall by about half since mid-July. Meanwhile, stock exchanges in Hong Kong and other parts of the Asia-Pacific area have pushed back against efforts to create new digital asset treasury companies, or DATs. Japan stands apart with 14 listed Bitcoin-buying firms, more than any other Asian country, based on information from BitcoinTreasuries.net. What backdoor listings mean for crypto firms A backdoor listing happens when a private company becomes publicly traded through a merger or takeover, skipping the traditional Initial Public Offering route. Japan Exchange Group already doesn’t allow backdoor listings, and sources say it’s now looking at whether to extend that ban to companies already on the exchange that change their main business focus to collecting cryptocurrency. The push for tougher oversight came about because of concerns that Japanese investors have lost money from the recent drop in local digital asset treasury company stocks, sources said. Metaplanet Inc. , which is by far Japan’s biggest digital asset treasury operator trading in Tokyo, has watched its stock price crash more than 75% from its peak in mid-June. This came after the stock had jumped about 420% earlier in the year. The company has gathered more than 30,000 Bitcoins after switching its business from running hotels to cryptocurrency in early 2024, making it the fourth-biggest public Bitcoin holder in the world. Convano Inc., a nail salon business that plans to buy 21,000 Bitcoins, has seen its shares fall roughly 60% since late August. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This dramatic shift creates both risks and opportunities for forex traders and cryptocurrency investors seeking to navigate these turbulent waters. Why is the Dollar Retreating During US Reopening? The US dollar’s surprising decline comes as the economy shows strong signs of recovery. Several factors are driving this dollar retreat that every trader should understand: Increased risk appetite among global investors Federal Reserve’s continued accommodative policy stance Strong performance in equity markets drawing capital away from safe-haven assets Improving global economic conditions reducing dollar demand US Reopening Impact on Currency Markets The comprehensive US reopening is creating ripple effects across all financial markets. As businesses resume operations and consumer spending rebounds, the economic landscape is transforming rapidly. This shift is particularly evident in: Indicator Pre-Reopening Current Status Retail Sales Contracted Expanding rapidly Employment High unemployment Steady recovery Consumer Confidence Low Improving significantly Sterling Struggles Amid Economic Challenges While the dollar faces pressure, the British pound continues its sterling struggles against major counterparts. The currency’s performance reflects ongoing concerns about: Brexit-related trade disruptions Slower vaccination rollout compared to US Bank of England’s cautious monetary policy approach Political uncertainty affecting investor confidence Navigating Volatile Currency Markets Current currency markets present unique challenges and opportunities for traders. The interplay between dollar weakness and sterling uncertainty requires careful strategy development. Key considerations include: Monitoring central bank policy statements closely Watching for inflation data surprises Assessing geopolitical developments impacting trade flows Considering correlation with cryptocurrency movements Forex Trading Strategies in Current Environment Successful forex trading in this environment demands adaptability and careful risk management. Traders should consider: Strategy Application Risk Level Range Trading Sterling pairs Medium Trend Following Dollar weakness plays High Carry Trade Interest rate differentials Medium-High FAQs What’s driving the dollar’s weakness? The combination of improved global risk sentiment, Federal Reserve policy, and strong equity performance is reducing safe-haven demand for the dollar. Why is sterling underperforming? Brexit complications, slower economic reopening, and political uncertainties are weighing on the British pound despite generally improving global conditions. How does this affect cryptocurrency markets? Dollar weakness typically supports cryptocurrency prices as investors seek alternative stores of value and hedge against currency depreciation. Which central banks are most influential currently? The Federal Reserve and Bank of England policies are particularly important, along with the European Central Bank . What economic indicators should traders watch? Key indicators include inflation data, employment reports, GDP growth figures, and central bank meeting minutes from major economies. The current currency market landscape presents a transformative opportunity for alert traders. The dollar’s retreat amid US reopening and sterling’s persistent struggles create compelling trading setups across multiple timeframes. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for capitalizing on the shifts occurring in global forex markets.

Officials at the Treasury have asked the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to reduce energy bills, rail fares, and other regulated prices in their forecasts, to free up more money for spending on public services. Reeves wants to spend more money on public services Reeves informed the OBR that lower inflation will reduce the government’s borrowing costs and increase the amount it spends on improving public services, such as healthcare, schools, and roads, without breaching fiscal rules. The government already has a budget gap of about £35 billion because it now expects the economy to grow more slowly than initially anticipated, interest rates have increased, and welfare cuts have been reversed. Reeves will use the extra £6 billion to support people and communities, strengthen public services, and plan for future growth simultaneously. Economists like Dan Hanson from Bloomberg Economics say the OBR has the final say because it is an independent watchdog that produces the forecasts behind every UK budget. However, Reeves’ request could succeed, as history shows the OBR has made changes when the market or government plans changed. Reeves will receive additional funding to spend once the OBR accepts her request, which will demonstrate to everyone that the government is taking proactive steps to manage the crisis. Her goal is to make life easier for people and businesses in the region. The Treasury wants to lower prices to reduce inflation Treasury officials aim to reduce energy bills, rail fares, and other regulated costs to help families afford everyday essentials and enable the Bank of England to lower interest rates. Low interest rates will make borrowing more affordable for both businesses and households and reduce the cost of government debt. The Treasury wants to remove climate and social tariffs from energy bills and cut value-added tax (VAT) on essential goods. They will also freeze air passenger duty to prevent travel costs from rising further, reduce taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and delay planned tax increases on vapes and electric vehicles. With these actions, families and businesses will be able to allocate more funds to other essentials, and companies will also maintain their costs at a low level. Economists predict that the government will lower inflation by around 0.5%, making a significant difference for businesses and families facing high costs in the economy. Even a small decrease in inflation will reduce the pressure on interest rates and make borrowing less expensive over time. The Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey, stated that reducing regulated prices can result in a reduction of 0.4 to 0.5 % points in service price inflation. He also said the central bank will reduce interest rates sooner to help households with mortgages, loans, and daily expenses if the measures are effective. Officials at the Treasury are transparent about their plans to reduce costs for families and businesses, as they aim to increase confidence in the government and facilitate collaboration among all parties involved in driving economic growth. Inflation in the UK is currently at 3.8%, which is almost double the Bank of England’s target of 2% . The base interest rate remains at 4%, so the government must balance supporting economic growth, controlling inflation, and ensuring public finances remain sustainable. Anything that goes wrong could increase the costs of goods and services even further, and the economy will fall even deeper. The Treasury aims to focus on energy, rail fares, and other regulated costs, as the government can have a direct impact on these areas. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Critical data hits 12-month low! Here's why…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/solana-sol-is-facing-tough-times-critical-data-hits-12-month-low-heres-why/,"Solana (SOL), which experienced a major collapse with the bankruptcy of FTX in November 2022 but was subsequently reborn from the ashes, is going through difficult times. Affected by the declines, Solana has now fallen to around $150 after approaching $300 last January. The decline in Solana was not limited to price alone, with Solana's daily active addresses also falling to a 12-month low. The number of daily active addresses on the Solana network has fallen to a 12-month low, according to The Block. The seven-day moving average for this metric has fallen to 3.3 million from around 9 million at the beginning of the year. This sharp decline on the Solana network has been attributed to the decline of this year's memecoin craze. Network activity on Solana, which surged in the second half of 2024 due to the memecoin craze, has been declining since 2025. At the time, Solana led the memecoin market with faster speeds and lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum (ETH). Despite this decline, the ecosystem continues to grow with new DEXs, prediction markets, and real-world asset protocols. DeFi TVL stands at approximately $10 billion, led by Jupiter, Kamino, and Jito. Memecoin issuance platform pump.fun continues to demonstrate its strength in this sector, generating over $1 million in daily revenue and commanding a nearly 90% market share among token launch platforms. This suggests that despite declining overall participation, activity in certain segments remains intense. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Solana (SOL) is facing tough times!

TRIA co-founder Parth Bhalla recently revealed how their sustainable cashback model actually works – and it’s changing the crypto card landscape forever. What Makes TRIA’s Sustainable Cashback Different? During Bitcoin World’s AMA session, Bhalla explained that traditional fintech companies spend heavily on advertising to acquire users. TRIA takes a different approach by redirecting those marketing budgets directly to users through their sustainable cashback program. This creates a win-win situation where users benefit while the company grows organically. The key difference lies in the funding structure. Unlike programs that rely on venture capital or temporary promotions, TRIA’s rewards come from three concrete revenue sources: Payment processing fees from transactions Ecosystem grants and partnerships Co-marketing budgets with strategic partners How Does the Sustainable Cashback Model Scale? One major concern with high cashback offers is scalability. However, Bhalla emphasized that their sustainable cashback system is designed to grow alongside network transaction volume. As more users join and transaction frequency increases, the revenue streams that fund the cashback also expand. This creates a virtuous cycle where user growth directly supports reward sustainability. The model ensures that cashback percentages remain stable even as the user base expands dramatically. Why Traditional Cashback Programs Often Fail Many fintech companies struggle with cashback sustainability because they treat rewards as customer acquisition costs. These programs typically rely on external funding sources that eventually dry up. TRIA’s approach integrates cashback directly into their business model, making it an inherent part of their ecosystem rather than an expensive marketing tactic. The sustainable cashback model represents a fundamental shift in how crypto card programs approach user rewards. Instead of viewing cashback as an expense, TRIA treats it as a core feature that drives network effects and long-term value creation. Real-World Benefits of Sustainable Rewards Users benefit from predictable, reliable rewards that don’t suddenly disappear. The premium metal card offering up to 6% cashback becomes more than just a payment tool – it transforms into a wealth-building instrument that consistently returns value to its holders. This approach demonstrates how blockchain technology can create more transparent and equitable financial systems. The sustainable cashback model shows that it’s possible to deliver substantial value to users while maintaining business viability. Future of Crypto Card Rewards TRIA’s success with their sustainable approach could inspire other projects to rethink their reward structures. As the crypto card market matures, users are becoming more discerning about which programs offer genuine long-term value versus short-term gimmicks. The emphasis on sustainable cashback reflects a broader trend toward building enduring crypto ecosystems rather than chasing quick user acquisition metrics. This shift benefits everyone in the space by promoting healthier, more sustainable business models. TRIA’s innovative approach to cashback rewards demonstrates that high percentages and sustainability aren’t mutually exclusive. By building rewards directly into their revenue model, they’ve created a program that benefits users while ensuring long-term viability. This represents a significant step forward for crypto card offerings and could set new standards for the entire industry. Frequently Asked Questions How is 6% cashback sustainable when other cards offer much less? TRIA funds cashback through multiple revenue streams including payment fees, ecosystem grants, and partner marketing budgets. This diversified approach makes higher percentages sustainable. Will the cashback percentage decrease over time? The model is designed to scale with transaction volume, meaning cashback rates should remain stable as the network grows. What makes this different from traditional credit card rewards? Traditional cards often fund rewards through interest charges and fees. TRIA uses specific revenue streams dedicated solely to user rewards. How quickly do users receive their cashback? Cashback is typically processed immediately or within the same transaction cycle, providing real-time rewards. Is there a limit to how much cashback I can earn? While there may be reasonable usage limits, the program is designed to reward all legitimate transactions proportionally. What happens if transaction volume decreases? The model includes safeguards and diversified funding sources to maintain reward stability during market fluctuations. Found this insight into sustainable crypto rewards valuable?

54342877,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=859430,1763028000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54342877.jpeg,Trump Announces ‘At Least’ $2K Tariff Dividend: Will This Stimulus Send the Digitap ($TAP) Presale Parabolic?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-announces-at-least-2k-tariff-dividend-will-this-stimulus-send-the-digitap-tap-presale-parabolic/,"Analysts talk about liquidity, central bank easing cycles, and fiscal policy—but nothing in the world is more bullish for risk assets than helicopter money. Trump is looking to distribute a “ tariff dividend ” of at least $2,000 per American. This would be pure rocket fuel for crypto and high-momentum stocks. Most investors still remember the COVID-era stimulus cheque that sent asset prices wild. If this stimulus arrives, it could send new crypto presales like Digitap ($TAP) parabolic this year. As investors scramble to find altcoins to buy in anticipation of a stimmy cheque, $TAP is rapidly becoming the best crypto to buy —especially in a rising-liquidity window. Trump’s $2,000 Tariff Dividend Macro tailwinds, such as rate cuts and balance-sheet expansion, help push asset prices higher. But helicopter money is an entirely different ball game. It is closer to pouring petrol on an open fire, and if a $2,000 ‘tariff dividend’ hits markets, it would aggressively front-load risk. Retail cash would flow into high beta tech, crypto presales like Digitap, and other high-risk, high-return assets. While most crypto and even stock investors are getting bearish with BTC trading lower, and AI mania wearing off, a stimulus cheque would reverse all of this sentiment literally overnight. While many claim that tariffs are inflationary and growth-negative in the long run, this does not stop the president from using this money to bribe voters in time for the midterms. Digitap Presale Nears $2 Million Digitap calls itself the world’s first omni-bank. But what does this mean? Digitap supports fiat, stablecoins, and crypto all from a single interface, blending the best of traditional and crypto together. It is a full money environment where users can pay, send, transfer, swap, and stake in whatever currency they like. Cross-border payments now settle in minutes with below 1% fees, and users can make instant crypto-to-fiat transactions. Digitap is delivering the dream many expected from earlier cross-border plays like XRP today. No more silos, no more delays, just value moving borderlessly in real time. Anyone can download the app today and sign up for a Visa card. $TAP has smashed $1.7 million as investors start to understand that Digitap is a great way to bet on the growth of stablecoins and crypto banking. Its multi-rail architecture also includes traditional bank corridors like SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, and Faster Payments, as well as public blockchains. Digitap’s AI routing engine optimizes each transaction and swap whenever users use an on-chain balance to spend on their Visa card. And that is the real beauty of Digitap’s services. It wraps the speed and power of crypto into a neobank-style application, and users might not even know they are using crypto. This is the type of product that could drive the next leg of adoption for crypto, and that’s why $TAP is one of the best altcoins to buy in Q4 . How $TAP Captures Value for Holders While a $2,000 stimulus flow could send $TAP parabolic in the short-term, this type of capital injection would be temporary. $TAP’s tokenomics are permanent, and they route 50% of platform profits, rewarding stakers and burning tokens permanently. And if Digitap manages to see aggressive adoption, $TAP could quickly become one of crypto’s most deflationary tokens. That’s how strong this flywheel is, and cash-flowing assets are all the rage in 2025—another reason why $TAP ranks among the best cryptos to buy this year . Digitap is an omni-bank with built-in value accrual for token holders, and is part of the next-gen of tokens, which are leaving behind the old, useless governance tokens. It is currently available for just $0.0297, but investors will have to be quick because the next round will see the price jump to $0.0313, and it is expected to arrive soon with the current levels of demand. $TAP is up more than 137% since the sale began, and investors still have plenty of upside until listing, which is confirmed at $0.14. This structured pricing is another reason why it ranks among the leading altcoins to buy in November . Helicopter Money Meets An Omni-Banking App: Is Digitap the Best Crypto Presale to Buy This Year? If a $2,000 tariff dividend materializes, muscle memory from COVID will kick in, and it will be a race to acquire risk. Crypto presales like Digitap will be first in line, and with its Visa card distribution, omni-banking services, and powerful flywheel, the setup is perfect. 2025 is different from prior cycles, and the real parabolic plays are real businesses solving real problems and generating cash flows, which they share with users. As stablecoins explode and Digitap begins to integrate these new stablecoin-centric chains, the potential is limitless. Hailed as one of the best cryptos to buy now, $TAP could be a future blue-chip and change how people manage their finances and interact with crypto forever.

The Chinese-rooted exchange appears to have found a way around the country’s strict financial regulations, raising serious concerns about investor protection and market integrity. How Did BTCC Bypass South Korean Regulations? According to recent reports from Decenter, BTCC’s illegal operations in South Korea involve sophisticated methods to circumvent the ban. The exchange allegedly opened disguised domestic bank accounts to accept Korean won deposits from local users. This represents a significant escalation in the ongoing battle between regulators and unregistered overseas cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the South Korean market. Financial industry sources reveal that the exchange is now operating through a new application called “BTCC Lite,” available on both Google Play and Apple App stores. This move comes after South Korean financial authorities removed BTCC’s official app, classifying it as an unregistered overseas exchange. The company’s persistence in maintaining BTCC illegal operations in South Korea demonstrates the challenges regulators face in controlling cross-border cryptocurrency activities. What Makes BTCC Lite Different From the Banned App? The new BTCC Lite application represents a strategic shift in how the exchange conducts its illegal operations in South Korea. Key differences include: Rebranded identity with a different name and appearance Separate banking arrangements through disguised accounts Continued acceptance of Korean won deposits Available on major app stores despite previous removals This approach allows BTCC to continue its illegal operations in South Korea while technically complying with app store policies. However, the fundamental activity remains the same: facilitating cryptocurrency trading for South Korean users without proper regulatory approval. Why Should Investors Be Concerned About These Illegal Operations? The persistence of BTCC illegal operations in South Korea creates multiple risks for local investors. Users trading through unregistered platforms lack the protections offered by compliant exchanges. Moreover, these activities undermine the integrity of South Korea’s financial system and could lead to: Loss of funds without legal recourse Exposure to money laundering risks Potential legal consequences for users Market manipulation concerns South Korean authorities have been increasingly vigilant about cryptocurrency regulation, making the continuation of BTCC illegal operations in South Korea particularly concerning. The situation highlights the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between regulators and determined offshore exchanges. What Does This Mean for South Korea’s Crypto Regulation? The ability of BTCC to resume illegal operations in South Korea despite previous enforcement actions raises questions about the effectiveness of current regulatory approaches. This case demonstrates that simply removing apps from official stores may not be sufficient to prevent determined exchanges from accessing South Korean markets. Financial authorities now face the challenge of developing more sophisticated detection and prevention methods. The ongoing BTCC illegal operations in South Korea serve as a wake-up call for regulators worldwide about the adaptability of unregistered cryptocurrency exchanges in circumventing national borders and regulatory barriers. Conclusion: The Ongoing Battle for Crypto Compliance The reported resumption of BTCC illegal operations in South Korea through the BTCC Lite app represents a significant challenge for financial regulators. This case underscores the persistent nature of regulatory arbitrage in the cryptocurrency space and the need for more comprehensive approaches to cross-border exchange oversight. As the situation develops, both investors and regulators must remain vigilant about the risks posed by unregistered platforms operating in regulated markets. Frequently Asked Questions What is BTCC and why is it operating illegally in South Korea? BTCC is a cryptocurrency exchange with Chinese roots that has been classified as an unregistered overseas exchange by South Korean financial authorities. It’s operating illegally because it hasn’t obtained the necessary regulatory approvals to serve South Korean customers. How is BTCC circumventing the ban in South Korea? The exchange is using disguised domestic bank accounts and a rebranded application called “BTCC Lite” available on major app stores to continue accepting Korean won deposits from local users. What risks do investors face when using unregistered exchanges? Investors risk losing funds without legal protection, exposure to money laundering activities, potential legal consequences, and lack of recourse in case of exchange failures or hacks. Are South Korean authorities taking action against BTCC? Yes, financial authorities previously removed BTCC’s official app and classified it as illegal. They continue to monitor and take action against unregistered exchanges operating in the country. Can users get into legal trouble for using BTCC Lite? While primary enforcement focuses on exchanges, users could potentially face legal consequences for knowingly using unregistered platforms, especially for large transactions. What should investors do if they’ve used BTCC in South Korea? Investors should immediately cease using unregistered platforms, withdraw any remaining funds, and consider moving to properly registered exchanges that comply with South Korean regulations.

54342626,626739,1763028015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54342626.jpeg,Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Is Just Around The Corner—What To Expect,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereums-fusaka-upgrade-what-to-expect/,"The Ethereum (ETH) blockchain is poised for one of its most significant upgrades yet, the Fusaka Upgrade, set to take place on December 3. This enhancement aims to tackle one of the network’s most pressing challenges: scalability. Promises Of The Upcoming Fusaka Upgrade According to a recent analysis by The Bull Theory experts on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Fusaka is designed to fundamentally improve Ethereum’s performance. A key feature of the Fusaka Upgrade is its substantial boost to the network’s capacity, raising the block limit from 45 million to 150 million gas. This increase is complemented by the introduction of two systems: PeerDAS and Verkle Trees, which collectively transform data management on the blockchain. PeerDAS enables Ethereum to process Layer-2 transactions more swiftly and affordably, while Verkle Trees lighten the storage requirements, making blockchain verification much more efficient. The implications for users are significant. Layer-2 solutions such as Arbitrum (ARB), Coinbase’s Base, and Optimism (OP) rely heavily on Ethereum for transaction settlements. The current protocol necessitates that every Ethereum node downloads extensive data sets to confirm transactions. However, the Fusaka Upgrade mitigates this issue. With PeerDAS, nodes will only need to verify samples rather than complete data chunks, which could dramatically lower costs and accelerate transaction times. This efficiency means that rollups will become less expensive, enhancing the overall experience for users in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). From an economic perspective, cheaper rollups are expected to stimulate activity across Layer-2 networks, leading to an influx of users and applications. Consequently, this surge could result in increased fees being burned, thereby elevating ETH’s demand. Could Ethereum Reach New Price Records? For analysts at The Bull Theory, the Fusaka Upgrade not only strengthens ETH’s role as the primary settlement platform across the crypto economy , encompassing everything from DeFi to tokenized assets, but it also reinforces its position in the broader market landscape. Fusaka follows a series of important milestones for the Ethereum network that have reshaped its fundamentals. The Merge in 2022 made the network more energy-efficient, while the Shanghai/Shapella update in 2023 introduced the capability for staked ETH withdrawals. The Dencun upgrade in 2024 incorporated proto-danksharding and blobs, and Pectra, which took place in 2025, brought about validator flexibility and Layer-2 interoperability. Previous upgrades, including the Pectra Upgrade , have demonstrated the market’s responsiveness to enhancements in network efficiency—triggering a remarkable 50% rally for ETH earlier this year. While ETH is trading just above $3,500, a similar response and level of demand to the next upgrade could push ETH to a new high of $5,250. This is supported by analysts’ forecasts of a bullish fourth quarter for the broader digital asset market.

54342594,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89471,1763028017,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Which Crypto to Buy Right Now? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Nearing $19 Million Raised,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-buy-right-now-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"The current crypto market is volatile, and investors are seeking projects with real utility and active communities. Tokens with working platforms will outperform speculative assets in 2026. Among leading cryptocurrencies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum and emerging as a next big cryptocurrency. Compared to Solana (SOL) and XRP, MUTM is capturing market attention with over $18.7 million raised across presale phases, signaling strong demand and confidence from early supporters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of four billion tokens, with the current Phase 6 price at $0.035. This phase has 170 million tokens allocated, and 90% are already sold. Over 18,000 holders are participating across all phases. The next presale phase will increase the price to $0.040, creating an urgent opportunity for investors to secure tokens at a lower rate. A new update allows buyers to purchase MUTM directly with a card without any limits, ensuring simple and immediate entry into the presale. Solana (SOL) The introduction of the first Solana (SOL) ETFs in the U.S.—including the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF and the Grayscale Solana Trust ETF—is expected to influence Solana’s broader market positioning and institutional visibility. However, Solana’s price has felt the pressure of the recent market downturn, as overall investment appetite for altcoins and DeFi projects has weakened. Despite the broader pullback, Solana ETFs have recorded net inflows, while Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have seen significant outflows of approximately $2 billion and $837.66 million respectively over the past six days. This contrast highlights a growing investor interest in Solana relative to other major assets amid challenging market conditions. Solana (SOL) offers strong developer adoption and high throughput, with analyst projections for 2026 suggesting $250–$300 if current growth continues. While SOL has technical strength, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide immediate utility through lending, staking, and stablecoin minting, creating transactional demand that can lead to higher ROI for early investors. XRP On November 7, 2025, 21Shares submitted an amendment to its spot XRP ETF filing with the SEC, initiating a standard 20-day review period. If the filing faces no objections, the ETF could receive automatic approval by November 27. Meanwhile, Ripple has completed a $500 million funding round, pushing its valuation to $40 billion and reinforcing its position for expanded development and market growth. In market action, the recent decline in XRP’s price has created an opportunity for investors to accumulate the asset below $2. However, those who entered following the November 2024 rally may currently be experiencing unrealized losses. XRP is widely known for cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory developments, with projected targets around $3–$3.50 under positive outcomes. Unlike XRP, MUTM will generate consistent transactional activity through platform lending and borrowing, staking rewards, and community incentives, providing tangible use cases for investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Lending, Borrowing, and Stable Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate as a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol with dual models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will allow users to pool assets like ETH and USDT for borrowers, earning interest through mtTokens that represent their share. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will enable direct, negotiated loans for specific community assets, offering more tailored lending options. V1 of the protocol will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, allowing early users to engage with core platform functions. In this early phase, users will have the ability to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. The Stable Interest Rate Model will give borrowers predictable repayment costs. The rate will be calculated at the time of borrowing, slightly higher than the variable rate to reward stability. If market rates rise significantly, the protocol will rebalance stable rates using a condition tied to 90% of the theoretical all-variable rate. Highly volatile or low-liquidity assets will not qualify for stable borrowing, protecting overall liquidity. Collateral and liquidation mechanisms will secure the platform. All loans will require overcollateralization, measured by a Stability Factor. If collateral falls below the required threshold, the system will trigger automatic liquidation. Liquidators will repurchase the outstanding debt at a discount, stabilizing the protocol and protecting other users. Both P2C and P2P loans will follow this model, ensuring consistent security for lenders and borrowers. Numerical Example and Community Engagement Numerical examples demonstrate impressive returns. A $5,000 investment in Phase 2 at $0.015 will acquire 333,333 MUTM, now worth $12K in value at the current price of $0.035. When MUTM reaches $1, that same holding will be valued around $333K. Similarly, a Phase 4 investment at $0.025 will scale proportionally with projected price milestones, rewarding early participants handsomely. Community engagement will drive platform growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will host a $100,000 giveaway for ten winners, reward the Top-1 leaderboard with $500 daily, and provide bonuses for the Top 50 leaderboard. The dashboard will allow investors to monitor holdings and calculate ROI easily. With over 12,000 Twitter followers, the community already demonstrates strong traction and active participation. Security will remain a cornerstone of MUTM. The protocol will undergo a CertiK audit, achieving a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. The 50,000 USDT bug bounty program will offer tiered rewards from Critical to Low severity, ensuring ongoing protection against vulnerabilities. Phase 6 is 90% sold, and the next phase will raise the price to $0.040. Investors who act now will gain access to a next big cryptocurrency with a working platform, strong community, and real transactional demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deliver high ROI, making investing in crypto simple and rewarding for those entering the presale at the current price. Immediate action will secure tokens before the price increase, positioning early supporters for substantial growth in 2026.

Trump Crypto Narrative Sends the Viral Bitcoin Hyper Presale Near $27M, as US Government Reopens November 13, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The longest US government shutdown has ended after 43 days, with President Donald Trump signing the bill that cleared the House in a 222-209 vote. The news turned the crypto market green on Wednesday, and Bitcoin briefly touched $105K before retreating. A recovery in the US economy is expected to spill over to the crypto market soon, potentially igniting a year-end rally. The signs are already here. The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) token presale, for instance, is about to smash through the $27M milestone. As the project is building a Layer-2 solution that brings more speed and programmability to the Bitcoin network, $HYPER is one of the best cryptos to watch this season. The low prices and initial market cap, in addition, make the presale entry too compelling to ignore. Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to learn more . Why the Plunging Fear and Greed Index and Trump Crypto Boost Could Spark a November Rally November 13, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin has been struggling to hold its ground amid strong macro headwinds, dragging the Crypto Fear and Greed Index down to 25. But this growing fear might be a blessing in disguise, as money shifts from weak hands to large accumulators. While the recent dip has rattled new traders, long-term investors see it as an opportunity to expand their portfolio at low costs. If the market slump continues, they’re expected to secure bigger positions, potentially setting off a sudden rally over the coming days. And with the US government shutdown coming to an end, the Trump Crypto narrative could also benefit the market. But Bitcoin is not the only crypto on their radar. Bitcoin’s upcoming Layer-2 solution, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), is also trending with a viral presale that’s on its way to $27M. Being a crypto closely tied to Bitcoin’s journey ahead, it wouldn’t be surprising to see $HYPER take off in the next rally. But the next presale price surge is only a day away. Here’s how you can join the presale before that .

Dominus’s analysis suggests that the current market structure mirrors a previous rally, and that XRP may now be entering a similar acceleration phase. BOOOOOOOOOOM Next leg for $XRP has begun Next target $14 pic.twitter.com/pBvYsNnpna — 𝐃𝐎𝐌𝐈𝐍𝐔𝐒 XRP Syndicate (@BaronDominus) November 10, 2025 Community Questions the Ambitious Target The forecast gained traction and mixed reactions among traders. One user questioned the $14 valuation, expressing confidence in XRP’s long-term potential but doubting that such a high price is achievable in the near term. Another user, Jordan Belfort, described the target as bold yet energizing, adding that based on market statistics, XRP has a 40% chance of reaching $14 by mid-2026. His analysis added context, explaining that at $14 per token, XRP’s market capitalization would be around $800 billion—approximately half of Ethereum’s current valuation. Market Cap and Liquidity Requirements The discussion extended beyond price speculation to the practical conditions necessary for XRP to achieve such a valuation. Reaching $14 would require significant liquidity inflows and widespread adoption of XRP’s utility through on-demand liquidity (ODL) transactions or similar real-world use cases. According to the figures mentioned, an ODL volume exceeding $2 trillion would be needed to sustain a market cap of that magnitude. This reinforces the scale of adoption for the forecast to materialize, emphasizing that such growth would depend on broader integration of XRP within global financial networks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Evaluating the Forecast Dominus’s projection is one of the more confident price calls for XRP in recent weeks, especially as the market shows signs of renewed strength. The accompanying chart emphasizes that XRP’s current structure may be preparing for an aggressive upward continuation, consistent with its historical price behavior during earlier bull phases. However, the $14 estimate remains highly ambitious and contingent on both technical confirmation and real-world expansion of XRP’s ecosystem. XRP’s long-term trajectory depends heavily on institutional utility and liquidity demand, not speculative momentum alone. If those conditions align, the scenario outlined by Dominus could become more plausible. For now, the forecast serves as a reminder of the growing optimism surrounding XRP’s market outlook, with traders closely watching whether the asset can deliver another strong breakout phase.

Chia highlighted that the MAS has established a vibrant FinTech sector comprising over 1,800 FinTech firms across different domains. Chia stated that MAS launched the BLOOM initiative to support the industry’s trials with tokenized bills and regulated stablecoins for settlement. He invited FIs (Financial Institutions), as well as clearing and settlement network operators, to help conduct trials under this initiative. He noted that three Singapore banks, including DBS Bank, United Overseas Bank (UOB), and Oversea-China Banking Corporation (OCBC), have successfully conducted interbank overnight lending transactions. The settlement used the first live trial issuance of Singapore dollar-backed CBDC. Chia asserted that MAS has provided support to hundreds of innovation projects and centers over the past decade. He added that, in recognition of the benefits of technology and innovation, MAS has established a regulatory sandbox and exercised regulatory flexibility to test business models. The MAS managing director says the regulator will trial the issuance of tokenized MAS bills to primary dealers and settle with CBDC. Chia says MAS to publish tokenization guide Chia Jiun mentioned that MAS is taking a step towards providing more regulatory clarity and will be publishing a “Guide on the Tokenization of Capital Market Products” later this week. The guide will use case studies to provide more clarity on the regulated treatment of tokenized capital market products, such as bills. It also provides guidance on the applicable disclosures and will be updated periodically as tokenization develops. According to Chia, there are specificities in tokenization and blockchain networks that would benefit from more regulatory and legal clarity. The MAS executive noted that many regulators have adopted a technology-neutral approach, and regulatory standards only apply based on their economic and legal substance. However, MAS is also working with industry and international counterparts to address barriers and gaps to the adoption of asset-backed tokens. “We welcome more collaborations with market participants and regulators to further mature the tokenisation ecosystem and help bridge the adoption gap.” – Chia Jiun , Managing Director of MAS Chia said a joint report published yesterday provides actionable steps for market participants and regulators to help scale adoption. The collaboration is between the Investment Association of the UK and the Investment Management Association of Singapore, with support from the UK Financial Conduct Authority and MAS. MAS claims Singapore needs institutional-grade networks MAS emphasized that stablecoins and tokenized bills need foundational blockchain attributes that are not readily available on public permissionless blockchains. The regulator noted that the ideal network should have clear governance structures, secure and reliable performance, regulatory compliance, predictable and transparent fees, settlement finality, and privacy optionality. Meanwhile, Chia said that FIs and innovators are developing solutions to make blockchain networks institutional-grade. Other network operators are also developing customizable private blockchains with the features identified above. Some are building permissioned and compliance layers on public blockchain networks. However, for market participants to gain greater confidence in these networks, the MAS claims that there needs to be more clarity on whether these arrangements are compliant with regulatory standards. The participants would also like to see more industry standards developed around functionalities and operational performance. Another notable contribution has been the GL1 Market Infrastructure Toolkit, developed under the support of the Global Layer One initiative. FIs and network operators can utilize the toolkit to determine whether blockchains comply with internationally recognized regulatory standards, such as the PFMI, and market practices, including the DAS CP developed by FMI operators. The toolkit comprises 108 controls, and Chia believes that such verification processes and tools will help build confidence in using compliant blockchains.

Since Ripple’s usual monthly escrow release had already occurred at the beginning of the month, the move sparked a lot of speculation in the crypto community, allowing the cryptocurrency to jump nearly 5% on the day. It was later revealed that the tokens were locked and subsequently unlocked at Flare’s Core Vault, a critical component of the Flare Network that acts as a liquidity hub for Flare’s FAssets system, holding assets such as XRP used to aid FXRP mining. Meanwhile, a 22 million XRP transfer , worth approximately $56 million, was made from Bitget to an unknown wallet, adding another layer of intrigue to the already mysterious situation. XRP price action While XRP’s price slowly dropped over the subsequent couple of days, it is once again surging at the time of writing on Thursday, November 13, up nearly 4% on the daily chart and almost 8% in the green on the week. XRP weekly price chart. Source: Finbold The renewed momentum is primarily driven by the launch of Canary Capital’s XRP ETF (XRPC), set to begin trading on November 13. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg predicts over $5 billion in inflows within the first month. On the broader political front, U.S. President Donald Trump has signed a bill ending the 43-day government shutdown, providing a favorable backdrop for the ETF launch. XRP is showing signs of strength from a technical perspective, too. For one, the relative strength index ( RSI ) at 46.99 is slowly edging back toward neutral territory, while the moving average convergence divergence ( MACD ) histogram at +0.013 signals an early bullish crossover. However, some resistance remains. Namely, the crypto faces a ceiling at the 200-day exponential moving average ( EMA ) at $2.63, while a sustained close above $2.52 could trigger a run toward $2.70, aligning with the 127.2% Fibonacci extension.

The Executive Yuan and Central Bank have agreed to assess the digital currency's potential role in the nation's financial infrastructure. The proposal includes pilot programs using confiscated Bitcoin currently held by authorities. These holdings would otherwise be sold at auction under standard asset seizure protocols. Legislator Dr Ju-chun Ko leads the initiative. JAN3 CEO Samson Mow, whose firm specialises in Bitcoin infrastructure, supports the effort. Bitcoin Magazine confirmed the development as legislative discussions continue. Dollar Dependence Drives Reform Push Taiwan maintains $577 billion in foreign exchange reserves. Approximately 92% consists of US Treasury bonds. The country also holds 423 metric tonnes of gold. Dr Ko argues this concentration creates vulnerability. The New Taiwan Dollar has experienced single-day fluctuations of 5%. Global inflation and geopolitical tensions add pressure to existing reserve strategies. Bitcoin would complement rather than replace traditional assets. Dr Ko emphasised its decentralised structure and fixed supply as key advantages. The digital asset operates independently of central bank monetary policy. The proposal addresses growing concerns about currency volatility and inflation hedging. Taiwan's heavy reliance on dollar-denominated assets limits diversification options during economic stress. International precedents exist for the adoption of sovereign Bitcoin. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March 2025 establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The initiative absorbed approximately $17 billion in forfeited cryptocurrency. El Salvador and Argentina have implemented frameworks that integrate Bitcoin into their fiscal operations. Both nations cited inflation protection and banking system instability as motivating factors. Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission authorized professional investors to purchase foreign Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds in 2024. This marked a significant shift in the nation's approach to digital assets. The central bank will conduct feasibility studies before any implementation. Pilot programs using seized Bitcoin will test operational procedures and risk management protocols. No timeline has been announced for broader adoption. Authorities plan a methodical evaluation of technical requirements and regulatory safeguards. The move represents one of Asia's most substantial government-level explorations of Bitcoin integration. Regional financial centres watch Taiwan's approach as other jurisdictions consider similar measures. Money Laundering Case Highlights Enforcement Needs Taiwan's cryptocurrency sector faces regulatory challenges despite progressive policies. Prosecutors indicted 14 individuals in August for operating an NT$2.3 billion fraud scheme. The operation defrauded over 1,500 victims through fake crypto exchange franchises. Ring leader Shi Qiren established more than 40 storefronts under names such as CoinW and BiXiang Technology. The group falsely claimed approval from the Financial Supervisory Commission. Franchise operators collected fees and used deposit machines to simulate legitimate exchange functions. Investor funds transferred to offshore cryptocurrency accounts. Authorities seized cash, digital assets, and luxury items valued at more than NT$100 million. Shi faces up to 25 years imprisonment on fraud, money laundering, and organized crime charges. Prosecutors described the scheme as a systematic exploitation of regulatory gaps.

Key Takeaways: MAS will pilot tokenized government bills settled with a CBDC. The move marks a major step toward integrating blockchain-based assets into Singapore’s financial system. DBS, OCBC, and UOB have tested interbank lending using the Singapore dollar wholesale CBDC, signaling growing real-world adoption of tokenized finance. Speaking at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Thursday , MAS Managing Director Chia Der Jiun said tokenization has evolved beyond the experimental phase and is now seeing real-world use. “Are asset-backed tokens clearly out of the lab? Without a doubt,” Chia said. “But have asset-backed tokens achieved escape velocity? Not yet.” Singapore Banks Trial Interbank Lending With CBDC Chia explained that while tokenized assets can enable instant settlement, reduce intermediaries, and optimize collateral usage, the broader ecosystem still faces significant operational and structural challenges before mass adoption can occur. As part of its ongoing experimentation, MAS revealed that three of Singapore’s largest banks, including DBS, OCBC, and UOB, have conducted interbank overnight lending transactions using the Singapore dollar wholesale CBDC. The move aligns with the regulator’s goal of scaling tokenized finance built on reliable, regulated settlement assets. Details of the trial will be unveiled next year. On the regulatory front, Chia noted that MAS has completed its stablecoin framework and will soon draft legislation.

The state became the biggest crypto user while you argued about memecoins. pic.twitter.com/Xe2wVwldqg — Tan Gera, CFA (@juniortgr) November 7, 2025 The framework, introduced in August 2023, applies to single-currency stablecoins pegged to the Singapore dollar or major global currencies such as the US dollar and euro. “Under our regime, we have given importance to sound reserve backing and redemption reliability,” he said, emphasizing that unregulated stablecoins have shown a “patchy record” in maintaining their pegs and could cause systemic stress similar to the 2008 money market crisis. MAS has also launched the BLOOM initiative to encourage industry trials involving tokenized bank liabilities and regulated stablecoins, reinforcing Singapore’s ambition to lead in safe and scalable tokenized finance. Coinbase Business Launches in Singapore As reported, Coinbase has expanded its reach beyond the United States with the official launch of Coinbase Business in Singapore, marking its first international rollout of the crypto operating platform. The move allows Singaporean startups and small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) to access instant USDC payments, global payouts, integrated trading tools, and automated accounting. However, Bitget and Bybit are preparing to reduce their presence in Singapore after the country’s central bank issued a final directive requiring unlicensed crypto firms to halt overseas operations. In early June, the regulator mandated that all digital token service providers not yet approved under the Payment Services Act must stop serving international clients—regardless of their licensing status. The MAS order targets firms with offshore clientele or front-office teams based in Singapore and leaves little room for exceptions. Bitget has already begun relocating staff to crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Dubai and Hong Kong, where regulatory frameworks are more accommodating. Bybit is also reportedly considering similar moves but has not officially announced its relocation strategy. Dubai and Hong Kong have emerged as leading alternatives for digital asset firms amid rising regulatory pressure in other markets. Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority has issued licenses to over 20 firms, including Binance and Bybit, offering tax benefits and legal clarity.

However, the current market is distinct, with funds pouring into DeFi crypto projects that have genuine on-chain utility, and this is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the best crypto to buy for the next big market bull run. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies on public opinion and hype for volume, Mutuum Finance is establishing genuine utility driven by revenues through credit markets on their platform, which allow for borrowing and lending without traditional collateral. Mutuum Finance is being widely recognized as the top DeFi crypto with real-world applications. The presale for Mutuum Finance is now 90% sold out in Stage 6, having raised over $18.7M, and this will see the price of tokens rise automatically when this stage is completed. Early birds are acquiring these tokens quickly because they know that a bull market with a useful token will see enormous growth. If a coin like DOGE can multiply by hundreds on mere hype, then it is argued that a genuine utility token like MUTM can easily outperform it, making it the best crypto to buy before the next major market surge. Dogecoin (DOGE) Forms Rounded Bottom As Buyers Show Interest Dogecoin (DOGE) has been in a serious correction process followed by a long consolidation phase, with the price ranging sideways due to the processing of past gains. Currently, a rounding bottom formation has begun to manifest, suggesting that purchase momentum is slowly retracting. If this is sustained, with these levels of support holding, a test for DOGE of the $0.21–$0.23 market might be attempted in the next phase upward. Despite current recoveries with Dogecoin (DOGE), prospective traders are ever-growingly interested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), another DeFi crypto project capturing attention for its innovative lending mechanisms. MUTM: The Next Big Crypto Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as one of the most innovative projects in the realm of DeFi crypto. The current presale round for this innovative project has surpassed all expectations. It has managed to attract more than 18,000 participants and has managed to generate over $18.7 million. The participation rate is a clear measure of interest and confidence in this innovative project, which is emerging as one of the biggest cryptos to watch out for in the coming market cycles. At its root is a new paradigm for lending that can solve problems inherent in lending on DeFi platforms. The platform facilitates loans with interest rates that adjust dynamically to market variables. Such dynamism is critical in ensuring that lenders have equal opportunities without bias, thus making MUTM one of the most sought-after coins for individuals looking for utilization in DeFi crypto. Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the concept of what can be done in the world of DeFi by focusing on issues such as trust, accessibility for users, and integrity. Specifically, Mutuum Finance is one such platform that is working towards actual utility, allowing both individuals and institutional entities to participate in it. Best Crypto to Buy to Top Dogecoin Returns Mutuum Finance has drawn in over 18,000 participants with a presale amounting to more than $18.7 million, with Stage 6 now 90% sold and priced at $0.035. However, Phase 7 will see a token price rise to $0.04. MUTM has both functional utility and huge growth opportunities with features such as a real-yield lending platform, dynamic interest rates, and a beneficial DeFi crypto space for users. Those looking for the best crypto to buy prior to another bull market will do well to buy MUTM.

Only brokers can now offer the new crypto-based products on the Russian market as management companies are explicitly prohibited from doing so. Russia to let investment funds buy crypto derivatives in the coming months The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) will authorize capital management firms to invest in crypto-linked instruments in 2026, according to one of its top executives. They are currently banned from buying such derivatives with a regulatory act that needs to be amended to lift the restrictions, and the bank intends to make the necessary changes in the first quarter of the new year. Olga Shishlyannikova, director of the monetary authority’s Investment Finance Intermediation Department, made the announcement at a financial industry forum in Yekaterinburg. Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, organized by the Russian National Association of Securities Market Participants (NAUFOR), she told RBC Investments: “Amendments to the regulation are required. We plan to do this in the first quarter of next year. We will remove the provision that imposed the ban.” Shishlyannikova reminded that a similar ban for other participants in the market was repealed with a circular , as it had been imposed with one issued earlier. In the case with mutual investment funds, however, the regulator “cannot do this by letter, because we have a regulatory act,” that needs to be amended, she explained. Olga Shishlyannikova’s comments on the matter confirm an earlier statement by her deputy, Valery Krasinsky, who first announced that the CBR is considering the move. Speaking at a capital markets forum in September, he revealed the regulator intends to “level the playing field” for funds and let them offer investors crypto derivatives, just like brokers. At the time, Krasinsky pointed to the need to remove other regulatory obstacles, too, and approve a list of base assets for these instruments. Russia gradually opening its financial sector to crypto Among financial regulators in Moscow, the Bank of Russia is the most conservative institution when it comes to allowing crypto to circulate in the nation’s economy. But its stance has somewhat softened in the past months, especially after Russia started using cryptocurrencies in cross-border payments to circumvent Western financial restrictions. It also recognized Bitcoin as a high-return asset. In May 2025, the CBR allowed financial firms to offer derivative instruments, securities and digital financial assets tied to the prices of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). A number of major players in the sector, including Sberbank, the Moscow Exchange and the broker Finam, almost immediately announced offerings in the new niche such as Bitcoin futures . There are some strings attached, though. They must not provide actual delivery of the underlying assets. Also, they can be purchased only by “highly qualified” investors, both companies and individuals, meeting minimum income and asset standards. Furthermore, the products are currently available exclusively within an “experimental legal regime,” although the central bank recently urged lawmakers to adopt a dedicated law that comprehensively regulates crypto investments in 2026. Earlier in October, Deputy Governor Vladimir Chistyukhin unveiled the CBR’s plans to permit commercial banks to work with cryptocurrencies. A separate set of specific requirements and stringent rules will be introduced for them to reduce associated risks. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

It streamlines the process while keeping security and clarity for both sides. We’ve made it simple: sender selects amount and currency, and recipient enters their own details and wallet address — no need to create a WhiteBIT account. WB Checks are valid for 5 years until they expire, so recipients can claim their transfers whenever they need. A more flexible and premium way to transfer digital assets Transferring digital assets is often described as instant and seamless. In practice, it can still require negotiation: Which wallet are you using? Do you have an account here? Can you pass verification first? Or let’s do it tomorrow when everyone is available? These questions slow down even simple arrangements: sharing a project reward, reimbursing expenses, gifting digital assets, or settling up with a partner. WB Check was created for exactly these moments — when transferring assets should be simple and instant, without additional steps or registration. “WB Check continues our work on making digital asset tools more convenient and accessible for everyday use,” said Volodymyr Nosov, Founder and President of the W Group ecosystem, which includes WhiteBIT. “People should not have to change wallets or complete onboarding steps just to receive funds. Our goal is to develop solutions that support financial autonomy, encourage broader adoption of digital assets, and help shape a more mature and user-oriented financial culture.” How WB Check works 1. To create open Products —> U Finance” → “WB Checks — Choose the amount and select a security level: Revocable — no password required, the Sender can cancel the WB Check anytime before the recipient withdraws funds from it. Or Irrevocable — requires a 6-digit access code; cannot be canceled after creation. 2. Share — Send via link, email, or print a PDF/QR code. 3. Claim — Recipient enters their wallet address and receives the assets instantly. When WB Check is useful WB Check may be practical in situations like: ● Settling with partners across different time zones or outside traditional business hours ● Sending rewards or honorariums after events or collaborations ● Returning or reallocating funds without requiring the recipient to onboard to a specific platform ● Gifting crypto to someone who is just starting and may not want to choose a platform yet In other words, the tool adapts to different contexts and user preferences with an option to claim WB check anytime in a convenient way for the recipient. What makes WB Check unique While transferring crypto itself is not new, the format of a flexible, account-free on-demand transfer is. ● Instant transfer not limited by to workdays and hours ● Activate WB check at any crypto wallet, whenever and wherever recipient wants ● No need to enter recipient details and mess up with wallet address — recipient fills in this information themselves ● 5 years to activate ● Top-tier security, yet simple and easy to use Availability WB Check is now available to WhiteBIT users. WB Checks may be activated to compatible wallets and exchanges, subject to jurisdictional restrictions and platform terms. WB Check provides an option for cases where digital asset transfers should be simple, direct, and independent of platform boundaries or onboarding steps.

The initiative comes as the USDC stablecoin issuer’s stock dropped 12.2% on Wednesday to close at $86.2. Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) added 245,830 shares of Circle to its holdings, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) purchased 70,613 shares of the stablecoin issuer. The asset manager’s ARK Fintech innovation ETF (ARKF) also added 36,885 Circle shares to its holdings. Drop in Circle’s shares leads to massive investments Cathie Wood’s company has been rebalancing its portfolios in recent weeks by trimming some long-held positions and increasing its investments in more innovative firms, including Circle. The USDC issuer has also drawn sustained institutional interest this year, driven by the surge in institutional stablecoin adoption and Circle’s flurry of partnerships. The drop in Circle’s shares came despite the firm reporting strong third-quarter results on Wednesday. The firm’s founder and CEO, Jeremy Allaire, confirmed that Circle had made huge progress in delivering platforms to leading startups and financial firms. The USDC issuer saw its total revenue increase to around $740 million, representing a 66% year-over-year surge. The firm reported a net income increase to $214 million. On-chain data also revealed that USDC circulation reached $73.7 billion during the period, representing an 108% increase from the same time last year. Analysts at investment bank William Blair on Wednesday urged investors to double down on Circle’s stock to leverage its 12% drop in stock prices. The analysts rated the stock as outperforming in an equity research report released on Wednesday. They also acknowledged that Circle remains a leader in the industry as it builds out critical network infrastructure, including Circle Payments Network and Arc. The analysts also highlighted that building Circle positions on weakness in its share price comes with outlined key risks. The risks include regulatory uncertainty, industry fragmentation, inadequate stablecoin infrastructure, corporate inertia, intensifying competition, and potential pressure from lower interest rates. However, there are concerns that Circle’s dependency on interest from sources like short-term Treasury bills could face headwinds as markets adjust to a series of Federal Reserve rate cuts next year. Circle CFO Fox-Green refuted those concerns, saying that the USD issuer is well-positioned to grow even in a lower-rate environment. Fox-Green acknowledged that the company has been delivering sustained growth in the current rate-cutting cycle. He also argued that lower rates lead to greater economic activity, more risk-taking, and increased investments. Cathie Wood trims her investment in Bitcoin Cathie Wood’s company recently increased its investment in Ethereum-focused firms, including the purchase of 240,507 shares of Bitmine Immersion. The increased exposure followed Wood’s reduction of her long-term Bitcoin position, citing rising competition from stablecoins. Wood revealed last week that she has lowered her bullish case for Bitcoin by about $300,000 to $1.2 million by 2030. She noted that stablecoins were replacing the utility once envisioned for Bitcoin in emerging markets. “Stablecoins…are happening faster. They’re scaling faster. I think emerging markets are huge in this regard. And we’re starting to see institutions in the United States focused on new payment rails with stablecoins at the core.” – Cathie Wood , CEO of Ark Invest. The investment in Bitmine comes as the firm has positioned itself as an early leader in the Ethereum treasury space. The firm has seen a 700% surge in its shares year-to-date, increasing from around $5 to a record $161 in October, before settling in the mid-$50s. Lee revealed in Wood’s podcast last month that the ETH treasury company now ranks around the 470th largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The tech executive projects that Bitmine’s forthcoming staking solution could generate a 2.79% pre-tax yield. According to him, the yield would place Bitmine among the 800 most profitable companies in the country.

Bitcoin climbed from $101,000 to $104,000 within hours. Dogecoin posted a brief 5% gain before momentum stalled. Financial newsletters circulated claims that Americans earning under $100,000 annually could receive $2,000 payments linked to tariff revenues. The reports triggered immediate speculation among traders that recipients would allocate portions of these funds toward digital assets. Market participants responded swiftly to the possibility of retail cash inflows. Trading data confirmed the surge in activity. Binance recorded Bitcoin spot volume jumping from $8.3 billion to $11.1 billion during the rally period. The price movement occurred without accompanying news from regulatory bodies or major institutional announcements. Funding rates across major cryptocurrencies turned negative for nearly twelve hours, indicating forced liquidations of short positions contributed to the upward momentum. Billy Markus Offers Blunt Assessment Billy Markus, who created Dogecoin in 2013, commented on the market reaction through social media. He stated the response aligned with expectations, noting that observers anticipate these funds will be ”used stupidly.” His remarks reflected a common sentiment among cryptocurrency veterans regarding retail investor behaviour during stimulus-driven rallies. Dogecoin's 5% increase proved temporary. The meme coin remains 22% below its recent peak despite the rumour-fueled bounce. The broader market exhibited similar patterns, with initial enthusiasm followed by consolidation. The connection between government stimulus and cryptocurrency purchases has historical precedent. Previous rounds of direct payments to households in 2020 and 2021 corresponded with notable increases in crypto trading activity. Exchange data from those periods showed measurable upticks in new account registrations and deposit volumes. Rally Loses Steam Amid Range-Bound Trading Bitcoin's gains proved short-lived as the asset returned to familiar trading boundaries. The cryptocurrency continues moving within a $98,900 to $106,200 range. This represents a significant retreat from the late October high near $118,000. Derivatives markets showed modest liquidation activity totalling $58 million. This figure falls well below thresholds typically associated with sustained trend reversals. Market analysts noted the absence of panic selling or aggressive position closures during the rally. Stablecoin inflows to exchanges provided another indicator of limited conviction. These metrics increased just 0.7% for the week, suggesting traders did not rush to deploy additional capital despite the price movement. Stablecoin reserves on trading platforms typically surge ahead of major buying campaigns. The tariff-linked payout proposal lacks official confirmation from government sources. No legislation has been introduced to authorize such payments. Treasury Department representatives have not addressed the circulating reports.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-13 11:51:19

Looking at the top 100 coins, we find 80 of them in the red. Among these, Canton (CC) and Pump.fun (PUMP) saw double-digit drops. They’re down 11.6% and 10.2% to $0.1172 and $0.003883, respectively. When it comes to the green coins, Quant (QNT) rose the most: 7.9% to the price of $89.91. It’s followed by Zcash (ZEC) , which is up 4% to $89.91. While stocks have been reacting positively to the potential reopening of US government soon, the crypto market hasn’t been as easily moved and remains highly cautious. It continues to wait for clearer global macroeconomic and geopolitical signals. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s government is getting closer to integrating BTC into its national reserve strategy . Executive Yuan and Central Bank have agreed to evaluate the world’s number one crypto as a potential strategic asset and explore pilot holdings using seized BTC currently awaiting auction. Taiwan’s central bank and Executive Yuan are evaluating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, marking a major step. #Taiwan #Bitcoin https://t.co/M5QHzqeghp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 13, 2025 ‘Not Yet Ready to Confirm a Bullish Reversal’ According to Glassnode analysts, BTC remains in “a mild bearish phase.” It’s trading between $97,000 and $111,000, “with resistance near $116,000 marked by top-buyers’ supply cluster.” Both on-chain and off-chain signals show a consolidating market, “stabilizing yet not yet ready to confirm a bullish reversal,” the weekly report states. “Until renewed inflows or a clear macro catalyst emerge, Bitcoin appears bound to oscillate within this $97K–$111.9K corridor, with $100K remaining the psychological line of defence.” Stuck in Limbo #Bitcoin consolidates above $100k, with support near $100K and resistance at $106K.

Overall, volumes remain robust,” Waisman said in an email comment. Source: Mercuryo October’s Black Friday crypto crash affected 1.6 million traders and wiped nearly $800 billion from market cap, the exec highlighted. It also “hit leveraged traders the hardest.” $19 billion in positions were liquidated. However, “retail spot traders are showing notable resilience despite recent price falls.” Per Waisman, “what we’re observing may indicate that retail investors are increasingly focused on long-term accumulation rather than speculative, short-term trading.” “Some might say sentiment has rarely been more divided on the future price trajectory of the cryptocurrency market. In the face of such uncertainty, some retail investors appear to be placing regular buy orders as part of a more disciplined, long-term strategy,” he concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC trades at $103,080. The coin has seen a plunge from the highest daily point of $105,257 to the low of $100,992. It has recovered somewhat since. BTC is now down 0.4% in a week, 8.3% in a week, and 18.3% from its all-time high. Looking ahead, if BTC slips below $99,200, it may lead to a deeper pullback toward $96,200 and then $93,400, which is a stronger historical support. If it moves above $104,000, the coin could see a rally toward $107,500 and $110,900. Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,502. Like BTC, ETH plunged from the intraday high of $3,583 to the intraday low of $3,374. Unlike BTC, ETH recovered better, even appreciating over the past day. It’s now up 3.1% in a week, down 12.9% in a week, and down 29.2% from its ATH. ETH found support at the $3,200 level over the past few days. Should it drop below this level, it could pull back further towards $3,000. However, a bullish momentum would see the price above $3,700 and possibly $3,850. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has decreased very again, keeping a firm place within the fear zone. The crypto fear and greed index fell to 25 today , compared to 26 seen this time a day ago. It seems quite clear that investors and traders await additional signals that would indicate the market’s near-term trajectory. That said, the prices being pulled down presents a buying opportunity for the long-term holders. ETFs Return to Red The green ETF fields didn’t last long. On Wednesday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $277.98 million in outflows, following a single day of notable inflows. The total net inflow is back down to $60.21 billion, but it still stands above $60 billion. Four of the 12 BTC ETFs saw outflows, and there were no inflows. Fidelity’s outflows are the highest, standing at $132.86 million. It’s followed by Ark&21Shares’ $85.18 million. At the same time, the US ETH ETFs continued their outflow streak, recording another $183.77 million leaving on 12 November. Therefore, the total net inflow pulled back again, now to $13.57 billion. Of the nine funds, four recorded negative flows, and none saw positive flows. BlackRock and Grayscale let go of the most of this amount. The former said goodbye to $91 million and the latter to $49.35 million. Meanwhile, crypto fund manager Canary Capital has filed to launch the first US ETF tied directly to MOG Coin , a memecoin on the Ethereum network. This is the Canary’s debut launching a fund to track the price of a memecoin. The investment firm formally submitted S1 registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . As the US government is expected to reopen, the SEC will be back to deciding on the ETFs submission, including a number of XRP-linked ETFs.

Wall Street giant Bernstein has some reassuring news that might change your perspective. Despite recent price fluctuations, the asset manager confirms that Circle fundamentals remain remarkably solid, with USDC maintaining its competitive advantage in the crowded stablecoin market. Why are Circle fundamentals so strong despite market headwinds? Bernstein’s latest analysis reveals that Circle’s core business metrics tell a different story than the stock price might suggest. The company reported staggering third-quarter revenue of $740 million, significantly outpacing market expectations. This performance demonstrates the underlying strength of Circle fundamentals even during challenging market conditions. The asset manager identified several key factors supporting this positive assessment: Exceptional revenue growth exceeding projections Sustainable profitability improvements Strategic expansion into blockchain infrastructure Robust USDC adoption and usage What gives USDC its competitive edge in the stablecoin wars? While competitors like Stripe enter the stablecoin space, Bernstein emphasizes that Circle fundamentals include one crucial advantage that’s hard to replicate: superior liquidity. USDC’s deep liquidity pools and widespread exchange support create a powerful network effect that strengthens its market position. Moreover, the company continues to innovate with new products and services. The launch of ARC, Circle’s proprietary Layer 1 network, represents another strategic move that enhances the overall Circle fundamentals. This infrastructure development positions the company for long-term growth beyond simple stablecoin issuance. How does Bernstein view Circle’s investment potential? Bernstein maintains its Outperform rating on Circle with a $230 price target, signaling strong confidence in the company’s future prospects. The analysis suggests that current market conditions may present a buying opportunity for investors who recognize the solid Circle fundamentals. The asset manager specifically highlighted several growth drivers: Expanding stablecoin payment monetization opportunities Growing institutional adoption of USDC Potential regulatory clarity benefits Blockchain infrastructure development What challenges could impact Circle fundamentals? While the overall outlook remains positive, Bernstein acknowledges increasing competition in the stablecoin sector. However, the analysis suggests that Circle fundamentals are strong enough to withstand these challenges. The company’s first-mover advantage, established partnerships, and regulatory compliance provide significant barriers to entry for newcomers. The key differentiator remains USDC’s liquidity advantage, which becomes more valuable as the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures. This aspect of Circle fundamentals creates a virtuous cycle where more usage leads to better liquidity, which in turn attracts more users. Conclusion: Why Circle fundamentals matter for crypto investors Bernstein’s comprehensive analysis provides compelling evidence that Circle fundamentals remain robust despite short-term market volatility. The combination of strong financial performance, strategic innovation, and USDC’s liquidity advantage positions the company for sustained growth. For investors seeking exposure to the stablecoin sector, understanding these Circle fundamentals could be the key to making informed decisions in a rapidly evolving market. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bernstein’s current rating on Circle? Bernstein maintains an Outperform rating on Circle with a $230 price target, indicating strong confidence in the company’s long-term prospects. How does USDC maintain its competitive advantage? USDC’s primary competitive edge comes from its superior liquidity, which creates network effects that are difficult for newcomers to replicate quickly. What was Circle’s third-quarter revenue performance? Circle reported $740 million in third-quarter revenue, significantly exceeding market expectations and demonstrating strong fundamental performance. How is Circle expanding beyond stablecoin issuance? Circle is developing its proprietary Layer 1 blockchain network called ARC, representing strategic expansion into blockchain infrastructure. What makes Circle fundamentals resilient during market volatility? Circle’s diverse revenue streams, growing USDC adoption, and infrastructure development create multiple growth drivers that support stability. How does Circle plan to monetize stablecoin payments? The company is developing various payment solutions and enterprise services that leverage USDC’s position in the digital payments ecosystem. Found this analysis of Circle fundamentals helpful?

US President Donald Trump has officially signed a temporary funding bill to end the federal government shutdown, ending the longest government shutdown in history at 43 days. With the government's resumption of operations, budget implementation and public services will resume. At this point, markets are also waiting for policy uncertainty to diminish and important economic data to be released again. According to NBC News, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing that key economic data such as the October CPI and employment report likely will not be released. “Democrats have done lasting damage to the federal statistical system. The October Consumer Price Index (CPI) and employment report are likely to be withheld, and the credibility of all future economic data has been shaken.” While economists were already predicting that the October CPI indicator might not be released, Goldman Sachs also stated that they agreed. Accordingly, Goldman Sachs analysts said that the release of key macro indicators, including the October Consumer Price Index (CPI), will be difficult. President Trump signed the temporary budget bill that officially ended the government shutdown, but it will take time for the process to return to normal, according to analysts. “The Bureau of Labor Statistics will announce a new schedule for the release of indicators. The release of other key economic indicators may also be delayed sequentially,” Goldman Sachs said. As is known, October CPI data is expected to be announced today. *This is not investment advice.

Large-scale investors are executing one of the most significant Bitcoin whale accumulation events of the year, purchasing over $4.6 billion worth of BTC despite the range-bound price action. What Does Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Tell Us? Recent data reveals that Bitcoin whale accumulation reached extraordinary levels this week. According to Timothy Messier, head of BRN Research, whales purchased 45,000 BTC worth $4.6 billion. This represents the second-largest weekly accumulation so far this year. More importantly, a substantial portion of these assets moved from exchanges to cold wallets. This movement suggests institutional buying rather than short-term trading. When whales move Bitcoin to cold storage, they typically plan to hold for extended periods. Why Are Whales Accumulating During Range-Bound Trading? You might wonder why significant Bitcoin whale accumulation occurs during sideways market conditions. Several factors explain this behavior: Strategic positioning during price consolidation phases Long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value Institutional allocation despite short-term volatility Dollar-cost averaging strategies during stable periods The current Bitcoin whale accumulation pattern indicates that large investors see current levels as attractive entry points. Their actions often precede significant price movements. How Does Macroeconomic Context Affect Bitcoin? Glassnode analysts note that despite positive macroeconomic shifts, the range-bound market could continue. The end of the U.S. government shutdown and easing U.S.-China trade tensions haven’t immediately translated into Bitcoin price breakthroughs. However, the ongoing Bitcoin whale accumulation suggests institutional investors anticipate future catalysts. Their buying behavior often signals confidence in Bitcoin’s medium to long-term prospects, regardless of short-term price action. What Can Retail Investors Learn From Whale Behavior? The current Bitcoin whale accumulation provides valuable insights for all market participants. When whales accumulate during consolidation phases, they typically expect significant future price appreciation. Their actions often serve as leading indicators for market direction. Monitoring Bitcoin whale accumulation patterns can help retail investors understand market sentiment among large players. The movement to cold wallets particularly indicates strong conviction rather than speculative positioning. Conclusion: Reading the Whale Signals The substantial Bitcoin whale accumulation during range-bound trading reveals underlying market strength. While prices remain stable, institutional and large-scale investors are building substantial positions. This behavior suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition despite short-term uncertainty. The movement of $4.6 billion in Bitcoin to cold storage indicates these investors plan to hold through potential volatility. Their actions provide a compelling narrative of underlying demand that could eventually translate into price appreciation. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin whale accumulation? Bitcoin whale accumulation refers to large-scale investors purchasing significant amounts of Bitcoin, typically indicating strong institutional interest and long-term holding intentions. Why does whale accumulation matter during range-bound trading? When whales accumulate during sideways markets, it suggests they see current prices as attractive entry points and anticipate future price appreciation beyond the current trading range. How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can monitor whale activity through blockchain analytics platforms like Glassnode and through exchange flow data that shows movements between hot and cold wallets. Does whale accumulation guarantee price increases? While not a guarantee, significant whale accumulation historically often precedes price rallies as it reduces available supply and indicates strong demand from sophisticated investors. What’s the difference between whale accumulation and regular buying? Whale accumulation involves much larger quantities, often moved to cold storage for long-term holding, whereas regular buying might include smaller amounts for trading or short-term purposes. How does institutional buying affect Bitcoin’s market structure? Institutional buying through whale accumulation typically brings more stability to the market and reduces volatility over time as these investors tend to hold through price fluctuations.

The relocation was earlier confirmed in a regulatory filing, revealing that a majority of the company’s stockholders supported the decision to reincorporate in Texas. Coinbase’s Texas Relocation The exchange’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to highlight that Coinbase is not alone in this transition, stating, “We surely won’t be the last.” He emphasized that the trend reflects a reversion to a free market economy in both regulation and judicial review. Competition between states, Grewal argued, fosters a healthy environment for businesses and innovators pursuing ambitious goals. He praised Texas’s corporate legal framework for its “efficiency, predictability, and fairness,” asserting that these qualities make it an ideal home for the company’s incorporation. Grewal reaffirmed Coinbase’s commitment to enhancing economic freedom through the development of the on-chain economy , noting that this move is aligned with that mission. Texas has increasingly become an attractive destination for US corporations seeking a favorable business climate, characterized by advantageous tax regulations, lighter oversight, and new laws that establish specialized business courts. Over recent years, several companies have opted to move their legal headquarters out of Delaware, a phenomenon some have termed “Dexit.” Other firms, such as Trump Media & Technology , have chosen to relocate to states like Florida, while others have incorporated in Nevada. CLO Praises Texas For Business Stability Grewal, in a recent article for the Wall Street Journal, pointed out that Delaware has historically been known for its “reliable” court outcomes and respect for corporate board decisions. However, he noted a trend of unpredictable results from Delaware’s Chancery Court in recent years. Although state legislators have attempted to address these inconsistencies, Grewal believes the efforts have not sufficed for businesses seeking stability. He underscored Texas’s promise of efficiency and predictability, highlighting the state’s new Business Court system as a vital factor in creating an inviting legal landscape for companies. Coinbase’s announcement comes at a busy time, as the exchange also revealed this week the launch of a new platform designed to allow retail investors to buy digital tokens before they are officially listed on the exchange. In another significant development, a Coinbase spokesperson confirmed that the exchange has officially halted its acquisition discussions with UK-based stablecoin startup BVNK. The decision to end negotiations follows Coinbase securing exclusive negotiation rights with BVNK after going through a competitive bidding process.

The competition aimed to spread blockchain and Web3 knowledge among university students through a dynamic quiz format that combined learning and entertainment. Designed to foster digital literacy, creativity, and innovation, the program engaged Vietnam’s youth while promoting collaboration between academia, enterprises, and government institutions. A Milestone for Web3 Education in Vietnam The Web3 Bell Challenge was hosted at the University of Danang – University of Science and Education, attracting over 300 attendees, including students, lecturers, business representatives, media, and officials from the Danang Department of Science and Technology. The initiative featured three main stages: Online Launch and Registration (Oct. 16–21) – More than 340 students registered during the opening period following the campaign’s online launch. Online Preliminary Round (Oct. 21) – Over 200 participants completed an online test on blockchain and Web3 fundamentals, with the top 100 advancing.

54346390,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89495,1763035230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is Already Beating ASTER &TON as 2025’s Top Trending Crypto [Whitelist Live Now],https://timestabloid.com/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp-is-already-beating-aster-ton/,"Aster and Toncoin are both showing technical signs of life, but price action alone doesn’t make a project the top trending crypto for 2025. Especially, when one competitor project has raised the bar by building the entire foundation before launch. While ASTER forms bullish patterns and TON clings to its $2.00 support, neither project has yet shown the kind of structural progress that defines long-term winners. In contrast, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) has already poured $100 million into development, prepared $17 million worth of hardware for rollout, and opened its whitelist, all before selling a single token. It’s not riding hype, It’s building from the ground up. And in the years to come, that may be the difference between a coin that pumps and one that leads. ASTER: Promising Pattern, But Still Waiting for a Breakout ASTER has seen some technical excitement lately. Traders point to something called the “Power of 3” pattern , a cycle that includes accumulation, a shake-out phase, and then, if all goes well, an expansion. ASTER recently traded between $1.52 and $2.28 before dipping as low as $1.10, raising concerns. The bulls are now watching one key level: $1.80. That’s where the 100-hour moving average sits. If ASTER can close above that with strength, the path could open toward $2.28, maybe even $3.41 if the pattern plays out fully. But if it can’t hold support around $1.52, the bullish setup may weaken. For now, ASTER is stuck in a waiting game. It’s showing potential, but it hasn’t broken out yet. That makes it hard to call it the top trending crypto for 2025 just yet. TON: Holding the Line, But Needing a Spark TON, also known as Toncoin, is in a similar spot. After briefly dipping below the key $2.00 support level, it bounced back, showing that buyers are still active. That bounce was small, with a modest 3% push to $2.12. But price indicators still show weakness, and the charts are sitting below important moving averages. Right now, $2.35 is the level to watch. If TON can move above that and close strong, a new uptrend could begin. If not, and if it loses the $2.00 support for good, analysts suggest it could slide toward $1.85 or lower. So while TON has a loyal base and technical structure to build from, it’s still lacking that big catalyst, the thing that could put it ahead as a top trending crypto for 2025 . Until then, it remains in a holding pattern. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP): Building Before the Buzz Now contrast that with ZKP. This project hasn’t even started its presale auction yet, the whitelist is open , but the actual auction is still a few days away. Despite that, ZKP is already being talked about as a top trending crypto for 2025 because of one major difference: it’s not starting from scratch. The team behind ZKP has already invested over $100 million of their own capital into building the project, before selling a single token. This level of self-funding is rare in crypto and gives ZKP a huge head start. They’ve already completed their infrastructure plans, including an Initial Coin Auction (ICA) system where every buyer, big or small, enters through the same rules. There are no private allocations, no VCs, and no insider discounts. The entire structure is designed to prevent unfair advantages. And when the auction goes live, something else happens: over $17 million worth of Proof Pods (ZKP’s AI compute hardware) will be available for users to purchase, shipping globally within 5 days. That means people can actually use ZKP tech on Day 1. Very few crypto projects, especially ones in presale, can say the same. It’s this level of readiness and structure that’s turning heads. Even without a token price to track or an exchange listing to hype, ZKP is being watched more closely than many live tokens. That’s why it’s climbing every radar as a top trending crypto for 2025 , not because of media noise, but because it’s already built. The Last Line The real story here isn’t about price predictions or technical patterns. It’s about who’s actually building something that lasts. ASTER and TON may have strong communities and decent upside setups, but both are waiting for something external to trigger growth, whether that’s a breakout on the charts or a new narrative push. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) on the other hand, doesn’t need that. It’s launching with everything already in place: real infrastructure, a fair distribution system, and ready-to-ship hardware. It’s what happens when a crypto team focuses more on architecture than attention. And that’s exactly the kind of foundation that could fuel the top trending crypto for 2025 in the months to come. The crypto space is full of coins reacting to the market. ZKP is one of the few actually shaping what comes next. That’s why it’s gaining early traction, and why you’ll likely keep hearing its name.

The deal would offer U.S. asset management GIP a 50% share in ACS’s Digital & Energy division, in light of the growing demand for AI infrastructure. On Thursday, the Spanish financial newspaper Expansión reported that the deal will consist of €18 billion in debt and €5 billion in share capital that will be provided gradually. According to the report, ACS aimed to have a data center company worth between €3 and €5 billion. The report claimed that the alleged partnership with GIP would place ACS at the high end of that range. ACS, GIP, and Daikin expand AI infrastructure According to Expansión newspaper, the Spanish construction company intends to revise its data center strategy during an investor day on Friday. Earlier this year, ACS planned to sell its stake in the data center business to GIP. According to El Economista report, ACS is in advanced talks to offer GIP, a 50% share in its data center and energy platform. According to the report, as a result of the agreement, ACS could secure more than €1 billion ($1.16 billion) from the stake sale. Last month, the consortium comprising MGX, BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), and the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP) announced a $40 billion acquisition of U.S. data center startup Aligned, with about 80 locations to secure coveted artificial intelligence (AI) computing capacity. Cryptopolitan reported that the consortium revealed that it will acquire Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie Asset Management and other co-investors. According to the report, the consortium intends to establish Aligned Data Centers as a key component of next-generation compute infrastructure to enable large-scale AI workloads throughout North and Latin America. “With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI.” – Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock. Notably, AIP intends to invest $30 billion in stock, with the potential to add debt, aiming for a total of $100 billion. The investments are designed to support the global expansion of digital capacity. Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, Managing Director and Chief Executive of MGX and Vice Chairman of AIP, stated that the acquisition of Aligned is a crucial milestone in AIP’s strategy to invest $30 billion in equity and develop global AI infrastructure. The Consortium stated that the investment will provide Aligned Data Centers with the funds and strategic support to accelerate expansion. On August 6, Daikin Applied announced the completion of the acquisition of DDC Solutions, a San Diego-based manufacturer of ultra-high-density cooling cabinets and data center management software. According to the announcement, the purchase shows Daikin Applied’s dedication to offering comprehensive data center cooling solutions and adds in-room, rack-level white space cooling solutions to the company’s data center-focused portfolio. DDC Solutions revealed that the company will function as a subsidiary of Daikin Applied. Additionally, the entire executive team of DDC Solutions will continue in their current positions. ACS-GIP deal shows global AI infrastructure boom Spain’s ACS partnership with GIP to develop data centers comes amid a boom in AI infrastructure in the UAE and globally. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, G42, an Abu Dhabi-based technology holding company focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, partnered with SoftBank Group, OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia to establish Stargate UAE, a one-gigawatt computer cluster, in May. The Stargate UAE will function in the emirate’s 5GW UAE-US AI Campus. According to the report, G42 data center campus will use Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell GB300 systems, which make up around 20% of the complex’s overall scope. The G42 data center is anticipated to launch in 2026. Last month, Morgan Stanley estimated that major tech companies will invest $400 billion in AI infrastructure this year. Get seen where it counts.

Here’s the Price Target,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-spots-xrp-buy-signal-heres-the-price-target/,"A quiet but powerful signal is emerging on XRP’s daily chart. Traders closely watching momentum indicators believe a fresh rally could be near. Technical strength appears to be building beneath the surface, and analysts say the signs are becoming impossible to ignore. According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, XRP’s daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just broken beyond its descending trendline . Steph highlighted the pattern on X, describing it as a “massive buy signal.” Similar RSI breakouts in past months preceded strong upside moves. In March 2025, XRP rallied sharply after a comparable RSI trendline break. Another breakout in June triggered another wave of bullish momentum. Steph’s latest observation suggests the pattern may now be repeating, signaling renewed buying pressure in the market. #XRP Buy Signal! pic.twitter.com/4D0obEFe4V — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 12, 2025 Technical Context Supports the Signal The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures buying and selling strength. When it breaks a downward trendline, it often signals that bulls are regaining control. Technical traders interpret this as a confirmation that the price could soon follow momentum higher. Analysts point to $2.60 as the first major confirmation level. A daily close above that mark could validate Steph’s bullish signal. The next resistance zones sit between $2.80 and $3.10, levels that have historically triggered profit-taking and short-term pauses. Potential Price Targets and Liquidity Zones If the RSI breakout translates into a sustained rally, XRP could test higher liquidity levels. Market mappers identify heavy clusters between $3.50 and $4.00. These regions often attract institutional volume and act as natural price magnets during strong momentum phases. Some analysts view $4.00 as the realistic medium-term target if bullish sentiment continues. Such a move would mirror XRP’s earlier RSI breakouts, each of which produced double-digit percentage gains within weeks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Managing the Risks Despite the bullish setup, caution remains essential. False breakouts can trap impatient traders when the price fails to confirm the RSI signal. A rejection below $2.60 could push XRP back toward key supports at $2.10 and $1.80. Experienced traders recommend waiting for a daily close above resistance before committing heavily. Proper position sizing and stop placement are critical to avoid being caught in short-term volatility. Outlook: Confirmation Is Key Steph’s RSI breakout signal places XRP in a potentially explosive position. A confirmed close above $2.60 would strengthen the bullish outlook and open the door to $3.10 or higher. However, without follow-through, the signal could fade as quickly as it formed. Traders should combine momentum analysis with a disciplined strategy. If momentum holds, XRP may soon begin a powerful new phase of upward movement.

Early Whales Trigger Market Anxiety Blockchain data reveals several wallets from the 1990s transferring thousands of Bitcoin in recent weeks. A notable case involved an early miner moving 3,500 BTC, worth $361 million, followed by similar sales totaling more than $1 billion. These sell-offs may weaken near-term support around $105,000–$106,000, already a key technical ceiling. SATOSHI ERA WHALE JUST SOLD ALL HIS BITCOINS AFTER 15 YEARS OF HOLD HE SOLD $1.5B WORTH OF $BTC pic.twitter.com/w21nlLAhej — Jason Ai. Williams (@GoingParabolic) November 12, 2025 Market strategist Ted Pillows pointed out that despite $530 million in ETF inflows, Bitcoin still dropped—evidence that whale selling is overpowering institutional demand. He cautioned that without a strong recovery above $108,000, BTC could revisit the $99,000–$100,000 range. Whale transactions from 2010–2012 wallets exceeded $2 billion in October alone. ETF inflows remain positive, but market liquidity is thinning around $103K. On-chain activity suggests redistribution, not panic selling. Long-Term Holders Shift Focus Erik Voorhees, founder of ShapeShift and early Bitcoin investor, explained that veteran holders aren’t motivated by short-term gains. “They don’t view $100,000 as significant. Bitcoin is the asset they measure value in,” he said. For these early adopters, BTC’s utility as a decentralized financial system outweighs its temporary price fluctuations. Voorhees added that not every old-wallet movement represents selling; some may reflect custody restructuring or long-term storage updates, often misinterpreted by analysts tracking whale behavior. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Eyes Breakout Above $103K as Triangle Pattern Tightens While selling from early holders adds short-term pressure, it also signals maturity in the Bitcoin market. These long-dormant coins are finding new owners, potentially through ETFs or institutional channels, broadening market depth. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview As the technical picture tightens within a symmetrical triangle near $103,000, traders are watching for a breakout toward $107,500 or a pullback toward $99,200. Yet many analysts see this as a natural phase of redistribution before Bitcoin’s next expansion cycle. If momentum aligns with improving liquidity and renewed ETF demand, Bitcoin could retest $116,000 by year-end, reaffirming its long-term bullish structure. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $27 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013265 before the next increase.

54346804,627126,1763036075,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54346804.jpeg,Trump Ends Shutdown; Crypto Rebounds As Bitcoin Hyper’s Best Presale Gains Traction,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-ends-shutdown-crypto-rebounds-bitcoin-hyper-best-presale/,"Quick Facts: The 43-day U.S. government shutdown ended with a 222–209 House vote and a presidential signature, easing macro headwinds for risk assets. As traders priced back in, top cryptos saw a measured rebound. The growing market optimism has also sent the $HYPER presale past $27M, with its upcoming Layer-2 solution fueling a buying frenzy. U.S. President Donald Trump has signed a bill to reopen the federal government after a 43-day shutdown, after the House cleared it with a 222–209 vote. The crypto market welcomed the news with enthusiasm. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP edged higher as markets priced in the return of delayed data releases, payments, and government services. It wasn’t a breakout rally, and the assets have retreated again, but it showed a clear move away from headline risk. For crypto, the takeaway is simple: the macro uncertainty that limited inflows is easing. Liquidity is coming back to on-ramps affected by the pause in agency operations. And if fiscal talks stay on track, risk sentiment into year-end should be more stable. The intraday pop across majors won’t decide the cycle. What matters is where new capital rotates as traders reassess the landscape. For small retail traders diversifying their altcoins, early signs point toward a new Bitcoin-linked Layer-2 project, Bitcoin Hyper . Speed, fees, and programmability are still the bottlenecks for everyday Bitcoin use. That’s the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is built to close. The timing helps. With the shutdown over as of November 13 and a modest market rebound underway, the best crypto presales tied to tangible network utility stand out. When traders shift from defensive positioning to selective risk-taking, they look for projects that offer something beyond hype. In a modest rebound like this, tokens linked to real network utility – not just sentiment – tend to stand out. They fit the narrative of “early but grounded,” giving investors a way to position for the next leg of the cycle without chasing overstretched majors. Bitcoin Hyper’s Pitch is Exactly That Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) sets out to bring Solana-level throughput and smart contracts to the $BTC economy, while keeping security anchored to Bitcoin’s base layer. Traders want the speed and flexibility where the deepest liquidity sits. $HYPER proposes a Layer 2 with an SVM execution setup, a canonical BTC bridge, and periodic settlement on Bitcoin’s L1 supported by zero-knowledge proofs. In practice, this creates: Near-instant finality for transfers, Low fees for dApps, And a path for DEX activity and payments without giving up the secure settlement that defines Bitcoin. As a BTC-anchored Layer 2 that can support the broader Web3 market, Bitcoin Hyper is trending among early backers. And for good reason: using SVM reduces barriers for developers already building on Solana, and can potentially turn Bitcoin into the next crypto hub for innovation. Participants are treating the presale as an early expression of that thesis. The raise is now past $27M, with the token priced at $0.013265. Read our ‘ How to Buy $HYPER Guide ’ for detailed presale instructions. These figures point to consistent participation across stages, not a one-off burst. Visit Bitcoin Hyper to learn more . Over $27M Raised: Why $HYPER Tokens Is a Must-Watch This Week The $HYPER token powers fees, governance, and locking on Bitcoin Hyper’s upcoming Layer-2 ecosystem. So the growing presale traction from both retail and whale investors makes sense. For instance, the presale has seen purchases worth $379.9K , $274K , and $161.3K in single transactions, signalling high conviction. Investors can also grow their presale investment by locking in the presale tokens, now at 43% staking APY. This gives a passive income route while they wait for the TGE and listings. But keep in mind that the APY will taper off as more investors join in. In other words, the earlier you join the presale, the higher the staking APY. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction sees the token potentially raking in 24x gains in 2025, and climbing much higher over the coming years if milestones land and liquidity conditions stay supportive. The forecast suggests appealing asymmetry, with the usual reminder that presales involve volatility, schedules can move, and early liquidity varies by listing. If the shutdown situation stays resolved into Q4 and the crypto market builds momentum, Bitcoin Hyper could potentially be headed for moonshot moves. Join Bitcoin Hyper’s presale today.

The rise in developer activity, along with a steady increase in active addresses, has strengthened calls for another major rally. As interest returns to Ethereum-based projects, one name repeatedly catching the community’s attention is Remittix (RTX) — a fast-growing PayFi network that integrates directly with blockchain infrastructure like Ethereum, reflecting the growing utility narrative driving crypto markets into 2025. Ethereum Price Prediction: Momentum Builds Ahead Of Next Breakout Ethereum is currently selling at $3,425.91 following a loss of about 0.95% in the last 24 hours with a market cap of about $414.36 billion. Thus, while the short-term rise isn’t particularly significant, the fundamentals indicate that Ethereum is preparing for a significant recovery. Increased gas charge usage and validator participation are two examples of on-chain metrics that show an increase in network activity. These improvements align with predictions that Ethereum Price Prediction targets are positioned above current resistance zones, signaling renewed investor confidence. Analysts also allude to the robust performance of projects built on Ethereum’s architecture, from decentralized exchanges to new cross-chain DeFi solutions, as evidence of sustained adoption. On-chain data points to increased network activity — including higher gas fee utilization and expanding validator participation. These developments align with forecasts that place Ethereum Price Prediction targets above current resistance zones, signaling renewed investor confidence. Remittix: The PayFi Project Making Waves On Ethereum Among a fresh wave of projects currently gaining traction, Remittix has become one of the most talked-about Ethereum-based DeFi projects of the last few months. At $0.1166 per token, this project has already managed to raise over $28 million in private funding and secure its position as a fast-rising fintech solution within crypto. Remittix makes direct crypto-to-fiat transfers possible to bank accounts in more than 30 countries, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain. The Remittix Beta Wallet testing program is currently expanding to include more iOS users, allowing the community to provide feedback that shapes the platform’s final release. The project’s credibility received another boost after the Remittix team became fully verified by CertiK, ranking #1 globally for pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet. This recognition strengthens confidence in RTX’s transparency and technical integrity. The Core Pillars of Remittix’s Rapid Ascent: $28 million + raised through private funding Crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries Beta Wallet testing expanding to more users weekly CertiK-verified and ranked #1 pre-launch project $250,000 Remittix Giveaway rewarding active participants The Broader Picture: Ethereum’s Network Fuels Real Utility Ethereum’s continued expansion in transaction activity, Layer-2 scaling, and real-world integrations indicates that this Ethereum Price Prediction cycle could be defined by utility-driven growth.

However, the billionaire said that he was not involved and has no ties with the exchange. After an unknown whale caused chaos on Hyperliquid , the crypto community did not see it as a random liquidation but a deliberate stress test or attack aimed at destabilizing Hyperliquid’s liquidity system. To that end, the community pointed at CZ. However, he responded to the speculation saying , “Glad to know I live rent free in your head but I have not used any other CEX for 8 years.” Still, the community is not buying it. One of the X users said that he could have instructed someone else to manipulate the market on his behalf. Another wrote , “He denies everything. lol. Look no further than his last week’s interview. He denied no business dealing with WLFI even after a clear business deal in place with WFLI on USD1. Denying the truth is no big deal for this dude.” Crypto community urge to move funds from Hyperliquid As a result of the attack, the crypto community has begun to urge each other to withdraw their funds from Hyperliquid. According to them, this is not the first incident on Hyperliquid this year, raising new questions about how the exchange handles liquidity concentration and systemic risk. One user said , “Only $5M and they’ve had to stop withdrawals […] The hyperfags are in full panic mode.” Last month, Hyperliquid experienced the highest dollar-value trades liquidated during a 24-hour selloff, totaling $10 billion, although it’s smaller than its competitor, Binance. The exchange struggled with low liquidity and prolonged liquidation times. The panic selling overwhelmed Hyperliquid’s order books, which were designed for fast and high-volume perpetual trading on its Layer 1 chain. Meanwhile, Dune data shows Binance dominates spot volume. However, Hyperliquid’s share remains under 10% despite steady growth through mid-2025. POPCAT crashes over 20% in hours after the attack As reported by Cryptopolitan, a whale withdrew $3M USDC from OKX and split the funds across 19 wallets on Hyperliquid. He started opening massive long positions on POPCAT. To create the illusion of strong demand, he placed a huge buy wall at $0.21, with $30 million worth of orders sitting on the book. However, without warning, the wall was removed. The price instantly collapsed. This resulted in long liquidations for their own position and all other traders. The trader lost his $3M collateral, and Hyperliquid’s HLP system automatically absorbed the open positions. This resulted in an additional $4.9 million loss to HLP and triggered a deeper selloff across the token. Previously, POPCAT has been experiencing long-term declines, characterized by extended periods of low trading activity. However, yesterday POPCAT saw its volumes rise by 10X, up to $230M. The price of the token has declined by 25% in the last 24 hours. The token is trading at $0.1244. CZ to debate Peter Schiff on Bitcoin vs tokenized gold While the attack on CZ and Binance ensues, the exchange has revealed a debate between Zhao and Peter Schiff , a gold advocate and economist. It will happen on December 4 as part of Binance Blockchain Week 2025, which will run from December 3 to 4 at the Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai. The debate will focus on Bitcoin vs. tokenized gold. The two bulls, one in gold and one in crypto, will separately give their reasons for supporting their respective assets. This argument began on X, where CZ voiced worries about Peter Schiff’s idea for tokenized gold. He pointed out that it would depend on third-party administrators and called it a “trust me bro” token. Peter Schiff replied by challenging CZ to a discussion about Bitcoin vs. tokenized gold to learn more about their different points of view. CZ said yes to the offer and suggested that Binance Blockchain Week take place in Dubai.

The central bank recently revealed it has built a $1 million pilot portfolio containing Bitcoin and U.S. dollar-based stablecoins. This groundbreaking move represents one of the most significant endorsements of digital assets by a European central bank to date. Why is the Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio so important? The Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio initiative marks a pivotal moment in the relationship between traditional financial institutions and emerging digital assets. According to CoinDesk reports, the bank created this experimental portfolio specifically to gain firsthand experience with blockchain technology. This hands-on approach allows them to understand how these assets could potentially transform payment systems and financial infrastructure in the coming years. The bank emphasized several key aspects of this pilot program: The $1 million investment represents a testing phase only No immediate plans exist to increase the total amount The portfolio exists separately from traditional reserves Focus remains on educational and experimental purposes What does this mean for cryptocurrency adoption? This Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio sends powerful signals across global financial markets. When a national central bank allocates resources to understand blockchain assets, it demonstrates serious consideration of the technology’s potential. The move suggests that even conservative financial institutions recognize they cannot ignore the digital asset revolution. Moreover, the inclusion of stablecoins alongside Bitcoin shows comprehensive thinking. The bank appears to be studying both the speculative and practical applications of blockchain technology. Stablecoins offer insights into how traditional currencies might function on blockchain networks, while Bitcoin represents the store-of-value aspect. How does this align with global central bank trends? The Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio places the institution among a growing number of central banks exploring digital assets. However, their approach differs significantly from central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects. Rather than creating their own digital currency, they’re experimenting with existing crypto assets. This practical approach offers several advantages: Real-world experience with actual market conditions Technical understanding of blockchain infrastructure Risk assessment capabilities for future regulations Competitive positioning in European financial innovation What challenges might the Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio face? While innovative, this Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio initiative faces several potential hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant concern across global cryptocurrency markets. Price volatility could affect the portfolio’s value, though the relatively small size minimizes systemic risk. The bank must also navigate: Security concerns around digital asset storage Public perception and potential criticism Technical complexity of blockchain integration Evolving international regulatory frameworks What can we learn from this development? The Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio represents more than just a financial investment—it’s a strategic move toward financial innovation. By taking this measured approach, the bank positions itself at the forefront of understanding how blockchain technology might reshape global finance. This initiative demonstrates that even traditional financial institutions recognize the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies. The knowledge gained from this Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio will likely influence future policy decisions, regulatory frameworks, and potentially even the development of national digital currency strategies. Frequently Asked Questions How large is the Czech central bank Bitcoin portfolio? The pilot portfolio totals $1 million, with allocations to both Bitcoin and U.S. dollar-based stablecoins. Will the Czech National Bank increase this investment? The bank has stated it currently has no plans to increase the total investment amount beyond the initial $1 million pilot program. Is this part of the bank’s official reserves? No, the asset acquisition was made separately from the bank’s existing foreign exchange and international reserves. Why include stablecoins in the portfolio? Stablecoins help the bank understand how traditional currency functions might operate on blockchain networks, complementing the Bitcoin investment. What is the main goal of this initiative? The primary objective is to gain direct experience with blockchain-based assets that could change how payment and financial systems operate in the future. Are other central banks doing similar experiments? While many central banks are exploring digital currencies, the Czech approach of investing directly in existing cryptocurrencies is relatively unique among European central banks.

54349793,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=859804,1763041226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54349793.jpeg,EU set to present new action plan in November meetings with US trade reps,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/european-union-us-trade-deal/,"The European Union (EU) has revised its action plans, which it proposes to the U.S. for implementation of the next phase of the trade agreement reached this summer. The agreement signed in August by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen set a 15% tariff ceiling on EU exports to the U.S. The push for a new action plan comes as Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s trade chief, is reportedly set to meet with his American counterparts later in November. The move to revise the action plan is in response to proposals the U.S. sent to the EU earlier this year, which requested revisions to regulations that were claimed to harm U.S. businesses. The deal also includes pledges to continue working on addressing non-tariff barriers and issues related to steel exports. The EU is reportedly keen to ensure that it covers all U.S. industries that might be hit with future sectoral duties. The bloc, as part of the accord, has also presented a proposal to scrap tariffs on U.S. industrial products and some non-sensitive agricultural goods. A small fraction of EU exports to the U.S. will also enjoy lower rates. New implementation action plan seeks dialogue The European Union’s new implementation action plan, which is yet to be shared with the U.S., reportedly seeks dialogue to address issues such as technical barriers, digital trade , standards, and other trade-related concerns. The dialogue would also explore cooperation on steel and aluminum, where the European Union hopes to work with the U.S. to curb global overcapacity. Meanwhile, the EU still faces a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum exports, as well as their derivative products. However, the bloc wants a quota system that will allow it to receive a specified amount of the metal exports at lower rates. The proposed plan also includes dialogue in areas like tariffs and market access, where the EU seeks lower rates for additional products, including spirits and wines. The bloc is particularly worried that the percentage of goods hit by tariffs risks hollowing out the 15% tariff ceiling agreed with the U.S. EU envoys will be briefed on the plans later this week. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is also expected to be in Brussels on November 24 to meet European Union trade ministers. European Union expects new plan to enhance supply chain resilience In a previous statement, the EU said it expects the implementation of the proposed action plan to enhance supply chain resilience while addressing non-market policies and practices. The U.S. and the UK will continue cooperating on export controls and investment screening. The EU intends to buy U.S. liquified natural gas, oil, and nuclear energy products worth over $750 billion over the next three years. The bloc hopes this will contribute to reducing Russian oil and gas on the EU market. The EU also plans to invest $40 billion in U.S.-made AI chips to strengthen its technological edge. EU companies have also expressed interest in investing up to $600 billion in several U.S. sectors by 2029, boosting the existing $2.4 trillion investment. Meanwhile, the EU promises better market access for specific non-sensitive U.S. agricultural exports worth €7.5 billion. U.S. products, including grains and nuts, soybean oil, planting seeds, and processed foodstuffs such as biscuits and tomato ketchup, will have improved access to the EU market. However, all these products will be subject to TRQs (tariff rate quotas). The political agreement reached between Trump and Ursula on July 27 may not be legally binding. Still, it serves the European Union’s core interest in stable and predictable trade, according to the commission’s statement. At the same time, it fully respects the European Union’s regulatory sovereignty and protects sensitive areas of EU agriculture, such as poultry and beef.

At this point, blockchain-based fintech company Telcoin (TEL) has received final approval to establish a digital asset bank in Nebraska. Telcoin has received final approval from the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance to establish the Telcoin Digital Asset Bank, the first regulated digital asset custodian in the United States, according to an official statement.

With this approval, the company's flagship product, eUSD, will become the first bank-issued on-chain US dollar stablecoin, offering consumers and businesses a secure and compliant way to use Digital Cash for payments, remittances, and savings. This development also puts Telcoin in a leading position combining traditional banking with the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, offering US consumers a regulated path to digital money. Telcoin (TEL) gained as much as 120% today after receiving approval to establish the first regulated digital asset bank in the US, but TEL gave some back and continues to trade at $0.0055, up 82%. *This is not investment advice.

NEW YORK, Nov. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Invictus Pharmacy , a pharmacist-founded and nationally licensed pharmacy network, announced today that it will begin accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment from patients. This milestone makes Invictus Pharmacy the first nationwide licensed pharmacy to embrace digital assets as part of its patient payment infrastructure. Beginning immediately, cryptocurrency payments including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP (Ripple) will be accepted at all Invictus Pharmacy retail locations. Starting January 1, 2026, patients will also be able to utilize these digital payment options through the company's online platform at InvictusPharmacy.com . Key Benefits of Invictus Pharmacy's acceptance of cryptocurrency include: Enhanced Security: Blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent platform for all transactions, reducing the risk of fraud. Faster Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions are typically faster than traditional payment methods, allowing for quicker processing of prescriptions. Increased Accessibility: Accepting cryptocurrency opens up access to pharmaceutical services for younger demographics who prefer or are comfortable using digital currencies. Transparency: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent and auditable trail. Pioneering Transparency in the Pharmaceutical Payment System This initiative represents the first phase of a larger technological movement led by Invictus Ventures Inc., the management company of Invictus Pharmacy. Invictus Ventures is developing a blockchain-based payment infrastructure designed specifically for the U.S. prescription drug market. The platform will facilitate instant, transparent, and auditable transactions between payers, manufacturers, pharmacies, and patients. By accepting cryptocurrency payments, Invictus Pharmacy is also embracing the next generation of American consumers who are more comfortable and familiar with digital assets and alternative payment methods. This forward-looking approach reflects Invictus's commitment to modernizing the pharmacy experience, meeting patients where they are, and fostering financial accessibility through innovation. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Invictus aims to eliminate the administrative lag and opacity that define today's pharmacy benefit model, replacing it with a real-time, programmable payment system that benefits every stakeholder in the chain.

Today, PBMs act as central toll collectors in a system that should be moving toward openness and modern technology. Accepting cryptocurrency is more than offering another way to pay.

This mission is part of the latest phase of Operation Endgame, an activity taking place between November 10 and 13, designed to dismantle criminal infrastructures and combat ransomware enablers worldwide. In a statement, Europol said , “The dismantled malware infrastructure consisted of hundreds of thousands of infected computers containing several million stolen credentials.” The joint action, coordinated by Europol and Eurojust, was also supported by several private partners, including Cryptolaemus, Shadowserver, Spycloud, Cymru, Proofpoint, CrowdStrike, Lumen, Abuse.ch, HaveIBeenPwned, Spamhaus, DIVD, and Bitdefender. Europol’s main suspect behind Venom RAT According to Europol, many victims were unaware of infections. This has highlighted the sneaky nature of these threats. Infostealers quietly harvest login details, while RATs like VenomRAT enable remote control for espionage or ransomware deployment , and botnets like Elysium amplify distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and spam campaigns. The joint action targeted ransomware infrastructure, the AVCheck site, Smokeloader botnet customers, and servers. It also disrupted major malware operations, such as DanaBot, IcedID, Pikabot, Trickbot, Smokeloader, Bumblebee, and SystemBC. Besides eliminating the three major cybercrime enablers, authorities have also arrested the main suspect behind Venom RAT in Greece on November 3. Additionally, more than 1,025 servers have been taken down, and 20 domains have been seized. Infostealer had access to 100,000 crypto wallets Today’s announcement confirms the disruption of the Rhadamanthys infostealer operation, with the malware-as-a-service’s customers stating they no longer have access to their servers. Seizure banner on Rhadamanthys’ site This comes after Rhadamanthys promoted two tools on its website, called Elysium Proxy Bot and Crypt Service. The main information stealer had been updated to include the ability to collect fingerprints from devices and web browsers, among other things. Rhadamanthys had become one of the most famous information scammers available as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS). It was first advertised by a threat actor named kingcrete2022. Version 0.9.2 of the stealer is the latest version. Over time, the stealer’s skills have evolved to the point where they can accomplish much more than just steal data. They posed a serious threat to both personal and business security. Recorded Future revealed that version 0.7.0 of the malware had a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool for optical character recognition (OCR) that could capture crypto wallet seed phrases. However, it is still unclear whether the Elysium botnet Europol refers to is the same proxy botnet service as RHAD security (also known as Mythical Origin Labs), the threat actor associated with Rhadamanthys, which was observed advertising as recently as last month. Europol also revealed that the main suspect behind the infostealer had access to no less than 100,000 crypto wallets belonging to victims. That could potentially amount to millions of euros. Authorities that participated in the effort included law enforcement agencies from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and the US. At the same time, the US Department of Justice (DOJ), FBI, and Secret Service created a new interagency task force to fight cryptoscams targeting Americans. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the new task force stated that criminals running the operations often operate from compounds in Southeast Asia. Workers at the sites are mostly victims of human trafficking, held against their will, abused, and guarded by armed groups. US Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro said, “Estimates because of underreporting could be as much as 15 times more than $9 billion, and it starts with the devices that you and I hold and use every day to do our banking, to enrich our lives, to communicate with our friends and our loved ones.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",News|BTC|ETH|EUR,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-13 13:54:28

That vision just became reality as BNY Mellon, America’s oldest bank, launches a groundbreaking money market fund specifically designed for US stablecoin issuers. This strategic move bridges the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrency, offering unprecedented stability and compliance. What Makes This Money Market Fund Revolutionary? BNY Mellon’s new BNY Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund represents a significant milestone in cryptocurrency adoption. This specialized money market fund provides stablecoin issuers with three critical benefits that were previously challenging to achieve simultaneously. The fund offers 24-hour liquidity, ensuring issuers can meet redemption demands at any time. It maintains strict stability through proven investment strategies. Most importantly, it ensures full regulatory compliance, addressing one of the biggest concerns in the crypto space. Why Should Stablecoin Issuers Care About This Development? The timing of this money market fund launch couldn’t be more crucial. Stablecoin issuers face increasing regulatory scrutiny and market volatility. This fund provides a secure haven for reserve assets while maintaining the liquidity needed for daily operations. Consider these key advantages: 24/7 access to funds for unexpected redemption demands Regulatory compliance built into the fund structure Professional asset management from an established institution Enhanced credibility through association with BNY Mellon Reduced operational complexity for reserve management How Does This Money Market Fund Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? This development signals a major shift in institutional acceptance of digital assets. When a 240-year-old banking institution creates a dedicated money market fund for crypto companies, it validates the entire sector. The fund’s structure demonstrates that traditional financial instruments can successfully integrate with blockchain technology. Moreover, it sets a new standard for how stablecoin reserves should be managed, potentially influencing regulatory frameworks worldwide. What Challenges Does This Money Market Fund Solve? Stablecoin issuers traditionally faced several obstacles in managing their reserves. Finding institutions willing to work with crypto companies proved difficult. Maintaining adequate liquidity while earning yield presented constant balancing acts. Regulatory uncertainty created compliance headaches. This new money market fund addresses all these challenges directly. It provides a turnkey solution that combines banking expertise with crypto-friendly features. Looking Ahead: The Future of Money Market Funds in Crypto The introduction of this specialized money market fund likely represents just the beginning of traditional financial products adapting to cryptocurrency needs. We can expect other major institutions to follow BNY Mellon’s lead. The success of this fund could pave the way for similar products serving different segments of the crypto market. This convergence of traditional and digital finance marks an exciting new chapter for both industries. BNY Mellon’s strategic move demonstrates that the future of finance lies in bridging traditional and digital worlds. This money market fund not only provides immediate solutions for stablecoin issuers but also sets a precedent for institutional crypto adoption. The banking giant’s endorsement through concrete action speaks louder than any marketing campaign could. Frequently Asked Questions What is the BNY Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund?

How does this fund benefit stablecoin issuers? The fund provides professional asset management, regulatory compliance, continuous liquidity access, and enhanced credibility through association with a major banking institution. Is this fund available to individual investors? No, this particular money market fund is designed exclusively for qualified stablecoin issuers rather than individual retail investors. What makes this different from traditional money market funds? This fund offers 24-hour liquidity to accommodate the always-on nature of cryptocurrency markets and is specifically structured for stablecoin reserve requirements. How does this impact cryptocurrency regulation? It demonstrates how traditional financial instruments can be adapted to meet regulatory standards while serving the crypto industry, potentially influencing future regulatory frameworks.

In a recent post on X, the analyst compared his message to “telling a kid Santa isn’t real,” joking that many investors don’t want to hear the truth about XRP’s price potential. However, Rector encouraged followers to stay positive, noting that the digital asset has remained strong and there are still reasons to be hopeful as the year draws to a close. Triple-Digit Hopes Dashed, But XRP Price Still Has Big Opportunities Rector, known for his level-headed market advice, made it clear that triple-digit XRP price targets are currently pure fantasy. He struck a humorous but honest tone, telling traders not to get carried away by big, unlikely predictions. “It’s all good,” he wrote, adding that XRP remains one of the more stable altcoins this cycle, while many others continue to fall behind. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is So High Now Rector summed up the mood of many XRP investors: hopeful but not fooled by unrealistic hype. Instead of focusing on unlikely prices, he urged the community to pay attention to upcoming events that could genuinely affect XRP’s short-term price performance. Many analysts observe that XRP is entering a critical phase marked by growing real-world adoption. Traders are watching speculation about a possible XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and are also hopeful that resolving the ongoing U.S. government shutdown could boost investor confidence. Analysts also note that as more institutions get involved with XRP, it could attract bigger investments once official ETF products are available. If this institutional interest builds as expected, it could lead to a significant change in the token’s price performance heading into 2026. Community Predicts More Modest, But Healthy Gains In response to Zach Rector’s post, XRP community member @xrpvegas offered a more realistic outlook. He suggested that the XRP price could climb to around $8 to $10 by year-end and potentially $13 to $14 by the peak of the current cycle. This prediction connects with many XRP holders, who consider it both hopeful and realistic. It suggests a solid potential gain from current levels, without relying on extreme or unlikely price jumps.

Here’s What We Know Analysts say even reaching the $10 range would strengthen XRP’s position as one of the stronger altcoins and highlight its growing appeal to institutional investors. Ultimately, Rector’s comments act as a reality check for the XRP community while remaining hopeful. The XRP price may not reach $100 this year, but investors appear ready to appreciate steady growth and the upcoming events that could support the token’s future progress. As Rector put it, there’s “nothing to complain about,” especially for a token that stays strong while many altcoins struggle to keep pace.

This Solana investor, listed on Nasdaq, is making strategic moves that could reshape its market position. Let’s explore what this means for investors and the broader crypto landscape. Why Is This Solana Investor Making Such a Strategic Move? Upexi’s decision to initiate a $50 million share buyback represents a significant vote of confidence in their own valuation. This Solana investor believes their stock is undervalued, and they’re putting substantial capital behind that conviction. The timing and execution will depend on market conditions, showing their flexible approach to capital management. Share buybacks typically signal that a company has strong cash reserves and positive future expectations. For this Solana investor, the move demonstrates: Confidence in current business operations Strong liquidity position Optimism about future growth prospects Commitment to shareholder value How Does Upexi’s Solana Investment Connect to This Decision? As a notable Solana investor, Upexi’s cryptocurrency holdings add an interesting dimension to their financial strategy. Their exposure to SOL means they’re positioned to benefit from both traditional e-commerce growth and cryptocurrency market movements. This diversified approach gives them multiple avenues for value creation. The company’s involvement with Solana demonstrates their forward-thinking approach to technology investments. This Solana investor understands the potential of blockchain technology and its applications beyond just cryptocurrency trading. Their dual focus on e-commerce and crypto positions them uniquely in the market. What Benefits Can Shareholders Expect from This Buyback? For current shareholders, this announcement brings several potential advantages. When a company buys back its own shares, it reduces the number of outstanding shares in the market. This typically leads to: Increased earnings per share Potential stock price appreciation Improved financial ratios Enhanced shareholder value The strategic timing of this buyback allows this Solana investor to capitalize on market conditions while demonstrating their commitment to long-term value creation. Their approach shows careful consideration of both immediate opportunities and future growth potential. What Challenges Might This Solana Investor Face? While the buyback announcement is generally positive, there are considerations to keep in mind. Market volatility could impact the execution timing, and the company must balance this initiative with other capital allocation needs. As a Solana investor, they also face the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets. However, their Nasdaq listing provides regulatory oversight and transparency that pure cryptocurrency companies might lack. This established public market presence gives investors additional confidence in their operations and financial reporting. Actionable Insights for Investors Watching This Development For investors monitoring this situation, there are key factors to consider. Track the actual execution of the buyback program and monitor how this Solana investor manages the process. Pay attention to: Timing of share repurchases Impact on stock liquidity Performance of their Solana investments Overall market conditions This Solana investor’s move could signal broader trends in how companies with cryptocurrency exposure are managing their capital in current market conditions. Conclusion: A Strategic Move with Broad Implications Upexi’s $50 million share buyback represents more than just a financial maneuver—it’s a statement of confidence from this innovative Solana investor. By combining traditional corporate strategy with forward-looking cryptocurrency investments, they’re positioning themselves at the intersection of established finance and emerging technology. The success of this initiative will depend on execution and market conditions, but the announcement alone demonstrates strategic thinking that could benefit shareholders and set precedents for other companies with crypto exposure. Frequently Asked Questions What is a share buyback? A share buyback occurs when a company repurchases its own outstanding shares from the market, reducing the number of shares available and potentially increasing the value of remaining shares. Why would a Solana investor like Upexi initiate a buyback? Companies typically initiate buybacks when they believe their stock is undervalued, want to return value to shareholders, or have excess cash to deploy strategically. How might this affect Upexi’s Solana investments? The buyback doesn’t directly affect their Solana holdings, but it demonstrates confidence in their overall financial position and strategic direction. When will the buyback occur? Upexi stated the timing will depend on stock price and market conditions, allowing them to execute the buyback strategically. Is this good news for shareholders? Generally yes—buybacks often signal company confidence and can lead to increased shareholder value through higher earnings per share and potential price appreciation. How large is this buyback relative to Upexi’s market capitalization? The $50 million amount represents a significant commitment that should be evaluated in context of their total market capitalization and financial resources. Found this analysis helpful?

Franklin Templeton extending Benji to Canton tightens the loop between regulated funds, collateral networks, and on-chain settlement. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets Bitcoin’s biggest gap – throughput – while Best Wallet Token ($BEST) leans into UX; Stellar ($XLM) anchors cross-border payments with deep listings. For presale exposure, $HYPER offers higher beta to Layer-2 demand; $BEST ties to wallet utility; $XLM provides listed liquidity. Franklin Templeton just plugged its Benji tokenization stack into the Canton Network, the institution-first blockchain linking collateral, settlement, and regulated markets. The move expands Benji’s reach from public networks into Canton’s private, permissioned rails where banks and trading firms already exchange tokenized assets. It’s a small line in a press release, but a big nudge toward mainstream on-chain finance. This matters, because Canton has scaled beyond pilot theater. Applications on the network are handling more than $6T in tokenized assets and north of $280B in daily U.S. Treasury repo transactions, a scale that signals real throughput rather than slideware. If tokenization is the sticky bridge between TradFi and crypto, Canton is where that bridge is getting traffic – and Benji now sits on it. For investors, this is a credibility signal. Regulated fund shares moving on a network that already processes institutional collateral give tokenized money funds and RWA collateral a clearer route into trading workflows. 💡 That’s a tailwind for projects positioned around Bitcoin scalability, self-custody user experience, and cross-border payments – three narratives with actual users and obvious product-market fit. Through that lens, three names stand out today as the best crypto to buy now. Read on as we delve into Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST), both in presale, plus Stellar ($XLM) on the listed side. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer-2 With Throughput Ambitions When regulated funds go on-chain, low-latency settlement and high-capacity rails stop being optional. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) pitch is simple: bring Solana-style speed to Bitcoin via a Layer-2 that batches, executes, and settles back to the Layer-1. The presale broke the $27M milestone today, suggesting there’s real appetite for a throughput-first Bitcoin Layer-2 rather than just another meme coin with orange branding. $HYPER is currently priced at $0.013265 with 43% staking APY. ➡️ Check out our step-by-step guide to buying $HYPER. In simple words, Hyper relies on tools like the Solana Virtual Machine and a canonical bridge to make the Bitcoin ecosystem more scalable, cheaper, and more performant, which would qualify it for mainstream adoption. If the Benji-to-Canton momentum translates into higher institutional tolerance for on-chain collateral, Layer-2s enabling $BTC-adjacent activity benefit first. The near-term math checks out. 💰 Our price prediction for $HYPER suggests a potential 2026 high near $0.08625 as core roadmap items – initial dApps, listings, and a DAO – ship. From today’s $0.013265 presale price, that’s roughly ~6.5x to the 2026 high if execution stays on track. These stats alone recommend $HYPER as one of the best crypto to buy today. This isn’t a free lunch; delivery risk is real and competition across Bitcoin Layer-2s is heating up. But the asymmetry suits presale math, and the story aligns with the market’s push toward on-chain collateral and instant settlement. 🚀 Don’t delay – buy your $HYPER today. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility-First Wallet Token With Presale Traction Canton’s growth underscores a simple truth: the next wave of users will need better UX for multi-chain portfolios, bridging, and payments. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) centers that need. It’s the native asset for the self-custody Best Wallet app ecosystem that folds in a DEX, cross-chain swaps, and a card product. The presale has reached the 17M raised, with the token currently priced at $0.025935. That’s not froth; that’s users voting for utility and distribution. The Best Wallet ecosystem offers non-custodial services and plans to ‘capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026’. The roadmap details the exact strategy at work, which involves milestones like 60+ chain support, a fiat offramp, and the Best Card, to name a few. 💰 Our price prediction for $BEST sees a potential end-2025 range topping around $0.035215 and a 2026 potential high near $0.05106175 if the roadmap lands – wallet growth, card rollout, and deeper integrations. From the current presale price, that’s ~36%–90% upside across the two years, with compounding utility rather than pure narrative carrying the lift. Yes, execution and listings timing matter. Still, with tokenized funds and RWAs normalizing, a wallet that abstracts network sprawl while offering real-world spend hooks is exactly what many newcomers will need. ➡️ Our guide to buying $BEST will help you navigate the purchase process. But hurry – the presale ends in two weeks. 🚀 Buy $BEST today and stake it for 77% APY while you still can. 3. Stellar ($XLM) – Payments Rail With Exchange Liquidity Today Stellar ($XLM) remains one of the most proven options for compliant cross-border transfers and fiat on-/off-ramps, now supported by Soroban smart contracts to widen its developer surface. Recent figures show $XLM at $0.2921 with a market cap above $9.3B, and the asset is broadly listed, including on Binance and Coinbase – meaning price discovery and liquidity are not theoretical. In a world where tokenized fund shares and repo collateral settle on permissioned chains, there’s still a huge role for public infrastructure that lets fintechs, remittance players, and stablecoin issuers move value across borders. ⚙️ Stellar’s blend of speed, low fees, and established exchange coverage keeps it relevant as the tokenization stack grows above it. Holders also get a clean story: payments first, programmability now, and plenty of listings to trade the cycle. With $XLM above $0.29 at the time of writing and an all-time ROI north of 9,677%, this one seems to be a banger. 🚀 Buy $XLM on Binance and other leading platforms today. Recap: Franklin Templeton’s Canton integration is the headline, but the subtext is bigger: regulated liquidity is moving on-chain at industrial scale. That is the connective tissue behind $HYPER’s Layer-2 throughput pitch, $BEST’s UX-led approach to self-custody, and $XLM’s liquid payments rail. If the question is the best crypto to buy into this tokenized-finance backdrop, these three sit squarely in the narrative with distinct roles and risk profiles.

Here’s What Is Happening,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-getting-ready-to-perform-like-gold-heres-what-is-happening/,"A new financial narrative is emerging across the digital asset space. Investors are increasingly seeking assets that offer resilience rather than speculation. Amid this shift, XRP appears to be positioning itself as the “digital gold” of blockchain finance—an asset built for global liquidity and utility rather than hype. Xaif, in a recent X post, shared a video from the Paul Barron Network podcast featuring market analyst Versan Aljarrah. The discussion focused on a critical transformation underway in both traditional and digital markets—a shift in how value is recognized and preserved. Gold’s Transformation and the Coming Decoupling Versan Aljarrah explained that gold has already undergone a major revaluation in its purpose. “We’re seeing the trend of gold no longer reflecting monetary policy anymore,” he said. According to Aljarrah, gold’s role is being redefined—recognized not as a reactionary asset but as “a store of value, more of an intrinsic value, and its role in the broader financial landscape.” BE READY $XRP is getting ready to decouple from BTC & ETH — just like Gold did from the rest of the market. This isn’t just another crypto… it’s built for a global shift in liquidity. pic.twitter.com/IKTQWvP251 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 12, 2025 Aljarrah believes XRP is on a similar path. He said, “I think XRP will gradually undergo some similar shift where it will decouple from Bitcoin, where it will decouple from the rest of the market.” He argues that just as gold is becoming independent of speculative cycles, XRP could soon operate beyond the volatile rhythms of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional Catalysts Driving the Shift Analysts point to institutional adoption as a key force behind this potential decoupling. JPMorgan recently estimated that XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could attract between $4 and $8 billion in inflows within their first year. That level of institutional participation could reduce exchange supply and reinforce XRP’s reputation as a liquidity asset rather than a speculative token. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows exchange reserves have fallen to multi-month lows. Binance, for instance, now holds under 2.8 billion XRP—the lowest level in nearly a year. The supply crunch, combined with growing ETF anticipation, suggests an emerging scarcity dynamic that mirrors gold’s long-term trajectory. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expanding Utility Beyond Payments Beyond market movements, XRP’s fundamental evolution continues. The XRP Ledger is expanding its functionality with new features that support tokenized assets and on-chain finance. These innovations strengthen its role as a cross-border settlement and liquidity platform. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, XRP’s utility extends into real-world financial operations, reinforcing its potential independence from speculative cycles. The Road to Market Independence Decoupling from Bitcoin and Ethereum would mark a defining moment for XRP. It would signal maturity—a shift from speculative trading toward recognition as a stable, utility-based asset. Still, analysts caution that this process will be gradual and tested by market volatility. As Aljarrah observed, XRP’s journey reflects a “recognition” process similar to gold’s. Once seen as just another token, XRP may soon stand apart—valued for its function and stability in a financial world craving both.

This marks a credible institutional tailwind for Bitcoin. Sovereign-level interest strengthens the ‘digital gold’ case and can add marginal demand, supportive for $BTC price and $BTC-native infrastructure. Bitcoin Hyper targets speed and programmability for $BTC via an SVM-based Layer-2, aiming to unlock faster payments, DeFi, and dApps within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. $HYPER’s presale price is $0.013265; a potential high of $0.08625 in 2026 could mean a +550% ROI if devs successfully hit project milestones. Taiwan plans to put Bitcoin on its policy map. Lawmakers have pushed for a full audit of the government’s $BTC exposure and a formal study into adding Bitcoin to national reserves. Premier Cho Jung-tai pledged a detailed Taiwan reserve-strategy report by year-end 2025 . That’s not a casual nod. It’s a signal that $BTC is graduating from ‘risk asset’ to potential sovereign-grade reserve. The motivation is simple enough: diversify a reserve stack still dominated by USD and add a liquid, hard-capped asset with global settlement. This decision comes after Taiwanese legislator Ju Chun Ko had framed Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ hedge to USD concentration back in a May 9 session, signalling political cover for a serious allocation debate. Today, Taiwan’s FX hoard sits in the hundreds of billions, totalling $602.94B (of which 90% is USD), as per the CBC . So, even a small allocation would be material on the margin. A proper audit also sweeps up seized coins held by agencies following legal cases — inventory that could seed a pilot treasury program instead of being dumped at auction. This policy change could cause a domino effect. One credible government exploring $BTC reserves tightens the supply narrative and reinforces the ‘digital gold’ idea – particularly in an environment where ETFs have already absorbed a steady flow. If the report lands on schedule and the door opens to a modest allocation, the market gets another demand vector. Projects building real utility around Bitcoin typically benefit first. That’s the plan for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a $BTC-centric Layer-2 aiming to turn store-of-value into a spend-and-build ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper Wants to Turn Bitcoin Into a High-Throughput DeFi Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a Layer-2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for fast execution while anchoring finality to Bitcoin’s base layer. In plain English, this means: cheap, low-latency transactions and smart-contract capability without altering Bitcoin’s consensus. Imagine Solana-style speed and programmability on top of Bitcoin’s security – a combination that’s been missing in $BTC-native ecosystems. To make this happen, the project’s playbook includes a canonical bridge for wrapping $BTC for DeFi use on the Hyper side chain, then releasing the L1 $BTC back to your wallet on exit. Once the live net is up, this setup makes it possible to onboard tooling for payments, DeFi, and dApps. Security is also a dev priority, especially for the project’s financing rounds. External checks from Coinsult and SpyWolf have reviewed the $HYPER token contract and flagged no backdoors or mint functions, a non-negotiable baseline to ensure token scarcity and fair trading. That doesn’t guarantee crypto success, of course. But good security does reduce avoidable smart-contract risk at the token layer. If Taiwan’s review lifts Bitcoin mindshare and on-chain activity, networks that make $BTC usable sit in the slipstream. That’s the lane $HYPER wants to own with its cheap payments, DeFi compatibility, and quick confirmations. See Bitcoin Hyper’s ecosystem plans. $HYPER Token’s Presale Is in Full Swing with $27M+ Raised Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the utility crypto for the Hyper network. Now in presale, $HYPER has crossed $27M, with plans to set aside 75% of its funds to support project development, marketing, and a long-term treasury. The token is priced at $0.013265 right now, though its fundamentals leave room for upside once liquidity and listings arrive in Q4 2025/Q1 2026. According to our $HYPER token forecast , the token has a potential high of $0.02595 in 2025 and $0.08625 in 2026 if listing and live mainnet milestones land as planned. From the current presale price, those levels imply about +96% and +550% respectively — not the moonshot hype you’d see on Crypto Twitter, but grounded in real value and fundamentals. Put simply, if utility ships and Bitcoin stays bid, this type of multiple isn’t fantasy. The market context is certainly on Hyper’s side. Taiwan’s review timeline runs through 2025, overlapping with Bitcoin Hyper’s roadmap windows. A favorable government report won’t flip a switch on day one, yet it improves the macro narrative for $BTC-aligned infrastructure exactly when $HYPER aims to turn on throughput. If a sliver of sovereign-level demand materializes, the liquidity tide can lift the $BTC-centric stack, extending to bridges, wallets, and L2s that make $BTC actually usable. That’s where a fast SVM execution layer tied to Bitcoin’s settlement could capture real volumes instead of pure speculation. Join Bitcoin Hyper and get 43% APY.

The document arrives amid mounting criticism that Ethereum’s ecosystem has drifted toward centralization, despite public commitments to decentralization. Just last month, former core developers revealed that a small group of insiders effectively controls project success and protocol direction. The manifesto asserts that trustlessness, where system correctness relies solely on mathematics and consensus rather than the goodwill of intermediaries. “ Ethereum was not created to make finance efficient or apps convenient ,” the authors write. “ It was created to set people free. “ Signed the trustless manifesto! https://t.co/VhHlx3K2vt @thewizardofpos @yoavw pic.twitter.com/lOuz1W7DQL — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 13, 2025 Manifesto Sets Six Core Requirements for Decentralized Systems The document establishes strict criteria for trustless design: Self-sovereignty, where users authorize their own actions Verifiability through public data Censorship resistance within reasonable timeframes Operator replaceability without approval Practical accessibility beyond technical experts Transparent incentive structures. Removing any requirement causes systems to “ drift from protocol to platform—from neutral ground to private property, ” according to the text. The manifesto applies three laws prohibiting critical secrets held by single actors, indispensable intermediaries that users cannot realistically replace, and unverifiable outcomes lacking public reproducibility. “ These laws are harsh ,” the authors acknowledge. “ They limit what we can build easily—but they are the only guarantee that what we build belongs to everyone. “ Beyond theoretical frameworks, the document warns that centralization already permeates Ethereum’s infrastructure through hosted RPCs serving as defaults, AWS-GCP-Cloudflare dependency creating single points of failure, and centralized sequencing in many rollups. “ Decentralization erodes not through capture, but through convenience ,” the manifesto states, comparing the trajectory to email’s evolution, where spam filters and blocklists made self-hosted servers practically impossible despite remaining theoretically open. Former Developer Exposes ‘Elite Control’ Contradicting Decentralization Claims The manifesto’s release follows bombshell revelations from former Geth lead developer Péter Szilágyi , who published a May 2024 letter exposing how five to ten people around Buterin maintain “ complete indirect control ” over Ethereum’s direction through attention allocation, donations, investments, and researcher assignments. Projects no longer conduct public offerings but instead secure backing from the same insiders, creating what Szilágyi called a “ ruling elite ” where success requires convincing “the correct 5-10 people around Vitalik—or even him—to commit. “ Separately, Szilágyi revealed he earned just $625,000 over six years managing Ethereum’s primary execution client with zero benefits or raises, describing Foundation employment as “ a bad financial decision ” that created “ a perfect breeding ground for perverse incentives, conflicts of interests, and eventual protocol capture. “ Ex-Geth lead Szilágyi exposes 5-10 people controlling Ethereum via Vitalik's ""indirect control"" as Foundation underpays core devs enabling ""protocol capture."" #Ethereum #Developer https://t.co/YMKQ7Herru — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 21, 2025 He warned the Foundation “ set the protocol up for capture ” by underpaying contributors who cared about principles, forcing them to seek compensation elsewhere, while those remaining felt like “ useful fools ” watching big players reshape the protocol. Sentiments at the time summarize the dynamic as “ we’re happy you built an empire for us, now move aside and let the people who can make us money take the lead, ” according to Szilágyi. Paradigm’s Growing Influence Over Ethereum Separate warnings also emerged during the same time when Ethereum core developer “Fede’s intern” cautioned that venture capital firm Paradigm’s influence “ within Ethereum could become a relevant tail risk for the ecosystem. ” Paradigm manages $12.7 billion and has positioned itself across multiple fronts, including hiring top researchers, funding critical open-source libraries like Reth, and launching Tempo. Tempo is a competing layer-1 blockchain that has raised $500 million at a $5 billion valuation from traditional finance firms, including Greenoaks, Thrive, Stripe, and Sequoia. I’ve been saying for the past two years that the influence of @paradigm within Ethereum could become a relevant tail risk for the ecosystem. I believe this will become increasingly clear to everyone in the months ahead. Some people think I have a personal issue with them. I… https://t.co/LH99Cvmbqo — Fede’s intern (@fede_intern) October 19, 2025 The concerns intensified following the departure of longtime Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist to Tempo, where Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang serves as CEO while retaining his role at the venture firm. “ When corporations gain too much legibility and influence over open source projects, priorities start to drift away from the community’s long term vision and toward corporate incentives ,” the developer warned, noting Paradigm’s failed FTX investment led them to “ remove most references to crypto and pivot heavily toward AI .” The post Ethereum Leaders Launch ‘Trustless Manifesto’ to Protect Crypto Decentralization appeared first on Cryptonews .",Ethereum News|Ethereum|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-13 15:26:22

Self, an innovative startup in this space, just secured $9 million in seed funding to make this vision a reality. This significant investment signals growing confidence in privacy-focused solutions that could reshape how we handle digital verification. What Makes Zero-Knowledge Identity So Revolutionary? Zero-knowledge identity represents a major leap forward in digital privacy protection. This technology allows users to verify their identity or credentials without exposing sensitive personal information. Instead of sharing your actual data, you provide cryptographic proof that you meet certain requirements. For instance, you could prove you’re over 18 without revealing your birthdate, or verify your income without disclosing exact figures. The approach addresses one of digital security’s biggest challenges: minimizing data exposure while maintaining trust. Traditional identity systems often require sharing extensive personal information, creating multiple points of vulnerability. However, zero-knowledge identity solutions dramatically reduce these risks by design. How Will Self Utilize This $9 Million Funding? Self plans to deploy the fresh capital across several key areas. The company has already launched a points program that rewards users for verified activities. This innovative approach encourages participation while building a robust ecosystem. The funding will accelerate: Platform development and technical infrastructure Expansion of the rewards and verification system Team growth and strategic partnerships Research into new zero-knowledge identity applications This substantial investment demonstrates strong market belief in Self’s vision for transforming digital identity management through zero-knowledge proofs. Who Are the Key Investors Backing This Zero-Knowledge Identity Initiative? The seed round attracted notable investors from across the technology and blockchain sectors. Greenfield Capital, known for supporting innovative blockchain projects, led the investment. They were joined by Startup Capital Ventures x SBI Fund, which brings SoftBank’s extensive network and expertise, along with Spearhead VC’s strategic guidance. This diverse investor base reflects broad recognition of zero-knowledge identity’s potential across multiple industries. Each investor brings unique strengths that can help Self navigate the complex landscape of digital identity verification and adoption. What Challenges Does Zero-Knowledge Identity Face? Despite its promise, implementing zero-knowledge identity systems presents several hurdles. User education remains crucial, as the concept can seem abstract to non-technical audiences. Regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions requires careful navigation, especially concerning data protection laws. Technical complexity and performance optimization also demand ongoing attention. However, the growing demand for privacy-focused solutions creates favorable conditions for overcoming these challenges. As data breaches become more common and privacy concerns intensify, zero-knowledge identity offers a compelling alternative to traditional approaches. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Identity? Self’s successful funding round represents more than just another startup achievement – it signals a shift toward privacy-by-design in digital identity management. As zero-knowledge identity technology matures, we can expect to see broader adoption across finance, healthcare, and government services. This approach could fundamentally change how we think about digital trust and verification. The company’s rewards program demonstrates an understanding that user adoption requires tangible benefits. By incentivizing participation while maintaining privacy, Self creates a virtuous cycle that could accelerate zero-knowledge identity mainstream acceptance. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Privacy Self’s $9 million seed funding marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital identity solutions. The backing from prominent investors validates the growing importance of zero-knowledge identity technology in creating more secure and private digital experiences. As the company expands its platform and rewards system, users stand to gain unprecedented control over their personal information while participating in a more transparent verification ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What is zero-knowledge identity? Zero-knowledge identity is a cryptographic method that allows someone to prove they know certain information or meet specific criteria without revealing the actual data itself. How does Self’s points program work? Self rewards users with points for completing verified activities using their zero-knowledge identity system, creating incentives for participation while maintaining privacy. Why is zero-knowledge identity important? It addresses growing privacy concerns by minimizing data exposure during verification processes, reducing the risk of personal information being compromised or misused. Who are the main investors in Self? The seed round included Greenfield Capital, Startup Capital Ventures x SBI Fund (connected to SoftBank), and Spearhead VC. What industries could benefit from zero-knowledge identity? Finance, healthcare, government services, and any sector requiring identity verification while protecting user privacy could benefit from this technology.

54352530,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=853114,1763047845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54352530.jpeg,Dogecoin Whales Load Up: 4.72 Billion DOGE Vanish Into Mega Wallets,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-whales-4-72-billion-doge-mega-wallets/,"Dogecoin’s largest non-exchange holders have accelerated accumulation into early November even as price remains subdued, according to a Santiment chart shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Dogecoin Whale Holdings Jump By 4.72B DOGE The graphic tracks two series from August 11 through November 12, 2025: DOGE’s spot price (black line, right-axis in USD) and the aggregate holdings of addresses with 100 million to 1 billion DOGE (shaded area, right-axis in coins). Over the most recent two-week window the whale cohort added roughly 4.72 billion DOGE, lifting their stack to about 32.4 billion coins at the latest reading. Price action over the same period shows a clear loss of momentum from the late-summer rally. After a mid-September push that printed near the top axis mark around $0.30, DOGE rolled over into a sequence of lower highs through early October before a sharp mid-October drawdown.

Analyst Explains What Matters Now The line carves out a capitulation through close to the $0.16 gridline in early November, followed by an anemic rebound that stalled beneath successive axis bands and slipped again into early November. The final plot on November 12 sits near $0.175, noticeably below the September peak and still hugging the lower bound of the chart’s labeled range. Against that backdrop, the whale series presents a contrasting staircase. Holdings were comparatively flat and choppy through September, with brief step-ups around late September and early October that quickly faded. The decisive move began in the final days of October: the shaded area arcs higher in a near-continuous climb from the ~27.7 billion region toward 32.4 billion by November 12. The magnitude of that rise aligns with Martinez’s note of 4.72 billion DOGE accumulated in roughly two weeks, concentrated entirely within the 100M–1B address tranche ($17.5 – $175 million at current price) specified on the chart. The juxtaposition establishes a straightforward divergence: while price traced new local lows into late October and struggled to reclaim lost ground in early November, large holders expanded their positions and now control the highest share shown on the display period.

Key price landmarks on the panel remain the mid-September swing high near $0.30 and the late-October low near $0.16. DOGE Bulls Must Act Now On the weekly DOGE/USDT chart, price is still trading below the rising black trendline that supported the advance from October 2023 until the clear breakdown in early November 2025, and that line now acts as overhead resistance in the upper-$0.18 area. DOGE is currently around $0.1766, capped beneath the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $0.2136 and the 20/50-week EMAs clustered near $0.2111–$0.2102, while resting above the 200-week EMA at $0.1563 and the major horizontal support highlighted near $0.1299. Until the market can reclaim that former primary uptrend line on a weekly basis, the chart structure remains one of post-breakdown retests from below, with key upside reference levels marked at the trendline itself, then $0.2136 (0.236 Fib), and higher Fibonacci checkpoints at $0.2654, $0.3073, $0.3492 and $0.4089 Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",Dogecoin|doge|DOGE news|Doge price|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-11-13 15:30:45
54352635,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=859886,1763047950,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54352635.jpeg,Authorities in Kyrgyzstan unplug mining hardware to save electricity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kyrgyzstan-shut-down-all-crypto-mining-farms/,"The government of Kyrgyzstan is disconnecting all crypto mining facilities from the grid, citing energy shortages as the key reason. The Central Asian nation is heavily reliant on hydroelectric generation, and the water in one of its main reservoirs is now critically low. Authorities in Kyrgyzstan unplug mining hardware to save electricity Officials in Kyrgyzstan have ordered all crypto farms shut down as the country is experiencing significant deficits in terms of available electrical power. In an interview with the online news outlet 24.kg published Wednesday, Minister of Energy Taalaibek Ibraev announced: “Given the current electricity shortage, a decision has been made to completely shut down all mining farms throughout the republic.” Ibraev emphasized he is keeping a close eye on the issue. He also stated that he had previously warned that the winter would be difficult, urging people to conserve power. The government representative explained that electricity generation in the country is facing challenges mainly due to the very low water level at the Toktogul Dam. The latter is a major source of water for the Toktogul Hydroelectric Station, the largest power plant of this kind in Kyrgyzstan, with its 1,260 MW. The country depends heavily on electricity generated by its HPPs. The energy minister detailed: “Yes, we’re experiencing a low-water period. Today, the Toktogul reservoir contains almost 2 billion cubic meters less water than the same period of last year.” “To maintain its capacity at 7 billion cubic meters by April 1, when the heating season ends and the Toktogul Reservoir begins to fill, we need to conserve electricity,” he added. Taalaibek Ibraev also highlighted that the authorities are implementing a range of other measures meant to limit transmission losses and excessive consumption. The government is also trying to increase production from renewable sources by commissioning smaller hydroelectric power plants. A 120 MW solar station is expected to be launched by the end of the year. Ibraev insisted his nation’s energy system is not in crisis yet, while warning it is already operating under increased loads. Crypto mining blamed for energy shortages across the region Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Ibraev unveiled that neighboring Kazakhstan will return over 30% more electricity than it received from Kyrgyzstan in the summer. The two former Soviet republics have a long-standing mutual supply agreement that helps them deal with seasonal power deficits. “This scheme has always existed between the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan. Electricity cannot be stored, and to prevent unnecessary water discharges in the summer, we transfer the excess to our neighbors. In the winter, when we need more electricity, they return it,” the minister explained . Kyrgyzstan will now receive up to 200 million kilowatt-hours from Kazakhstan, when needed, to maintain the stability of its power grid and generation system during periods of peak consumption in the winter months. Crypto mining, which surged across the region a few years ago after China banned the activity, has also been blamed for energy shortages in Kazakhstan . Astana is coping with the issue by implementing strict regulations and higher electricity rates. Russia, which is also dealing with similar challenges in some parts of the country with subsidized electricity rates, has imposed seasonal or permanent restrictions on mining in about a dozen of its regions – from Siberia to the Caucasus, recently adding two more to the list. In September, Kyrgyzstan’s parliament approved a bill “On Virtual Assets” aimed at regulating crypto-related activities in its economy, including mining, and envisaging the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. Last week, the country’s finance ministry registered a dollar-pegged stablecoin backed by gold, USDKG, which is going to be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges in the coming days. Banks and crypto platforms operating in the country have been targeted in sanctions, as reported by Cryptopolitan, imposed over links to another stablecoin, the Russian-ruble pegged A7A5 .

Uniswap just demonstrated its massive influence by recording an astonishing $116.6 billion in trading volume during October alone. This unprecedented Uniswap trading volume milestone signals a fundamental shift in how traders interact with digital assets. What Drove Uniswap’s Record-Breaking Trading Volume? The $116.6 billion Uniswap trading volume didn’t happen by accident. Several key factors contributed to this historic achievement. First, the broader cryptocurrency market experienced significant volatility throughout October, driving increased trading activity across all platforms. Moreover, Uniswap’s user-friendly interface and lower barriers to entry attracted both new and experienced traders seeking decentralized trading options. Another crucial element was the platform’s continuous innovation in liquidity pools and trading pairs. The Uniswap trading volume surge reflects growing confidence in decentralized finance protocols. Traders increasingly prefer the transparency and control offered by DEXs over traditional centralized exchanges. How Does This Impact the DeFi Ecosystem? This massive Uniswap trading volume achievement creates ripple effects throughout the entire DeFi space. Consider these key implications: Increased Liquidity : Higher trading volumes mean deeper liquidity pools and better prices for traders Protocol Revenue : More volume translates to higher fee generation for liquidity providers Market Validation : Record Uniswap trading volume validates the DEX model’s sustainability Competitive Pressure Other exchanges must innovate to keep pace with Uniswap’s growth The October Uniswap trading volume milestone demonstrates that decentralized exchanges can compete with, and sometimes surpass, their centralized counterparts. This trend suggests we’re witnessing a fundamental transformation in how cryptocurrency markets operate. What Challenges Does High Volume Present? While celebrating this remarkable Uniswap trading volume achievement, we must acknowledge the challenges that come with such rapid growth. Network congestion during peak trading hours remains a concern, potentially leading to higher gas fees. Additionally, maintaining security and preventing exploits becomes increasingly critical as volumes rise. The platform’s developers face ongoing pressure to optimize performance while preserving decentralization principles. However, the consistent growth in Uniswap trading volume indicates they’re successfully navigating these challenges. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders What does this record Uniswap trading volume mean for your trading strategy? First, recognize that DEXs now offer liquidity comparable to many centralized exchanges. This means you can execute larger trades without significant price impact. Second, consider providing liquidity to popular pools during high-volume periods to capture more fee revenue. Monitor Uniswap trading volume trends to identify emerging token pairs and market sentiment shifts. The platform’s volume data often serves as an early indicator of changing market dynamics. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Uniswap? The record-breaking Uniswap trading volume establishes a new benchmark for decentralized exchanges. As the platform continues evolving, we can expect further innovations in user experience and trading efficiency. The growing Uniswap trading volume suggests decentralized trading is becoming mainstream rather than niche. This achievement marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency history, proving that decentralized protocols can handle institutional-scale trading activity while maintaining their core principles of transparency and user control. Frequently Asked Questions What makes Uniswap different from other exchanges? Uniswap operates as a decentralized exchange using automated market maker protocols rather than traditional order books, giving users full control of their assets. How does high trading volume benefit Uniswap users? Higher trading volume means better liquidity, tighter spreads, and reduced slippage, resulting in improved trading execution for all participants. Can Uniswap maintain these volume levels long-term? While monthly volumes may fluctuate, the consistent growth pattern suggests Uniswap has established itself as a fundamental piece of cryptocurrency infrastructure. What risks come with trading on Uniswap during high volume periods? Primary concerns include network congestion leading to higher transaction fees and potential smart contract vulnerabilities, though the protocol has proven robust through extensive testing. How does Uniswap generate revenue from trading volume? Uniswap charges a 0.3% fee on trades, which distributes to liquidity providers who enable the platform’s trading functionality. What impact does this have on UNI token value? While UNI token value doesn’t directly correlate with trading volume, sustained high activity typically increases protocol utility and long-term value appreciation potential.

One single transaction wiped out 179.5 million SHIB about thirteen hours ago. Burns keep stacking up, the supply keeps shrinking, and that always sets the stage for possible price pops down the line. On top of that, Shiba Inu linked up with Unity Nodes , which lets people pick up Nodes with SHIB, earn rewards, and grab SHIB-themed NFTs. It sounds fun, but the price still dropped eight percent this month while Shibarium activity hit new lows. Source: GoogleTrends It really shows you where the market is at. Google searches for memecoins are at one of the lowest levels ever. There is zero interest from anyone outside the tiny bubble that memecoin holders sit in. The upside is that moments like this are usually when the market pulls something nobody expects. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: A Breakout Is Quietly Taking Shape? Source: SHIBUSD / TradingView SHIB looks like it might be gearing up for another move up after grabbing back a key support level and bouncing hard off the demand zone at 0.0000096. It has been building strength ever since it tagged 0.000007 on Oct 25. The RSI is sitting around 64, which shows the momentum is still leaning bullish. If SHIB can close above 0.0000100 with some real volume behind it, a push toward 0.00001035 and maybe even 0.0000112 is on the table. If the price gets slapped down here and falls under 0.0000096 again, a revisit to 0.0000090 could be next before buyers try another run. Tired Of Shiba Inu? Pepenode Might Replace It While Shiba Inu holders are clinging to burn updates for hope, another project is stealing the spotlight in a totally different way: PepeNode. PepeNode brings a new twist to crypto mining. It turns mining into a play-to-earn experience where anyone can join, build virtual rigs, and earn rewards without needing expensive equipment or high power bills. Players set up their digital mining farms, upgrade nodes, and earn PEPENODE tokens, plus rewards in popular meme coins. What really makes PepeNode stand out is its deflationary design. Around 70% of the tokens used for upgrades get burned forever, tightening supply and creating real long-term value for holders. And even before launch, staking rewards are sitting at a massive 607% APY . It feels like the early days of Bitcoin mining, but easier, faster, and open to everyone. With over $2.11 million raised so far and growing investor interest, PepeNode might be the next big meme-driven success story.

Karremans noted that he was open to China’s imminent moves to loosen regulations around the export of Nexperia’s chips. He also added that he was closely monitoring the situation to confirm when trade from Nexperia’s facilities in China would resume. In late September, Nexperia found itself sandwiched in a geopolitical war between the Chinese and the Dutch governments. Netherlands authorities seized control of the chipmaker from its Chinese parent company, Wingtech Technology, after concerns arose over the company’s technology transfers to China. The European government also removed its Chinese CEO after U.S. officials cautioned European allies about existing security threats accompanying Chinese leadership in key tech sectors. In response, the Chinese government implemented export controls on Nexperia’s products manufactured in China, which had a devastating impact on the automotive and electronic supply chains. A letter distributed by Nexperia to its clientele on October 29th detailed that the company had suspended supplies of wafers to its Chinese assembly plant, causing a supply squeeze to automotive manufacturers. The letter informed that the suspension was a direct consequence of the Dutch’s previous actions, which failed to honor existing contractual agreements. Cryptopolitan previously reported that the China-Dutch clash over the chip maker forced European carmakers against the wall and put the continent’s car production at risk. According to the report, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) has warned that parts of Europe’s car production may collapse if deliveries of the Nexperia chip are halted. Automotive manufacturers suffer amid the Nexperia chip disruption Volkswagen was among the first automotive companies to face the chip shortage challenge after the China-Dutch fallout. On October 22nd, the car manufacturer announced shortly after the Nexperia dispute erupted that it had halted the production of iconic models. The company later resumed production after announcing that chip production had resumed, but cautioned about uncertainty ahead. BMW noted that its supply network felt the impact of the trade war and had initiated talks with relevant stakeholders to ensure the stability of its supply chain. Europe’s major automotive parts supplier, Bosch, also commented on the issue, cautioning that even minor disruptions could still send considerable shockwaves through the supply chain. Earlier reports noted that the Netherlands had agreed to relinquish control over Nexperia on the condition that China resume chip exports and resolve internal issues. Nexperia chips are vital components that make up rudimentary automotive systems, such as sensors, controls, and battery management. Without these systems, modern car manufacturers face serious production challenges. As the two nations near a mutual agreement halfway around the world, General Motors has informed its suppliers that it is no longer willing to depend on China for supplies. A recent Cryptopolitan report noted that the automotive giant cited the China-US trade relationship as having become random and unpredictable. The report highlighted that the company gave some suppliers up to 2027 to disentangle from Chinese control. The company expressed its frustrations after Trump’s new tariffs rekindled the China-U.S. trade war.

JPMorgan’s latest analysis reveals a surprising Bitcoin support level that could change how investors view the cryptocurrency’s risk profile. The banking giant has identified Bitcoin’s production cost as a crucial price floor that could limit downside movement significantly. What Exactly is This Bitcoin Support Level? JPMorgan’s research team has determined that Bitcoin’s production cost of approximately $94,000 serves as a fundamental Bitcoin support level. This analysis comes from examining the economics of Bitcoin mining operations worldwide. When Bitcoin trades near its production cost, miners face pressure that typically reduces selling activity, creating natural price support. The bank emphasizes that this Bitcoin support level makes potential declines from current prices very limited. This creates an interesting risk-reward scenario for investors who have been cautious about entering the cryptocurrency market. Why Does Production Cost Matter for Bitcoin Support? Understanding mining economics is crucial to grasping this Bitcoin support concept. Here’s how it works: Miners incur significant electricity and hardware costs When Bitcoin prices fall below production costs, mining becomes unprofitable This leads to reduced selling pressure from miners Fewer coins enter the market, creating natural support This fundamental Bitcoin support mechanism has historically proven reliable during previous market cycles. The current analysis suggests we might see similar dynamics play out if prices approach the $94,000 level. What About JPMorgan’s Long-Term Bitcoin Forecast? Despite identifying strong Bitcoin support at $94,000, JPMorgan maintains its ambitious 6- to 12-month price target of $170,000. This represents substantial upside potential from current levels while having clear downside protection identified through the production cost analysis. The bank’s confidence in this Bitcoin support level stems from comprehensive mining cost analysis across different regions and mining operations. They’ve considered factors like: Global electricity price variations Mining hardware efficiency improvements Regulatory impacts on mining operations Network difficulty adjustments How Can Investors Use This Bitcoin Support Information? This Bitcoin support analysis provides valuable insights for both short-term traders and long-term investors. The identified production cost level offers a potential entry point for those waiting for better risk-adjusted opportunities. Moreover, understanding this fundamental Bitcoin support mechanism helps investors make more informed decisions during market volatility. The limited downside potential combined with substantial upside targets creates an attractive asymmetric risk profile. This Bitcoin support analysis suggests that current prices might offer reasonable entry points for patient investors. What Makes This Bitcoin Support Analysis Different? Traditional technical analysis often identifies Bitcoin support levels based on historical price action and trading volumes. However, JPMorgan’s approach using production costs provides a fundamental economic foundation for price support. This methodology offers several advantages: Based on real-world economic constraints Less susceptible to market sentiment swings Provides objective valuation metrics Accounts for mining industry dynamics This fundamental Bitcoin support analysis complements traditional technical approaches, giving investors multiple perspectives on potential price floors. Frequently Asked Questions How reliable is production cost as Bitcoin support? Production cost has historically served as strong Bitcoin support during previous market cycles. While not absolute, it represents a fundamental economic floor where mining economics create natural buying pressure. What happens if Bitcoin breaks below this support level? If Bitcoin falls significantly below production costs, mining operations would scale back, reducing new supply entering the market. This typically creates conditions for price recovery as supply decreases. How does JPMorgan calculate the $94,000 production cost? The calculation considers global average electricity costs, mining hardware efficiency, maintenance expenses, and network difficulty across major mining regions worldwide. Should I invest based solely on this Bitcoin support analysis? While this Bitcoin support analysis provides valuable insights, it should be one factor among many in your investment decision process. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. How often does JPMorgan update these Bitcoin support calculations? Major banks typically update cryptocurrency analyses quarterly or when significant market changes occur. Production costs can change with electricity prices and mining technology. Does this Bitcoin support analysis consider ETF flows and institutional demand? This particular analysis focuses on production costs, but JPMorgan likely considers institutional demand in their broader market assessment and $170,000 price target. Found this analysis helpful?

Recent data reveals something startling – long-term Bitcoin holders have unleashed a massive sell-off that’s shaking the cryptocurrency landscape. According to CryptoQuant analysis, these dedicated Bitcoin holders parted with approximately 815,000 BTC over the past month. This represents the largest exodus since January 2024, creating significant waves across the entire crypto ecosystem. Why are Bitcoin holders selling now? The substantial selling pressure from long-term Bitcoin holders stems from a noticeable decline in market demand. When these seasoned investors begin moving their assets, the entire market feels the impact. CryptoQuant’s report clearly indicates that this selling activity is directly weighing on Bitcoin’s price performance. Many Bitcoin holders who have held through previous market cycles appear to be taking profits or cutting losses amid current conditions. This trend among Bitcoin holders matters because they typically represent the most committed segment of the cryptocurrency community. Their actions often signal deeper market sentiment shifts that can influence shorter-term traders and new investors entering the space. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s future? The behavior of Bitcoin holders serves as a crucial market indicator that experienced analysts watch closely. When long-term Bitcoin holders begin selling in large volumes, it typically suggests several possible scenarios: Profit-taking after significant price appreciation Concerns about upcoming market conditions Portfolio rebalancing strategies Response to macroeconomic factors affecting cryptocurrency The current selling pattern among Bitcoin holders represents the most substantial movement we’ve seen in months. This doesn’t necessarily spell doom for Bitcoin, but it does indicate a shift in sentiment among those who have historically been the most bullish about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. How should current Bitcoin holders respond? If you’re among the Bitcoin holders watching this trend unfold, understanding the context is crucial. Market cycles have historically seen periods where long-term Bitcoin holders reduce their positions, only to see new investors eventually fill the gap. The key considerations for Bitcoin holders include: Evaluate your investment timeline – Short-term volatility affects long-term holders differently Assess your risk tolerance – Market movements test even seasoned Bitcoin holders Monitor fundamental indicators – Look beyond price to network health and adoption metrics Remember that Bitcoin holders have navigated similar situations before. The cryptocurrency has demonstrated resilience through numerous market cycles, though each presents unique challenges and opportunities for Bitcoin holders. The bigger picture for Bitcoin holders While the current selling activity among Bitcoin holders appears dramatic, it’s essential to view this within the broader context of cryptocurrency evolution. The market continues to mature, and the actions of Bitcoin holders today may reflect sophisticated portfolio management rather than outright abandonment of the asset class. Many Bitcoin holders who are selling may simply be reallocating to other opportunities or taking measured profits after extended holding periods. The fact that we’re seeing movement among long-term Bitcoin holders indicates they’re actively managing their positions rather than passively holding regardless of market conditions. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin holder exodus The significant selling by Bitcoin holders represents a pivotal moment in the current market cycle. While the 815,000 BTC movement certainly creates short-term pressure, it also potentially sets the stage for new market dynamics. For current and prospective Bitcoin holders, this period offers valuable insights into market psychology and the evolving nature of cryptocurrency investment strategies. The true test for Bitcoin holders comes during these transitional phases. History has shown that periods of consolidation often precede new growth cycles, though the timing and magnitude remain unpredictable. The commitment of Bitcoin holders through volatile periods has historically been rewarded, but each investor must assess their individual circumstances and convictions. Frequently Asked Questions Why are long-term Bitcoin holders selling now? Long-term Bitcoin holders are likely selling due to a combination of profit-taking after previous gains, concerns about current market demand, and broader economic factors affecting cryptocurrency valuations. How significant is 815,000 BTC in market terms? This represents a substantial amount – approximately $20-25 billion at current prices – making it the largest sell-off from long-term holders since January 2024. Should I be worried as a Bitcoin holder? Market cycles naturally include periods of selling and buying. While noteworthy, this activity doesn’t necessarily indicate a fundamental problem with Bitcoin itself. Will this selling pressure continue? It’s difficult to predict, but historical patterns suggest that once long-term holders have adjusted their positions, selling pressure typically subsides. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s price? Significant selling from long-term holders generally creates downward price pressure in the short term, but the long-term impact depends on whether new buyers emerge to absorb the supply. Are institutional investors also selling? The CryptoQuant report specifically addresses long-term individual holders. Institutional activity may follow different patterns based on their investment strategies. Found this analysis helpful?

After being rejected around $107,000 in the last bullish wave, Bitcoin continues to fluctuate between $100,000 and $105,000. However, analysis shows that whale wallet savings flows in the market are increasing rapidly. According to The Block, Bitcoin is trading sideways, but large-scale investors/whales continue to accumulate BTC. Timothy Misir, President of BRN Research, noted that whales purchased 45,000 BTC worth approximately $4.6 billion this week, making it the second-largest weekly total of 2025 so far. Misir stated that a significant portion of these Bitcoins have moved from exchanges to cold wallets, indicating that institutional purchases are continuing. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode stated in its latest report that Bitcoin is “consolidating in a gradual decline range.” He noted that BTC has only sustained a limited recovery despite positive macroeconomic changes such as the end of the US government shutdown and the easing of US-China trade tensions. At this point, Glassnode states that the selling pressure has eased around $ 100,000, but there is a supply resistance zone concentrated in the $ 106,000-110,000 range, which limits the upward momentum. *This is not investment advice.

Historically, market peaks have occurred between 1,060 and 1,070 days after those lows, which places the asset at a critical point where a deviation from previous cycles could become statistically meaningful. Traditionally, Bitcoin peaks 12 to 18 months after a halving event. The most recent one took place in April 2024. If that historical pattern were to repeat, Melker said, a market top would be expected between April and October 2025. However, he pointed out that the current market lacks the typical “mania phase.” To top that, altcoins have yet to surge, and investor sentiment remains weak. Many traders have either sold early or stayed on the sidelines, according to his analysis. Bitcoin Breaking Free from Old Patterns Melker suggested that investors’ attempts to front-run the four-year cycle may have altered or “broken” it, and that once the early selling pressure subsides, Bitcoin could begin following a more mature, liquidity-driven trajectory into 2026. “Eventually, the four-year cycle will break – if not now, then probably next time. Whether that means Bitcoin’s entering a new era of institutional flows and real-world adoption, or simply rewriting its pattern, is what makes this moment so fascinating.” A similar perspective was shared by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes last month when he argued that Bitcoin’s traditional four-year price cycle is becoming obsolete. He then asserted that the current bull market could extend far longer due to loose global monetary policy and dismissed the rigid application of the four-year cycle, claiming that traders overlook the real drivers, such as liquidity conditions and credit trends in the US and China. Hayes explained that previous Bitcoin peaks were tied more to tightening in dollar and yuan credit than to halving schedules, suggesting today’s environment is fundamentally different. Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle Obsolete? More recently, PlanB, the creator of Bitcoin’s well-known stock-to-flow model, has also begun questioning the cycle. Responding to bearish views that $126,000 marked the market top and that 2026 will usher in a bear phase, he called such assumptions a “big misunderstanding.” PlanB argued that just three completed cycles are insufficient to establish a dependable pattern and stressed that it is “absolutely not guaranteed” for Bitcoin to peak 18 months after a halving, which would imply October 2025. He suggested that the next market top could just as easily occur in 2026, 2027, or even 2028, adding that he is now more focused on Bitcoin’s average price levels rather than short-term peaks and troughs. According to him, the market has yet to undergo a “fundamental phase transition,” which could either lead to a major rally or a more stable, institutionally influenced regime – both outcomes he considers bullish.

The concerns centre on draft amendments to Vietnam’s high‑tech law , currently under review by the Vietnam National Assembly and expected to be adopted in December. Specifically, the amendments would phase out certain preferential tax, duty, and land-use incentives for high-tech firms that have been a cornerstone of Vietnam’s foreign direct investment (FDI) strategy. Samsung tells Vietnam to keep its tax policies friendly for foreign investors Samsung Electronics has built factories in Bac Ninh and Thai Nguyen, hiring tens of thousands of Vietnamese workers to produce 60% of the smartphones it sells worldwide. Samsung contributes over one-tenth of Vietnam’s total exports and has helped the country become a significant part of the global tech supply chain. However, Samsung and other South Korean companies are now concerned that the new law will eliminate the special benefits afforded to high-tech companies, including lower taxes, exemptions from duties, and more affordable access to land. Korean business leaders stated that removing these benefits would make it difficult for companies like Samsung to initiate new projects or factories, as prices would likely skyrocket. The Korean Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam (Kocham) and Ko Tae Yeon said the changes might slow down investment and hinder the country’s long-term growth goals. He asked the government to maintain favourable policies for foreign investors, so that companies can continue to bring new technology and jobs into Vietnam. Korean officials stated that Samsung expressed its concerns privately but did not threaten to halt or reduce its investments. The company requests that the government clarify how the new rules apply to existing projects and compensate companies for any resulting losses. Samsung and other investors want the government to ensure that the policies adhere to the global tax rules, including a 15% minimum tax, to reduce unexpected costs. The global tax plan by Vietnam makes foreign companies uneasy Korean companies in Vietnam have consistently enjoyed favourable corporate tax rates, which have been as low as 5%. This means the firm has more money to build new factories, hire workers, and increase exports. Now that the government has increased these rates, companies are worried that costs will be high. The government of Vietnam has promised to compensate for any losses the changes cause, but investors say the process of getting these funds is slow and unclear. They say these unclear rules may cause delays that make it difficult to plan for new projects or continue current operations. Experts say the new 15% minimum may not affect companies that already pay this rate; however, the fact that there is no published legal text and the rules remain unclear is very troubling. On the other hand, analysts suggest that the government can provide direct grants, research and development (R&D) credits, or other forms of support that adhere to international tax rules to attract investors. However, companies currently lack the confidence to plan future investments because these benefits are still not tangible.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $101,986.64 on the Binance USDT market, marking a concerning downturn for investors and traders alike. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? The sudden Bitcoin price movement has caught many market participants off guard. Several factors could be contributing to this downward pressure. Market analysts point to potential profit-taking after recent gains, changing investor sentiment, or broader economic factors affecting cryptocurrency markets. Understanding these drivers is crucial for making informed trading decisions. When we examine the Bitcoin price trajectory, we see that this drop represents a significant shift from recent trading patterns. The $102,000 level had previously served as an important support zone, making this breach particularly noteworthy for technical analysts. How Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Affect Traders? The current Bitcoin price situation presents both challenges and opportunities. For active traders, this volatility can create profitable scenarios if managed correctly. However, long-term investors might see this as a potential buying opportunity. Consider these key points: Short-term traders should monitor support and resistance levels closely Long-term holders might view this as a discount opportunity Risk management becomes increasingly important during volatile periods Market sentiment indicators should be watched for trend confirmation What Can We Learn From This Bitcoin Price Action? Every significant Bitcoin price movement offers valuable lessons for market participants. This recent drop below $102,000 reminds us that cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile. The Bitcoin price fluctuation demonstrates the importance of having a clear trading strategy and risk management protocol in place. Moreover, the Bitcoin price behavior highlights how quickly market conditions can change. What seemed like stable ground at $102,000 has now become a resistance level that traders will watch closely for any recovery attempts. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin Price Predictions and Analysis While the current Bitcoin price situation appears concerning, historical patterns suggest that such corrections are normal in cryptocurrency markets. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged, and many analysts believe this could be a healthy correction before the next upward move. However, traders should remain cautious and monitor these key factors that could influence future Bitcoin price movements: Market liquidity conditions Institutional investor activity Regulatory developments Global economic indicators Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $102,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from a combination of profit-taking, changing market sentiment, and broader economic factors affecting cryptocurrency markets. Should I buy Bitcoin at the current price? Investment decisions depend on your risk tolerance and strategy. Some traders see price drops as buying opportunities, while others prefer to wait for stability. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, technical analysts watch key support levels around $100,000 and $98,000 as potential floors for the current correction. Will Bitcoin price recover quickly? Historical patterns show that Bitcoin often experiences sharp corrections followed by recoveries, but timing can be unpredictable. What indicators should I watch for Bitcoin price recovery? Monitor trading volume, market sentiment indicators, and key technical levels above $102,000 for signs of sustained recovery. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin price movements often influence the broader cryptocurrency market, with many altcoins following similar patterns. Share Your Thoughts Found this analysis helpful?

Sentiment has deteriorated quickly as Bitcoin hovers dangerously close to the $100,000 level. The shift began after the October 10 “Big Liquidation” event, which drained upward momentum and pushed several key indicators into bearish territory. Long-term holders are selling hard. ~815K BTC sold in the past 30 days, the highest level since Jan 2024. With demand contracting, this sell-side pressure is weighing on the price pic.twitter.com/jFODp4ZA1p — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 13, 2025 Spot demand contracted earlier in October, while growth in stablecoin liquidity — a critical driver of market inflows — slowed significantly. Together, these factors have created a fragile environment in which Bitcoin’s price struggles to sustain meaningful support. A Market Losing Its Grip on Momentum CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index reflects the extent of the downturn. Earlier in October, when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $126,000, the index stood at a strongly optimistic reading of 80. That optimism evaporated quickly as Bitcoin slipped below $100,000 for the first time since June. The index has now fallen to 20, indicating an extremely bearish environment. The steep decline shows how quickly the market has shifted from aggressive buying to hesitation and caution, with fewer new inflows and weaker spot demand contributing to the downward pressure. Long-Term Holders Unload at Rare Levels One of the most concerning signals in the report is the behaviour of long-term holders. Over the past month, they have sold roughly 815,000 BTC, marking their heaviest distribution since January 2024. This selling occurred as Bitcoin pushed into the $118,000 to $121,000 range, a moment when spot demand had already begun to fade. In earlier phases of the cycle, strong demand from ETFs, institutional traders and retail buyers was sufficient to absorb heavy selling from long-term holders. That buffer is now absent. Instead, the combination of steady supply from long-term holders and weakening demand is placing clear downward pressure on the market, raising the risk of further price deterioration. Profit-Taking Stays Strong, but Capitulation Is Absent Profit realization remains elevated. On November 7, investors locked in approximately $3 billion in net profits, mirroring the aggressive selling seen throughout October. Despite the heavy profit-taking, the market has yet to show signs of capitulation. Realized losses remain extremely low, suggesting that holders are not panic-selling even as price support weakens. This dynamic — strong profits but minimal losses — indicates that the market has not formed a bottom. Historically, price floors emerge only after losses rise and weak hands exit the market, a pattern that has not yet appeared. The Battle at the 365-Day Moving Average Bitcoin’s current struggle centres on the 365-day moving average, which sits near $102,000. This line has served as the ultimate support level throughout the current bull cycle and was one of the last major indicators to turn bearish during the 2021–2022 transition into a prolonged downturn. Bitcoin has now dipped below this level several times — a warning sign not seen earlier in this cycle. If the price continues to close beneath the 365-day average, the risk of a deeper correction grows considerably. CryptoQuant notes that the next areas of meaningful support lie significantly lower, suggesting that failure to reclaim this moving average could accelerate a broader market decline. Bitcoin now stands at a critical juncture. With momentum fading, long-term holders selling heavily, and spot demand failing to keep pace, the market’s ability to stabilize depends heavily on whether Bitcoin can reclaim its 365-day moving average. The coming weeks may determine whether this is a temporary pullback or the start of a more significant correction.

This strategic acquisition represents a significant step forward in making cryptocurrency investments accessible through retirement accounts, potentially transforming how millions of Americans plan for their financial future. What Does Public Acquiring Alto Crypto Business Mean for Investors? The acquisition allows Public to integrate Alto’s technology that enables users to invest in cryptocurrencies using their Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). This means investors can now potentially include digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in their retirement portfolios alongside traditional stocks and bonds. The move comes at a time when more investors are seeking diversified retirement options beyond conventional markets. This strategic decision by Public to acquire Alto’s crypto business addresses a growing demand from investors who want exposure to cryptocurrency markets within tax-advantaged retirement accounts. The $65 million price tag reflects the substantial value both companies see in this emerging market segment. Why Is This Acquisition So Important for Crypto Adoption? The deal represents a major milestone for cryptocurrency mainstream adoption. Here are the key benefits this acquisition brings: Expanded access to cryptocurrency investments through retirement accounts Regulatory compliance and security for retirement-focused crypto investing Simplified process for managing traditional and digital assets in one platform Tax advantages of holding cryptocurrencies in IRA accounts Professional oversight for retirement-focused crypto investments When Public acquires Alto crypto business capabilities, they’re not just buying technology—they’re acquiring expertise in navigating the complex regulatory landscape surrounding retirement accounts and digital assets. How Will This Change Retirement Investing? The integration of Alto’s technology means Public users can soon expect seamless access to cryptocurrency markets through their existing retirement accounts. This eliminates the need for multiple platforms and complicated transfer processes. The acquisition positions Public as a comprehensive solution for both traditional and alternative investments. However, investors should remain aware of the unique challenges cryptocurrency investments present. The volatile nature of digital assets means retirement portfolios could experience significant fluctuations. Proper risk management and portfolio diversification remain crucial when including cryptocurrencies in long-term retirement planning. What’s Next After Public Acquires Alto Crypto Business? The successful integration of Alto’s technology will be critical to the acquisition’s long-term success. Public must ensure a smooth transition for existing Alto users while maintaining the security and reliability that retirement investors expect. The company will likely focus on: Integrating Alto’s technology into the Public platform Maintaining regulatory compliance across all offerings Educating users about cryptocurrency investment risks and opportunities Expanding the range of available digital assets Ensuring robust security measures for all investments This acquisition demonstrates Public’s commitment to providing comprehensive investment solutions that meet evolving investor preferences. The decision to acquire Alto crypto business capabilities shows foresight in recognizing the growing intersection between traditional finance and digital assets. Conclusion: A New Era for Retirement Investing The news that Public acquires Alto crypto business for $65 million marks a significant moment in financial technology convergence. This strategic move bridges the gap between traditional retirement planning and emerging digital asset classes, offering investors unprecedented flexibility and choice. As cryptocurrency continues to mature as an asset class, such integrations will likely become more common, potentially reshaping how generations approach retirement savings and investment diversification. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Public acquire from Alto? Public acquired Alto’s cryptocurrency business division, including their technology platform that enables cryptocurrency investing through IRA accounts, for $65 million. Can I now invest in crypto through my Public retirement account? Yes, once the integration is complete, Public users will be able to invest in cryptocurrencies through their retirement accounts using the technology acquired from Alto. What types of cryptocurrencies will be available? While specific assets haven’t been announced, Alto previously offered access to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and Public will likely continue this approach. Is investing in crypto through retirement accounts safe? While Public will implement security measures, cryptocurrency investments carry unique risks including volatility and regulatory uncertainty that investors should carefully consider. When will the integration be complete? Public hasn’t announced a specific timeline, but such integrations typically take several months to ensure proper functionality and security. What happens to existing Alto crypto users? Existing Alto users will likely be migrated to the Public platform, though specific transition details haven’t been publicly disclosed yet.

Far beyond the usual price targets and technical analysis, this message introduces an undercurrent of caution and urgency for XRP holders. According to Time Traveler, whose provocative post suggests that the real concern for those in power is not a few millionaires, but a systemic mass participation in XRP just ahead of a “quick switch”. Hidden Threat: Mass Adoption versus Elite Wealth Time Traveler argues that the elite are unconcerned by you getting rich; they are wary of everyone getting rich . He frames the global population in terms of the top 0.09%—roughly 8 million people—and contends that if too many slip through the cracks and invest in the rail system, the power structure recalibrates. They were never worried about YOU getting rich. You and I are less than 0.09% of the total world population. A measly 8 million people who slip through the cracks and invested in the rail system is accounted for in their strategies to keep power. We will not shift anything by… — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) November 13, 2025 The message: a handful of millionaires do not shift the system. But if the masses buy into XRP ahead of the switch, the balance could tip. A “Quick Switch” in the Making At the heart of the post is the notion that a decisive pivot is imminent—what Time Traveler labels the “quick switch”. According to his narrative, financial systems and rails may be realigned, and being on the “inside” or early could matter. The post invites holders to see not just price upside, but positioning ahead of structural change. If true, this would reshape the common narrative around XRP, moving it from speculative gain to strategic participation. Why XRP? Why Now? XRP’s context adds weight to the discussion. After the sales finally withdrew their appeals in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission vs. Ripple Labs case, regulatory clarity has improved. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The token is increasingly viewed as a vehicle for cross‑border rails and institutional flows . Yet the idea of “everyone buying XRP before the switch” remains speculative. Time Traveler’s message is bold—less about proven mechanics, more about narrative leverage and timing. Implications for Investors For XRP holders and newcomers alike, this message reframes priority. Timing and breadth of adoption become as important as price targets. The claim underscores that wealth concentrated in a few hands doesn’t alter the system—but broad ownership might. It suggests reflecting on not only how much you hold, but when and how widely others hold it. It also prompts caution: narratives carry power, but they do not replace due diligence. XRP remains volatile, subject to regulatory, macro, and sector‑specific risks. Final Reflection Time Traveler’s assertion—that “they don’t want everyone to buy XRP before this quick switch”—transforms the debate. It asks you to think beyond “Will XRP hit $X?” to “Will the switch happen, and will I be positioned ahead of it?” Whether the prophecy unfolds as stated or not, the perspective adds a layer of strategic thinking to the XRP story. As always, research remains paramount—narrative intrigues, but fundamentals and timing drive outcomes. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With investors now bracing for an explosive bull run, the question is: Which token will be the Dogecoin alternative of the cycle? One project catching attention is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a viral Layer 2 meme chain set to dominate the next phase of meme coin rally. Dogecoin’s Legacy and the Search for the Next Big Meme Coin Dogecoin pioneered the meme coin era. It was built on humor, community, and virality. But as its price hovers around $0.18, its returns have cooled off. With a multi-billion-dollar market cap, Dogecoin’s potential for 100x growth has diminished, leaving investors asking a simple question: What’s the next Dogecoin? Dogecoin Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The answer may not just be another meme. It’s Little Pepe , a project that fuses the viral magic of memes with real blockchain infrastructure. As a next-gen meme project, it promises the same community-driven power but adds something DOGE never had: actual DeFi utility and cutting-edge Layer 2 performance. Little Pepe is not just riding the meme wave. It’s building an entire meme Layer 2 network, designed for near-zero trading fees, lightning-fast transactions, and seamless meme token launches. That means future meme coins could debut on the Little Pepe chain itself, fueling long-term demand for LILPEPE. Little Pepe: The Dogecoin Alternative Redefining Meme Coin Utility Little Pepe’s biggest edge lies in its meme Layer 2 architecture, a first-of-its-kind blockchain designed exclusively for meme coins and viral projects. Unlike Dogecoin’s slower Proof-of-Work chain, Little Pepe’s Layer 2 delivers sniper-bot resistant trading, zero buy/sell tax, and near-zero fees, making it perfect for high-volume meme trading. This technology sets Little Pepe apart as the Dogecoin alternative that is building real utility beneath the humor. Developers will soon be able to launch new meme tokens through its meme-only Launchpad, creating an entire ecosystem powered by LILPEPE. The project also offers high-staking APY, rewarding long-term holders while maintaining strict vesting schedules that prevent devastating dumps. Its CertiK audit and transparent tokenomics add another layer of credibility, making it one of the safest early-stage meme investments in 2025. Presale Momentum and Whale Accumulation Drive Buzz More impressively, Little Pepe has raised over $27.4 million in its presale, selling 16.6 billion tokens at $0.0022, a 120% gain from Stage 1’s $0.001 price. With a $52.4 million target and launch price set at $0.003, it’s fast approaching the point where early buyers could see triple-digit gains even before listings begin. The project’s launch price of $0.003 offers immediate upside potential, and analysts are already forecasting a 10,000% rally post-launch, a level of growth that cements its position as the most promising Dogecoin alternative on the market. Adding fuel to the momentum, Little Pepe’s Mega Giveaway campaign offers over 15 ETH in prizes, rewarding top buyers and random participants through Stages 12–17. This massive incentive program has created viral engagement across X and Telegram, further amplifying presale demand. Best Crypto to Buy Now? LILPEPE Looks Like the Popular Option As the next bull run heats up, investors aren’t just looking for nostalgia. They want meme coins that can scale, earn, and evolve. Little Pepe fits that profile perfectly. It has unique utilities, a detailed roadmap, impending CEX listings, and a community-first ecosystem. It may provide both short-term buzz and long-term value. At under $0.005, LILPEPE offers entry-level pricing that could multiply exponentially after listings. Those who missed Dogecoin’s early days may finally have a second chance.

RISE , the fastest Ethereum Layer 2, today announced a new strategic direction with the launch of RISE MarketCore and RISEx , as it continues its mission to become the global home for onchain markets. These new platforms establish a comprehensive ecosystem for onchain trading, transitioning RISE from a high-performance execution layer into the foundational engine for global onchain markets. This expansion is bolstered by the recent acquisition of BSX Labs , which contributes key technology to RISE’s new global markets offering. Traditional financial markets, from equities to FX, all run on orderbooks. Until now, this market structure has been largely incompatible with blockchain technology due to latency and complexity. RISE’s performance advancements solve this, enabling orderbooks to operate entirely onchain for the first time. This development enables a level of deep liquidity, programmability, and composability never before possible in finance. RISE is leveraging its high-performance L2 to launch a new orderbook infrastructure and perpetuals DEX, turning its leading performance edge into a programmable market structure, the core engine that powers global onchain trading. RISE MarketCore , built on RISE’s ultra-low latency EVM, provides an orderbook infrastructure with deep, shared liquidity that enables anyone to launch fully onchain spot and perpetual markets fast and permissionlessly; with future support planned for additional orderbook-based primitives such as options and prediction markets. It solves key challenges by offering native orderbook primitives, risk engines, and APIs directly at the base layer. Builders can plug into liquid books, founders can list their tokens permissionlessly, and asset issuers can launch their own markets or entire exchanges. RISEx is the ecosystem’s flagship application, the first Integrated Perpetuals DEX, where DeFi co-exists with CEX-grade perpetuals. Built on the EVM, it delivers a premium trading experience with deep liquidity, tight spreads, and seamless execution. Every order, margin update, and settlement occurs synchronously onchain, providing both speed and composability while maintaining full transparency for traders and market makers. “RISE was never just about building a faster blockchain. It’s about enabling a new market structure for the internet,” said Sam Battenally , CEO of RISE. “With RISE MarketCore and RISEx, we’re turning the chain itself into the global home for onchain markets, a programmable foundation where liquidity, risk, and innovation converge onchain. This is the infrastructure global finance will be built on: composable, transparent, and unstoppable.” Overview of RISE Platform Functions RISE’s evolution gives developers and institutions a programmable foundation for global market infrastructure. Key capabilities include: Native Orderbook Infrastructure: Shared, composable books for both spot and perpetuals markets Programmable Instruments: SDKs and APIs for building custom products and market logic High-Performance EVM: Millisecond-class latency and high throughput that ensure seamless execution Flagship Exchange: RISEx bootstraps ecosystem liquidity and sets a new standard for onchain trading Next Phase of RISE Platform Development RISEx enters its closed mainnet this quarter, followed by a public mainnet launch in early 2026. RISE MarketCore will then open for the permissionless deployment of new spot and perps markets. The future roadmap includes expanding the Markets SDK to support options, structured products, and prediction markets, all running natively on RISE’s shared orderbook infrastructure. About RISE RISE is the Home for Global Markets, a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 that powers programmable markets onchain. Built for CEX-grade performance and full EVM composability; RISE enables builders, traders, and institutions to create and connect to global orderbooks alongside a thriving DeFi ecosystem with ease.

The current market downturn has investors concerned as the S&P 500 drops 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite plunges 1.7%. This significant pullback reflects growing investor anxiety about economic conditions and market stability. Why Are U.S. Stocks Extending Losses? Market analysts point to several factors driving the current decline. Rising interest rates continue to pressure growth stocks, particularly in the technology sector. Moreover, inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions create uncertainty that makes investors cautious. The fact that U.S. stocks extend losses suggests this isn’t just a temporary correction but potentially a broader market shift. Technology stocks face particular pressure as the Nasdaq’s 1.7% drop indicates. Companies reliant on future earnings struggle when borrowing costs increase. Additionally, consumer spending patterns are changing as economic conditions evolve. These combined factors explain why U.S. stocks extend losses across multiple trading sessions. What Does This Market Movement Mean for Investors? When U.S. stocks extend losses, it’s crucial to understand the implications for your investment strategy. This environment presents both challenges and opportunities for savvy investors. Consider these key points: Diversification matters more than ever during extended downturns Quality companies often recover faster when markets stabilize Market corrections create buying opportunities for long-term investors Risk management becomes essential when volatility increases Historical data shows that when U.S. stocks extend losses, patient investors who maintain discipline typically see better long-term results. However, understanding your risk tolerance and investment timeline remains critical during these periods. How Should You Respond to Extended Market Losses? Seeing U.S. stocks extend losses can trigger emotional decisions, but successful investors follow proven strategies. First, avoid panic selling during market downturns. Second, review your portfolio allocation to ensure it matches your risk profile. Third, consider dollar-cost averaging to take advantage of lower prices. Remember that market cycles are normal, and periods where U.S. stocks extend losses have occurred throughout market history. The current situation where U.S. stocks extend losses provides an opportunity to reassess your investment approach and make strategic adjustments. Key Takeaways from the Current Market Downturn The pattern where U.S. stocks extend losses teaches valuable lessons about market behavior. Volatility is a natural part of investing, and successful navigation requires both knowledge and emotional control. The current situation where U.S. stocks extend losses emphasizes the importance of having a well-defined investment strategy. As we observe U.S. stocks extend losses, remember that market conditions constantly evolve. Staying informed and maintaining perspective helps investors make better decisions during challenging periods. The fact that U.S. stocks extend losses today doesn’t necessarily predict tomorrow’s performance. Frequently Asked Questions How long might U.S. stocks continue extending losses? Market downturns vary in duration, but historical patterns suggest most corrections last between 3-6 months. However, each situation has unique drivers that influence the timeline. Should I sell my stocks during extended losses? Panic selling often locks in losses. Instead, consider your long-term strategy and whether current prices represent buying opportunities for quality investments. Which sectors are most affected when U.S. stocks extend losses? Technology and growth stocks typically experience larger declines during market downturns, while defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples often show more resilience. How can I protect my portfolio during extended market losses? Diversification across asset classes, maintaining cash reserves, and focusing on quality companies with strong fundamentals can help manage risk during downturns. Do extended losses indicate a coming recession? While prolonged market declines can signal economic concerns, stock market performance alone doesn’t guarantee a recession. Multiple economic indicators provide better recession forecasting. When is the best time to invest during market downturns? Dollar-cost averaging throughout the downturn can be more effective than trying to time the exact market bottom, which even professional investors struggle to predict. Found this analysis helpful?

At the same time, chart analyst Crypto Patel says Binance Coin is testing support near $700, with a familiar breakout structure hinting at a possible move higher if that level holds. BNB Chain multi-sig wallet users told to migrate to Safe Global BNB Chain developers warned that the current BNB Chain multi-sig wallet will sunset soon and urged all users to migrate their funds to Safe Global to keep assets secure. Migration is already open, and users can start the process through Safe’s official migration page or by following the step-by-step thread shared by the team. BNB Chain Multi Sig Migration Screen. Source: BNB Chain Developers on X Developers explained that users must first connect a signer that is part of the Safe account, then import the Safe account from the old fork by giving it a name and pasting the address. After adding a name for the connected signer, users should review the overview screen, verify that the data is correct and then click “Add” to proceed. As users move through the interface, they will see several signals that their current setup runs on an unsupported contract. The ap p shows a warning that the “Base contract is not supported,” a message in the upper right corner stating “This Safe Account was created with an unsupported base contract,” and the same “Base contract is not supported” notice in the settings menu. In the migration interface, users can collapse the “migration2Singleton” section to see a detailed view of the upgrade path. When they click “Migrate,” a transaction creation form appears, allowing them to review the migration transaction before submitting it on-chain. Analyst flags BNB breakout structure with support at $700 Meanwhile, Crypto Patel said Binance Coin’s monthly chart may be repeating a past breakout structure that preceded a sharp rally. In a post on X, the analyst pointed to a recent “break of structure” on BNB/USDT and compared it with an earlier move that he said led to a gain of about 242 percent. BNB Parabolic Setup Chart. Source: CryptoPatel on X According to his chart, BNB has established support near $700 after the latest breakout. From this zone, the previous pattern saw price accelerate into a parabolic leg higher. Patel argued that the current setup shows “the same structure,” with the new support band acting as a launchpad if buyers maintain control. The analysis outlines a potential upside target above $2,300 based on the size of the earlier rally projected from the new support area. The monthly view highlights prior consolidation phases that turned into support before each major advance. However, the scenario depends on BNB holding the $700 region and sustaining momentum on higher timeframes.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-13 16:14:02

RISE , the fastest Ethereum Layer 2, today announced a new strategic direction with the launch of RISE MarketCore and RISEx , as it continues its mission to become the global home for onchain markets. These new platforms establish a comprehensive ecosystem for onchain trading, transitioning RISE from a high-performance execution layer into the foundational engine for global onchain markets. This expansion is bolstered by the recent acquisition of BSX Labs , which contributes key technology to RISE's new global markets offering. Traditional financial markets, from equities to FX, all run on orderbooks. Until now, this market structure has been largely incompatible with blockchain technology due to latency and complexity. RISE’s performance advancements solve this, enabling orderbooks to operate entirely onchain for the first time. This development enables a level of deep liquidity, programmability, and composability never before possible in finance. RISE is leveraging its high-performance L2 to launch a new orderbook infrastructure and perpetuals DEX, turning its leading performance edge into a programmable market structure, the core engine that powers global onchain trading.RISE MarketCore, built on RISE’s ultra-low latency EVM, provides an orderbook infrastructure with deep, shared liquidity that enables anyone to launch fully onchain spot and perpetual markets fast and permissionlessly; with future support planned for additional orderbook-based primitives such as options and prediction markets. It solves key challenges by offering native orderbook primitives, risk engines, and APIs directly at the base layer. Builders can plug into liquid books, founders can list their tokens permissionlessly, and asset issuers can launch their own markets or entire exchanges. RISEx is the ecosystem’s flagship application, the first Integrated Perpetuals DEX, where DeFi co-exists with CEX-grade perpetuals. Built on the EVM, it delivers a premium trading experience with deep liquidity, tight spreads, and seamless execution. Every order, margin update, and settlement occurs synchronously onchain, providing both speed and composability while maintaining full transparency for traders and market makers. “RISE was never just about building a faster blockchain. It’s about enabling a new market structure for the internet,” said Sam Battenally, CEO of RISE. “With RISE MarketCore and RISEx, we’re turning the chain itself into the global home for onchain markets, a programmable foundation where liquidity, risk, and innovation converge onchain. This is the infrastructure global finance will be built on: composable, transparent, and unstoppable.” Overview of RISE Platform Functions RISE’s evolution gives developers and institutions a programmable foundation for global market infrastructure. Key capabilities include: Native Orderbook Infrastructure: Shared, composable books for both spot and perpetuals markets Programmable Instruments: SDKs and APIs for building custom products and market logic High-Performance EVM: Millisecond-class latency and high throughput that ensure seamless execution Flagship Exchange: RISEx bootstraps ecosystem liquidity and sets a new standard for onchain trading Next Phase of RISE Platform Development RISEx enters its closed mainnet this quarter, followed by a public mainnet launch in early 2026. RISE MarketCore will then open for the permissionless deployment of new spot and perps markets. The future roadmap includes expanding the Markets SDK to support options, structured products, and prediction markets, all running natively on RISE’s shared orderbook infrastructure. About RISE RISE is the Home for Global Markets, a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 that powers programmable markets onchain. Built for CEX-grade performance and full EVM composability; RISE enables builders, traders, and institutions to create and connect to global orderbooks alongside a thriving DeFi ecosystem with ease. RISE is rearchitecting the financial stack for a transparent, composable, and unstoppable onchain economy.

54353732,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=218965,1763050511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/54353732.jpeg,Bitcoin Triumph: Metaplanet’s Revolutionary 98.5% Asset Allocation Stuns Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-bitcoin-assets-allocation/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Triumph: Metaplanet’s Revolutionary 98.5% Asset Allocation Stuns Markets In a stunning move that’s shaking the financial world, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has revealed that Bitcoin now comprises a massive 98.5% of its total assets. This revolutionary allocation represents one of the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin strategies ever witnessed, signaling a dramatic shift in how institutions view cryptocurrency as a core asset class. How Did Metaplanet Accumulate Such Massive Bitcoin Assets? Metaplanet’s journey into Bitcoin has been nothing short of extraordinary. The company currently holds 30,823 BTC, acquired at an average price of $108,000 per coin. This positions their Bitcoin assets at a staggering 542.7 billion yen out of their total 550.7 billion yen in holdings. The sheer scale of this investment demonstrates unprecedented confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. The company’s strategic pivot toward Bitcoin assets represents a fundamental rethinking of corporate treasury management. Unlike traditional companies that diversify across multiple asset classes, Metaplanet has placed nearly all its eggs in the Bitcoin basket. This approach challenges conventional investment wisdom and could inspire other corporations to reconsider their own asset allocation strategies. What Does This Mean for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s bold move sends powerful signals across multiple sectors. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin assets showcases several key advantages that other corporations might consider: Inflation hedge against currency devaluation Portfolio diversification beyond traditional assets Long-term store of value strategy Technological forward-thinking positioning Moreover, this allocation to Bitcoin assets demonstrates how publicly traded companies can leverage cryptocurrency to potentially enhance shareholder value. The transparency of their reporting and the clear communication of their strategy provide a blueprint for other firms considering similar moves. What Challenges Come With Such Concentrated Bitcoin Assets? While Metaplanet’s strategy appears bold and forward-thinking, it’s not without significant risks. Concentrating 98.5% of assets in any single investment class, even Bitcoin, raises important considerations about volatility management and risk mitigation. The company must navigate several challenges with their substantial Bitcoin assets allocation. Price volatility remains a constant concern, and regulatory changes could impact their strategy. However, their average purchase price of $108,000 suggests they’re playing a long-term game rather than seeking short-term gains. How Will This Impact Future Institutional Bitcoin Investment? Metaplanet’s unprecedented commitment to Bitcoin assets could serve as a catalyst for broader institutional adoption. Other companies watching this experiment will likely consider several factors when evaluating their own potential Bitcoin investments: Storage and security solutions for large Bitcoin holdings Accounting and reporting standards for Bitcoin assets Regulatory compliance across jurisdictions Shareholder communication strategies The success or failure of Metaplanet’s concentrated Bitcoin assets strategy will undoubtedly influence how other corporations approach cryptocurrency allocation. Their transparency about holdings and acquisition costs sets a new standard for corporate Bitcoin reporting. Conclusion: A New Era for Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Metaplanet’s revolutionary allocation of 98.5% of assets to Bitcoin marks a watershed moment in corporate finance. This bold strategy demonstrates extreme confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and could inspire similar moves across the corporate landscape. While the risks are substantial, the potential rewards could redefine how companies manage their treasuries in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions How many Bitcoin does Metaplanet currently hold? Metaplanet holds 30,823 BTC, making up 542.7 billion yen of their total 550.7 billion yen in assets. What percentage of Metaplanet’s assets is in Bitcoin? Bitcoin comprises exactly 98.5% of Metaplanet’s total assets, representing one of the most concentrated corporate Bitcoin allocations ever recorded. At what average price did Metaplanet acquire their Bitcoin? The company purchased their Bitcoin assets at an average price of $108,000 per coin, indicating a strategic long-term investment approach. Is this the largest corporate Bitcoin allocation? While other companies hold significant Bitcoin, Metaplanet’s 98.5% allocation represents one of the most concentrated corporate Bitcoin strategies publicly disclosed. What risks does Metaplanet face with this strategy? The primary risks include Bitcoin price volatility, regulatory changes, security concerns, and the challenges of managing such a concentrated asset portfolio. Could other companies follow Metaplanet’s approach? While most companies would likely maintain more diversification, Metaplanet’s strategy could inspire increased Bitcoin allocation across corporate treasuries.
