Ethereum ETFs see $107 million in outflows, weighing on broader sentiment. Key support sits at $2.38, with resistance at $2.59 and $2.70. By Jainam Mehta ​XRP ( XRP-USD ) rose 1.8% to trade near $2.42 on Wednesday, holding above its ascending support line as it reclaimed short-term moving averages on the 4-hour chart. The rebound follows a week of volatility across the crypto market, with Ethereum ETFs recording $107 million in outflows on November 11—their largest in weeks—prompting speculation that liquidity may be rotating toward alternative assets like XRP. From a technical perspective, XRP remains within a rising structure that has persisted since late October. The 20-, 50-, and 100-period EMAs cluster between $2.41–$2.43, forming a tight confluence zone. A decisive close above this range could unlock upside potential toward $2.59, the previous local high and upper Bollinger Band level. Beyond that, $2.70 marks the next resistance zone, where prior rallies have consistently stalled. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Immediate support is seen at $2.38, followed by the ascending trendline base near $2.26, a level that has repeatedly attracted buying interest. The Bollinger Bands have begun to widen, signaling a potential increase in volatility after several sessions of compression. The RSI remains neutral, suggesting the current upward drift could extend if price action holds above the moving average cluster. The broader tone remains cautiously constructive. XRP’s resilience relative to other large-cap altcoins suggests short-term stability, especially as market participants await confirmation of stronger inflows or trend continuation. Ethereum outflows and capital rotation shape sentiment Market data from CoinGlass shows persistent net outflows from Ethereum spot exchanges, totaling $22.7 million on November 12. A significant factor was BlackRock’s $19.8 million Ethereum sale, which contributed to total ETF redemptions exceeding $107 million in a single session. These outflows underline a period of defensive positioning among institutional investors, particularly within the smart contract and DeFi segment, which has experienced weaker fund inflows since late October. In contrast, XRP’s steadier structure and lower speculative leverage have made it an attractive alternative for traders seeking relative stability amid sector-wide volatility. While Ethereum continues to dominate market headlines—especially after Fundstrat’s Tom Lee reiterated a forecast calling for ETH to reach $9,000–$12,000 in early 2026—short-term fund movements reflect a tactical rebalancing rather than broad bullish conviction. If this rotation persists, XRP could benefit from incremental capital flows, particularly as the asset continues to maintain key structural support and shows less liquidation pressure than high-beta peers. Outlook XRP’s technical bias remains mildly bullish above $2.38, though a breakout above $2.59 is required to confirm trend reversal momentum. The rising support line near $2.26 remains the critical invalidation level for buyers. If the base holds, the next upside target sits near $2.70, while failure to sustain above $2.43 could reopen downside pressure toward $2.26. Previously discussed analysis identified the $2.60 region as the decisive barrier separating consolidation from breakout. That outlook remains unchanged. Sustained strength above that level would mark a clear shift in sentiment , aligning XRP’s recovery with improving sector liquidity trends.

In 2017, Ethereum transformed a few hundred dollars into life-changing wealth. Solana followed in 2021, rising from under a dollar to over $200. Now, analysts suggest that RentStac (RNS) could be next, applying the same principle of scarcity and timing but with real-world assets supporting its growth. Unlike speculative projects that depend solely on market hype, RentStac bridges decentralized finance with verified rental income. It is designed to connect digital tokens with property-backed value, making it one of the few DeFi ecosystems that merge blockchain scalability with real economic output. Lessons from the Past History shows that wealth in crypto often starts with small, early investments in projects that solve real problems. Ethereum introduced programmable contracts. Solana proved that speed could scale blockchain. RentStac builds on both ideas by using blockchain to distribute income from tokenized rental properties. Through RentStac , investors can access legally registered SPVs that hold income-generating assets. Rental profits are distributed on-chain in stablecoins, combining transparency with consistent yield potential. Why RentStac Stands Out Many DeFi projects promise high rewards but lack structure. RentStac’s system is built for sustainability. Holders earn yield in two ways: through staking rewards and through income derived from real-world properties. This dual-yield mechanism creates an ecosystem that rewards both long-term holders and active participants. The platform’s deflationary design, combined with transparent property reporting, positions it among the few DeFi models with measurable fundamentals instead of speculative buzz. Key Presale Data The project operates on verified metrics published openly on its website: Total supply: 2,000,000,000 RNS Presale allocation: 40% (about 800 million tokens) Target funding: $27.45 million over 7 stages Current price: $0.025 per token Active bonus: 100% additional tokens for early buyers These parameters are publicly accessible on RentStac.com and ensure accountability throughout each phase of the presale. A Simple Example: $100 Today At the current price of $0.025, a $100 investment buys 4,000 RNS tokens. With the 100 percent bonus for early participants, that number doubles to 8,000 tokens. If RNS reaches a future market price of $1, the original $100 position would be worth $8,000. Should it follow the path of early DeFi leaders like Solana, which multiplied over 200 times, that same entry could theoretically approach $20,000. This example demonstrates the power of timing and real-world backing in a presale structured for growth and transparency. Security and Real-World Connection Security is central to RentStac’s foundation. The project scored 92.48 percent on Solidity Scan, with a full CertiK audit in progress. Each property is managed through a dedicated SPV, providing legal verification and independent oversight. RentStac also uses multi-signature wallets, DAO-based voting, and oracle validation to maintain transparency in property performance and token distribution. This framework ensures every transaction is verifiable and tied to real-world value. A New Direction for DeFi As the DeFi sector matures, investors are seeking more than hype. They want yield backed by real income streams and assets that can outlast volatility. RentStac’s model brings together blockchain innovation and tangible economics, offering a structure that appeals to both retail and institutional players. With a fixed supply, a transparent presale, and property-backed returns, RentStac (RNS) represents a potential milestone in the evolution of decentralized finance and one of the most promising opportunities in 2025.

54324166,626176,1762988413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54324166.jpeg,Is the XRP ETF About to Get Approved? Bipartisan Senate Vote Could Reopen US Government,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-bipartisan-senate-vote/,"The XRP community might finally have a reason to celebrate as the United States Senate has just voted 60-40 to advance a bill that would reopen the federal government, a major step toward ending the longest shutdown in American history. This vote could be the moment everything changes for the crypto market, and especially for holders. Now that lawmakers are working to restore government operations, the next outlook is what could come next once the SEC returns to full capacity, and it opens up the question of whether Spot XRP ETFs will soon get approved. Senate Vote Brings Hope for XRP ETF Decisions Monday’s 60-40 Senate vote brought a sigh of relief to markets and set the stage for a final House vote as early as Wednesday. The bipartisan measure, if approved, will unlock government funding and allow regulators, including the SEC, to resume their normal operations after more than a month of near standstill. During the shutdown, SEC staff responsible for reviewing ETF filings were furloughed, effectively freezing dozens of applications from major asset managers. This included those for Dogecoin , Cardano, Solana, and most notably, XRP ETFs, which had already crossed their decision deadlines in October. It is important to note that the agency had issued new procedural guidelines for ETF filings shortly before the shutdown to make approvals much easier and faster, but the freeze effectively stalled all progress. Although there is still work to be done for the shutdown to end, the focus is now on how quickly the SEC will resume its backlog once operations restart. There is enough optimism that the XRP ETF filings, which have witnessed significant public attention, could be among the first to move forward once reviews begin again. Spot ETFs Waiting For the Green Light XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap (minus stablecoin USDT), so it is only natural that it becomes the next cryptocurrency with tradable Spot ETFs in the US market. Several major firms have filed for spot XRP ETFs over the past few months, hoping to bring the same level of institutional exposure to the altcoin that Bitcoin and Ethereum are enjoying. Among those in line are Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares. These issuers had expected SEC responses in October, but the government shutdown disrupted the timeline. There are already different XRP futures and leveraged ETFs available , but they do not cause the same sort of buying pressure as Spot XRP ETFs. Unlike futures-based ETFs, Spot ETFs actually hold the underlying asset, in this case, XRP. That means investors could gain direct exposure through traditional brokerage accounts without holding the tokens themselves. The market impact could be massive once these Spot ETFs are approved. Institutional demand flows in once a regulated product becomes available, just as it did with Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Therefore, Spot XRP ETFs will mean a rise in price and liquidity for the cryptocurrency.",XRP|ETF|ETF news|ripple|ripple news|XRP ETF|XRP ETF news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-12 23:00:13

Prices are not shooting higher yet. At press time Bitcoin trades around $104,500, down 0.5% over the past day. Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst Traders watched a decline of about 1.8% earlier that pushed the price near $103,400 and it briefly touched $102,850 during the move. Stablecoin Signal Points Toward Accumulation CryptoQuant analyst Moreno points to the Stablecoin Supply Ratio, or SSR, as the first clear indicator. The SSR compares Bitcoin’s market cap to the total market cap of stablecoins. It has dropped back into the 13 range. Based on historical readings, that 13 area has lined up with market lows in mid-2021 and at several moments across 2024. Reports show that when SSR fell to similar levels, liquidity quietly built up and buying followed after a period of low volatility. Liquidity Pattern Has Appeared Before Every Bitcoin Surge — And It’s Back “We’re witnessing a liquidity configuration that has only appeared a handful of times since 2020, and each instance marked a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s trajectory.” – By @MorenoDV_ pic.twitter.com/vWKcCkyn55 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 11, 2025 Binance Reserve Trends Add A Second Layer The second metric Moreno highlights comes from Binance. On that exchange, stablecoin balances are rising while Bitcoin reserves are shrinking. In plain terms: more cash-like tokens sit on the exchange and fewer coins are being held there. That pattern has appeared only a handful of times since 2020, according to the data he referenced. Each time, the movement suggested capital waiting on the sidelines and holders moving coins off exchanges into longer-term storage. Market Calm Can Hide Big Moves The current trading backdrop is cautious. Many investors expected a lift after news that the US Congress approved short-term federal funding through January 30, yet crypto did not rally with other risk assets. Some capital rotated back to stocks. At the same time, large holders took profits after recent highs, and momentum cooled. That mix shows how macro events can shift flows without immediately turning into crypto buying. Risk Still Exists — Structure Could Break Moreno warns this liquidity zone acts like a final structural support. If the metrics break down decisively, it could signal a deeper reset before any sustained recovery. In that scenario, buying would likely be delayed and volatility would rise. This is not a guaranteed outcome, but it is a clear risk that traders watch closely. Outlook: Limited Downside, Growing Upside Based on reports and on-chain signals, Moreno believes the risk-to-reward favors buyers at these levels. He points to the built-up stablecoin supply and falling exchange BTC reserves as reasons for that view. Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming Historical patterns suggest the last three months of the year often bring gains for Bitcoin, but past behavior does not promise future returns. For now, the indicators show capital parked in stablecoins and fewer coins available on major exchanges. That creates a setup where fresh buying could push the market higher quickly if sentiment turns. Yet the opposite is possible: a break below these levels would reshape the cycle and force many participants to rethink positions. Markets will decide which path comes next.

SEC Chair Paul Atkins Weighs Token Taxonomy Speaking at The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s FinTech Conference on November 12, Atkins announced that he is weighing the creation of a token taxonomy “anchored in the longstanding Howey investment contract securities analysis” as the next phase of the SEC’s “Project Crypto” initiative. I was honored to give the keynote at the @PhiladelphiaFed ’s Ninth Annual Fintech Conference this morning. My remarks outlined the next steps in the @SECgov ’s Project Crypto and what to expect in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/WI79ANJrfD — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) November 12, 2025 While Atkins assured that the taxonomy “aims to complement, not replace, Congress’s critical work,” he said that he views most crypto tokens as non-securities . Atkins declared that he believes digital commodities, digital collectibles, and digital tools do not constitute securities, while tokenized securities do, as they “represent the ownership of a financial instrument enumerated in the definition of ‘security’ that is maintained on a crypto network.” “A reasonable Commission approach to crypto will not by itself decide the fate of the market—or of any particular project,” Atkins said. “Markets will do that.” “But it will help to ensure that the United States remains a place where people can experiment and learn, fail and succeed, under rules that are both firm and fair,” he added. New Crypto Market Structure Draft Outlines SEC, CFTC Collaboration Atkins’ commentary comes just days after Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) announced their own crypto market structure legislation discussion draft. The draft specifically orders the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to “collaborate on necessary inter-agency rulemakings.” “As Congress works to expand authority for the commission to oversee the trading of digital assets that are commodities, it’s essential that we also ensure it has the tools, personnel, and resources necessary to carry out this new mission, along with its current responsibilities,” Boozman said.

Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity are choosing Ethereum to power their real-world asset (RWA) offerings — a major sign of growing trust from traditional finance. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund, for example, tokenizes U.S. Treasury bonds directly on Ethereum, letting investors earn yield through decentralized rails. This rising institutional adoption is one of the strongest signals yet that Ethereum’s long-term trajectory could still be just getting started. The total assets under management (AUM) of these products have increased by an eye-popping 2,000% since January 2024, according to data from Token Terminal. This emphasizes institutions’ growing interest in tokenization. A report from Fidelity Digital Assets in early October highlighted that “beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, some of the most noteworthy developments in digital assets are happening in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).” Ethereum’s lead in this market gives it a unique edge that favors a bullish outlook for its native asset. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Needs a Clean Breakout Above $3,700 to Resume Its Rally ETH found support at the $3,200 level in the past few days. Market volatility has spiked, and trading volumes have exceeded the average as the token struggles to recapture the $4,000 area. The price has retested the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) multiple times lately but has failed to move above it multiple times. A descending price channel has also been forminig since early October as ETH failed to make it to $5,000. The end of the U.S. government shutdown could help Ethereum break out of its descending price channel and resume its upward trajectory to $4,700. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just sent a buy signal upon crossing above the 14-day moving average. If positive momentum accelerates, a break above $3,700 would mark the beginning of its next leg up. As crypto markets bounce back, early presales with strong utility like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could deliver the biggest upside. This ambitious project brings Solana-level speed and low fees to Bitcoin, unlocking the network’s full potential with the first true scaling solution.

The traders who win 2026 won’t be the ones chasing the noisiest charts—they’ll be the ones turning tight spreads, reliable depth, and disciplined risk into steady, repeatable outcomes. That’s where FX quietly outclasses crypto. If you’re building a daily playbook, pressure-test ideas against external filters to avoid narrative traps. Many desks also benchmark BTC/alt flow and session bias via crypto signals telegram before committing real capital, using it as one of several sanity checks rather than a crutch, according to Coinspot , the fast-growing crypto media. Why FX’s “small edges” add up faster in 2026 • Execution survives stress. Event-time liquidity in major pairs means you can size conviction without fills becoming the trade’s biggest risk.• Costs compound. Lower spread + impact + slippage create a structural advantage over hundreds of tickets.• More ways to be right. Policy divergence, terms of trade, and cross-pair rotation offer edges beyond a single “risk-on/risk-off” call. Where crypto still wins—and how to use it wisely • Right-tail convexity: When flows align, momentum can sprint—treat it as a tactical sleeve sized by realized vol.• Idiosyncratic catalysts: Upgrades and tokenomics shifts create event trades off the standard macro calendar.• 24/7 access (with rules): Useful flexibility, but manage weekend gaps and venue fragmentation with defined-risk structures. FX Playbook for 2026 (Do, Don’t, and How) 1) Carry—with guardrails • Do: Target positive real-rate differentials; scale with volatility targeting.• Don’t: Overstay when guidance flips or realized vol spikes.• How: Pre-set cut rules (e.g., two-vol move or guidance change). 2) Event-driven execution • Do: Treat CPI, labor prints, and central-bank days as opportunity maps.• Don’t: Wing it; slippage limits must be written down.• How: Bracket entries, define max impact per ticket, and prewrite exit logic. 3) Pair selection > beta • Do: Hunt relative divergence across G10 and selective EM.• Don’t: Force a single USD narrative to fit every week.• How: Maintain a rotation board (strong/neutral/weak) refreshed after each macro block. 4) XAUUSD as a regime compass • Do: Let gold’s trend inform risk stance in both FX and crypto sleeves.• Don’t: Treat it as dogma—use it to pace aggression, not to predict. Crypto Tactics that actually survive the year • Vol-targeted sizing: Keep exposure proportional to realized vol; adjust quickly on regime change.• Staggered entries/exits: Ladder positions; use time/vol bands for exits to dodge thin-book whipsaws.• Defined-risk optionality: Options/spreads capture upside while capping gap risk. Costs & controls: the overlooked alpha • Track after-cost performance (spread + impact + slippage) per strategy.• Sunset systems that earn less than they cost to run—even if screenshots look great.• Review fills weekly; promote playbooks that keep net efficiency above your hurdle. A portfolio that compounds (not just pops) • Core: FX carry/relative-value/event strategies for steady Sharpe and scalable size.• Tactical: A lean crypto sleeve for momentum bursts, sized by vol and protected by options where sensible.• Overlay: Regime reads from XAUUSD and EUR/USD trend structure to throttle risk. Execution checklist (pin this) • Pre-define maximum slippage per instrument; skip trades that breach it.• Pre-fund collateral to avoid forced exits in stress windows.• Keep event playbooks: what to trade, how to size, where to cut, how to re-enter.• Log and audit after-cost PnL—the only number that compounds. Risks that can flip your board • Policy shocks: Tariffs, sanctions, capital controls—FX reprices first; crypto follows via sentiment.• Liquidity air-pockets: Weekends (crypto) and surprise data (FX) stretch spreads—plan exits before entries.• Rule changes: Constructive long-term, choppy short-term; edges migrate as spreads compress.

Prices have struggled to rise in the face of AI-bubble fears in recent weeks, with Bitcoin and Ethereum down by 9% and 16% in the last 30 days. This may be disappointing for investors, yet most major tokens are now in oversold territory, meaning that they should bounce back soon. And one of the most promising coins in such a context is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based token that’s about to launch crypto’s mine-to-earn platform. Best Altcoin to Buy Today – 12 November Opened in September, PEPENODE’s presale has now raised in excess of $2.1 million, as investors race to buy its native token at discounted prices. While the market is awash in meme coins, what sets PEPENODE apart from the crowd is the fact that it carries some interesting tokenomics and fundamentals. PEPENODE is building something special from the ground up. Buy Meme Nodes. Upgrade Facilities. Earn meme Coins. All on one platform https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/JUTG2F6eXG — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 11, 2025 In particular, it will launch a mine-to-earn token that will provide users with the ability to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, which can earn them rewards in third-party meme coins (e.g., Pepe and Fartcoin). All participants need to build their own rigs is to spend PEPENODE itself on acquiring nodes. The more virtual mining nodes a user owns, the greater their rewards will be. It’s as simple as that, with PEPENODE aiming to remove the complexity and costs that come with normal cryptocurrency mining. And given that users will need to buy PEPENODE to buy more nodes, demand for the token could be high, pushing its price up over time. On top of this, holders of PEPENODE will be able to stake the coin for a passive income, with the coin’s protocol currently paying an APY of just over 600%. This promises to make PEPENODE one of the most exciting and profitable new coins around, something which helps to explain why its presale has taken off. PEPENODE Launch Could Coincide with Bull Rally As a token, PEPENODE will have a max supply of 210 billion tokens, and it has been audited by Coinsult , with no red flags. Given its rising popularity, investors may want to join the presale as early as possible, which they can do by going to the PEPENODE website. They can connect a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), and then buy the desired amount of PEPENODE, which is currently available at $0.0011454. This price will rise at regular intervals until the sale ends, so traders looking to lock in the biggest possible return should act quickly. And because its launch looks likely to coincide with a market-wide recovery, PEPENODE does seem to be one of the best altcoins available right now.

In a recent announcement via the social-media platform X, RippleX noted that its user base is being targeted by fraudulent campaigns that leverage counterfeit livestreams and AI-generated deep-fake videos purporting to represent company executives. The advisory arrives amid a marked increase in scam activity aimed at XRP investors. Fraudsters are reportedly using artificial-intelligence tools to create highly convincing videos appearing to depict executives such as Brad Garlinghouse . These videos typically promise large giveaway rewards of XRP in exchange for token deposits or wallet access, attempts at theft dressed as generosity. The scams often appear in the commentary or reply threads of posts from official accounts, lending them a misleading air of legitimacy. Beware of scams using fake Ripple or XRP livestreams, giveaways, or deepfake videos. Ripple employees will never ask you to send funds, share wallet info, or join investment streams. Always verify information through @Ripple and @RippleXDev . Keep your XRP yours. — RippleX (@RippleXDev) November 11, 2025 RippleX’s Official Guidance to the Community In its warning, RippleX emphasized unequivocally that no member of the company’s management team will ever ask users to transfer funds, participate in investment schemes, or provide wallet seed phrases or private keys. It advised holders of XRP to rely exclusively on official channels, specifically the @RippleX and @RippleXDev handles on X, when verifying any giveaway or promotional activity. The message ended with a direct instruction for users to guard their tokens carefully. Background on Scam Landscape and Company Measures Scams targeting XRP holders are not new, but their sophistication has grown. After Ripple achieved incremental legal and regulatory milestones , fraudsters ramped up impersonation tactics, especially after company announcements. In some cases, fake channels on platforms such as YouTube and X have hosted fraudulent content featuring manipulated imagery and audio claiming celebratory airdrops. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple previously raised legal action against YouTube in 2020 over similar impersonation issues, and later reached an agreement to collaborate on content-removal efforts. Experts now warn that as deep-fake generation tools become more accessible, the risk of fraud targeting crypto users continues to escalate. Why This Matters for XRP Investors The relevance of this advisory is underscored by the fact that high-value crypto assets like XRP attract not only legitimate investment but also malicious actors seeking to exploit user trust. Deep-fake and impersonation scams erode confidence, pose real risk to holdings, and can trigger sizable financial losses. For investors holding or transacting XRP, the alert serves as a reminder that vigilance is essential, no matter how credible a message or appearance may seem. RippleX’s latest message serves as a timely reminder that the prominence of XRP and its ecosystem makes it a recurring target for fraudulent actors . By clarifying that the company will never solicit funds or personal wallet credentials, the advisory aims to equip users with clear guardrails. Investors and community members are advised to confirm all offers through verified sources and to remain highly cautious of any promotion that requests an upfront token transfer or personal wallet access. Staying alert and skeptical remains the best defense. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On-chain data shows whales are loading up, reinforcing a bullish TRUMP price prediction as momentum builds. Data from CryptoQuant shows that whales have been placing large bets on TRUMP across both spot and futures markets, likely anticipating a resolution to the U.S. government shutdown. Trading activity remains intense, with volumes hitting $675 million—nearly half of the token’s circulating supply. Adding fuel to the fire, Trump’s latest proposal to issue $2,000 checks to Americans using tariff revenue has stirred fresh excitement, potentially setting the stage for another leg up in TRUMP’s price. Trump Price Prediction: $15 Target In Sight If TRUMP Stays Above $7 The daily chart shows that TRUMP has broken out of a falling wedge, signaling a possible trend reversal. After retesting and holding the $7 level as support, the token surged to $9.5, now a critical resistance level to watch. This zone aligns with the 200-day EMA, so a decisive move above it could trigger a strong rally toward $15, unlocking a potential 101% gain if bullish momentum holds. The RSI remains above the signal line, suggesting buyers still have the upper hand. As long as TRUMP holds above $7, the uptrend remains intact. While a 10X move may not happen immediately, the token could reach $15 if the President successfully ends the U.S. government shutdown. With meme coins poised for renewed attention as altcoin season approaches, TRUMP may continue leading the pack. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is exploding onto the scene, racking up nearly $4 million in its presale in record time.

Boston Fed President Susan Collins recently made headlines by advocating for holding rates steady amid limited data and persistent inflation concerns. This cautious approach reflects the complex challenges facing monetary policymakers. Why Is Holding Rates Steady the Preferred Approach? Susan Collins, who previously supported rate cuts, now emphasizes the need for patience. The current environment demands holding rates steady because inflation remains elevated while economic data remains incomplete. This strategic pause allows policymakers to gather more information before making their next move. Collins specifically highlighted several key factors supporting her position: Limited inflation data due to government shutdowns Uncertain labor market conditions Balancing risks between inflation and employment Need for clear signs of economic deterioration What Challenges Does Limited Data Create? The government shutdown has created significant data gaps, making policy decisions more difficult. Without complete economic information, holding rates steady becomes the most prudent course of action. Collins stressed that policymakers need reliable data to assess whether the economy requires additional stimulus or continued restraint. This data limitation affects multiple areas: Inflation tracking becomes less precise Employment trends are harder to identify Economic growth measurements are delayed Consumer spending patterns are unclear How Does This Impact Future Rate Decisions? The current stance of holding rates steady sets the stage for future policy moves. Collins indicated that any future rate reductions would require clear evidence of labor market deterioration. This approach ensures that the Fed doesn’t act prematurely while inflation concerns persist. Key considerations for future decisions include: Labor market stability indicators Inflation trajectory over coming months Economic growth projections Global economic conditions What Are the Risks of Moving Too Quickly? Collins warned against hasty policy changes in the current high-uncertainty environment. Holding rates steady helps balance the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Moving too quickly could either reignite inflation or unnecessarily slow economic growth. The primary risks include: Undermining inflation control efforts Creating unnecessary economic volatility Reducing policy credibility Limiting future policy flexibility Conclusion: The Wisdom of Patience in Uncertain Times The decision to advocate for holding rates steady reflects careful consideration of current economic conditions. Susan Collins’ shift from supporting rate cuts to emphasizing patience demonstrates how evolving data and circumstances influence monetary policy. This cautious approach provides the Federal Reserve with valuable time to assess the economic landscape while maintaining stability in financial markets. Frequently Asked Questions Why has Susan Collins changed her position on interest rates? Collins has shifted her stance due to ongoing inflation concerns and limited economic data caused by government shutdowns. She believes holding rates steady provides the best balance between controlling inflation and supporting employment. How long might the Fed continue holding rates steady? The duration depends on incoming economic data. Collins suggests rates should remain at current levels until there are clear signs of either rising inflation or significant labor market deterioration. What economic indicators will trigger rate changes? Key indicators include inflation rates, employment data, wage growth, and economic growth metrics. Clear trends in these areas would prompt reconsideration of the current policy stance. How does limited data affect Fed decisions? Incomplete economic information makes it difficult to assess the true state of the economy. This uncertainty makes holding rates steady the safest approach until more reliable data becomes available. What are the risks of changing rates too soon? Premature rate changes could either accelerate inflation if cuts are too early, or unnecessarily slow economic growth if hikes occur too soon. Both scenarios could harm economic stability. How does this affect consumers and businesses? Holding rates steady maintains current borrowing costs for mortgages, business loans, and credit cards. This provides stability for financial planning while the economic outlook remains uncertain. Found this analysis helpful?

The issue briefly disrupted normal activity across the network before being corrected. Automation Error Triggers Network Disruption The incident began when BitGo’s automated account management system continued to issue new account creation requests even after the wallet’s balance reached zero. On the XRP Ledger, activating a new account requires a base reserve of one XRP, and transactions that do not meet this requirement are automatically rejected. However, the automation did not stop despite the insufficient balance, leading to thousands of consecutive failed transactions. Blockchain explorers recorded a sharp rise in “UNFUNDED_PAYMENT” entries, indicating a high number of unsuccessful operations. Activity metrics showed that the number of attempted account activations spiked to roughly 11,000 in a single day, far above normal levels. Something interesting on chain. I'm not sure yet who is behind it. > BitGo activating thousands of XRP accounts in masses the past couple days. > Account Set tx spike > Multi Sig tx spike There's a story here. pic.twitter.com/QWPEsSfJsy — Vet (@Vet_X0) November 7, 2025 The accumulation of failed entries temporarily congested network trackers, though the ledger’s consensus and transaction integrity remained intact. Community and Developer Response Community members quickly noticed the anomaly. XRPL contributor “Vet” drew attention to the abnormal pattern of account creation attempts and speculated that a coding oversight might have caused the continuous transaction loop. Within hours, developers confirmed that the excessive activity originated from BitGo’s systems. Following the detection of the error, BitGo initiated an internal review and determined that the cause was an automation fault rather than a security breach. The company later replenished the affected wallet with 1,048 XRP to restore functionality and prevent the system from issuing further unfunded payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Once the deposit was made, the repeated failed transactions stopped, and normal operations resumed on the ledger. The event serves as a reminder of the potential network-wide impact of automated processes that interact directly with public blockchains. Even minor scripting oversights can produce widespread operational effects if not properly safeguarded. In this case, while no user assets were affected and no malicious activity occurred, the episode demonstrated how essential it is for custodial providers to maintain robust monitoring and fail-safe mechanisms. At present, the XRP Ledger is operating normally, and BitGo’s systems have stabilized. The incident underscores the importance of proactive reserve management and effective error-handling protocols in automated wallet operations to ensure network reliability and prevent unnecessary transaction load.

By December that year, it hit $19,666. In 2020, when the McRib came back on Dec. 2, BTC was $18,773 and later climbed to $64,895 by April 2022, a gain of 245%. In 2021, the sandwich returned with Bitcoin at $61,000; nine days later, it topped $69,000, a 13% increase and a new record then. The legendary McRib returns 11/11 at most McDonald’s in the US.

He wrote: “Here’s a look back at how Bitcoin has reacted to news that McDonald’s McRib is back on the menu. They just announced it again last week. And you’re bearish?” Voell even shared a chart mapping the digital currency’s price against McRib announcement dates, which caught widespread attention among traders. Other analysts have mixed views. Some market watchers say the pattern reflects how social mood and investor psychology often shape crypto movements more than logic or data. They point out that people tend to find patterns that fit their beliefs, even when the evidence is thin. Others describe the McRib-Bitcoin link as a meme that got too much credit, noting that in some years BTC moved the opposite way despite the sandwich’s return. On Correlation & Causation According to those skeptical voices, the McRib’s timing could simply line up with typical end-of-year optimism in markets. Coincidence, they say, should not be mistaken for a reliable pattern. Analysts have also pointed out that traders often cherry-pick the examples that support the story while ignoring years when the crypto moved differently. Still, the conversation highlights how crypto culture loves turning memes into signals. Some traders treat the McRib’s return as a symbolic marker of good times ahead, a lighthearted reminder that markets are not only driven by numbers but by mood and imagination too.

Speaking at the XRP Meetup NYC in the run-up to Ripple’s Swell conference—and in remarks shared via a clip by Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba) on X—Traidman argued that the publicly listed “digital asset treasury companies” which ran hot earlier this year are now trading like the investment-trust boom-and-bust of the early 2000s. “In the last 60 days or so, we’ve seen several and many, actually, of the digital asset treasury companies collapse. A lot of the stocks have been down by 80%, 90%. This is reminiscent of what we saw in the early 2000s… Initially, they traded at much higher to their net asset value. And eventually, they collapsed completely. And those companies are not publicly traded anymore. To be totally honest, the same thing is happening with DAT companies right now.” DATs are collapsing, according to the former @Ripple board member. VIVOPOWER has been BUYING $XRP exposure at 84% OFF by purchasing shares in @Ripple. With the new Ripple $40B Valuation, the XRP discount is effectively 59% off. VivoPower Strategy explained here:… pic.twitter.com/ypSrGAgRsC — 🌸Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) November 12, 2025 The XRP Treasury Company 2.0 The response, he said, is a second-generation construct that acquires underlying exposure at a discount instead of paying token spot. “What we are doing at VivoPower, and what I think the future is, is this sort of second generation of DATs. I call it a DAT 2.0 strategy. Some folk call it an anti-DAT strategy, which is, instead of buying the net asset at spot price, you buy the net asset at a massive discount.” Related Reading: XRP To $10? Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark He used Bitcoin to illustrate how unusual an “80% off” entry actually is—mining might lower unit cost by 20–30%, but not by 80%. “How would you buy Bitcoin at an 80% discount today? You can’t… You might mine it… and then you might be able to get it at a 20%, 30% discount by mining it… But how the hell are you going to get it for 80% off?” The answer, in VivoPower’s case, is tied to Ripple. As Traidman put it, there is a unique linkage between a private company and the crypto asset that enables discount capture through corporate financing structures rather than on-exchange purchases. “There’s 25 million cryptocurrencies on coinmarketcap.com. There’s only one that is tied to a private company that is severely undervalued in terms of its share price, and that’s XRP, because of Ripple, right? And so that’s the opportunity that we are taking advantage of.” Related Reading: XRP Flashes Strongest Macro Bull Trend in Its History: Chartist This is the core ordering of operations in his remarks: first, acquire XRP exposure at a claimed “84% off” via mechanisms that revolve around Ripple’s equity and related look-through economics; second, put the resulting XRP to work on yield networks. Flare sits explicitly in the second step. “And then we work with our partners, like Flare, in order to generate yield on those XRP assets. And so that’s essentially buying XRP basically 84% off, and then investing it onto networks like Flare in order to generate a yield.” By emphasizing the sequencing—discounted acquisition tied to Ripple first, yield generation on Flare second—Traidman also addressed why this model does not rely on the market assigning a premium to the operating company. “So it’s like a DAT 1.0 plus the 2.0 strategy, right? And so the companies in this model don’t even need to trade at a premium to MNAV, like Saylor’s MicroStrategy does, because by default, they’re making money on day one. T plus one second, every dollar that gets put into our company gets a forex return, right? That’s only available when you can buy the net asset at a discount.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.44.

This news follows recent reports that Johor attracted about 164.45 billion ringgit as of the second quarter, equivalent to around $40 billion in data center investment. Analysts researched this growing interest in Johor. They discovered that the state has positioned itself as an investment hub, particularly with the establishment of a new special economic zone by Singapore. According to their estimates, Johor is expected to host approximately 60% of Malaysia’s data centers by 2030. This move shows promise of favorable development or future success for UEM, especially considering that its property development arm, UEM Sunrise Bhd., owns almost 4,600 acres in the area. Khazanah’s UEM intends to use its extensive land assets to back a data center based in Johor During an interview in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, November 11, Amran mentioned that Sunrise is making a strategy for the Gerbang Nusajaya Industrial Park, which will operate on renewable energy and cover 40 acres. Moreover, he highlighted that UEM Lestra Bhd., their green energy division, is preparing to initiate the construction of a 1-gigawatt hybrid solar plant, funded by investors such as the Macquarie Group and I Squared Capital Advisors. Notably, the initial stage of this plant will be a 500-megawatt facility priced at 2.5 billion ringgit, as stated by Lestra earlier this year. Meanwhile, UEM is exploring the potential investment in water treatment for industrial parks, which is crucial for cooling data centers. Amran stated, “This aligns with providing energy to industrial parks.” He added that there is a significant demand for water and power for industrial use, even without considering the needs of data centers. According to BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, Malaysia ranks one of Asia’s top three growth markets. The development of data centers in the region is expected to significantly increase power demand until 2028, as mentioned in an industry outlook report released this week. However, this rapid expansion stresses the country’s land and power resources, including the electrical grid. BMI noted that it has become increasingly important yet more challenging to meet this new demand for clean energy since renewable energy commitments are becoming a key focus for data center operators’ business plans. On the other hand, the Malaysian conglomerate, which has primarily been associated with property and road infrastructure projects, is now prioritizing green energy and sustainability initiatives for future growth. Last year, Lestra acquired a majority share in Nur Power, Malaysia’s only independent power utility company, for an undisclosed amount. They also pledged 1.5 billion ringgit to help reduce carbon emissions in industrial parks nationwide by 2026. Amran expresses his optimism about 2026 based on the current deals they have struck Currently, Lestra supplies biogas power to Kulim Hi-Tech Park, located in Kedah state, which is home to companies such as Infineon Technologies AG and AT&S that specialize in semiconductors and electronic components. The biogas facility has a capacity of 350 MW and is fully utilized. “We can upgrade the plant to have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity if we get approval from the regulators,” Amran mentioned. He also stated that the company is interested in selling biogas power to other industrial areas via Malaysia’s national grid. He believes the group will perform better on the profit side in 2025, thanks to increased contributions from Sunrise and other divisions. He also expressed optimism about 2026 based on the current deals they have lined up.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 423 points, or 0.9%, reaching a new intraday high as investors awaited a House vote on a bill to end the 40-day government closure. Stocks Surge as Confidence Returns Strong performances from banking giants such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and American Express fueled the rally. The S&P 500 inched up 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%, showing slight weakness in tech shares. Meanwhile, gold climbed to around $4,180 and silver rose above $53, boosted by safe-haven demand and expectations of resumed government data releases once the shutdown ends. Investors seemed to rotate back into equities and commodities with clearer ties to fiscal policy and credit conditions. Bitcoin Pulls Back Bitcoin dropped 3.4%, falling from an intraday high of $105,300 to a weekly low near $101,200. The decline came as investors shifted capital toward traditional assets, signaling a temporary cooling of crypto enthusiasm following a strong rally earlier in the week. The move reflects a broader recalibration in risk appetite. As the threat of a prolonged shutdown fades, market participants appear more comfortable positioning around traditional investments rather than digital assets. ETF Inflows Suggest Long-Term Optimism Despite short-term weakness, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains supported by institutional interest. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded $524 million in cumulative net inflows on Tuesday — the highest daily total since early October. The renewed ETF activity suggests that investors are gradually rebuilding exposure to Bitcoin after the volatility seen earlier this month. With the Federal Reserve expected to provide new policy guidance later this month, any hint of a dovish stance could reignite demand for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

A few users have even been trading with real contracts, and the company is still refining its systems in advance of a wider launch. Now, with that beta release, Polymarket makes a tentative return to the American market after years of being based overseas. The company had limited access from the United States as a result of an agreement with regulators in 2022. This development comes as Polymarket announced on Wednesday that data from its prediction market platform will be integrated into Yahoo Finance , expanding the reach of its product to potentially more people. According to the X announcement, Polymarket said that it had become Yahoo Finance’s “exclusive prediction market partner,” while sharing a 30-second video featuring the song “Timeless” by The Weekend and Playboi Carti. Polymarket secures compliance for U.S. relaunch Polymarket’s U.S. return comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the company settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), agreeing to pay a $1.4 million penalty after admitting that it had operated as an unregistered derivatives platform. This time, however, the company’s relaunch is built on compliance, as it is acquiring QCX, a CFTC-approved entity that operates as both a derivatives exchange and a clearinghouse. Polymarket can rest easy, as it runs a legal show in the U.S., while ensuring the development of a decentralized and transparent system. It has also introduced a new, simpler fee structure that it hopes will appeal to users and challenge entrenched competitors, such as Kalshi Inc. Later this month, Polymarket will launch with a small menu of markets, including sports and political results, among others. More are expected to be added. The gradual rollout, according to the team, helps it meet the regulatory requirements. The resurgence of Polymarket also coincides with a surge in interest in prediction markets in the U.S. These markets, where people place bets on real-world events ranging from elections to the outcomes of reality television series, have garnered attention for the crowdsourcing of forecasts they provide. Instead of taking bets — competing with traditional celebrity gossip sites for page views and advertising revenue — Polymarket functions more like a stock market. Users buy shares in an outcome they believe will prevail, and prices are based on the collective popular opinion. This arrangement is also more transparent and liquid — and, Coplan said, a more equitable deal for participants. Polymarket intensifies competition in prediction markets This re-entry by Polymarket increases the stakes for prediction platforms to address the challenge, aside from its main competitor, Kalshi Inc., which is already licensed in the U.S. and provides a market for event-based futures contracts. Meanwhile, for some of the largest companies in the gambling business, that same turf is now being seen as a new frontier: FanDuel last week announced that it would soon introduce its own product based on prediction markets. Polymarket has a major advantage, though. Founded five years ago, the company’s platform, built on blockchain technology, allows members to settle trades almost as soon as they are executed and to view every transaction. Combined with low overheads, such as reduced fees and a decentralized system, it presents itself as a technologically advanced and compliance-friendly choice. Insiders say Polymarket is on its way to a valuation of as high as $2 billion, following intense investor interest after it secured a commitment of up to $2 billion in venture capital from Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which owns the New York Stock Exchange. That round is, in some sense, a sign of increasing institutional interest in the future of event-based prediction markets.

The company reported that its earlier forecast fell short by almost $1 billion, and the new figure put it above expectations tracked by Wall Street, and this is after Cisco outperformed revenue and earnings targets in the second quarter too. The company said it now expects $4.14 per share in adjusted earnings for fiscal 2026, a number that stands higher than the $4.05 analysts projected. Demand for secure and fast networking is rising as businesses rush into AI upgrades across data centers, cloud systems, and enterprise networks. AI orders increase as Cisco builds partnerships and updates hardware Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, speaking to analysts during a conference call, said the company expects the AI pipeline to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2026. Chuck said customers are moving fast to unlock AI systems, and that networks must stay secure as workloads expand. The company also said late Wednesday that AI infrastructure orders reached $1.3 billion in the most recent period, compared with $800 million in the quarter before that. Executives said Cisco is redesigning chips and routing systems to handle heavier AI traffic, with upgrades meant to connect large racks of servers used for advanced training models and other compute‑heavy tasks. Cisco is competing against Broadcom and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which owns Juniper Networks, but the business is also working with Nvidia through a partnership that the company says gives it an advantage in building AI‑optimized network equipment. During the fiscal first quarter, which ended October 25, Cisco reported $14.9 billion in revenue, showing an 8% rise from the previous year. Profit landed at $1 per share, excluding certain items. Analysts tracking the numbers estimated revenue would hit $14.8 billion and earnings would reach 98 cents, results the company managed to beat. For the fiscal second quarter that runs through January, Cisco expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.2 billion, above the $14.7 billion prediction from analysts, with earnings of $1.02 per share, compared with an expected 99 cents. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Woo Jin Ho wrote that the company’s AI momentum has not slowed and said the higher forecast still looks cautious, adding that there could be room for limited upside if demand keeps rising. Cisco CFO Mark Patterson said demand for updated networking gear continues to build, noting that a multi‑year campus refresh cycle is starting to gain pace across large customers. Cisco expands through security, training, and AI‑powered development Cisco is broadening its product line through security and observability tools, and the largest step came in 2024 when it bought Splunk for $28 billion. Chuck has pointed to the deal as part of a plan to reduce exposure to hardware cycles while deepening the company’s software business. Inside the company, employees are being pushed to use AI tools rather than face layoffs. Chuck told CNBC earlier that he does not want to cut engineers and instead wants the current team to innovate faster and be more productive. The approach contrasts with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Accenture, which cut staff during the broader shift toward automation. Chief information officer Fletcher Previn, speaking about internal development, said 70% of the company’s 20,000 developers log into AI coding tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot at least once a month. Fletcher said AI‑generated code now accounts for nearly a quarter of all the code produced inside the company, up from 4% the year before. Global head of talent acquisition Scott McGuckin told Fortune that managers who use AI encourage teams to adopt the tools faster. Scott said: “While I haven’t placed any mandatory AI training on my immediate team, I highly expect them to be taking advantage of the AI tools and courses available in the company. Those who do, show me their creativity, productivity, and strategic thinking.” As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco shares were up 25% for the year, ahead of the Nasdaq’s 21% gain.

For 2025, that opportunity may be found in RentStac (RNS) , a DeFi token built around real-world property income and transparent blockchain mechanics. Here’s how simple math shows how a modest $1,000 investment can potentially grow to $50,000 as RentStac’s ecosystem expands. The Path From $1,000 to $50,000 At the current presale price of $0.025 per token, $1,000 buys 40,000 RNS. Early participants receive a 100 percent bonus, which doubles that to 80,000 tokens. If RNS later trades at just $0.50, a level several analysts consider achievable once the project reaches exchange listings and expands its property portfolio, those 80,000 tokens would be worth $40,000. At $0.60, the value climbs to $48,000. And if the token hits $1, that original $1,000 would equal $80,000 in value. The structure of the presale rewards early entry, making the first phases the most lucrative window for investors who recognize the project’s fundamentals early on. Why RentStac Can Support This Growth The key behind RentStac’s potential lies in its connection to real-world income. Unlike speculative tokens, RNS is tied to rental yield generated from legally verified properties. Each property is held through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), ensuring that the income streams are transparent and backed by real assets. The platform converts property earnings into stablecoin distributions, giving holders a steady source of yield while also supporting token demand. This hybrid model combines the predictable returns of traditional real estate with the scalability of decentralized finance. Dual-Yield Design and Deflationary Mechanics RentStac’s system allows investors to earn in two ways: passive rental income and staking rewards. Token holders can stake RNS to earn a share of platform revenue while also benefiting from property-linked yield paid in stablecoins. In addition, a portion of platform revenue is allocated to buy back and burn RNS from circulation. This creates a deflationary effect that supports token appreciation over time. The structure mirrors what made early DeFi leaders like Aave and Chainlink successful, measurable utility supported by real economics. Security and Transparency Security is central to the project’s credibility. RentStac’s code has already achieved a 92.48 percent score on Solidity Scan, with a full audit by CertiK currently underway. Each transaction related to property income is verified through multi-signature wallets and oracle data feeds, ensuring accuracy and compliance across the system. The governance model also allows community voting via DAO, letting token holders influence decisions on property additions, yields, and platform upgrades. Why Analysts Are Watching Closely As the DeFi market matures, investors are shifting toward projects with verified income streams rather than speculative hype. RentStac aligns with that trend perfectly. Its connection to the global rental market, a multi-trillion-dollar sector gives it scalability and resilience that pure digital assets cannot replicate. That’s why early participants see RNS not just as another crypto presale, but as one of the first tokens designed to generate steady value while offering exponential upside as adoption increases. The Bottom Line Turning $1,000 into $50,000 isn’t about luck, it’s about timing, structure, and fundamentals. RentStac offers a transparent, asset-backed approach that combines property income, staking, and deflationary economics in a single ecosystem. While no investment is risk-free, RentStac’s real-world connection gives it a long-term foundation that few new tokens can match. As the presale continues, early participants are positioning themselves for what could be one of DeFi’s most significant success stories of 2025.

With Q4 2025 drawing near, analysts are indicating a $0.035 DeFi crypto project. The traders are seeing the initial indications of increasing demand and some suspect that this structure behind the token might make it one of the strongest growth opportunities in the quarter. Its premise is starting to draw interest in all quarters of investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that is being developed to introduce clarity and efficiency to lending digital assets. The platform employs a Peer-to-Contract business model in which users place assets in a liquidity pool. Such deposits are turned into mtTokens tracking earned interests. APY is boosted when the demand for loans is high. As such, mtTokens automatically update with increased interest income in case a person provides the market with for example $1,000 of ETH and borrowing operations increase. There are also Peer-to-peer lending markets of assets that are more controlled under Mutuum Finance. Borrowers are subjected to variable interest rates which are influenced by availability of liquidity. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios provide the maximum and minimum amount of collateral that can be borrowed. Less riskier assets will have greater LTVs whereas more risky assets will have lower limits. A liquidation process is triggered in case a borrower is put in a situation that is unsafe. To create an overall solvency, liquidators have the ability to purchase discounted collateral to put the situation back on track. These mechanics devise a system constructed on anticipatory lending, equity borrowing and reliable liquidations. Numbers Behind the Presale At the beginning of 2025, the presale was initiated at $0.01. Those early prices developed an excellent foundation among early purchasers. On current days MUTM is set on Phase 6 at a price of $0.035, 250% up the initial stage. The presale figures are serious growth. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $18.6 million and found 17,900 tokenholders, and sold 796 million tokens. The percentage of Phase 6 allocated is more than 86% and the demand is rising day by day. The price of confirmation of launching at $0.06 supports anticipations of initial appreciation. Investors who got in at $0.01 are poised to see a growth of 500% at listing and even investors in Phase 6, having entered at 0.035, still have a significant uptake potential. Direct card purchases also introduced by Mutuum Finance and this enhanced accessibility and appeal to large buyers. The 24-hour leaderboard is another catalyst of action as it gives the best contributor of the day MUTM tokens. This makes the participation dynamic and visible, which provides energy to keep on. Foundations and Security Analyst Outlook According to analysts who follow the developments in early DeFi, the development of Mutuum Finance is among the largest factors that increase the popularity. The team made the designation on X that its V1 borrowing and lending protocol would debut on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. V1 incorporates: the Liquidity Pool, the mtTokens, the Debt Tokens and the Liquidator Bot, ETH and USDT were the first supported assets. The fact that actual development milestones are being seen in the pre-listing stage becomes a confidence build among long-term traders. Mutuum Finance, as well, underwent an audit of their token by CertiK that provides an additional layer of credibility to the smart-contracts of the protocol. Investors highly value security, and it applies to the DeFi crypto industry. Due to these fundamentals, analysts have made solid forecasts. There is some speculation of a 5x to 10x move in the initial expansion phase following the launch in case platform usage is higher. Others look to possible upside elsewhere, pointing to the fact that an early lending business in earlier cycles results in far greater growth once it has grown in critical mass and liquidity. Long-Term Vision Mutuum Finance is not halting at lending. The roadmap has USD-pegged stablecoin backed by treasury inflows that are raised by borrowing interest. Stablecoins lead to liquidity and make lending platforms consistent in activity. They give users a steady value and keep users looking forward to using them in times of open markets. Other significant steps are layer-2 expansion. Networks based on layer-2 enhance speed and the cost of transacting. In the case of a lending platform that has interest updates and liquidation procedures, this has to be enhanced. By making the transition to Layer-2 ecosystems, Mutuum Finance will be able to serve more assets and facilitate the transaction flow and increase user base. Why Analysts See 30x Potential All of this, coupled with impressive performances in presale and, most importantly, audited smart contracts, a form of utility, revenue-driven token utilization and a stablecoin with Layer-2 roadmap make Mutuum Finance look out of place in an oversaturated market. The observers of emerging DeFi protocols refer to the early lending vehicles in the last couple of cycles that brought about colossal growth when their pipeline network developed. Since MUTM is still at $0.035 in Phase 6 and nearing the final phases of presale, this could be one of the best crypto to buy to those looking to have long-term growth, according to many traders. As the quarter 4, 2025 nears, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the new crypto player with the type of platform that could sustain significant growth.

Recently, Adam Back, the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream , weighed in with a bold statement, claiming that BTC embodies the essence of permissionless bearer money. Bitcoin As Permissionless Bearer Money Back’s description of Bitcoin as permissionless bearer money positions it as the modern realization of the cypherpunk’s vision for bearer eCash . Essentially, this concept means that BTC, unlike traditional bank accounts or centralized digital currencies, is owned and controlled directly by the individual who holds the private keys . This means that no intermediary can freeze, reverse, or control the transaction, making it an entirely permissionless system where ownership is verifiable and transferable without reliance on banks or governments. Notably, Back’s statement resonates with the original cypherpunk vision and ideals of self-sovereignty and financial privacy. However, some members of the crypto community quickly raised challenges to this view. One critic highlighted the role of Back’s Blockstream in developing the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 (L2) protocol designed to facilitate faster Bitcoin transactions . While it improves efficiency, the crypto community member pointed out that the Lightning Network is permissioned and partially centralized, suggesting nodes can theoretically censor or modify transactions without immediate detection by other participants. He argues that Bitcoin may not remain truly permissionless if widely adopted L2s introduce central points of control. Notably, Back has not publicly responded to these concerns, leaving the debate open to future discussions. The Many Faces Of BTC As Money Over the years, Bitcoin has been described in many ways, reflecting its evolving role in the global financial landscape. In its early stages, it was seen as a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) electronic cash and a decentralized alternative to fiat currencies. As adoption grew, BTC gained recognition as a store of value , appealing to those who want to hedge against inflation and the collapse of fiat currencies. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and rapid growth rate led many to compare it to gold, giving rise to its long-standing title as “ digital gold .” Other perspectives view Bitcoin as a speculative asset , where short-term price volatility often overshadows its intended use as a medium of exchange. More recently, governments have begun looking to the leading cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset for diversifying national holdings from conventional currencies. Meanwhile, for cypherpunk enthusiasts like Back, Bitcoin remains a form of money that prioritizes personal sovereignty, censorship resistance, and privacy.

The market appears to be stabilizing after weeks of volatility, yet on-chain data signals that profit-taking remains active. According to top analyst Darkfost, since the exceptional liquidation event in early October, many investors have started to secure profits and scale back their exposure as the current cycle nears its end. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable uptick in Bitcoin inflows to Binance. The 30-day moving average of daily inflows has climbed sharply throughout October, showing that, on average, roughly 7,500 BTC are being transferred to Binance every day. This is the highest inflow rate since the March correction, indicating renewed selling pressure and cautious positioning among traders. While such inflows often reflect profit realization and short-term selling, Bitcoin’s ability to consolidate near the $100K level suggests resilient underlying demand. Buyers continue to absorb the supply entering the market, preventing a deeper breakdown — at least for now. As the cycle matures, this phase may prove critical in determining whether Bitcoin stabilizes for another leg up or faces a more prolonged correction. Short-Term Holders Add To Selling Pressure As Bitcoin Consolidates Darkfost explains that the recent surge in Bitcoin inflows to Binance and other exchanges reflects growing selling pressure across the market. Despite this, Bitcoin’s price continues to consolidate relatively cleanly around the symbolic $100,000 level — a sign that existing demand remains strong enough to absorb the increased supply. This balance between distribution and accumulation indicates that the market is undergoing a structural reset rather than a full-blown capitulation. Adding to this dynamic, short-term holders (STHs) have become a major contributor to the ongoing selling pressure. These participants are typically the most reactive segment of the market, responding quickly to volatility and sentiment shifts. With a realized price near $112,000, many STHs have been underwater for about a month, prompting them to send significant amounts of BTC to exchanges at a loss. Historically, this type of behavior has coincided with late-stage corrections — what analysts often call a “cleansing phase.” During such phases, speculative capital exits the market while long-term investors quietly absorb the supply, setting the foundation for renewed stability and potential future growth. If demand continues to offset this wave of short-term selling, Bitcoin could soon form a stronger base above $100,000 — paving the way for a gradual recovery as selling pressure fades and confidence returns.

On the weekly chart, BTC remains supported by the 50-week moving average (blue line), which is acting as a strong dynamic floor for price. Despite multiple retests over recent weeks, bulls have managed to defend this level, signaling that underlying demand remains intact even as profit-taking intensifies. The broader structure still points to a healthy long-term uptrend. The 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) moving averages continue sloping upward, confirming that Bitcoin’s macro bias remains bullish. However, the lack of strong volume during recent rebounds suggests that market participants are cautious, awaiting confirmation of renewed momentum before adding to positions.

Conversely, a weekly close below $100K would mark a significant technical breakdown, potentially opening the door to a deeper retrace toward $92K–$95K.

The Altcoin Season Index just made an exciting move, climbing 2 points to reach 28. This subtle shift could signal the beginning of something bigger for alternative cryptocurrencies. Let’s explore what this means for your investment strategy and why savvy crypto enthusiasts are paying close attention. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as our crypto market thermometer. CoinMarketCap calculates this crucial indicator by comparing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over 90 days. However, they exclude stablecoins and wrapped coins from this calculation. The result gives us a clear picture of market sentiment and potential investment opportunities. Think of the Altcoin Season Index as a scoreboard showing which team is winning: Bitcoin or the altcoins. When the index reads closer to 100, we’re in full altcoin season territory. Conversely, lower numbers indicate Bitcoin dominance. The recent jump to 28 suggests we might be seeing early signs of altcoin momentum building. Why Does This 2-Point Increase Matter? While 28 might seem modest, this 2-point gain represents meaningful movement in crypto markets. The Altcoin Season Index movement tells us that more altcoins are starting to outperform Bitcoin. This gradual shift often precedes more significant market changes that can impact your portfolio. Consider these key aspects of the current Altcoin Season Index reading: Threshold indicator: We need 75% of top coins beating Bitcoin to declare true altcoin season Early warning system: Small increases often signal changing investor sentiment Portfolio guidance: Helps determine whether to focus on Bitcoin or diversify into altcoins Market timing: Provides clues about when to adjust your investment strategy How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index? Smart investors don’t just watch the Altcoin Season Index—they use it. This tool becomes particularly valuable when you understand its practical applications. The current reading of 28 suggests we’re in a transitional phase where careful observation pays dividends. When the Altcoin Season Index trends upward, it often indicates growing confidence in alternative cryptocurrencies. However, remember that we’re still far from the 75% threshold that defines a true altcoin season. This means you have time to research potential opportunities before any major market moves. What’s Next for the Altcoin Season? The journey from 28 to potential altcoin season territory requires sustained momentum. Historical patterns show that once the Altcoin Season Index begins climbing, it can accelerate quickly. However, market conditions can change rapidly, so continuous monitoring remains essential. Keep these factors in mind as you watch the Altcoin Season Index evolve: Market cycles: Crypto markets move in predictable patterns Bitcoin influence: Bitcoin performance still drives overall market sentiment External factors: Regulatory news and global economics impact all cryptocurrencies Technical analysis: Combine the index with other indicators for best results Final Thoughts on the Rising Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index movement to 28 represents more than just numbers—it reflects shifting market dynamics that could shape your investment decisions. While we’re not in full altcoin season yet, the upward trend warrants attention and preparation. The most successful crypto investors use tools like the Altcoin Season Index to stay ahead of market curves and make informed decisions. Remember that cryptocurrency investing carries risks, and no single indicator guarantees success. However, understanding tools like the Altcoin Season Index helps you navigate these volatile markets with greater confidence and strategic insight. Frequently Asked Questions What is considered a true altcoin season? A true altcoin season occurs when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index would need to reach much higher levels than the current 28 reading. How often does CoinMarketCap update the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap updates the index regularly, typically showing daily changes. The recent 2-point increase happened within a 24-hour period, showing how quickly market conditions can shift. Should I invest in altcoins when the index rises? While a rising Altcoin Season Index suggests growing altcoin strength, it shouldn’t be your only investment criterion. Always conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for predicting market moves? The index provides valuable insights but works best when combined with other analysis tools. It indicates current market conditions rather than predicting future performance with certainty. What’s the difference between the current reading and previous altcoin seasons? During strong altcoin seasons, the index typically reads above 75. The current 28 reading suggests we’re in early stages rather than full altcoin season conditions. Can the Altcoin Season Index decrease after rising? Yes, the index can fluctuate based on market performance. Cryptocurrency markets are volatile, and the Altcoin Season Index reflects these changing conditions regularly. Found this analysis helpful?

The number of Solana daily active addresses has dropped to a concerning 12-month low, signaling a significant shift in user engagement. According to data from The Block, the seven-day moving average for this key indicator fell sharply from around 9 million at the beginning of the year to just 3.3 million. This decline highlights potential challenges for the blockchain’s ecosystem and could impact investor confidence. Why Are Solana Daily Active Addresses Decreasing? The gradual drop in Solana daily active addresses stems largely from the cooling memecoin trend that captivated users earlier this year. Memecoins drove massive transaction volumes and user interactions, but as interest wanes, network activity naturally slows. Therefore, understanding this trend helps investors gauge the health of the Solana network and make informed decisions. What Does This Mean for Solana’s Future? Lower Solana daily active addresses may raise questions about the network’s utility beyond speculative trading. However, it’s crucial to note that blockchain ecosystems often experience cycles. Key factors to consider include: Reduced speculative activity as memecoin mania fades Potential for renewed growth with upcoming projects Long-term adoption metrics beyond short-term spikes Moreover, this dip could present buying opportunities for believers in Solana’s technology. How Can Investors Respond to This Trend? Monitoring Solana daily active addresses provides valuable insights into network health. Investors should track this metric alongside other indicators like transaction volume and developer activity. By doing so, they can identify potential entry points or diversification strategies. Remember, market cycles are normal, and patience often rewards those who focus on fundamentals. Conclusion: Navigating the Dip in Solana Daily Active Addresses In summary, the decline in Solana daily active addresses to a 12-month low reflects broader market trends rather than inherent flaws in the blockchain. While it may cause short-term concern, it also underscores the importance of looking beyond surface metrics. Stay informed, analyze the data, and consider the long-term vision for Solana’s ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What are Solana daily active addresses? Solana daily active addresses refer to the number of unique addresses interacting with the Solana network each day, indicating user engagement. Why did Solana daily active addresses drop? The drop is primarily due to decreased interest in memecoins, which previously drove high transaction volumes on the network. Is this decline permanent? Not necessarily; network activity often fluctuates with market trends and new project launches, so it could rebound. How does this affect SOL’s price? Lower activity might pressure SOL’s price short-term, but long-term value depends on adoption and technological advancements. Should I be worried as a Solana investor? Monitor broader ecosystem developments rather than reacting to one metric; diversification and research are key. Where can I track Solana daily active addresses? Websites like The Block and blockchain explorers provide real-time data on network metrics. Found this analysis helpful?

The plan centers on the joint venture the two formed one year ago, called RV Tech, which brings together engineers and software teams from both sides. The project has moved far enough that the companies are now speaking openly about offering the electrical and software system to outside manufacturers instead of limiting it to their own models. At a briefing held Wednesday in Palo Alto, Rivian’s software chief and RV Tech co-chair Wassym Bensaid told reporters the work they are doing solves challenges common across the auto industry. Wassym said, “We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry. That could become an opportunity.” He noted that the platform is built to scale across different body types and sizes in Western markets. The team is building something they expect to run multiple kinds of vehicles and to reach buyers in several regions. RV Tech prepares system tests and outlines licensing plans Wassym explained that licensing the system is financially different from building and selling cars. He said the earnings that could come from licensing are “a very different ballgame” and come with “a very different margin profile from a business standpoint than making cars.” RV Tech plans to begin testing its platform in winter conditions during the first quarter of 2026. That phase will involve models from Audi, Volkswagen, and Scout, giving the joint venture real‑world data on how the system performs in harsh climates. Volkswagen has opened its technology to others before. Past deals saw Ford and Mahindra & Mahindra use the company’s first‑generation EV platform for their own electric models. But the new collaboration comes at a time when the German automaker is dealing with tariffs in the United States, weaker sales in China, and slowing momentum in Europe. As part of efforts to cut costs and rebuild demand, Oliver Blume, the company’s chief executive, approved as much as $5.8 billion to support the partnership with Rivian. For Rivian, which has been losing money, the investment provides funding at a time when many manufacturers are rethinking their EV strategies. The joint venture is using Rivian’s centralized electronics layout. The structure uses fewer computing units, which helps Volkswagen lower development costs. The project is not limited to electric models. RV Tech co-chair Carsten Helbing said the underlying structure can support combustion engine vehicles as well. That gives the companies more potential buyers if they choose to license the system widely. First models using the new platform line up for release The first vehicle to use the platform will be Rivian’s R2 sport utility vehicle, which is expected early next year. Volkswagen will follow with its compact EV called ID. EVERY1, targeting a price of about €20,000 or roughly $23,000, with release planned in 2027. After that, larger and more rugged vehicles from the Scout brand will enter production using the same system. Volkswagen is also working with Xpeng for the Chinese market, where that partnership focuses on a separate platform for buyers in that region. The push for outside help follows earlier problems the German automaker faced in trying to build software internally. Volkswagen’s own systems delayed the launch of ID models and caused issues that harmed sales once the cars reached the market. Updates over the past year improved software performance, which helped raise EV sales figures in Europe. Oliver wants to succeed where his predecessor Herbert Diess struggled. Herbert became the leader of the Volkswagen brand shortly before the diesel emissions scandal. At that time he said electric cars would become the company’s “strategic core.” He launched internal software teams and expanded work on autonomous driving. During a 2021 “Power Day” event, Herbert laid out plans for six battery factories across Europe, dozens of new EV models, and a target of selling up to three million electric vehicles by this year. That period briefly turned Volkswagen into Germany’s most valuable company on the stock market.

This massive $14.3 million investment signals strong belief in the future of decentralized finance and the UNI token’s potential. But what does this mean for the broader cryptocurrency market? Why This UNI Accumulation Matters The recent UNI accumulation by the Monetalis-associated address represents a significant vote of confidence in the token’s future. Investment firms don’t casually move $14 million without thorough research and strong conviction. This substantial UNI accumulation suggests institutional players see real value in the decentralized exchange ecosystem. Over just eight hours, the address acquired 1.851 million UNI tokens through over-the-counter deals. This approach avoids market slippage and demonstrates sophisticated execution strategy. The UNI accumulation occurred at an average price of $7.7 per token, indicating careful timing and price consideration. How Did This UNI Accumulation Unfold? The massive UNI accumulation involved coordinated efforts with major market makers including: Wintermute – Known for their liquidity provision expertise Flow Traders – Specialists in digital asset trading B2C2 – Pioneers in cryptocurrency market making This strategic UNI accumulation through established market makers ensured minimal market impact. The careful execution prevented price volatility that typically accompanies large purchases. This UNI accumulation demonstrates how institutional players can efficiently build positions without disrupting the market. What Does This Mean for UNI Investors? The substantial UNI accumulation by a reputable investment firm sends powerful signals to retail and institutional investors alike. When professional money managers make moves of this scale, it’s worth paying attention. This UNI accumulation could indicate several positive developments: First, it suggests confidence in UNI’s underlying value proposition. Second, the timing of this UNI accumulation might coincide with upcoming protocol developments or market conditions that professional analysts have identified. Finally, this level of institutional participation often precedes broader market recognition.

The company is entering the space as crypto ATMs are gaining a fresh look in markets worldwide. Bitcoin Depot secures Hong Kong licensing For its trading business to be legal in Hong Kong, Bitcoin Depot requires a license from the Customs and Excise Department as a regulated money services operator (MSO). The license enables the company to comply with local financial regulations — particularly those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. According to a company’s representative speaking with reporters, Bitcoin Depot’s compliance team “established close partnerships on the ground in Hong Kong to fulfill all requirements, including licensing; AML/KYC regulations.” According to Coin ATM Radar, there are 223 Bitcoin ATMs currently operational in Hong Kong. Bitcoin Depot’s arrival means another player is entering a market that has become more sophisticated and crowded. The Hong Kong government is actively establishing a regulatory environment that encourages innovation and protects investors. The city’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) pioneered the licensing of crypto exchanges, and banks were advised to open accounts for licensed digital asset businesses — in contrast to mainland China, where trading in cryptocurrencies is broadly outlawed. In the United States, there were almost 11,000 complaints about crypto kiosks in 2024, which resulted in $246 million of claimed losses, according to the F.B.I. Several other cities around the country have already limited or banned the machines outright. Australia, which now has more than 2,000 of the machines, up from just 21 last year, is among those where lawmakers are considering further clamping down on them. In November, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke stated that the government is seeking to increase visibility over cryptocurrency transactions and assist regulators, such as AUSTRAC, in closing ATMs if required. Bitcoin Depot, with over 7,000 Bitcoin ATMs in 47 U.S. states, has stated that compliance with regulations remains a key part of its business strategy. On Wednesday, Bitcoin Depot announced that its expansion into Hong Kong is part of a strategy to target markets with high demand for quick and easy cash-to-crypto conversion. The company said it aims to become one of the top five Bitcoin ATM operators in the city. Hong Kong becomes launchpad for crypto expansion Analysts say the manoeuvre has potentially significant implications, opening the door to broader expansion in the region if it is successful. Hong Kong’s “clear regulatory regime and robust fintech environment” make it a perfect launchpad for Western crypto infrastructure firms, said Ray Ng, a fintech analyst in Singapore. Bitcoin Depot’s timing, however, matches a surge of institutional investor interest in Hong Kong’s digital asset landscape. The timing of Bitcoin Depot’s growth appears strategic. With Bitcoin prices having only recently stabilized following a prolonged bear market, institutional adoption has been on the rise. With global crypto trading volumes on the rise again, Bitcoin Depot’s Cash-to-Crypto machines may provide an entry point for individuals who want to interact with exchanges physically, particularly in areas where staking trust in digital exchanges remains a challenge.

The probe, which stems from complaints by European news publishers, alleges that Google unfairly demotes outlets that include “third-party” promotional content, such as sponsored articles or paid editorial pieces, something publishers argue is essential to their revenue models. The EU brings charges Critics, including news industry groups, claim this Google practice gives an advantage to publishers without such content and stifles competition in the digital advertising space. The EU’s probe alleges that the American tech giant is violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA) legislation, which was implemented to prevent large “digital gatekeepers” from unfairly disadvantaging other businesses operating on their platforms. If found that it violated the DMA, Google could face fines of up to 10% of its global turnover —potentially billions of euros—along with orders to change its algorithms or business practices. The company appears to be attracting charges by the day. It is already under multiple DMA investigations in the EU, including probes into whether its search engine favors its own services over competitors and whether it obstructs developers from directing consumers to offers outside its app store. This new investigation comes just two months after the European Commission fined Google €2.95 billion for its search advertising practices, a penalty that pushed U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten additional tariffs against Europe. The company has previously defended its ranking systems as neutral and based on user relevance. Meanwhile, the news has created a buzz among some who have welcomed the move as a step toward leveling the playing field against Big Tech dominance. Google fights allegations of using Gemini AI to spy on users Google has to fight off the antitrust allegations just as it was accused in a lawsui t of using its Gemini AI assistant to unlawfully spy on the private communications of users of Gmail’s instant messaging and videoconference programs. In the past, users of Gmail, Chat and Meet had the option to turn on Google’s artificial intelligence program. However, in October, the Alphabet Inc. unit “secretly” turned on Gemini for all those applications, which meant it could harvest private data “without the users’ knowledge or consent,” according to the complaint filed late Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California. It is not that the company prevents users from turning off Gemini, but they need to look into Google’s privacy settings to find the deactivation key for the AI tool, according to the proposed class-action suit. If they don’t do that, Google uses Gemini to “access and exploit the entire recorded history of its users’ private communications, including literally every email and attachment sent and received in their Gmail accounts,” the complaint claims. The suit has alleged that Google is violating the California Invasion of Privacy Act, a 1967 law put in place to prohibit surreptitious wiretapping and recording of confidential communications without the consent of all parties involved.

This marks Canary’s first foray into launching a fund to track the price of a memecoin. The investment firm formally submitted S1 registration with the US SEC on Wednesday, seeking approval for the ETF. NEW: @CanaryFunds files for a MOG ETF. pic.twitter.com/IUBkL4mF3E — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 12, 2025 The filing described MOG as a “memecoin,” adding that the ETF may hold up to 5% of its holdings in Ether for transaction costs, since MOG is dependent on the Ethereum network. As the U.S. government shutdown seems to be ending , the SEC is expected to re-engage on digital asset ETFs. Particularly, a handful of XRP-linked ETFs are set to hit the trading floor , said ETF expert Nate Geraci. In September, the regulator cleared the clouds to dozens of new spot ETFs tied to cryptos, including Solana and Dogecoin. Canary has filed for several different types of crypto ETFs, including two that launched last month, tracking Litecoin and HBAR . The company is set to list another ETF tracking the price of XRP this week. A Memecoin Fueled by Social Media Buzz: Community Reacts Canary Capital’s new MOG ETF, coming at the brink of the SEC opening the door for crypto ETFs, has attracted widespread community attention on the memecoin. Launching an ETF for a coin powered by community vibes—not real utility— underscores how memecoins are inching closer to the world of regulated finance. One crypto investor wrote on X that not even Pepe has an ETF. “MOG is at a position close to 200 of the crypto market cap. I don’t think people understand.” It is noteworthy that MOG Coin isn’t listed on Binance yet, but is listed on the spot market on Coinbase. The Canary MOG ETF filing also mentions that the memecoin is “driven primarily by online popularity, cultural relevance and social sentiment, rather than by underlying technological utility.” ETF Filing Catalyst MOG Coin to Spike 8.44% The 339 th -ranked crypto with a market capitalization of approximately $170 million, saw an 8.44% surge in price over the last 24 hours.

For the experiment to be carried out successfully, sources close to the matter said that the proof-of-concept will be conducted in collaboration with Worldpay, Mastercard, Fireblocks, and Avalanche. Most importantly, this initiative will use the Avalanche blockchain to explore how to automate refunds via smart contracts and make settlements using stablecoins. While the process is ongoing, customer details or real money will not be required because the intended purpose of this PoC is to check whether the technology adopted functions properly and can be used effectively, according to the press release. Meanwhile, South Korea recently announced that it is close to finalizing its long-awaited stablecoin legislation , as the central bank and financial regulator jostle over who should regulate digital tokens pegged to the won. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) plans to submit a government-sponsored bill by the end of 2025. It will join five other competing stablecoin bills under review in the National Assembly, which individual lawmakers have submitted. NH NongHyup aims to lead in the digital transformation of Korea’s tourism economy In a statement, Choi Woon-jae, the executive vice president of NH NongHyup Bank, stated that the refund model based on stablecoins demonstrates how blockchain technology can actually enhance national competitiveness and boost customer experience. Therefore, with this ability in mind, Choi outlined their goal: to secure the top ranking in the digital transformation of Korea’s tourism economy by implementing strategies like enhancing cross-border payment and settlement efficiency. The PoC , on the other hand, focuses on attracting the booming tourist volume visiting South Korea by streamlining the VAT refund process. Sources pointed out that this process is essential as it enables foreign tourists to reclaim the VAT , usually 10%, they paid on eligible items when they decide to take them out of the country. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that in 2024, South Korea welcomed approximately 16.37 million tourists into the country. This figure represented a significant increase of about 48.4% compared to the previous year. Concerning NH NongHyup’s intention to modernize the traditional paper-based tax refund system, the bank stated that this initiative will be delivered in two main ways. To begin with, the PoC will thoroughly investigate a digital system based on blockchain technology that automates the tracking of refund data. This method will make it easier and more efficient for both businesses and tourists. For the Second method, NongHyup highlighted that the process will include a test on a method using stablecoins to allow users to effectively exchange currency and make their payments. Being a key player in the financial sector, with a broadened customer base and significant assets, NH NongHyup made public its intentions to improve its refund services and stablecoin payment while strictly adhering to new regulatory guidelines from financial authorities. South Korea’s financial regulators focus on the development of new laws for won-pegged stablecoins Sources knowledgeable about NH NongHyup’s proof-of-concept mentioned that South Korea is developing regulations to promote a stablecoin market linked to the Korean won. The move is intended to increase its control over money matters, especially in the face of strong competition from US dollar stablecoins. While financial regulators and local lawmakers cooperate toward these regulations being put in place for the won-pegged stablecoins, major banks and institutions are also preparing to launch their own stablecoin projects by cooperating with others and obtaining ticker symbols. However, individuals who received this plan had mixed reactions. The Bank of Korea argued that it is wise for banks to be granted the opportunity to issue stablecoins, while private companies stated that non-bank organizations should be given the chance to establish stablecoins to achieve healthy competition and promote innovation in the market.

Though the company grew revenue year over year, account growth seems slow for a company priced at 5x forward sales. With Fold's basic mNAV already falling under 1.0, there is a growing incentive for the company to sell BTC to raise needed capital. Despite the issues, FLD remains on my watch list as a rare US company pursuing a legitimate Bitcoin-based business model. When I last wrote about Fold Holdings ( FLD ) for Seeking Alpha, I initiated stock coverage with a 'hold' and cited a lack of interest in the rewards business as my primary reason for not buying FLD stock. Furthermore, I went into detail about the company's purported Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings and found the company's major BTC acquisition to be more 'PR' than substance given that Fold's convert holders were actually in control of a large amount of the BTC that Fold claimed to own. In the time since that article, shares of FLD have fallen by over 50% in a little under 8 months. Given the massive drawdown and the recently reported Q3 earnings, it's time for an updated look at Fold's Bitcoin-based business. Q3-25 Earnings For the quarter ended September 2025, Fold Holdings reported $7.4 million in top-line revenue. While this was down sequentially from $8.2 million in Q2, in Q3 revenue did grow by over 41% year-over-year. Financials Q3-24 Q2-25 Q3-25 YoY QoQ Revenue Net $5.2m $8.2m $7.4m 41.2% -9.5% Total operating expenses $9.4m $14.5m $13.3m 41.7% -8.0% Operating loss -$4.2m -$6.3m -$5.9m 42.5% -6.1% Source: Fold Holdings, 10-Qs Despite a 9.5% sequential decline in top-line revenue, the company was able to reduce expenses by 8% from Q2. This helped Fold reduce its operating loss from $6.3 million in Q2 to $5.9 million last quarter. Still, the company's Q3 loss widened year-over-year. Digging into the specific expense items, compensation and benefits jumps off the page with a 408% year-over-year increase from $734k in Q3-24 to over $3.7 million in Q3-25. I find this level of compensation to be rather large given the company's $7.4 million in revenue during the quarter. Shifting to some of the company's key user metrics, there are both good and bad signs, in my estimation: Quarter Total Accts Verified Accts % Verified QoQ Accts QoQ Verified Q3-24 580 68 11.72% Q4-24 591 71 12.01% 1.90% 4.41% Q1-25 609 76 12.48% 3.05% 7.04% Q2-25 619 80 12.92% 1.64% 5.26% Q3-25 625 82 13.12% 0.97% 2.50% Source: Fold Holdings, Analyst's calculations, accts in 000s First the good; Fold appears to be doing a good job converting some of its non-verified accounts to verified following KYC completion. Last year, 11.7% of Fold's accounts were verified. As of the end of September, over 13% of the company's customers have gone through KYC. This should allow the company to better monetize its customer base. That said, sequential growth of total accounts slowed to just 1% in the quarter. For a growth-stage company, this seems a bit underwhelming to me. Through the first three quarters this year, Fold is burning about $7.3 million per quarter on average. I view this as problematic given the company's liquidity position. Balance Sheet, mNAV, and Valuation On paper, Fold's liquidity position is actually pretty good. While the company only has $6.7 million in cash and equivalents, Fold's Bitcoin stash was worth $170.4 million at the end of the quarter. With total liabilities of just $96.3 million, FLD shareholders have $94.7 million in stockholder equity: Balance Sheet Q3-25 Cash/equivalents $6,663,463 Digital Assets (Treasury) $170,392,495 Total Assets $190,966,112 Total Liabilities $96,276,871 Stockholder's Equity $94,689,241 Source: Fold Holdings, 10-Q Given the 48 million shares outstanding at the end of September, Fold's book value per share comes in at a little under $2 per share at the end of Q3. Of course, this valuation is largely dependent on the company's Bitcoin holdings rather than cash or other tangible assets. Thus, even though the company is working toward a Bitcoin-based business that should be less sensitive to the day to day moves of the token price, the market value of Fold's BTC holdings has the most significance to the share price today. In the company's investor deck , it noted 48.3 million shares outstanding and 1,526 BTC as of November 7th. At intraday market prices on November 12th, FLD shares are trading at a basic mNAV discount of 4%: Units Unit Price Total Value Bitcoin Held 1,526 BTC $101,500 $154,889,000 Shares Outstanding 48,307,642 $3.08 $148,787,537 Basic mNAV 0.96 Source: Fold Holdings, market data from November 12th at 1p eastern Fold is certainly no stranger to shares trading at a discount to basic mNAV as it has happened three different times this year already. But a sustained move lower for FLD shares relative to the performance of BTC would open up the company to what I believe would be a significant capital allocation pickle. As recently as September, FLD shares traded at a basic mNAV rate closer to 0.8. The problem is since Fold is still a cash-burning company, the longer FLD shares trade at a basic mNAV discount, the more difficult it is to argue Fold should be selling shares to fund operations rather than selling BTC at the market rate since it is an unproductive, liquid asset that could be utilized to grow the business. And keep in mind, 800 of Fold's BTC is restricted from usage because it is pledged as convertible note collateral. The fully diluted shares outstanding number is slightly above 73 million shares. When we look at the book value of FLD shares on a fully diluted, real-time BTC value adjustment, the equity is worth about $1.08 per share. Risks In my opinion, FLD shares could conceivably go much lower than current levels even though they're already trading at a basic mNAV discount. The question is whether or not the company will sell BTC to raise funding with its share price trading below basic mNAV. Fold does not believe that it will need to sell Bitcoin to fund operations over the next 12 months, though it does acknowledge in the 10-Q that it may have to: Our Investment Treasury is considered a long-term investment and we do not believe we will need to sell or engage in other transactions with respect to any of our Investment Treasury within the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements, although we may from time to time sell or engage in other transactions with respect to our Investment Treasury as part of treasury management operations. This is, of course, purely speculation on my part; but I believe Fold's price will continue lower from here. I think the 'DAT' hype in the market is largely over. And even though it probably isn't proper to look at FLD solely through the DAT lens alone, the company still loses money, trades almost 5x forward sales, and operates a business that seemingly could be easily replicated by major Fintech competitors. Closing Summary Having said all this, as one of the few companies in the US equity markets that appears to be attempting something resembling a Bitcoin-based business, my view is that Fold remains a solid watchlist candidate. I certainly didn't like FLD at $7 per share; I don't know that I like it all that much at $3 per share either. Closer to book value, I'm much more inclined to take a shot on Fold. For me, the problem is evident: the company loses a lot of money each quarter relative to the revenue that it generates, and user growth seems far from robust. Given Fold's quarterly burn rate, the company likely has to raise capital next quarter just to keep going. Given the mNAV discount, the market seems to be telling the company to sell Bitcoin to raise capital.

A UAE government transfer using a digital dirham took place this week, and officials say the payment settled in less than two minutes. This marks the first recorded transaction in the nation’s pilot program. UAE Gov’t Transaction Marks Test According to government and industry reports, the transfer was carried out by the Central Bank of the UAE alongside the Ministry of Finance and the Dubai Department of Finance. The payment used the mBridge platform, a system designed to link multiple central bank digital currencies. The move was limited to federal and Dubai entities, not to banks or the general public. Reports have disclosed that the transaction was handled end-to-end in under two minutes, a speed that officials highlighted as proof of technical readiness.

The UAE’s choice signals an intent to test interoperability, not just a domestic ledger. Some experts say this model could make it easier for central banks to settle with each other without routing everything through correspondent banks. A small test does not mean mass rollout. But the system was tested in a live setting, which moves it past lab trials and into operational territory, according to reports. What The Pilot Covered The pilot right now is narrow. It focused on payment flow between government accounts and on how settlements are recorded. Transaction monitoring, privacy safeguards, and operational controls were part of the checks. Based on reports , authorities also monitored speed, finality, and system stability. No retail wallets or merchants were involved in this stage. The pilot was described as one step in a staged plan that will expand if the tests meet the central bank’s benchmarks. What Comes Next For The Digital Dirham According to public statements and media coverage, the Central Bank has indicated a phased approach toward broader use, with some earlier timelines pointing to a possible wider launch in Q4 2025. If the authorities move forward, future phases could involve private banks, merchant acceptance, and consumer wallets. But regulators will need to resolve questions about privacy, cybersecurity, and how a CBDC will sit alongside existing bank deposits. Decisions on these issues are likely to shape how quickly the program moves beyond government transfers.

Related Reading: XRP’s Next ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Could Hit Within 6 Weeks—Analyst The move marks Uniswap’s biggest reform since its 2020 token launch, designed to transform UNI from a passive governance token into a deflationary, yield-generating asset. Under the proposal, 0.3% of all trading volume will now be split between liquidity providers (0.25%) and a UNI buyback pool (0.05%), creating continuous demand for the token. With over $1 trillion in annualized trading volume, analysts project roughly $38 million in monthly buybacks, about $450 million annually. Whales Accumulate as Uniswap (UNI) Skyrockets 63% The market reaction was explosive. Uniswap (UNI) surged by over 63% in one week, peaking at $10 before stabilizing around $8.57. On-chain data from Santiment shows rising whale accumulation and a steady increase in UNI held outside of exchanges, indicating long-term investor confidence. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes reportedly purchased $244,000 worth of UNI, joining institutional buyers positioning for a supply shock. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju predicted that if protocol fees remain active, annual burns could exceed $500 million, drastically tightening supply. “Even with unlocks, a UNI supply shock seems inevitable,” Ju noted. The rally also extended to other DeFi assets, such as AAVE, Synthetix, and Compound, as traders speculated that Uniswap’s model could set a new standard for protocol-owned liquidity and value distribution.

The proposal eliminates interface fees, introduces fee discount auctions to enhance LP returns, and compensates governance delegates, turning Uniswap’s decision-making into a professionalized, revenue-sharing system. Adams emphasized that the initiative represents more than a technical upgrade, it’s a cultural shift. “Uniswap can be the primary place tokens are traded globally,” he said. “This proposal ends a restrictive chapter and begins the decade of Uniswap.” Related Reading: Ethereum Ready To Explode To $12,000 By January, Says Tom Lee With UNI up more than 66% this week and investors anticipating formal governance approval, the DeFi giant appears poised to reclaim its dominance as crypto’s flagship decentralized exchange.

That’s exactly what happened in the recent Balancer hack recovery, where white hat hackers miraculously returned over $20 million to the DeFi community. This stunning development reveals the power of ethical hacking in the cryptocurrency space. What Really Happened in the Balancer Hack? Haseeb Qureshi, a managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, recently dropped a bombshell revelation on social media platform X. He announced that white hat ethical hackers successfully recovered more than $20 million from the devastating Balancer hack . Surprisingly, this remarkable recovery story hasn’t received the widespread attention it deserves. The original Balancer hack caused massive losses exceeding $100 million, making it one of DeFi’s most significant security breaches. However, the white hat intervention dramatically reduced the final damage. These ethical hackers essentially became the unsung heroes of the cryptocurrency world. Why Don’t More People Know About This Recovery? Qureshi specifically noted that this recovery fact remains largely unknown to the general public. This information gap highlights several important aspects of cryptocurrency security: White hat operations often work discreetly Major exchanges and platforms coordinate behind the scenes Quick action prevents further fund movement The community benefits from silent protection The quiet nature of these recoveries actually serves a purpose. Security experts prefer working without attracting unnecessary attention that could alert malicious actors. How Do White Hat Hackers Make a Difference? White hat hackers represent the guardians of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They use their technical skills for good, constantly working to protect user funds and maintain system integrity. In the case of the Balancer hack , their intervention demonstrated several key benefits: Immediate damage control – Preventing further losses Fund recovery – Returning stolen assets to rightful owners Security improvements – Identifying vulnerabilities for future protection Community trust – Reinforcing DeFi’s resilience These ethical professionals often coordinate with projects like Balancer to strengthen security measures after incidents occur. What Does This Mean for Future DeFi Security? The successful recovery from the Balancer hack sets an important precedent for decentralized finance. It proves that even major breaches can have positive outcomes when the right people get involved. This incident provides valuable lessons for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Moreover, it demonstrates that the DeFi community possesses self-correcting mechanisms. When white hats step in, they not only recover funds but also help build stronger systems for everyone. The Balancer hack recovery serves as a powerful reminder that good often triumphs in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions What is a white hat hacker? White hat hackers are ethical security experts who use their skills to protect systems and recover stolen funds rather than cause harm. How much was originally stolen in the Balancer hack? The initial Balancer hack resulted in losses exceeding $100 million before the white hat recovery intervention. Why wasn’t this recovery widely publicized? Security operations often remain discreet to prevent alerting malicious actors and to maintain operational effectiveness. Can all stolen cryptocurrency be recovered? Not always, but white hat hackers can often recover significant amounts if they act quickly and have the right technical capabilities. What happens to recovered funds? Recovered funds are typically returned to the affected protocol or users through coordinated processes with the project team. How can I protect my DeFi investments? Use reputable platforms, enable all available security features, and stay informed about potential vulnerabilities in the protocols you use. This incredible story of recovery deserves to be shared!

BITO's 62% distribution rate does not equate to an actual yield but represents a gains crystallization tool. BITO is most attractive post a downturn, helping investors crystalize gains and mitigate psychological challenges of market timing. Despite a $2.6B AUM and 0.95% expense ratio, BITO is best used to harvest gains in up markets, not as downside protection. Thesis The advent of covered call and single-name ETFs has seen an explosion in investors interested in yield products. However, the reality is not as simple as looking at the current distribution for an ETF. With bitcoin stuck in a $100,000 - $120,000 range since May 2025, many investors are actively considering the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) due to its high distribution rate of 62%. In today's article we are going to revisit BITO, a fund we first covered last year, and articulate why this ETF will not compensate an investor for the drawdowns that occur during a crypto winter. In our original article on the name, we highlighted the fund's structure and outlined why, at the time, BITO was the only alternative for investors looking to use options. Fund structure - using futures The ETF uses futures to gain exposure to bitcoin: Holdings (Fund Website) Unlike names that own spot bitcoin via crypto wallets, BITO contains futures. This structure eliminates any risks associated with crypto wallets, hacking, and counterparty risk. Performance - not the only game in town Firstly, let us look at how the ETF has done in the past year versus a cohort of peers: Data by YCharts In the past year we have seen the origination of a number of funds that employ options to extract dividends from the bitcoin asset class. Among those names we can find the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF ( BCCC ), the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ), and the Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF ( BAGY ). The entire cohort has very similar total returns, with the only outlier being BCCC, which has outperformed as of late. The correlation is very high among the entire population here. Secondly, let us compare BITO with an outright bitcoin position: Data by YCharts We are using here the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the largest exchange-traded fund for outright bitcoin exposure. We can see the correlation is very tight, but as expected, IBIT outperforms (or, better said, BITO lags). As we detailed in our prior article, BITO will always lag an outright bitcoin exposure due to its construction using futures and the dividend extraction feature. Kindly note we are using a total return graph here in order to account for distributions. A high distribution does not equate to an actual yield If we go back in time, we will realize that the concept of yield used to equate the distribution, and originated with traditional fixed-income ETF. A traditional fixed income ETF for high yield, for example, would simply pass on to investors the cash flows realized in its holdings. The yield for the ETF would therefore equate the distribution for the name. Everything changed when options started being used, because options can expire worthless or they can get triggered; thus, the ultimate payout fluctuates. Moreover, implied volatility is a large input in options pricing; thus, as volatility moves around, premiums move, thus the distributions change. As per the Seeking Alpha landing page, BITO currently has a 62% distribution rate. Does that equate to an actual yield? No. As one can see from the above graphs, the fund only produced a 10.8% total return in the past year, meaning that its price moved lower, compensated by a high distribution. When thinking about BITO, please ignore the distribution completely. It does not mean much. BITO will ultimately follow bitcoin prices on a total return basis. What the fund does do, however, is constantly harvest gains. In an up-market, this comes in very handy, as we shall see shortly. Let us paint that picture visually for you - from January 2025 to April 2025, bitcoin was down roughly -20%: Data by YCharts In the above graph, the blue line is bitcoin outright. Please note BITO had virtually the same downside on a total return basis (the orange line), although the fund was paying a very high distribution. BITO is not designed to outperform spot bitcoin during a downturn; it simply extracts dividends from the product. During the next downturn, one will get the exact same type of graph. Do not bank on the current 62% distribution to bail you out because it is not real. Kindly note how the ETF's price is down -29% this year, although the total return is positive. The fund has an ever-decreasing price that is compensated by the high distribution. When would BITO be attractive, then? We have now established that in a downturn, BITO's dividend will not save an investor from losses. Then when is BITO attractive? Well, it depends on the investor, but for us, BITO is a good tool to use when the underlying risk factor (i.e., bitcoin) is trying to find a bottom. We are not good at market timing, and sometimes we see investors cut risk only to miss out on significant gains. Via its structure that constantly harvests gains, BITO mitigates those psychological aspects. Let us look at an example: Data by YCharts After the massive 2022 downturn in crypto, let us say an investor would have been interested in going long on Bitcoin. If said investor would have used BITO as an instrument, we can see the payout profile in the graph above. After one and a half years, the investor would have fully amortized the cost basis - in the above graph, the orange line is the total return, while the teal line is the price return. The price return in June 2024 is 'only' 150%, while the total return is close to 300%. The same investor still holding BITO would be up +54% since 2023 on a price basis, but from a net total return, they would have had a 4x return. This simply means they should not really care what happens next because the BITO structure forced them to crystallize gains already via the dividend. A theoretical investor in bitcoin outright (via a crypto wallet) can see a complete wipeout of said gains if, theoretically, bitcoin moves to $20,000 tomorrow. Not the BITO investor: $100 invested in January 2023 would now be worth $154 in the brokerage account, while $356 would sit as realized dividends in cash (410% total return minus the 54% price gain). BITO is a great tool to crystallize gains in an up market, tool that takes away many of the psychological negative aspects that come with trading for retail investors. Conclusion BITO is an ETF that is long on bitcoin futures. The fund is one of the largest bitcoin ETFs in the market, with a $2.6 billion AUM and a 0.95% expense ratio. Despite its stated 62% distribution rate, the name has the exact same downside as outright bitcoin in a downturn. Investors should not confuse distribution rates with yields and understand that the next crypto winter will see BITO have the exact same downside profile as outright bitcoin. BITO is a great tool to use after a downturn when an investor is unsure about market timing for a bottom. Via its distributions, the fund 'amortizes' an investment fairly quickly by constantly crystalizing gains, thus removing the psychological pressures around exiting a bitcoin long.",BCCC|YBTC|BAGY|IBIT|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-13 02:14:00

As of today, the global crypto market cap is about $3.6 trillion, with Bitcoin dominance near 58% and BTC trading above $106,000 while ETH hovers around the mid-$3,500s. The majors are acting like macro assets, but volatility keeps rotating into altcoins as traders chase narrative, liquidity and early entries. That’s where this trio comes in. Apeing ($APEING) is building a degen-forward brand with a structured whitelist and audit-first plan. XRP ($XRP) is in the headlines for a $4 billion Wall Street acquisition spree and a fresh $500 million raise at a $40B valuation, pushing deeper into brokerage, treasury and institutional rails. And Hedera ($HBAR) just landed inside Google Cloud’s BigQuery public datasets, sparking a double-digit price jump and bullish chart talk. For readers tracking new crypto coins and big-cap catalysts side by side, this combo hits every part of the risk spectrum. Apeing ($APEING): Degen Branding, Grown-Up Structure Apeing opens with the tagline: “We’re Degens, We’re Not Thinking, We’re APEING.” But the actual site is far more organized than the meme would suggest. The project describes Apeing as a meme coin brand created by a team of true degens focused on culture, energy and community, with a clear promise to “focus on audit first, then… open the door” to the broader ecosystem Well, Apeing is blunt. The project describes $APEING as a utility and entertainment token, not a security or guaranteed investment, and repeatedly warns that crypto assets are high-risk and users can lose everything they put in. For anyone scanning new crypto coins , that mix of meme energy and sober disclaimers is exactly what seasoned degens now look for. Why Does the Apeing Whitelist Matter for New Crypto Coins? Whitelist subscribers are the first to get email updates when Apeing moves from “getting ready” into live action. Instead of learning about $APEING from a green candle on Twitter, they get details from the source. In many structured launches, the 1st stage typically has limited token allocation, so those who enter early and size responsibly have a better shot at decent entries than late buyers chasing hype. That doesn’t magically make $APEING the next moonshot, but it does stack the odds slightly more in favor of people who were prepared. Apeing publishes an official smart contract address on the site but clearly warns users not to send any funds to that address, stressing that transactions there cannot be reversed. Combined with “official channels only” messaging, that’s a strong hint: check, double-check, and treat random DMs as instant red flags whenever you interact with new crypto coins. Time to think, even if you’re a degen, because the whitelist is email-based and tied to audited milestones, readers have breathing room to research the project instead of apeing into the first contract link they see. How Does Someone Actually Join the Apeing Whitelist? If you want to position for $APEING among new crypto coins, the process is straightforward: Simply visit the website and follow the company’s official Telegram and X accounts. Near the top of the homepage, there’s a Join Whitelist box with an email field and a Submit button. No wallet connect or “send funds first” gimmicks at this stage. Next, submit your email (and nothing else). When someone enters their email and hits Submit, they’re opting in to receive presale/launch updates and instructions from Apeing . The fine print says they can unsubscribe at any time. Used correctly, Apeing’s whitelist becomes a tool: a way to be early, keep risk controlled, and have a front-row seat instead of refreshing charts from the cheap seats. XRP: $4B Wall Street Shopping Spree XRP is not a “new” project, but its 2025 activity reads like a hyper-aggressive scale-up story, which is exactly why it sits beside newer names in many new crypto coins watchlists. According to multiple recent reports, XRP has spent around $4 billion on acquisitions in 2025 alone, snapping up prime broker Hidden Road for about $1.25 billion, treasury platform GTreasury for roughly $1 billion, and custody firm Palisade, among others. The goal is simple: compete directly with Wall Street heavyweights in areas like brokerage, treasury management and institutional crypto infrastructure, rather than staying in the niche of cross-border payments. Reports also note that XRP now holds more than 75 licenses worldwide, and has high-profile partnerships, for example, BNY Mellon safeguarding reserves for XRP’s RLUSD stablecoin and other institutional products. On top of that, the company just closed a $500 million round at a $40 billion valuation, led by major funds like Citadel and Fortress. On the token side, $XRP currently trades around $2.48, with more than 60 billion tokens in circulation, putting its market cap well into the tens of billions. While recent price action has been choppy after a large run-up, XRP holders are still significantly up year-on-year, and speculation continues around spot XRP ETFs and broader institutional use. For someone scanning new crypto coins, XRP is more like the “benchmark alt”: a reminder of what happens when a token goes from scrappy outsider to $40B infrastructure player, while also showing that big valuations don’t erase volatility. Hedera ($HBAR): Google Cloud BigQuery Boost & Breakout Talk Hedera has been having a moment of its own. A 99Bitcoins deep-dive explains that Hedera (HBAR) has been added to Google Cloud’s BigQuery public datasets, putting its full transaction history alongside chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum inside Google’s flagship data warehouse. BigQuery lets developers and enterprises run SQL-style queries across massive datasets, so this integration makes Hedera’s on-chain data far more accessible to analysts, app builders and Web3 teams already plugged into Google Cloud. The article notes that HBAR jumped over 10% on the news, and technical analysis shows the token consolidating around the $0.19 area after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern, often seen as a bullish reversal setup. Indicators like RSI near 50 and a flattening MACD suggest a “catching its breath” phase, with upside targets near $0.20–$0.22 if support holds, while a drop below $0.18 could trigger a deeper pullback. Even though $HBAR isn’t a brand-new token, this kind of enterprise-grade partnership and chart reset is exactly what keeps it in discussions around new crypto coins to rotate into. It shows how older Layer-1s can generate “new coin energy” when they land real integrations and then back them up with constructive technicals. Conclusion: New Crypto Coins Need Narratives and Filters Taken together, Apeing , XRP and Hedera show three different angles on what readers mean when they talk about new crypto coins. Apeing is the pure degen play: a meme-driven project that still insists on audits first, official channels only and a whitelist-led funnel so early supporters get structured information before anything goes live, especially important when first stages typically have limited token allocation and better entry opportunities for those who were paying attention. XRP sits at the other end: a multi-billion-dollar firm spending $4B on Wall Street-style acquisitions, raising $500M at a $40B valuation and pushing $XRP deeper into the institutional conversation. Hedera lands somewhere in the middle, with Google Cloud BigQuery integration and bullish HBAR price action giving it a fresh narrative burst despite its age. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) FAQs – Which Is The Best 100x Crypto Shot? 1. Why is Apeing included in a discussion about new crypto coins? Apeing is a fresh meme-driven project that combines degen branding with an audit-first plan, official-channel communication and an email whitelist, putting $APEING firmly on many “new crypto coins” watchlists. 2. How does the Apeing whitelist help with new crypto coins risk? The Apeing whitelist sends early, official email updates about milestones and next steps, so readers can research before acting and position for stages that often have limited token allocation, key advantage when dealing with high-risk new crypto coins. 3. What’s the big XRP news right now? XRP has spent roughly $4 billion acquiring firms across brokerage, payments, custody and treasury, raised $500 million at a $40B valuation, and is pushing deeper into Wall Street-style infrastructure while $XRP trades in the mid-$2 range. 4. Why is Hedera mentioned alongside new crypto coins? Hedera just joined Google Cloud’s BigQuery public datasets , boosting visibility and enterprise appeal, and $HBAR recently broke out of a falling wedge with price consolidating around $0.19, giving it fresh momentum similar to newer coins. Glossary Whitelist – A curated list of early participants who get first access to updates or events; Apeing uses an email-based whitelist to notify users when audited stages go live. XRP – The company behind the XRP Ledger, now expanding into Wall Street-style infrastructure via multi-billion-dollar acquisitions and strategic partnerships. $XRP – The native asset of the XRP Ledger, currently trading around the mid-$2 range with over 60B tokens in circulation, used for liquidity and payments. Hedera – A proof-of-stake public network focused on enterprise use cases, recently integrated into Google Cloud’s BigQuery for easier on-chain data access. $HBAR – Hedera’s native token, which recently rallied on the Google Cloud news and is consolidating around $0.19 with potential resistance near $0.20–$0.22. BigQuery – Google Cloud’s large-scale data warehouse service, now hosting Hedera’s public blockchain data alongside major networks for cross-chain analytics. Market cap – The total value of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply (price × circulating tokens); used to compare the relative size of assets like $APEING, $XRP and $HBAR in the broader market. Summary Apeing, XRP and Hedera each play a different role in today’s market: Apeing positions $APEING as a meme-driven brand with an audit-first roadmap and a whitelist for early, safer access; XRP deploys roughly $4 billion on Wall Street-style acquisitions while $XRP trades in the mid-$2 range; and Hedera’s $HBAR gains fresh momentum from its new integration into Google Cloud’s BigQuery, together creating a snapshot of how new crypto coins and established altcoins are evolving in a $3.6T crypto ecosystem.

Legislator Ge Ru-jun’s call for a comprehensive review of confiscated Bitcoin assets highlights the growing importance of digital currencies in government policy. This move could set a precedent for how nations handle seized cryptocurrency assets worldwide. Why Is Taiwan Investigating Seized Bitcoin? Taiwanese legislator Ge Ru-jun has taken a bold stance on the government’s cryptocurrency holdings. He argues that the seized Bitcoin represents substantial potential value that requires careful evaluation. The central question revolves around whether Taiwan should maintain these digital assets as long-term investments or liquidate them for immediate financial gain. Governor Yang Chin-long of Taiwan’s central bank has responded positively to these concerns. He confirmed that a detailed research report will be published by the end of the year. This timeline gives authorities sufficient opportunity to analyze multiple factors affecting their decision. What Makes Seized Bitcoin So Valuable? The investigation focuses on several key aspects of the confiscated cryptocurrency: Market volatility – Bitcoin’s price fluctuations affect asset valuation Storage security – Safeguarding digital assets requires specialized measures Legal considerations – Proper handling of seized property Investment potential – Long-term versus short-term financial strategy This seized Bitcoin represents more than just digital currency—it symbolizes the intersection of traditional finance and emerging technology. The government’s approach could influence how other nations manage similar situations. What Challenges Does Taiwan Face? Managing seized cryptocurrency presents unique obstacles that differ from traditional asset management. The volatile nature of Bitcoin prices requires careful timing for any potential sales. Additionally, secure storage solutions must prevent hacking attempts and ensure asset protection. Legal frameworks surrounding cryptocurrency continue to evolve globally. Taiwan’s decision will need to consider international precedents while establishing its own regulatory standards. The government must balance immediate financial needs against potential future gains from holding the digital assets. What Can We Expect From the Investigation? The year-end report will likely address several critical questions about the seized Bitcoin. Experts anticipate recommendations regarding: Optimal timing for asset liquidation Secure storage protocols Legal compliance requirements Market impact considerations This comprehensive approach ensures that Taiwan makes an informed decision about its seized cryptocurrency holdings. The outcome could serve as a model for other governments facing similar dilemmas. Conclusion: A Landmark Decision for Cryptocurrency Regulation Taiwan’s investigation into seized Bitcoin marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency governance. The government’s careful approach demonstrates recognition of digital assets’ growing significance in global finance. Whatever decision emerges from this process will undoubtedly influence how nations worldwide handle confiscated cryptocurrency. The seized Bitcoin investigation represents more than just asset management—it reflects the evolving relationship between traditional financial systems and digital innovation. Taiwan’s thoughtful methodology sets a valuable precedent for responsible cryptocurrency governance. Frequently Asked Questions Why is Taiwan investigating seized Bitcoin? Taiwan wants to determine the best approach for managing confiscated cryptocurrency assets, deciding whether to hold them as investments or sell them for immediate funds. Who initiated the Bitcoin investigation? Legislator Ge Ru-jun called for the investigation, highlighting the potential value of the seized Bitcoin and the need for proper asset management. When will the investigation results be available? Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-long confirmed a research report will be released by the end of the current year. What happens to seized Bitcoin in other countries? Different nations handle confiscated cryptocurrency differently—some immediately sell at auction, while others hold assets as investments. How does Bitcoin volatility affect the investigation? Price fluctuations significantly impact the decision-making process, as timing sales during market highs can maximize returns. What security measures protect seized Bitcoin? Governments typically use cold storage wallets and multi-signature protocols to secure confiscated digital assets from theft.

STCE exhibits high volatility, with a 64% annualized standard deviation and significant tracking error, making it a high-risk, high-reward play. The ETF is concentrated in fintech, heavily weighted toward Financials and Information Technology, and relies on bullish trends in bitcoin and ether. Technical analysis shows STCE near key Fibonacci support, with the 200-day moving average trending up, suggesting a favorable risk-managed entry point. Cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin and ether, got off to a rough start in 2025. Digital assets cratered leading into and immediately after the so-called “Liberation Day.” But the crypto bulls came back, and for a brief time, the two most valuable non-stablecoin tokens tagged record highs in the second half of the year. Volatility has been high, but swings are incredibly wild in shares of many crypto-linked stocks. Today, I’m digging into the Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF (STCE). With about three years under its belt, price action has not been for the faint of heart. I have a buy rating on it. The valuation is not extreme, while the chart points to the possibility of near-term support. To add to that, year-end has tended to be a very strong stretch in crypto. STCE: Much Higher Volatility Than Even Bitcoin & Ether This Year StockCharts.com According to the issuer , ""STCE is designed to deliver global exposure to companies that may benefit from the development or utilization of cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) and other digital assets, and the business activities connected to blockchain and other distributed ledger technology. Investors in the fund have the potential to benefit from the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies, both as a store of value and medium of exchange, without owning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin directly and other digital assets."" STCE is a small ETF with just $347 million in assets under management as of November 10, 2025. Its annual expense ratio is modest at just 30 basis points, while the trailing 12-month dividend yield is very low at just 0.34%, about one percentage point below that of the S&P 500. Share-price momentum is rated well, but the fund is about 25% off its highs. The portfolio is, of course, highly risky across volatility metrics. Its standard deviation is at nosebleed levels, above 60%. What’s more, annualized volatility is now 64%, with tracking error running high compared to benchmarks. Overall, the ETF Risk Grade by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system is poor at an F. Still, its overall Asset Class rank, as of this writing, is top-notch at No. 2 out of 410. Finally, on liquidity , I would caution investors to use limit orders, particularly around the market’s open. Average daily volume is just 124,000 shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is wide at 24 basis points, per Schwab. Looking closer at the portfolio, the 3-star ETF by Morningstar has high exposure to the lowest row of the style box, indicating its material exposure to small caps. Furthermore, more than half of the allocation is classified as growth. What does that mean for investors? Well, it suggests that price trends rely heavily on a thematic story—bullish bitcoin and ether, in this case. I’d steer investors away from the low reported 9.8x P/E (I trust Schwab’s numbers more, which is 22.4x). STCE: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar STCE: Low-Mid 20s P/E Schwab In terms of the sector breakdown, STCE is really a fintech play. Hence, almost the entire portfolio is invested in either the Financials or the Information Technology sector. Concentration is high, however, with almost two-thirds of the product allocated to just the top 10 holdings. So, it’s key to follow both the fundamentals and technicals of those major positions, particularly during the earnings season. STCE: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha In terms of seasonality, STCE has a limited price history. For that reason, I pulled bitcoin’s long-term month-by-month average price change. You’ll see that November is historically bullish, with gains extending into year-end and the beginning of the new year. To be clear, bitcoin bucked usual October bullish trends, so it’s not a sure thing. Bitcoin: Bullish Turn-of-the-Year Trends Barchart The Technical Take With a reasonable valuation and seasonal tailwinds, STCE’s technical situation is weak at first glance, but I see support in play. Notice in the chart below that shares are now approaching the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the April to October rally. That level is close to the $78 level—just $4 above the current price. Moreover, a peak in September has confluence with that point. What’s negative, though, is that the fund has dropped below the short-term 50-day moving average. But take a look at the long-term 200dma. It remains upward sloping, suggesting that even after a 25% giveback, the bulls still control the primary trend. Long-term support is likely to appear near $60—the peak from late 2024 and where resistance appeared in July. That's also the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement mark. So, buying here and adding in the low-mid $60s could be a risk-managed way to build a position. Additionally, the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart has ranged in a bullish zone from 40 to 80 (and here we are at the base of the range today). Finally, there is overhead resistance, given the significant amount of volume by price up to $110 (heavy volume since September leaves many investors underwater). STCE: Shares Retreat 25% to Fibonacci Support, Rising 200dma, Bullish RSI Range StockCharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on STCE. The significant decline was perhaps needed after the fund notched extremely overbought levels. The P/E is not massive, while bullish calendar trends and a notable place on the chart offer opportunity, in my view.",BTC-USD|STCE,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-13 02:44:00

Founder Shayne Coplan said at a recent Miami conference that Polymarket’s US venue is already running, with a limited group of users onboarding as part of a beta phase, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. He added that the exchange is fully functional for selected accounts while it completes the final steps before opening wider access. Bloomberg reported last month that Polymarket planned to start a limited rollout in the US in November. The beta follows a reset period in which Polymarket moved offshore and paid a $1.4m penalty in 2022 to settle CFTC allegations . According to Bloomberg, prediction market platform Polymarket has quietly relaunched in the U.S. in beta mode, allowing select users to place real bets on live contracts. After paying a $1.4 million CFTC fine and relocating offshore, Polymarket returned by acquiring QCX, a… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 12, 2025 Prediction Market Momentum Builds As US Platforms Race To Launch New Products Interest in wagering on real-world events has climbed since last year’s presidential election. Kalshi has served US customers for years, and FanDuel said Wednesday it will launch a prediction product in December. Polymarket is moving to capture that demand with an exchange model that lets users set prices and back either side of an outcome. “It’s the fastest anyone has ever gotten to market,” Coplan said. “Definitely a difficult task, but our team has been incredible and made that happen.” CFTC-Approved Acquisition Bolsters Polymarket’s Bid To Enter Regulated Markets The firm acquired QCEX earlier this year, a company with CFTC approval to operate a derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, after the Justice Department and the CFTC dropped investigations into the crypto-betting platform. Polymarket frames its design as closer to a market venue than a casino. “I don’t think anyone would argue that the sports book model is the optimal model,” Coplan said. “There’s a monopoly on pricing. You trade against the house every time and they can set whatever prices they want and to make matters worse, if you make any money, they can ban you.” Founder Hints $POLY Token Could Join Top Cryptocurrencies By Market Value The company has been seeking fresh capital at a valuation between $12b and $15b after announcing an investment of as much as $2b from Intercontinental Exchange . A successful US return would give the platform a stronger footing as prediction trading battles for mainstream attention. Google Finance said last week it will begin showing live data from Polymarket and Kalshi in the coming weeks , starting with Labs users, so people can ask about future events and tap the wisdom of the crowd. That visibility could help normalize prediction prices for a broader audience. Speculation is also building around a potential native token. Last month, Coplan hinted at a $POLY token and suggested it could rank among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The tease comes as markets for elections, sports and macro outcomes gain traction. For crypto traders, a compliant US presence would be a milestone. A beta that proves stable onboarding, reliable settlement and meaningful liquidity could set the stage for a larger reopening, while competition from incumbents pushes the sector toward clearer rules and stronger consumer protections.

Corporate Bitcoin holdings continue to expand, even as MicroStrategy’s dominance slips to 60% of total reserves. Morgan Stanley advises caution, calling this phase a potential profit-taking season, while a stronger U.S. dollar adds short-term pressure. Still, BTC’s symmetrical triangle pattern hints at a possible breakout toward $104,000 and beyond. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Share Falls as Corporate Adoption Expands MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of BTC, but its share is declining as more companies add BTC to their balance sheets. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows MicroStrategy now holds 640,808 BTC, or 60% of total corporate Bitcoin reserves — down from 75% earlier this year. Corporate Bitcoin accumulation slowed in October, with public and private firms adding just 14,447 BTC — the lowest monthly increase of 2025. Coinbase purchased 2,772 BTC, while Japan’s Metaplanet led with 5,268 BTC, underscoring steady institutional confidence in BTC’s long-term value.

However, the growing number of companies adopting BTC for reserves supports a positive long-term outlook for the asset. Morgan Stanley Warns Bitcoin Entering Profit-Taking Phase Morgan Stanley strategist Denny Galindo says Bitcoin has entered its “fall season,” a phase in its four-year market cycle when investors typically take profits before a potential downturn.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Eyes $104K as Triangle Pattern Narrows Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is hovering near $102,100, trading within a narrowing range that’s forming a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. The pattern signals that the market is coiling before a decisive breakout, with traders watching closely for a move beyond either side of the formation. BTC found support near $101,000, where a hammer candle formed, a sign that buyers are still stepping in on dips. The 20-EMA sits just below the 50-EMA, showing short-term caution but also hinting at a potential bullish crossover if momentum builds. The RSI at 48 remains neutral, suggesting that volatility could soon expand as traders position for the next move. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A confirmed break above $104,000 would likely trigger a rally toward $107,500, with further upside possible near $110,900. However, if Bitcoin slips below $99,200, a deeper pullback toward $96,200 or $93,400 could follow, where stronger historical support lies. For now, traders are waiting for confirmation. The breakout direction, above $104,000 or below $99,000, will likely set the tone for the rest of the quarter. With volatility tightening and institutional inflows building, Bitcoin’s current pause could be the calm before a sharp year-end move. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $26.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013255 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

54330763,626165,1763002808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54330763.jpeg,Bitwise Inches Closer to Launching First-Ever Chainlink ETF as DTCC Listing Creates a Buzz,https://bitcoinist.com/bitwise-inche-closer-launching-first-ever-chainlink/,"Bitwise’s proposed Chainlink exchange-traded fund (ETF) has moved a step closer to launch after being added to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) registry under the ticker CLNK. The listing, marked as both active and pre-launch, indicates that preparations are underway for its debut once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) grants final approval. DTCC Listing Sparks Optimism for Chainlink ETF Approval While DTCC listings do not guarantee regulatory clearance, they often precede official approval. The ETF aims to track Chainlink (LINK) , the native token that powers Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network, connecting smart contracts to real-world data feeds. This marks a major milestone for Bitwise, one of America’s leading crypto asset managers, which filed its Form S-1 with the SEC in August and is expected to follow up with Form 8-A, the last step before the ETF can trade on U.S. exchanges. The progress comes amid a prolonged U.S. government shutdown, now in its sixth week, which has stalled dozens of pending crypto ETF applications. However, optimism is growing after the Senate passed a bill to reopen government operations, potentially expediting long-delayed ETF reviews. Chainlink’s Expanding Institutional Footprint If approved, the Bitwise Chainlink ETF would become the first U.S. fund offering institutional exposure to a decentralized oracle network, a critical infrastructure in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Chainlink provides real-time, tamper-proof data to smart contracts, enabling the automation of payments, lending, and asset management across blockchain platforms. Analysts suggest that such an ETF could not only expand investor access to LINK but also solidify Chainlink’s position as a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure. The move follows Bitwise’s growing portfolio of altcoin ETFs, including funds tracking Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Aptos, while competitors like Grayscale are also seeking approval for a similar Chainlink ETF that includes staking features, a structure that may face additional regulatory hurdles. Market Reactions and the Road Ahead Despite the bullish regulatory signal, LINK prices slipped 2%, trading around $15.75 after failing to hold above the $17.40 resistance level. Analysts note that broader crypto market weakness and heavy derivatives sell-offs have overshadowed the positive ETF news. Still, industry observers see the DTCC listing as a key sign of maturing infrastructure for crypto-based financial products. Once the U.S. government fully reopens and the SEC resumes full operations, the Bitwise Chainlink ETF (CLNK) could lead a new wave of altcoin ETFs into the U.S. market, supporting the growing institutional appetite for blockchain-linked assets and bringing DeFi innovation closer to Wall Street.

Over the past week, Ethereum’s price has stabilized around the $3,500 level after briefly dipping below key supports, as traders and institutions reassess risk exposure across the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH-MVRV Rebounds From Local Low – Potential Recovery Toward $115K–$120K Despite the cautious sentiment, on-chain data reveals a contrasting story — large holders, or “whales,” are quietly accumulating ETH during the downturn. According to data from Lookonchain and CryptoQuant, several high-value wallets have increased their Ethereum positions significantly, signaling growing confidence among long-term investors even as broader market momentum slows. This accumulation phase suggests that sophisticated players view current price levels as an opportunity rather than a sign of broader weakness. Historically, similar patterns of whale buying during macro uncertainty have preceded periods of recovery and renewed market strength. Whale Activity Suggests Strategic Accumulation Despite Market Uncertainty According to data from Lookonchain, a whale known for aggressive Ethereum accumulation has just purchased an additional 30,548 ETH ($105.36 million) within the past hour. This move brings his total acquisitions since November 4 to an astonishing 385,718 ETH, worth roughly $1.33 billion. Notably, around $270 million of the funds used for these purchases were borrowed from the decentralized lending platform Aave, highlighting a highly leveraged but strategic positioning. This type of activity often signals strong institutional confidence in Ethereum’s medium-term outlook. Borrowing large sums to accumulate ETH indicates that the whale expects price appreciation substantial enough to offset borrowing costs and volatility risks. It also reflects growing demand for Ethereum exposure within decentralized finance (DeFi), where whales utilize platforms like Aave to optimize capital efficiency. Such large-scale buying can have multiple implications: it absorbs available market liquidity, strengthens psychological support zones, and may trigger a sentiment shift among retail investors who interpret the move as bullish. However, it also introduces potential short-term risk — if prices correct further, leveraged positions could amplify volatility. Overall, the data points toward renewed accumulation momentum, suggesting that sophisticated market participants are positioning for Ethereum’s next major move. Related Reading: Uniswap Founder Submits Governance Proposal To Burn UNI — Token Jumps 50% Bulls Attempt to Reclaim Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing signs of stabilization after weeks of intense selling pressure, trading around $3,479 at the time of writing. The daily chart shows ETH holding just above the 200-day moving average (red line) — a key long-term support level that has historically acted as a launch point for bullish recoveries. After dipping below $3,200 earlier in the week, Ethereum bounced strongly, supported by renewed whale accumulation and improving market sentiment. However, the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages remain above the current price, indicating that the short-term trend is still tilted to the downside. For bulls to regain control, ETH needs to close decisively above $3,650–$3,700, where a confluence of resistance sits. Related Reading: Ethereum Trading Volume On Binance Surpasses $6 Trillion: A Speculative Frenzy Unfolds Volume data suggests that selling pressure is gradually fading, but momentum remains weak. If Ethereum fails to maintain the $3,400–$3,450 zone, the next major support lies near $3,200. On the upside, reclaiming the $3,700 mark could open the door to a recovery toward $4,000. Overall, Ethereum appears to be in a consolidation phase, with large holders accumulating while retail traders remain cautious — a structure that often precedes a stronger directional move.

That’s why Noomez ($NNZ) is turning heads right now – it’s fun, it’s early, and it’s still flying under the radar. Each stage pushes the price higher, and early buyers are locking in before the big exchange listings. Miss this window, and you’ll be watching screenshots of Noomies celebrating while you’re still refreshing charts. It’s the one people will brag about saying, “I bought that before it pumped.” What Makes A Meme Coin Worth Buying? Not all meme coins are equal. The top meme coins 2025 will be the ones with structure, transparency, and a strong community behind them. Noomez hits several of those marks. It runs a 28-stage presale where each stage raises the price and burns leftover tokens. That means early entry gives you raw access and built-in scarcity. The fact that you can follow every stage using the live “Noom Gauge” on-chain gives clarity that many meme launches lack. It’s about more than the joke or the mascot – it’s about mechanics and timing. 3 Proven Ways To Find The Next Big Meme Coin Spotting the next breakout meme coin isn’t about luck. It’s about knowing where to look before everyone else catches on. 1. Monitor Social Media And Communities Buzz often starts in Telegram groups, Discord servers, and on X (formerly Twitter). When you see steady chatter about a meme coin, check the details. Early community momentum can point to something real. Don’t just swim in hype; watch for consistent engagement, memes, and people asking about project updates. 2. Track Presale Stages And Tokenomics The best meme coins right now will have clear tokenomics, a staged release plan, and built-in scarcity. Noomez ’s presale begins at $0.00001 and works up to $0.0028 across 28 rounds. Each stage only lasts up to seven days, and unsold tokens get burned. This gives early buyers a lower price and fewer competitors. Watch how many tokens are left, when the next stage kicks in, and whether the project updates transparently. 3. Follow Smart Money And Whales Big holders often jump in before listings. While you’re tracking presale numbers, take note of wallet activity, whale buys, or smart-money moves. If several early wallets are committing, it can be a strong signal. With Noomez, you can observe the “Noom Gauge” update each time a stage closes and tokens burn. That level of visibility is rare in the meme-coin space. Why Noomez ($NNZ) Could Be The One Everyone Talks About Next Noomez is shaping up as a standout among presale tokens. Its 28-stage structure, fixed total supply of 280 billion $NNZ , and deflationary burns make it perfectly timed for those hunting the top meme coins 2025 . Here’s what makes it stand out: Current Stage & Price: The presale is now in Stage 3 , priced at around $0.0000151 per token. Each new stage increases the price and burns unsold tokens automatically. Structured Tokenomics: 28 presale stages, 50% of supply for presale, 15% locked liquidity, and the rest reserved for staking and ecosystem growth. Every stage fuels scarcity and trust. Referral Rewards: Through the “Noom Recruit” system , both the inviter and the new buyer receive a 10% $NNZ bonus , creating a viral growth loop. Staking Integration: Holders can stake tokens early for bonus rewards, giving utility beyond speculation. Transparency: The entire presale progress is visible on-chain through the Noom Gauge , showing live token burns and stage data in real time.

ETH price dipped below $3,550 and entered a short-term bearish zone. The decline gathered pace below $3,500 and the price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,176 swing low to the $3,658 high.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,550 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,800 resistance zone or even $3,880 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,400 level. The first major support sits near the $3,360 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,176 swing low to the $3,658 high. A clear move below the $3,360 support might push the price toward the $3,280 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,240 region in the near term.

Recent technical setups and data suggest growing interest in a potential move higher, with some traders eyeing a $5 target before the year ends. Cup-and-Handle Pattern in Focus Levi shared a chart showing a classic cup-and-handle setup on XRP’s 3-day timeframe. The rounded bottom formed between January and July 2025, followed by a move upward. Since then, the asset has pulled back inside a downward channel, shaping the handle. Notably, this structure is often seen before a breakout. The upper boundary of the handle is now being tested. A clean break above that level would complete the pattern and open room toward the $5 area. Levi noted, BREAKING: $XRP chart shows a classic cup-&-handle setup pointing to a $5 target by year-end. pic.twitter.com/kU37qXUBSU — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 12, 2025 The MACD on the chart also shows a possible bullish cross forming. Furthermore, ChartNerd pointed to a larger consolidation-expansion cycle. In the past, XRP traded sideways before a breakout. A similar structure is now visible on the chart, with the price holding between $1.50 and $3.00 throughout most of 2025. If this pattern continues, a new upward move could follow. The chart suggests this consolidation phase may be near completion, but a push above the top of the range is still needed. Mirrored Setup Hints at Repeat Move EGRAG CRYPTO shared a short-term pattern labeled “ As Above, So Below ” on the 4-hour chart. It compares two identical time periods of 89 days. Both show four stages of price movement within a tight range. The current structure reflects the earlier phase. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X Support levels are marked between $2.30 and $2.50. Resistance areas sit near $2.80, $3.00, and higher at $3.65 and $4.38. The final level on the chart aligns with the 1.414 Fibonacci extension at $4.38. Market Reaction and New Developments CRYPTOWZRD noted that XRP closed below $2.75 and is still influenced by Bitcoin’s trend. The key short-term level remains $2.41. A bounce from that support may allow for a move higher, while a failure to hold it could lead to more range-bound movement. As CryptoPotato reported , analysts are watching the $2.70 resistance level. This zone is seen as a short-term barrier before any major move can materialize. Separately, Steph reported that XRP’s CVD turned positive for the first time in months. “Last time this happened, XRP rallied 75%.” In addition, Canary Capital is set to launch the first US-based spot XRP ETF on November 13, aiming for full exposure to the asset.

The current Bitcoin price situation highlights the importance of understanding market cycles. Moreover, experienced traders recognize that short-term volatility doesn’t necessarily reflect long-term value. The fundamental technology behind Bitcoin remains unchanged, regardless of daily price movements. What Should Investors Do About the Bitcoin Price Drop? Facing a declining Bitcoin price requires careful strategy rather than emotional reactions. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this market condition: Assess your risk tolerance before making any decisions Diversify your portfolio to manage exposure Consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market Stay informed about market developments Set clear investment goals and stick to your strategy The current Bitcoin price movement serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investing requires both patience and perspective. While the drop below $101,000 is significant, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced view of the overall market trajectory. Looking Beyond the Current Bitcoin Price The Bitcoin price has demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout its history. Each major correction has been followed by periods of recovery and growth. Consequently, many analysts suggest focusing on the fundamental value proposition rather than short-term price fluctuations. As the market processes this latest Bitcoin price development, investors should remember that volatility works in both directions. The same factors that drive prices down can also fuel rapid recoveries. The key is maintaining a disciplined approach and avoiding reactionary decisions based on temporary market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin fall below $101,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from a combination of factors including profit-taking, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic conditions affecting cryptocurrency markets. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this price drop? Investment decisions should align with your individual strategy and risk tolerance. Many long-term investors view price corrections as potential accumulation opportunities. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is challenging, but historical support levels and market analysis can provide guidance on potential downside targets. When will Bitcoin recover from this drop? Market recoveries vary in timing. The Bitcoin price has historically shown strong resilience, but recovery periods can range from weeks to several months. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some investors consider price drops as buying opportunities, but always conduct thorough research and consider your financial situation before investing. What indicators should I watch during Bitcoin price volatility? Key indicators include trading volume, market sentiment, regulatory news, and technical analysis patterns to gauge potential market direction. Found this analysis helpful?

On November 12, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant shift, with a net outflow of $278 million reversing the previous day’s inflows. This sudden change highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments and raises questions about market sentiment. What Caused the Bitcoin ETF Outflow? The data from Trader T reveals a complete reversal in investor behavior. After a brief period of net inflows, the market saw substantial withdrawals across major funds. This Bitcoin ETF movement suggests changing investor confidence and potential market adjustments. Which Bitcoin ETFs Were Most Affected? Several prominent funds experienced notable outflows: Fidelity’s FBTC : $132.86 million outflow Ark Invest’s ARKB : $85.18 million outflow BlackRock’s IBIT : $36.91 million outflow Grayscale’s GBTC : $23.05 million outflow Interestingly, no spot Bitcoin ETFs reported net inflows for the day, indicating a broad market trend rather than isolated incidents. How Does This Bitcoin ETF Movement Impact Investors? For current investors, this outflow represents a shift in market dynamics. The Bitcoin ETF sector, known for its volatility, continues to demonstrate rapid changes in investor sentiment. However, experienced investors understand that such fluctuations are normal in emerging asset classes. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETF Future Trends? While daily outflows might concern some investors, it’s crucial to consider the bigger picture. The Bitcoin ETF market remains relatively new, and such movements often reflect short-term market adjustments rather than long-term trends. Market analysts suggest watching for patterns over weeks rather than days. Should You Worry About Bitcoin ETF Volatility? Volatility is inherent in cryptocurrency investments. The recent Bitcoin ETF outflow, while significant, represents a small percentage of total assets under management. Investors should maintain perspective and consider their long-term investment strategies rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. The $278 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a reminder of the market’s dynamic nature. While concerning at first glance, such movements are part of the normal ebb and flow in cryptocurrency investing. Savvy investors use these opportunities to reassess their positions and stay informed about market developments. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin ETF? A Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks Bitcoin’s price, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning cryptocurrency. Why do Bitcoin ETF flows matter? ETF flows indicate investor sentiment and can influence Bitcoin’s price through buying and selling pressure. Are Bitcoin ETF outflows always negative? Not necessarily. Outflows can represent profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing rather than loss of confidence. How often do Bitcoin ETF flows change direction? Flows can change daily, reflecting the cryptocurrency market’s high volatility and rapid sentiment shifts. Should I sell my Bitcoin ETF during outflows? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and long-term strategy, not just daily flow data. Where can I track Bitcoin ETF flows? Multiple financial data providers and cryptocurrency news sites regularly update ETF flow information. Found this analysis helpful?

Nasdaq’s approval of the Canary XRP ETF represents a monumental step forward for institutional cryptocurrency adoption, potentially opening floodgates for mainstream investment in digital assets. What Exactly is the XRP ETF and Why Does It Matter? The Canary XRP ETF approval signals a significant shift in how traditional financial markets view cryptocurrency. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, allows investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the digital asset. This eliminates the technical barriers that often deter traditional investors from entering the crypto space. Nasdaq’s endorsement carries tremendous weight in financial circles. The exchange’s rigorous standards mean this XRP ETF has passed numerous compliance checks and due diligence processes. Moreover, this development comes at a crucial time when regulatory clarity around digital assets continues to evolve. How Will the XRP ETF Benefit Everyday Investors? This XRP ETF opens doors for investors who previously hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market. Consider these advantages: Simplified access through traditional brokerage accounts Enhanced security compared to managing private keys Regulatory protection within established financial frameworks Tax reporting simplicity through conventional investment channels Liquidity advantages of trading on major exchanges The XRP ETF structure means investors can buy and sell shares just like any other stock, making cryptocurrency investment as straightforward as purchasing Apple or Microsoft shares. What Challenges Remain Before Trading Begins? While Nasdaq has approved the listing, the XRP ETF still requires SEC registration completion before active trading can commence. This final regulatory hurdle represents the last step in a lengthy approval process. The SEC’s careful scrutiny ensures investor protections align with traditional financial standards. Market experts anticipate the registration process will proceed smoothly given Nasdaq’s thorough vetting. However, timing remains uncertain as regulatory bodies operate on their own schedules. Investors should monitor official announcements for the exact launch date. How Could This XRP ETF Transform Crypto Markets? The introduction of a regulated XRP ETF could dramatically increase institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets. Traditional investment firms, pension funds, and retirement accounts that previously avoided digital assets due to regulatory concerns may now consider allocation to this new asset class. This development follows growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency products. The success of Bitcoin ETFs paved the way for alternative digital asset offerings. An XRP ETF represents the next logical step in cryptocurrency financialization, potentially setting precedent for other digital assets seeking mainstream acceptance. What Should Investors Watch For Next? As we await the SEC registration completion, several key indicators deserve attention: Official trading start date announcement from regulatory bodies Initial market response and trading volume metrics Institutional participation levels in early trading sessions Price correlation between the XRP ETF and underlying XRP asset Competitive responses from other financial institutions The successful launch of this XRP ETF could trigger a wave of similar products, further bridging traditional finance and cryptocurrency ecosystems. Frequently Asked Questions When will the XRP ETF start trading? Trading will begin as soon as the SEC registration process completes. While no exact date has been announced, market observers expect approval within the coming weeks. How is this XRP ETF different from buying XRP directly? The ETF provides exposure to XRP price movements without requiring investors to manage cryptocurrency wallets or deal with exchanges. It offers the convenience and regulatory protection of traditional securities. What brokerage platforms will offer the XRP ETF? Most major brokerage platforms that support ETF trading will likely offer the XRP ETF once SEC registration completes and trading officially begins. Will this affect the price of XRP? Increased accessibility through the ETF could drive additional demand for XRP, potentially influencing its price. However, market dynamics involve multiple factors beyond ETF availability. Is this the first cryptocurrency ETF? While Bitcoin ETFs launched earlier, this represents one of the first XRP-focused ETFs to receive major exchange approval, marking a significant milestone for alternative cryptocurrency adoption. What risks should investors consider? Like all investments, the XRP ETF carries market risk, regulatory uncertainty, and volatility concerns. Investors should assess their risk tolerance and consult financial advisors before investing. Found this insight valuable?

Bitcoin Has Underperformed Against Gold & S&P 500 Recently In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed about BTC’s recent trend relative to Gold and S&P 500. Historically, the cryptocurrency has shown some degree of correlation to these assets, but the pattern has shifted lately. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Demand Growing For First Time Since Early October: CryptoQuant Head Any two given assets are said to be “correlated” when one of them reacts to movements in the other by showing volatility of its own. As the chart shared by Santiment shows, Bitcoin has diverged from the traditional assets during the last few months. From the graph, it’s visible that Bitcoin has overall gone down 15% since August 11th. In the same window, the S&P 500 and Gold are up 7% and 21%, respectively. Gold has been the clear winner, but the S&P 500 has also at least managed a profit. The same is clearly not true for the number one cryptocurrency, which has gone the opposite way. The different trajectories of the assets would imply that they are no longer correlated or only have a negative correlation. Based on the fact that Bitcoin has shown tight correlation to the two over the last four years, however, the analytics firm has said, “BTC is arguably being undervalued.” It now remains to be seen whether the cryptocurrency’s price will eventually close the gap to the others. In some other news, BTC is trading between two key on-chain price levels right now, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post. The levels in question are part of the Supply Quantiles Cost Basis Model, which maps out various Bitcoin price levels according to the percentage of the supply that will be in profit if BTC were to trade at them. Bitcoin broke above the 0.95 quantile during its rally to the new all-time high (ATH), meaning more than 95% of the supply entered into a state of unrealized gain. With the drawdown that the coin has faced since then, its price has slipped not just under this level, but also the 0.85 quantile, corresponding to supply profitability of 85%. Related Reading: XRP To $10? Analyst Reveals What Could Be The Spark This level, currently situated at $108,500, could act as a barrier preventing upward breaks. In the down direction, the 0.75 quantile is present as a cushion around $100,600. “These levels have historically acted as support and resistance, with a break of either likely to define the next directional trend,” explained Glassnode. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $105,000, up 2.5% over the last seven days.

54332398,626070,1763006446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54332398.jpeg,US Government Shutdown Slows Crypto Market Growth By $408 Billion – Analyst Explains,https://bitcoinist.com/government-shutdown-slows-crypto-market-408-billion/,"The cryptocurrency market has entered a turbulent phase marked by intense selling pressure and heightened fear, as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs heavily on investors. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have lost key support levels, signaling that bulls are losing control and that the market has shifted into a corrective phase. However, some analysts argue that this environment represents opportunity rather than collapse — a reset phase that could prepare the ground for stronger long-term growth. A major catalyst behind the recent market weakness has been the US government shutdown, which introduced significant economic uncertainty. The halt raised global concerns about volatility and delayed crucial regulatory progress, including decisions on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. With official data on inflation and employment temporarily frozen, the Federal Reserve faced increased difficulty in guiding monetary policy, adding to investor hesitation. Despite this challenging backdrop, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to demonstrate resilience. Yet, the unstable political environment and disruption in financial regulation have amplified risk perception across digital assets. For now, the crypto market remains in a fragile equilibrium , caught between fear-driven selling and opportunistic accumulation as traders and institutions await clarity on both policy direction and macroeconomic recovery. Crypto Market Growth Stalls as Uncertainty Takes Hold According to a recent report by CryptoQuant analyst GugaOnChain, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a sharp deceleration in growth over the past month, reflecting mounting investor caution amid macroeconomic uncertainty. The analysis of the Market Cap Growth Rate (MA Gap Ratio between 30-day and 365-day averages) revealed a steep slowdown between October 1 and November 10, resulting in an aggregate market capitalization loss of approximately $408 billion, according to the on-chain Market Cap Comparison indicator. Bitcoin (BTC), while remaining relatively resilient, saw its growth rate decline from 16.75% on October 1 to 6.60% by November 10. The top 20 digital assets, excluding BTC, also experienced a significant slowdown, with their collective growth rate falling from 32.29% to 14.67% in the same period. The most severe impact was observed in mid- and small-cap assets, whose growth rate collapsed from 18.57% to a near standstill at 0.21% — a clear signal of fading market momentum and risk appetite. The compression across all segments highlights how the absence of macroeconomic data, coupled with regulatory delays due to the US government shutdown, has heightened uncertainty. While Bitcoin continues to hold elevated levels, the broader market remains fragile. CryptoQuant analysts conclude that a sustained recovery depends on policy clarity and the return of economic data flow. The resumption of government activities, inflation reports, and potential ETF updates could help restore investor confidence and reignite growth across the digital asset landscape. Crypto Market Cap Tests Crucial Support Amid Broad Slowdown The total cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands around $3.48 trillion, showing signs of stabilization after weeks of persistent selling pressure. As seen in the chart, the market is consolidating near the 50-week moving average, a level that has historically acted as a crucial support zone during mid-cycle corrections. A decisive close above this area could signal resilience, while a breakdown below it may open the door for deeper retracements toward the $3.2 trillion region. From a structural standpoint, the broader market remains in an uptrend, but momentum has clearly weakened since the late-September peak near $4.2 trillion. The declining volume over the past few weeks reinforces this cooling phase, suggesting that market participants are adopting a cautious stance amid macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty. Bitcoin’s relative stability above $100,000 has helped prevent a steeper market-wide correction, but the weakness in altcoins continues to weigh on aggregate valuations. If liquidity and investor sentiment improve, the market could attempt a recovery back toward $3.8–$4 trillion in the coming weeks. However, sustained macro uncertainty or prolonged consolidation in Bitcoin could extend this period of stagnation, keeping total crypto capitalization trapped within the current range for the remainder of Q4 2025.

This decisive action brings relief to federal workers and restores essential services across the nation. What Does Ending the Government Shutdown Mean for America? The resolution of this government shutdown means federal employees can return to work and receive their delayed paychecks. Moreover, all national parks, museums, and government agencies will resume normal operations immediately. However, this is only a temporary fix that addresses the immediate crisis. Key Details About the Temporary Budget Agreement The newly signed bill provides funding for government operations through February 15th. This three-week window gives lawmakers additional time to negotiate a more permanent spending package. The agreement includes: Full back pay for all affected federal workers Restoration of all non-essential government services Continuation of critical programs like food stamps and housing assistance Reopening of all national parks and monuments Why Was This Government Shutdown Particularly Significant? This government shutdown became the longest in American history, lasting 35 days and affecting approximately 800,000 federal workers. The political standoff primarily centered around border security funding, specifically President Trump’s request for $5.7 billion for a border wall. The temporary solution provides time for bipartisan negotiations while preventing further economic damage. What’s Next After This Government Shutdown Resolution? Lawmakers now face a tight deadline to reach a comprehensive agreement before the temporary funding expires. Both parties have expressed willingness to negotiate, but significant differences remain on border security measures. The coming weeks will determine whether a permanent solution can be found or if another government shutdown looms on the horizon. How Does This Affect the Average American? For most citizens, the end of the government shutdown means: Tax refunds will be processed without delay Small business loans and permits will resume processing Federal housing loans and mortgage approvals will continue Food safety inspections return to normal schedules Air travel security maintains full staffing levels The resolution of this government shutdown brings immediate relief but underscores the need for lasting budgetary solutions. As federal workers return to their posts and services resume, the nation watches closely to see if lawmakers can find common ground before the next deadline approaches. Frequently Asked Questions How long did the government shutdown last? The government shutdown lasted 35 days, making it the longest in U.S. history. Will federal workers receive back pay? Yes, the legislation guarantees that all affected federal employees will receive full back pay for the duration of the shutdown. What government services were affected during the shutdown? Numerous services were impacted including national parks, museum operations, tax processing, and various regulatory functions. When does the temporary funding expire? The temporary budget funds the government through February 15th, giving lawmakers three weeks to negotiate a longer-term solution. Could another government shutdown happen? Yes, if Congress fails to reach an agreement by February 15th, another government shutdown could occur. What was the main issue causing the shutdown? The primary disagreement centered around funding for border security, specifically President Trump’s request for border wall funding. Found this update on the government shutdown resolution helpful?

The price is now consolidating and might aim for another increase if it stays above the $2.350 level. XRP price started a downside correction and tested the $2.320 zone. The price is now trading near $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.430 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears $2.50. XRP Price Eyes Additional Gains XRP price started a downside correction from the $2.580 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.550 and $2.50 levels to enter a consolidation phase. The price even dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.240 swing low to the $2.580 high. However, the bulls remained active above the $2.320 support. It is now rising and trading above $2.40. The price is now trading near $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The first major resistance is near the $2.450 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.50. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.720. Another Decline?

President Donald Trump signed a temporary budget bill that effectively ended the government shutdown. This crucial action allows federal employees return to work and resume their normal duties. The Department of the Interior, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Justice are among the first agencies implementing this directive. The resolution comes after intense negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House. However, the temporary nature of the budget bill means this solution may only last for a limited period. Which Departments Are Affected by This Return? Several key government departments have issued clear instructions for their staff. The affected agencies include: Department of the Interior Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Justice Multiple other federal agencies These departments play vital roles in maintaining government operations and public services. Their full staffing ensures that essential functions can resume immediately. What Challenges Do Workers Face Returning? While the news brings relief, federal employees return to work facing several practical challenges. Many must quickly readjust their schedules and childcare arrangements. Moreover, they need to catch up on backlogged work that accumulated during the shutdown period. The transition also involves logistical considerations. Offices may need time to restore full operational capacity. Equipment might require maintenance after sitting unused for weeks. Therefore, the initial days will likely involve both celebration and significant catch-up work. How Does This Impact Government Services? As federal employees return to work, the public can expect gradual restoration of services. Important functions like national park maintenance, housing assistance programs, and legal proceedings will resume normal operations. This return to stability benefits millions of Americans who rely on these essential services. The resolution demonstrates how temporary budget solutions can provide immediate relief. However, it also highlights the need for more permanent funding agreements to prevent future disruptions. What’s Next for Federal Workers? The November 13 deadline gives federal employees return to work a clear timeline for resuming their duties. While the temporary nature of the budget solution means uncertainty remains, the immediate return provides much-needed stability for workers and their families. This development serves as a reminder of the importance of consistent government funding. It also shows the resilience of federal workers who adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining their commitment to public service. Frequently Asked Questions When exactly do federal employees return to work? Federal employees are scheduled to return to work on November 13, following the end of the government shutdown. Which departments are included in the return-to-work order? The directive affects multiple departments including Interior, Housing and Urban Development, and Justice departments.

Mizuho Securities just unveiled what they’re calling a ‘hidden gem’ – the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. With an Outperform rating and a stunning $30 price target, this analysis could change how investors view one of the most promising platforms in the digital asset world. Why is the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange generating so much excitement? Mizuho’s coverage initiation comes at a crucial time for the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. Shares recently closed at $13.80, representing a significant 56.88% decline since the company went public. However, Mizuho sees this as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern. The investment bank’s positive outlook stems from several key factors that could drive substantial growth. The analysts specifically highlighted the company’s focus on developing new growth engines. These innovative ventures include decentralized prediction markets, which represent the next frontier in blockchain technology. Moreover, the management team is actively working to secure necessary licenses for these new business lines. What makes the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange a ‘hidden gem’? Mizuho’s characterization of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange as a hidden gem isn’t just catchy marketing language. The assessment reflects several concrete advantages that could position the platform for success: Innovation focus: The company’s commitment to developing decentralized prediction markets shows forward-thinking leadership Regulatory preparedness: Active license acquisition efforts demonstrate responsible growth planning Growth potential: Current valuation doesn’t reflect future revenue streams from new ventures Market position: Established brand in the competitive cryptocurrency exchange landscape The $30 price target suggests Mizuho believes the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange could more than double from current levels. This represents one of the most optimistic Wall Street assessments in the crypto sector recently. How can investors benefit from this Gemini cryptocurrency exchange analysis? For investors considering the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, timing appears crucial. The significant price decline since IPO means entry points are substantially more attractive than during the initial public offering. However, investors should consider both the opportunities and challenges. The regulatory landscape remains complex for cryptocurrency exchanges. Success in securing necessary licenses will be critical for the new ventures Mizuho highlighted. Additionally, competition in the cryptocurrency exchange space continues to intensify from both traditional finance entrants and crypto-native platforms. Nevertheless, the combination of Mizuho’s reputable analysis and the company’s strategic direction creates a compelling case. The focus on decentralized prediction markets could tap into emerging Web3 trends that many investors are seeking exposure to through established platforms. What’s next for the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange? The path forward for the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange involves executing on several key initiatives. License acquisition for new ventures will be closely watched by market participants. Successful regulatory approvals could serve as positive catalysts for the stock price. Furthermore, the development timeline for decentralized prediction markets will influence investor sentiment. Early prototypes or testnet launches could generate additional excitement around the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange’s innovation capabilities. Market conditions for cryptocurrency exchanges overall will also play a role. A resurgence in crypto asset prices and trading volumes would naturally benefit all platforms in the sector, including Gemini. Conclusion: A promising outlook for savvy investors The Mizuho initiation on the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange represents a significant vote of confidence from a major financial institution. The Outperform rating and $30 target price suggest substantial upside potential from current levels. While risks remain in the volatile crypto market, the combination of innovation focus, regulatory diligence, and attractive valuation creates a compelling investment thesis.

The House approved the deal 222 to 209 after Senate negotiators reached a compromise, keeping agencies funded through January and securing full-year financing for several departments into fiscal 2026. Trump’s signature late Wednesday closed a 43-day stalemate, restoring pay for federal workers and restarting critical food and nutrition programs. Futures in the US were little changed, with investors waiting for normal economic data releases to resume and help refine the interest-rate outlook.

President Trump signs bill to reopen the government. The longest shutdown in US history is over, but it will take time for things to return to normal. https://t.co/wqqceeYUad pic.twitter.com/CCXkplBHYI — CNN (@CNN) November 13, 2025 In Japan, the Nikkei rose 0.5% and the Topix climbed nearly 1% to a record, as investors rotated away from the frothiest AI leaders into broader parts of the economy. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng eased from a one-month high, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.1%. Wall Street closed split overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record high, even as the Nasdaq slipped, reflecting ongoing profit-taking in high-multiple tech. In Europe, the FTSE 100 finished at a record, bank gains lifted the STOXX 600 to fresh peaks, and Italy’s FTSE MIB hit its highest level in nearly 25 years. Shutdown’s End Clears Path For Regulators To Resume Oversight And ETF Reviews Safe-haven moves faded. The US 10-year Treasury yield hovered near 4.07% after an earlier bond bid eased. Gold, which surged nearly 3% overnight, stayed firm above $4,200 in Asian hours as traders balanced easing shutdown risks with lingering macro uncertainty. Energy softened. Brent crude futures edged down to a three-week low near $62.48 a barrel after OPEC shifted its outlook to a small surplus for 2026, tempering the demand narrative that supported prices earlier in the week. For crypto traders, the fiscal clarity removes one source of headline risk, but it may not immediately shift flows. With bitcoin flat and liquidity still thin in early trade, desks are watching the restart of US data for fresh cues on rates and risk appetite. The shutdown’s end also clears the way for regulators and agencies to return to normal operations, which matters for digital-asset oversight, ETF administration, and enforcement calendars. Any surprises in the coming data run could reprice rate expectations and ripple quickly through high-beta assets, including crypto. For now, the market tone is one of cautious relief. The reopening steadies sentiment, but positioning remains selective as investors parse the path from fiscal restart to a cleaner read on growth, inflation and the next Federal Reserve steps.
