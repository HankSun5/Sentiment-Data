The company stated that data showed that investors in some altcoins are exiting exchanges, while in others, selling pressure is increasing by depositing tokens into the exchange. According to the analysis, the altcoins with the most outflows on Binance were Axie Infinity (AXS), Chainlink (LINK), Fetch.ai (FET), Aavegotchi (GHST), Amp (AMP) and Synthetix (SNX). In contrast, the assets experiencing the most inflows were recorded as Mines of Dalarnia (DAR), Polygon (MATIC), Bitcoin (BTC), JasmyCoin (JASMY), and Chiliz (CHZ). Related News: Watch Out: New Week Brings Massive Token Unlocks for 8 Altcoins - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List CryptoQuant noted that token outflows from exchanges typically indicate investors are moving their assets to cold storage or reducing selling pressure. This, combined with a reduced circulating supply, could potentially have a positive impact on prices. On the other hand, high inflows into stock markets could indicate that investors are moving their assets to stock exchanges in preparation for selling. This is a signal that could put downward pressure on prices in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

This move comes amidst significant month-end collateral needs. The incident raises concerns about liquidity conditions. The Fed still insists that market conditions remain robust with ”ample reserves.” The Surge in Repo Activity The $50.35 billion infusion marks a historical high for the Standing Repo Facility.The reverse repo facility simultaneously took in $51.8 billion. This indicates that the Fed's intervention was not isolated. This coordinated effort is aimed at addressing short-term liquidity needs that occur at the end of each month. This is generally when financial institutions face heightened collateral requirements. The Standing Repo Facility, designed to provide overnight loans to primary dealers in exchange for Treasury securities, acts as a crucial tool in managing short-term liquidity shortages. Analysts Warn of Looming Liquidity Crisis Despite the Fed's stance that these operations are part of routine market management, analysts are beginning to question whether these measures are indicative of deeper liquidity issues. One key analyst suggests that these maneuvers are not just minor adjustments but could signal an emerging liquidity crisis that the central bank is working to contain before it becomes more widespread. The analyst's commentary highlights an important pattern. He pointsout stress building up in the system. This was also evident during the 2019 repo crisis. when the Fed intervened in similar fashion to plug the gaps before the pressures spread further across the financial system. The analyst believes the Fed stepping in s o aggressively, even while facing record deficits and elevated interest rates, signals a tightening of conditions beneath the surface. Fast forward to today, and the current repo injections, though presented as part of ”ample reserves,” are drawing attention to possible cracks in the system. This is especially with the backdrop of rising deficits and an overall tightening of monetary policy. The chart of overnight repurchase agreements (repo) clearly illustrates this pattern of sudden spikes. Although often downplayed at first, the spikes eventually led to broader market repercussions. FED Repurchase Agreements | Source: Fred The intervention on Friday is not an isolated incident but a continuation of the Fed's ongoing efforts to manage short-term liquidity. This is while navigating an increasingly fragile economic environment. Comparing Repo Activity to Fed Funds Rate Looking at a long-term comparison of the Powell’s Fed funds rate versus the S&P 500 index, we see that the drastic swings in the Fed Funds Rate, especially during times of economic crisis or market stress, correlate strongly with downturns in the S&P 500 index. The period following the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 pandemic-induced recession, and the current inflationary environment, all show how aggressive Fed policy can affect broader market performance. FUND Rata/S&P 500 | Source: X What stands out from the chart is the inverse relationship between the Fed's rate hikes and the performance of the S&P 500, which has been struggling against Bitcoin over the years. Historically, when the Fed raises rates or injects large amounts of liquidity into the system, it often signals economic stress. In some cases, such as during the 1974 and 1981-82 bear markets, aggressive rate hikes and liquidity injections preceded major market downturns. The same could be said for the current environment, where the rising repo activity may be a precursor to further market volatility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-02 20:34:03

LTHs Actively Switching To Distribution In a November 1st post on social media platform X, popular on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci shared an insight into the prevalent structural bias among Bitcoin’s long-term holders. Kesmeci’s analysis hinges on the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change metric, which tracks the net buying or selling behavior of Bitcoin’s long-term investors over a period of 30 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A ‘Do-Or-Die’ Level As Cycle Faces First Real Test: Analyst A positive reading is usually interpreted as a sign that the LTHs are in a net accumulation phase, as there are more market participants within this investor class buying Bitcoin than those who are selling. On the flipside, when the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change metric is negative, it means that the LTHs are in a distribution phase. Kesmeci explained in his post that there has been an increasing amount of momentum towards the sell side of the metric. In the highlighted chart, around 400,000 BTC appears to have been sold off in the past 30 days. Interestingly, the LTHs don’t seem to be easing off on their sales — a behavior which stands equally as a source of concern. In a case where Bitcoin’s long-term investors do desist from selling their holdings, Bitcoin could put in a local price bottom, as this typically indicates renewed interest and ‘smart money’ positioning for the next cycle. However, if this distribution momentum continues to grow, the premier cryptocurrency could continue towards the downside, as its long-term holders continue to inject more bearish pressure. LTH 2.2% Supply Drop Relatively Modest — Analyst In another X post, crypto pundit Darkfost shed light on the implications of Bitcoin’s LTH behavior shift. According to the analyst, the 2.2% “modest reduction” of Bitcoin LTH supply in October is not much to worry about, especially when compared to the levels seen in 2024. As of March 2024, Bitcoin’s LTH supply dropped by approximately 5.05%. In December, there was an even higher decline of about 5.2%. Darkfost implied that the present distribution the market is seeing could therefore be a result of early profit taking, where the market could soon see a rebound of the Bitcoin price. Nonetheless, the long-term holder net position’s trend is one that should be monitored, as a move back towards neutral readings could signal the start of an accumulation phase and subsequent price reversal to the upside. As of this writing, BTC is valued at approximately $110,750, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

53957258,619042,1762117228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53957258.jpeg,"Bitcoin Market Strength Could Be More Than It Appears, Research Shows",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-strength-more-than-appears-analyst/,"Over the past two weeks, the world’s leading cryptocurrency has struggled to break definitively above the $116,000 price mark while also testing the $106,000 support. As Bitcoin consolidates around $110,000, the latest on-chain analysis suggests an exciting outlook despite the recent price struggles. Why Bitcoin Price Might Soon See Expansion In a QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, XWIN Research Japan, a crypto research institution, explores the possibility of a price reversal in the Bitcoin market, saying the current consolidation might be representative of asset-building momentum. The institution’s optimistic conjecture relies on readings obtained from three important on-chain metrics. Firstly, XWIN Research Japan highlights that there has been a sharp drop in Open Interest across futures exchanges since its peak established in September. For context, the open interest is the total number of outstanding futures or options contracts that have not been settled or closed. A sharp decline in open interest is usually indicative of events referred to as “leverage wipeouts,” where speculative positions are forced out of the market. Historically, a simultaneous decline in open interest alongside the cryptocurrency’s price has often led to market resets, which typically precede sustainable price rallies as a result of growing spot demand. Furthermore, the education and research institution references the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which tracks whether investors are predominantly selling at a profit or loss. The SOPR has reportedly found stability around 1.0, meaning that the majority of Bitcoin traders are trading around their cost basis. By extension, this points out that traders are neither in significant profits nor deep in losses. According to XWIN Research, this is a good sign that points to the end of the previous capitulation phase, and reflects the absorption of short-term holder supply by long-term holder demand. As all of these unfold underneath the surface, XWIN Research also postulates that liquidity might also be accumulating for the benefit of the flagship cryptocurrency. As reported by the institution, the total amount of the stablecoin ERC-20 in supply has reached an all-time high of approximately $158.8 billion. The crypto research institution speculates that if the market sentiment sees an improvement, as much as $158 billion in ERC-20 might be waiting on the sidelines to contribute upward pressure to Bitcoin’s price.

Technical and fundamental indicators now align to suggest a potential long-term breakout. ChartNerd’s latest Fibonacci analysis gives a detailed roadmap of where XRP could move next. ChartNerd’s Fibonacci Extension Targets Renowned market analyst ChartNerd shared a clear Fibonacci extension model on X, defining three crucial upside targets for XRP. According to his projection, the 1.272 extension aligns with $8, the 1.414 level targets $13, and the 1.618 extension points to $27. These price levels represent measured expansions from XRP’s long-term accumulation base. Each target reflects a calculated stage of momentum continuation. The Fibonacci model, a trusted tool in technical analysis, helps identify natural zones where trends extend or reverse. ChartNerd’s setup combines multi-year swing data and consistent structure, showing that XRP may be completing a long re-accumulation phase. $XRP holders.. FIB extension targets are as follows: 1) 1.272 = $8 2) 1.414 = $13 3) 1.618 = $27 Tieing up with recent developments and acquisitions, alongside vertical accumulation for 12months, FA and TA point to all of them being possibilities. #NFA — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 31, 2025 Current Price and Market Structure As of report time, XRP trades around $2.50. Daily trading volume stays robust above $2 billion, indicating sustained investor interest despite low volatility. The RSI sits near 45, a neutral region that indicates room for a potential upside swing. If XRP breaks above its local resistance, a larger impulse wave could begin to form. The $8 level, based on Fibonacci analysis, could serve as a key confirmation zone for a breakout. Further strength could push the asset to $13, while a full momentum expansion could test $27 over a longer horizon . Fundamental Catalysts Supporting the Bullish Setup Ripple’s ecosystem developments align strongly with ChartNerd’s bullish technical structure. The company launched RLUSD, its institutional stablecoin, in December 2024 to deepen liquidity within the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s acquisition of custody and payment infrastructure firms strengthens its institutional on-ramp strategy. Additionally, the XRPL EVM sidechain enables Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, opening new DeFi and liquidity opportunities. These advancements support long-term transactional demand for XRP and reinforce its position as a cross-border bridge asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On-Chain and Investor Sentiment Trends On-chain data shows steady accumulation by large holders over the past twelve months. Whale wallets continue to grow their positions, signaling confidence in the asset’s long-term value. However, daily active address counts have fluctuated, showing inconsistent network usage. A sustained increase in network activity would provide fundamental validation for a move toward higher Fibonacci targets. Risk Considerations and Market Caution While the setup is promising, risks remain significant. Any sharp decline in global liquidity could weaken momentum before confirmation. Regulatory pressure or reduced institutional inflows could also delay bullish projections. If XRP fails to hold key supports, the technical structure may lose credibility. A Conditional Yet Powerful Bull Case ChartNerd’s Fibonacci roadmap—$8, $13, and $27—offers a disciplined framework for tracking XRP’s next expansion phase. Ripple’s growing ecosystem, institutional focus, and stable liquidity base provide a credible foundation for this outlook. Still, these targets represent possibilities, not guarantees. Sustained volume, positive on-chain signals, and continued product adoption will decide whether XRP meets ChartNerd’s projections.

More tokens have moved into self-custody and exchange-held public wallets. BNB’s Ownership Profile According to YZi Labs’ latest data, roughly 66-67% of BNB’s total supply is held by public participants, including exchange users and those in self-custody wallets. Around 27% of the supply is controlled by the BNB Foundation, which maintains a burn reserve used for programmatic token burns, a mechanism designed to reduce supply and reinforce BNB’s deflationary model gradually. Meanwhile, Binance’s treasury accounts for about 4-5% of circulating BNB, which serves operational and custodial functions. Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao personally holds less than 1% of the total supply. YZi Labs held that the largest labeled wallets are primarily associated with burn, operational, or custody purposes, rather than control or speculative holdings. The firm said this distribution structure suggests that BNB has evolved into a broadly held, transparent asset, and a majority of its supply is managed through open, on-chain mechanisms rather than centralized ownership. In terms of its price action, BNB traded mostly between $1,000 and $1,300 over the past month, and faced significant volatility but maintained a generally sideways trend. The token started the month near $1,008, and rose sharply in the first half of October to reach an all-time high above $1,300. However, this rally was followed by a steady correction as prices declined toward the $1,050-$1,100 range. Even as BNB struggled to regain its earlier highs, the token’s exposure to US markets appears to be expanding as new financial instruments such as BNB digital asset treasuries (DATs), ETFs, and listings on major exchanges like Robinhood and Coinbase provide indirect access for US-based participants. These developments allow investors to gain exposure to BNB using fiat currencies without direct purchases. CZ’s Comeback In a related development, CZ was recently granted a “full and unconditional” pardon by US President Donald Trump, a move many industry observers believe could ease certain regulatory constraints for Binance tied to past US government cases. However, the pardon quickly sparked controversy. US Senator Elizabeth Warren labeled the decision as “corruption” and alleged that he had financed Trump-linked crypto ventures before seeking clemency.

Now, the ‘next SHIB’ could see such meteoric growth in the crypto market today. Of these, Pepe and Mutuum Finance are becoming the main focus for investors looking to catch the next big crypto. PEPE has seen a remarkable accumulation and is growing its holder base at a very impressive rate. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is better positioning itself as the best “next SHIB” candidate, for those in search of DeFi crypto utility combined with early-stage growth potential. Priced at only $0.035, MUTM is already creating serious FOMO in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 85% sold out and more than $18.35 million raised. While the dual-lending DeFi crypto model means both Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending are available for real financial utility besides the community-driven momentum, few tokens remain, making MUTM a favorite among investors keen to catch the next big crypto capable of combining hype with sustainable growth. Pepe (PEPE) Already Ran, Is It Still the Next Shiba Inu? With PEPE having already had its big run from its accumulation zones up to levels that most traders would consider late entry, currently, it consolidates in the 0.0000065–0.0000070 range. PEPE finds resistance at its former ascending trendline, and while the MACD has turned bullish, the majority of the upside move has already occurred. Even as it moves toward 0.0000077, the explosive growth that made SHIB legendary is probably behind it, which precludes PEPE from truly emulating the early-stage meteoric rise of SHIB. But for investors looking for early-stage growth potential with actual utility, the spotlight shifts to the position of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the next big crypto gaining serious momentum among traders searching for the DeFi crypto project with both value and innovation. Mutuum Finance Charges Ahead Mutuum Finance has become one of the most in-demand crypto projects since the multi-phase presale kicked off in 2025. Every stage of the presale so far has been very transparent about long-term potential to investors giving early adopters ample time to lock in huge value before the token ever hits open markets. Now in Phase 6, MUTM changes hands for $0.035, over triple its starting price of $0.01 in Phase 1, thus giving early contributors almost 3x returns. So far, the presale has generated $18.35 million from over 17,660 investors, with 85% of Phase 6 tokens already sold. During Phase 7, the token’s price increases another 20% to $0.04, reflecting continued strong demand in the market and confidence among investors. With such momentum, MUTM positions itself as the next big crypto and the most promising DeFi crypto project of 2025, offering considerable short-term upside while promising long-term stability. Of the 4 billion MUTM tokens, 1.76 billion are allocated to presale, with more than 760 million already sold in the previous rounds. Such steady accumulation, including large orders from institutional investors, underlines strong confidence in Mutuum Finance’s DeFi crypto model, built on utility and resilience rather than short-lived speculation. Stablecoin & Oracle Infrastructure The MUTM USD-pegged stablecoin, set to launch soon, will be fully backed by on-chain-verified collateral and will be launched once the V1 protocol goes live. This forms the very foundation of the lending ecosystem that Mutuum Finance has built, allowing for better liquidity, predictability, and ultimately, user confidence in the platform. Since the protocol links borrow and repayments against a stable underlying, exposure to market volatility is reduced, and users can more accurately predict their returns. High-performance oracle networks will provide real-time market data so that collateral, borrowing limits, and liquidation thresholds are correctly valued. Backup systems ensure reliability in case there is disruption to the data. With the integration of stablecoin technology and state-of-the-art oracles, Mutuum Finance stands at the edge of DeFi crypto innovation, enabling stability, transparency, and next-generation financial ecosystems to cater to institutional and retail participant needs. With more than 17,660 investors on board, Mutuum Finance has gathered over $18.35 million and already allocated 85% of Phase 6 tokens, a clear sign of immense demand in the early stages. Priced at an extremely affordable price of $0.035, MUTM offers one of the few opportunities to get exposure to the next big crypto before its full market launch. For investors looking for the next breakout altcoin with potential in both hype and utility, the time for action is now.

A recent high-profile dispute involves U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a well-known crypto critic, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. At the heart of this contention is Zhao’s conviction for money laundering charges, a fact Warren highlighted in a public post on X (formerly Twitter). This incident has ignited a debate about the boundaries of public discourse, especially when it concerns high-profile legal outcomes in the digital asset space, prompting many to question the responsibilities of public figures in relaying such sensitive information. What Sparked the Controversy Around Zhao’s Conviction? The controversy began when Senator Warren, known for her critical stance on cryptocurrencies and her advocacy for stronger financial regulations, shared a post on X asserting that Changpeng Zhao had pleaded guilty to money laundering. This statement, while seemingly straightforward and based on public records, quickly drew a sharp reaction from Zhao’s legal team. Zhao’s lawyers promptly threatened a defamation lawsuit against the senator. They demanded a retraction of the senator’s comment, arguing it was inaccurate or misleading. The core of their argument was that Warren’s statement allegedly misrepresented the facts or went beyond what was legally established, implying a potential harm to Zhao’s reputation. This challenge underscored the sensitive nature of public statements regarding legal proceedings, particularly when made by influential political figures. The incident quickly became a talking point, not just in legal circles but also within the broader crypto community, raising questions about freedom of speech versus potential defamation and the precise wording used when discussing such significant legal events. How Did Senator Warren’s Counsel Deliver a Crucial Defense? In response to the legal threat, Senator Warren’s counsel swiftly moved to defend her position, presenting a robust argument that stood firmly on the bedrock of public record. Their argument was clear and direct: the senator was merely stating publicly reported facts. They emphasized that Zhao had indeed pleaded guilty to money laundering charges and subsequently received a prison sentence. This defense hinges on the fundamental principle that information already in the public domain, especially official court records, can be freely cited and commented upon by public figures without fear of defamation. The counsel’s assertion highlighted several key points, establishing a strong legal foundation for Senator Warren’s statement: Public Record: They stressed that Zhao’s guilty plea and subsequent sentencing are undeniable matters of public record, accessible to anyone. Statement of Fact: Senator Warren’s post was presented as a factual summary of these established public events, not an opinion, an unsubstantiated claim, or a personal attack. No Defamation: By simply relaying verifiable and established facts, the counsel argued convincingly that no defamatory statement had been made, as truth is an absolute defense against defamation claims. This robust defense underscores the critical legal distinction between expressing an opinion and reporting a verifiable fact. The outcome of Zhao’s conviction has been extensively reported by numerous reputable news outlets globally, solidifying its status as a matter of widespread public knowledge and legitimate public interest. What Are the Broader Implications of Zhao’s Conviction for the Crypto Space? Beyond the immediate legal skirmish between Senator Warren and Changpeng Zhao, this episode carries significant and far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Zhao’s conviction and the subsequent public discourse surrounding it serve as a potent reminder of the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by digital asset platforms and their leaders across the globe. This case, involving one of the most prominent figures in crypto, sets a precedent for how legal transgressions will be handled and discussed publicly. This situation highlights several critical challenges and potential shifts that the crypto sector must acknowledge: Enhanced Regulatory Focus: Governments and financial watchdogs worldwide are intensifying their efforts to regulate the crypto sector, particularly concerning anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. The message is clear: the era of lax oversight is over. Accountability for Leadership: The legal action against high-profile figures like Zhao signals a new era of individual accountability for executives within the crypto space. Leaders are now expected to ensure their platforms operate within legal boundaries, facing personal consequences if they fail. Industry Reputation: Such high-profile cases can significantly impact public perception and trust in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. They fuel narratives about crypto’s association with illicit activities, making it harder for legitimate projects to gain mainstream acceptance. For crypto businesses and innovators, the actionable insight is clear: proactive and stringent adherence to legal and regulatory frameworks is no longer optional but an absolute necessity for long-term sustainability and credibility. Developing robust compliance programs, fostering transparency, and engaging constructively with regulators are paramount to navigating this evolving landscape successfully. This legal exchange underscores the intense scrutiny faced by the crypto industry and its leaders. Senator Warren’s counsel’s defense reinforces the principle that public figures can comment on publicly established facts, even those as significant as Zhao’s conviction . It’s a crucial reminder for all participants in the digital asset space: transparency, rigorous compliance, and adherence to legal frameworks are paramount for fostering trust and ensuring stability in the ever-evolving world of digital finance. The crypto world is maturing, and with that comes greater responsibility and accountability for all involved. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Imagine a single, powerful entity overseeing the entire crypto landscape across Europe. This is precisely what the European Commission (EC) is striving for, as it prepares a pivotal draft proposal to grant the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) enhanced crypto supervision powers. This move, reported by Cointelegraph, signals a bold step towards a more unified and competitive European crypto market. Why is Unified Crypto Supervision Crucial for Europe’s Future? Currently, the EU’s digital asset sector operates under a patchwork of national and regional regulators. This fragmented system creates hurdles for businesses and investors alike. Cross-border transactions often incur high costs and navigate complex, differing rules, which can stifle innovation and growth. The EC aims to streamline this process, making the EU’s capital markets more unified and competitive on a global scale. Think of it as mirroring the robust regulatory framework seen in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a central role. By empowering a single supervisory body like ESMA, the EU hopes to foster a more cohesive and efficient environment for digital finance. This move is not just about control; it’s about fostering growth and stability. A clear, consistent regulatory framework can boost investor confidence and attract more innovation to the European market. It promises to simplify compliance for crypto service providers operating across multiple member states, making the EU a more attractive hub for digital asset businesses. What Does ESMA’s Expanded Role in Crypto Supervision Entail? The forthcoming draft proposal, anticipated in December, outlines a broad expansion of ESMA’s jurisdiction. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a comprehensive overhaul designed to bring a wide array of crypto-related activities under a centralized umbrella. The goal is to ensure a consistent approach to crypto supervision across all member states. Specifically, ESMA’s new powers would extend to overseeing: Stock and Crypto Exchanges: Ensuring fair and transparent trading practices. Crypto Service Providers: Regulating companies offering services like custody, trading, and advisory. Other Trading Infrastructure: Covering the foundational systems that facilitate digital asset transactions. This consolidation under ESMA is a proactive step. It aims to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure that all major players in the digital asset space adhere to a consistent set of standards. This enhanced crypto supervision is vital for maintaining market integrity and protecting consumers from potential risks, ultimately building trust in the digital asset ecosystem. Navigating the Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for EU Crypto Supervision While the vision for unified crypto supervision is clear, the implementation will undoubtedly present its own set of challenges. Integrating diverse national regulations into a single, cohesive framework requires careful planning and coordination among member states. There may also be debates about balancing stringent oversight with fostering innovation in a rapidly evolving sector, ensuring that regulation does not stifle growth. However, the opportunities are substantial. A strong, centralized regulatory body can enhance investor protection by establishing clear rules against market manipulation and fraud. It can also create a more predictable operating environment for businesses, encouraging investment and growth within the EU’s digital economy. This initiative complements existing frameworks like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, aiming to create a truly comprehensive regulatory landscape. The ultimate goal is to build a robust, competitive, and secure digital financial ecosystem. By centralizing crypto supervision , the European Commission is signaling its commitment to being a leader in the global digital asset space, offering clarity and stability that many other regions still lack and paving the way for future innovation. The European Commission’s move to consolidate crypto supervision under ESMA marks a pivotal moment for the continent’s digital asset sector. This strategic shift aims to overcome current fragmentation, reduce operational costs, and significantly boost the EU’s competitiveness on the global stage. As the draft proposal approaches, the industry watches keenly, anticipating a future where a unified regulatory approach fosters both innovation and investor confidence across Europe. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is ESMA? ESMA stands for the European Securities and Markets Authority. It is an independent EU Authority that protects investors and promotes stable and orderly financial markets across the European Union. 2. Why is the EU Commission seeking to centralize crypto supervision? The EU Commission aims to unify fragmented capital markets, reduce cross-border transaction costs, boost competitiveness against regions like the US, and enhance investor protection by having a single, consistent regulatory body for crypto assets. 3. Which entities will fall under ESMA’s expanded jurisdiction? ESMA’s expanded jurisdiction is expected to cover stock and crypto exchanges, various crypto service providers (such as custodians and trading platforms), and other critical trading infrastructure within the EU. 4. When is the draft proposal for ESMA’s expanded powers expected to be released? The draft proposal is reportedly expected to be released in December, providing more detailed insights into the scope and implementation of these new supervisory powers. 5. How does this initiative relate to the MiCA regulation? This move complements the existing Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by further consolidating supervisory powers. While MiCA provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets, ESMA’s expanded role focuses on centralizing the oversight and enforcement of these rules, ensuring consistent application across the EU.

This analysis follows a turbulent price display over the past week during which Ethereum prices fell by 1.64%. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Crash Below $3,400 After Rejection From 0.618 Fibonacci Level Ethereum Traders Brace For Potential Sweep Before Reversal In an X post on November 1, Pillows shares data from Coinglass on the Ethereum liquidity heatmap, identifying significant resting liquidity on both sides of the current price action. Notably, the upper band, which lies between $3,900 and $4,200, represents a heavy concentration of limit orders as many traders are positioning themselves for potential selling activity once ETH revisits this area. Therefore, this price range acts as a major resistance zone critical for market bulls to reclaim in any potential push for a sustained uptrend. On the downside, there is also a notable liquidity cluster around $3,750 acting as a potential magnet for price and a key support area in a price crash situation. Looking at this setup, Ted Pillows postulated that Ethereum could be setting up for a liquidity sweep, a common pattern where price dips into an area of high liquidity to trigger stop losses and fill bids before reversing upward. If this scenario plays out, a short-term move toward $3,750 could precede a sharp rebound, potentially targeting the $3,900–$4,200 resistance region once more. With present market prices around $3,800, Ethereum could be eyeing a potential short-term gain of 10% gain but not without an initial correction and significant levels of long and short liquidations.

Despite this negative performance, blockchain analytics firm Sentora reports that ETH treasuries registered a net inflow of 550,000 ETH. Although this figure falls well below the 1.5 million ETH inflows observed in August, it remains significant, underscoring investors’ continued confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. At press time, Ethereum trades at $3,873, reflecting a minor 0.44% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 53.83% and valued at $17.57 billion.

Kyrgyzstan has made a bold move by establishing its first Kyrgyzstan digital asset bank , Bereket Bank. This initiative, inspired by a proposal from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), signals a strong commitment to embracing the digital economy. It also aims to attract crucial foreign investment and foster a thriving cryptocurrency sector within the nation. What is the Kyrgyzstan Digital Asset Bank and Why Does it Matter? Bereket Bank is not just any financial institution; it is a specialized digital asset bank. Its primary mission is to attract foreign capital and significantly develop Kyrgyzstan’s burgeoning cryptocurrency landscape. This strategic step positions Kyrgyzstan as a potential hub for digital finance across Central Asia. Furthermore, it highlights a forward-thinking approach to national economic diversification. The involvement of a prominent figure like CZ adds substantial weight to this project. Previously, Zhao had indicated that Kyrgyzstan was exploring the issuance of a national stablecoin based on BNB. This earlier statement underscores the nation’s ambitious digital agenda and its willingness to innovate in the financial space. How Will Bereket Bank Transform Kyrgyzstan’s Economy? The establishment of the Kyrgyzstan digital asset bank could unlock substantial economic benefits for the nation. By providing a regulated and secure environment for digital asset transactions, it aims to foster trust among international investors. This critical move is expected to lead to increased foreign direct investment and create new job opportunities, particularly within the growing technology sector. Moreover, by focusing on digital assets, Kyrgyzstan is actively tapping into a rapidly expanding global market. This strategy can help diversify its economy away from traditional industries. The bank’s operations are also anticipated to streamline cross-border digital transactions, enhancing efficiency crucial for modern international trade. Attracts Foreign Investment: Provides a secure, regulated gateway for digital capital, drawing global interest. Boosts Crypto Sector: Creates a robust ecosystem for blockchain innovation and development within the country. Economic Diversification: Reduces reliance on conventional industries, promoting a more resilient economy. Enhanced Financial Infrastructure: Modernizes banking services, adapting them for the digital age and future growth. What Are the Global Implications of Kyrgyzstan’s Digital Asset Bank? Kyrgyzstan’s proactive stance with its new Kyrgyzstan digital asset bank sets an interesting global precedent. It demonstrates how smaller nations can effectively leverage digital assets and blockchain technology for significant economic growth. This pioneering approach could inspire other countries to explore similar initiatives, fostering a wider adoption of digital finance. The global trend towards digital currencies and blockchain technology is undeniable. Nations worldwide are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of these innovations. Kyrgyzstan’s Bereket Bank contributes significantly to this evolving narrative, showcasing a practical and bold implementation of digital asset strategies. However, important considerations such as developing robust regulatory frameworks and adequate technological infrastructure remain vital for sustained success. Ultimately, this development could also influence how international bodies and financial institutions view and regulate digital assets. It highlights the growing need for adaptable, clear, and globally harmonized policies to govern the digital economy.

Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Bessent said the broader economy remains solid, but certain sectors are clearly struggling, with the housing market taking the hardest hit. Bessent explained that high mortgage rates had effectively frozen home sales, making it difficult for first-time buyers to afford homes. He said the Federal Reserve’s policies had created significant distributional problems, adding that low-income households were suffering the most because they tended to have debts rather than assets. Indeed, data from the National Association of Realtors show pending home sales were flat in September. Bessent warned that if rates remain elevated, they could easily spill over into construction, retail, and other job-rich industries that are directly tied to the real estate sector. Additionally, bond markets are also flashing warning signs, Bessent said. Yields on two-year Treasuries have fallen below the Fed’s benchmark rate – a classic signal that investors expect rate cuts soon. Easing inflation gives room for cuts According to Bessent, inflation has cooled down more than expected, which gives the Federal Reserve some new powers. According to government data, consumer prices rose by just about 3% year-over-year in September. This is the slowest growth rate in more than two years and is only one percentage point above the Fed’s target of 2.0. The prices for energy and food, which contributed to the surge in prices over the last few years, have stabilized, and inflation in core prices, that is, excluding the volatile items, continues to cool as well. Bessent said that, in his view, prices had already turned a corner and that keeping interest rates high was now doing more harm than good. He pointed out that the U.S. economy had clearly moved past the overheating phase and added that improvements in fiscal management provided another strong reason for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates. The deficit for the GDP has shrunk from 6.4% to 5.9% due to Trump’s spending cuts, indicating that the government is consuming less through borrowing. This, Bessent told CNN, reduces the pressure on prices and makes more room for a looser monetary stance. The CME FedWatch Tool’s futures pricing indicates that traders now expect a 70% chance of a rate cut by early 2026, up from 45% a month ago. Bond yields have also fallen significantly as investors start to believe that inflation is cool enough and that looser policy is no longer needed. Bessent joins the chorus of economists and markets that call for the Fed to shift gears. Fed Governor Stephen Miran, one of the two dissenting members, cautioned that keeping interest rates elevated for too long could alter the economy’s trajectory. He, along with a few other officials, had advocated for a 50-basis-point cut instead of the smaller 25-basis-point reduction that the central bank ultimately approved. Fed’s cautious stance faces growing pressure The Fed chair is pledging to hold off on further rate cuts this December, claiming that policymakers will need more proof of sustained disinflation before becoming more active. In the meantime, the stance is under attack by both the administration and the markets. Over the weeks to come, investors expect the Fed’s investment to be constrained, allowing rates to be cut more deeply in January 2026 if current circumstances persist. Economists argue that if the authorities postpone such cuts, it will exacerbate downturns in the housing sector and impede job development throughout other industries reliant on rates. Still, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has reiterated his support for a rate cut at the Fed’s December meeting. In an interview, Waller noted, “The biggest concern we have right now is the labor market,” he told Larry Kudlow on Fox Business Network. “We know inflation is going to come back down, so this is why I’m still advocating that we cut policy rates in December, because that’s what all the data is telling me to do.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-02 23:53:04

During the meeting, officials will leave rates unchanged at 3.6%, and RBA Governor Michele Bullock will refrain from guiding as the economic outlook becomes more unpredictable, sources close to the matter said. These expectations arise after a reliable survey highlighted that the Reserve Bank will maintain rates at 3.6% following the escalation of consumer prices that rose beyond earlier predictions. Additionally, overnight-indexed swaps, a type of financial derivative, suggested the likelihood of a suspension in rate changes, with the next possible cut not anticipated until May of next year. According to Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter, Reserve Bank of Australia staff are actively reviewing and analysing the latest economic trends as they prepare updated forecasts for the November Monetary Policy Statement (MPS). The RBA raises concerns about the persistent nature of inflation In a statement, Sam Konrad, an Investment Manager for the Asian Equity Income strategy in Singapore, mentioned that the RBA might find it difficult to reduce rates again soon, citing the latest inflation figures. “Looking at the Australian economy, there are mixed signals, so I don’t think there’s an urgent need to reduce rates further from here. They must ensure inflation stays under control,” Konrad added. This situation has raised controversy among individuals who are wondering about the country’s central bank’s final decision. To address these concerns, the final rate decision and official statement will be made public at 2:30 p.m. Sydney time on Tuesday, November 4, according to sources. At this time, investors remain alert to see if any board member opposes this expectation. These sources also suggested that the RBA would announce its quarterly economic prediction update at this time. About one hour after this announcement, Bullock is set to hold a press conference. Australia’s anticipated rate pause comes after the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to reduce its key rate for the second consecutive meeting. On the other hand, economists stressed that although markets were cautious about easing rates again in December, there are still strong odds that the US central bank may execute this decision as job growth slows down. In the meantime, the outlook for RBA policy changed drastically last week after core inflation surged by 1% in the third quarter. This percentage increases from a revised 0.7% in the previous three months. Interestingly, core prices reached the highest point of the RBA’s target range of 2-3% annually. Sources revealed that the increase in core inflation was extensive, confirming the central bank’s concerns that inflation, particularly in services, is becoming persistent. The Australian dollar secures the top position as the strongest leading currency In Australia, domestic demand is increasing due to tax reductions from the government and energy rebates introduced earlier this year, while the previous rate cuts implemented by the RBA are gradually affecting the economy. As a result, the Australian dollar was ranked as the strongest leading currency last week. This achievement comes as the currency gains popularity among investors, thanks to a tougher approach from the RBA, as well as improved risk appetite and reduced trade conflicts between the US and China, according to Alex Loo and Prashant Newnaha from TD Securities Ltd. Recent reports have also highlighted that credit growth and house prices are surging, indicating that financial conditions are not overly restrictive. However, Bullock noted that the current policies remain a bit restrictive. “The underlying momentum of inflation is much stronger than what the RBA anticipated,” stated George Tharenou from UBS AG. According to Tharenou, the main question is whether to delay the next rate cut or determine when rates will reach their lowest point. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is currently sitting at 42, signaling that fear continues to persist among investors, despite a slight uptick from yesterday’s reading. This critical barometer, provided by Alternative.me , offers a unique lens into market sentiment, helping us understand the collective emotional state driving crypto price movements. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is essential for any market participant. This index measures market sentiment on a clear scale from zero to 100. A score of zero indicates ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed.’ It’s a sophisticated tool that synthesizes various data points to give a comprehensive overview of investor psychology. The index is calculated using several key factors, each weighted to reflect its impact on market sentiment: Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin price volatility and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current market volume and momentum, comparing it with long-term averages. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans social media for relevant keywords and sentiment, tracking engagement. Surveys (15%): Gathers insights from weekly polls, though this component is currently paused. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often signals a flight to safety, indicating fear in altcoin markets. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search trends for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash,’ which can indicate fearful sentiment. Why Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Show Persistent Fear at 42? A reading of 42 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index firmly places the market in the ‘Fear’ category. While it’s a slight improvement from previous days, it clearly indicates that investors are still hesitant and cautious. This persistent fear can be attributed to several factors currently influencing the broader crypto landscape. Economic uncertainties, ongoing regulatory discussions, and recent price volatility across major cryptocurrencies often contribute to this sentiment. Consequently, many investors adopt a wait-and-see approach, leading to reduced trading activity and a general air of apprehension. This level of fear suggests that market participants are worried about potential further downturns. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Mean for Your Strategy? For astute investors, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a powerful strategic tool. The famous adage, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,’ perfectly encapsulates how to interpret these signals. When the index shows high fear, it often presents potential buying opportunities for those with a long-term vision. Conversely, when the index surges into ‘Extreme Greed,’ it might be a signal to exercise caution or even consider taking some profits. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is not a standalone predictor. It should always be used in conjunction with thorough research and a well-defined investment strategy. Relying solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index without understanding its nuances can be misleading. Navigating Crypto Market Sentiment with Confidence Understanding market sentiment is key to making informed decisions, and the index offers invaluable insight. By observing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , investors can better manage their emotional responses to market fluctuations. It helps to counteract impulsive decisions driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during greedy phases or panic selling during fearful times. A balanced perspective is always recommended. While the current ‘Fear’ reading might feel uncomfortable, it’s a natural part of market cycles. Use this data to refine your entry and exit points, but always prioritize your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a constant reminder to stay rational in an often irrational market. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains a vital indicator for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space. Its current reading of 42 confirms that a sense of fear still grips the market. While this might deter some, for others, it could signify a period of potential accumulation. Staying informed and understanding the underlying factors that contribute to market sentiment are paramount. By leveraging tools like this index, investors can strive for more disciplined and strategic participation in the dynamic world of crypto.

How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It’s calculated based on a weighted average of volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, surveys, Bitcoin’s market dominance, and Google search trends.

Instead, it’s an indicator of current market sentiment that can help investors make more informed, less emotional decisions, but it should be used with other analysis.

One such phenomenon that often captures the attention of traders and analysts alike is the CME Bitcoin futures gap . What exactly is this gap, and why does it matter to anyone involved in the crypto space? On a recent Monday, CME Bitcoin futures opened at $110,370, leaving a noticeable gap of approximately $490 from the previous Friday’s close of $109,880. This event, while common, sparks considerable discussion among market participants. Understanding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap: Why It Forms A CME Bitcoin futures gap emerges when there’s a difference between Friday’s closing price and Monday’s opening price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This unique situation arises because the CME’s traditional markets observe weekend closures. In stark contrast, the global Bitcoin spot market operates 24/7, without interruption. When the spot price experiences significant price movements over the weekend, it naturally creates a disconnect. This leads to a wider CME Bitcoin futures gap once the futures market reopens. Investors keenly observe these gaps, often anticipating whether the futures price will eventually “fill” or close this disparity. It’s a fascinating interplay between traditional market structures and the always-on nature of digital assets. Does the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Always Fill? What History Shows The concept of a “gap fill” is a popular theory in technical analysis. It suggests that prices tend to return to the level of a previous gap to close it. For the CME Bitcoin futures gap , historical data often shows a strong tendency for these gaps to be filled. However, it is crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Several factors can influence whether and when a gap might fill: Overall market sentiment: Bullish or bearish trends can accelerate or delay gap closure. Significant news events: Unexpected developments can push prices away from gap levels. Trading volume: High volume around the gap area can indicate strong conviction in a particular direction. Traders often use these gaps as potential entry or exit points, but always with careful risk management. It’s a strategic consideration, not a certainty. Strategies for Navigating the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap For active traders, the CME Bitcoin futures gap presents both opportunities and challenges. Understanding how to approach these situations can be vital for making informed decisions. Here are some common approaches: Gap Fill Trading: Some traders will bet on the gap filling, taking positions that anticipate the price returning to the previous close. This can involve shorting if the gap is up, or longing if the gap is down. Trend Following: If the gap occurs in the direction of a strong prevailing trend, some traders might see it as confirmation and continue to trade with the trend, rather than betting on a gap fill immediately. Risk Management: Regardless of the strategy, robust risk management is paramount. Setting stop-loss orders is essential to protect capital if the market moves unexpectedly. Market Context: Always consider the broader market conditions. Is Bitcoin in a bull run or a bear market? What are the macroeconomic factors at play? These can heavily influence the likelihood and timing of a gap fill. The CME Bitcoin futures gap is just one piece of the puzzle; it should be analyzed within a comprehensive trading strategy. The Broader Implications of the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap for Crypto Markets Beyond immediate trading opportunities, the CME Bitcoin futures gap offers insights into the evolving maturity and institutional interest in Bitcoin. The existence of these regulated futures markets, like CME, provides a bridge between traditional finance and the nascent crypto world. Institutional investors often prefer regulated products, and the activity on CME futures can reflect their sentiment. When a significant gap forms, it highlights the continuous, often volatile, nature of the underlying Bitcoin spot market, even when traditional markets are closed. This continuous price discovery contrasts sharply with traditional assets, offering a unique dynamic for investors to observe and potentially capitalize on. It underscores the global, 24/7 liquidity of Bitcoin, which is a key differentiator from conventional assets. Conclusion: Mastering the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap The recent $490 CME Bitcoin futures gap serves as a powerful reminder of the unique characteristics of the cryptocurrency market. While these gaps can create short-term trading opportunities, they also reflect the continuous, global nature of Bitcoin trading. Understanding their formation and historical tendencies is a valuable tool for any serious crypto investor or trader. Always remember to combine this insight with broader market analysis and sound risk management. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a CME Bitcoin futures gap? A: It’s the price difference between the CME Bitcoin futures’ Friday closing price and its Monday opening price, due to the spot market’s 24/7 operation versus CME’s weekend closure. Q2: Why do CME Bitcoin futures gaps occur? A: They happen because the Bitcoin spot market trades continuously over the weekend, while CME futures markets are closed. Significant price movements in the spot market during this period create the gap. Q3: Do all CME Bitcoin futures gaps get filled? A: Historically, many CME Bitcoin futures gaps have been filled, meaning the price eventually returns to close the gap. However, it’s not guaranteed, and some gaps may take a long time or never fill completely. Q4: How do traders use the CME Bitcoin futures gap? A: Traders often use the gap as a potential signal for future price movements, sometimes betting on a “gap fill.” However, it’s usually combined with other technical analysis and robust risk management. Q5: What was the recent CME Bitcoin futures gap mentioned in the article? A: The recent gap was approximately $490, with CME Bitcoin futures opening at $110,370 on Monday after closing at $109,880 on Friday. Found this article insightful?

This week, we’re tracking several significant token unlocks that could influence market dynamics. From November 3rd to November 9th, five major projects are set to release previously locked tokens into circulation. The largest of these involves a substantial $64.3 million worth of ENA tokens. These scheduled releases, as reported by Tokenomist, represent planned expansions of a project’s circulating supply. For investors, these moments often bring both opportunities and potential volatility. Let’s dive into the details of these upcoming token unlocks and what they might mean for your portfolio. Understanding Crucial Token Unlocks: What’s the Impact? You might be wondering, “What exactly are token unlocks ?” Simply put, they are pre-determined events where a portion of a cryptocurrency project’s total token supply, previously held back—often for early investors or team members—becomes available on the open market. This process is typically outlined in a project’s whitepaper and vesting schedule. The release of these tokens can significantly impact a token’s price. When a large volume enters the market, it can increase selling pressure, potentially leading to a price decrease if demand doesn’t keep pace. Conversely, strong project fundamentals and growing demand might absorb the new supply without significant negative impact. Monitoring these events is a key strategy for many traders and long-term holders. It allows them to anticipate potential market movements and adjust their investment strategies. Staying informed helps you stay ahead in the fast-paced crypto world. A Closer Look at This Week’s Major Token Unlocks Let’s break down the specific token unlocks scheduled for November 3rd to November 9th, providing a clear picture of what’s coming: November 3rd, 7:30 a.m. UTC: MEME will unlock 3.45 billion tokens, valued at approximately $5.32 million (5.98% of circulating supply). November 5th, 7:00 a.m. UTC: ENA is set to unlock a significant 172 million tokens, worth around $64.28 million (2.52% of circulating supply). This is the largest unlock by dollar value this week. November 6th, 4:00 p.m. UTC: RED will see 5.54 million tokens unlocked, valued at roughly $1.82 million (2.40% of circulating supply). November 9th, 12:00 a.m. UTC: BB has a scheduled unlock of 29.93 million tokens, amounting to about $3.12 million (3.85% of circulating supply). November 9th, 12:00 p.m. UTC: MOVE will release 50 million tokens, valued at approximately $3.45 million (1.82% of circulating supply). Each of these events adds to the dynamic nature of the crypto market, providing fresh supply for investors to consider. Navigating the Market: How to Approach Upcoming Token Unlocks? With these significant token unlocks on the horizon, what should investors consider? It’s not always a straightforward sell-off scenario. Here are some actionable insights: Research the Project: Understand the fundamentals of MEME, ENA, RED, BB, and MOVE. Is there strong development activity, growing user adoption, or positive news? A healthy ecosystem can better absorb new supply. Analyze the Vesting Schedule: A gradual, well-planned vesting schedule often signals a project committed to long-term growth. Consider Market Sentiment: Broader market trends can amplify or mitigate the impact. A bullish market might shrug off unlocks, while a bearish one could see heightened selling pressure. Don’t Panic Sell: While price drops are possible, not all unlocks lead to a crash. Long-term investors might view dips as buying opportunities for projects they believe in. Staying informed and maintaining a balanced perspective is key to navigating these events successfully. The impact of each token unlock can vary greatly depending on numerous factors. In conclusion, this week presents a series of noteworthy token unlocks that crypto enthusiasts and investors should keep on their radar. From the substantial ENA release to unlocks from MEME, RED, BB, and MOVE, these events highlight the continuous evolution of token economics within the digital asset space. While unlocks can introduce volatility, they are also a natural part of a project’s lifecycle, often signaling the maturation of early investments. By understanding the mechanics behind these unlocks and evaluating each project individually, you can make more informed decisions. The crypto market rewards those who are well-prepared and strategic. Keep an eye on these dates and consider how they fit into your overall investment thesis. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a token unlock in cryptocurrency? A token unlock is a pre-scheduled event where a portion of a cryptocurrency project’s total token supply, previously held in reserve or ‘locked’ for early investors, team members, or development, becomes available for trading on the open market. Q2: Why do projects implement token unlocks? Projects implement token unlocks as part of their vesting schedules to gradually release tokens over time. This helps manage supply, incentivize long-term holding by team and early investors, and fund ongoing development or ecosystem growth. Q3: How do token unlocks typically affect token prices? Token unlocks can introduce selling pressure, potentially leading to a price decrease if a large volume of new tokens enters the market without corresponding demand. However, the actual impact depends on market sentiment, project fundamentals, and the size of the unlock relative to circulating supply. Q4: What should investors do before a major token unlock? Investors should research the project’s fundamentals, analyze its vesting schedule, consider the broader market sentiment, and avoid panic selling. It’s crucial to make informed decisions based on a balanced perspective rather than reacting solely to the unlock event. Q5: Are all token unlocks negative for price? No, not all token unlocks are negative. While they can introduce volatility, a project with strong fundamentals, growing adoption, and a well-managed vesting schedule might absorb the new supply without significant negative impact, or even see renewed interest from new buyers.

They stated that Warren’s post about his money laundering case was accurate because official records support it. Warren’s lawyer, Ben Stafford, wrote to Zhao’s lawyer, Teresa Goody Guillén, and said Zhao “pleaded guilty to money laundering and was sentenced to prison.” Warren’s lawyers say her post about Zhao’s conviction told the truth Ben Stafford sent the letter, stating that there are public documents , court filings, and statements from the U.S. Department of Justice that support Warren’s post regarding Zhao’s conviction for money laundering. He explained that the Senator was doing her job as a U.S. lawmaker who oversees laws related to financial regulation and money laundering. Stafford reminded Zhao’s legal team that the Department of Justice publicly said Zhao’s actions violated our nation’s first and most comprehensive anti–money laundering statute. He argued that even if Zhao threatened to sue, the facts remain true, and Warren had every right to repeat them. The letter also cited the plea deal that Zhao signed in the case United States v. Changpeng Zhao (W.D. Wash. No. CR23-179) . Zhao admitted that he “willfully aided and abetted” the failure of his company to set up and follow proper anti–money laundering procedures. Stafford said the same government agency that prosecuted Zhao made these statements official, so Warren’s reference to Zhao’s case was in no way false or defamatory. The attorney went on to explain that Warren’s post on X was protected speech under both the Constitution and her duties as a lawmaker. He also said that even if her official immunity did not apply, Zhao would still have to prove “actual malice” to win such a case. But since several public records support her words, Zhao can’t really prove she acted with malice. He closed by saying that Zhao just wanted to intimidate a public official with threats. Stafford explained that his actions reveal a pattern of attempting to control the narrative surrounding his criminal case, rather than accepting responsibility. He also made it clear that Warren’s office will not be intimidated or silenced by legal threats from big players in the crypto industry. Zhao’s lawyers say Warren misstated the nature of his guilty plea The disagreement began on October 28, when Zhao’s lawyer, Teresa Goody Guillén, accused the senator of stating that Zhao “pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison” on X. She stated that they would file a defamation lawsuit because the senator’s words harmed Zhao’s image. She added that Zhao accepted responsibility for not enforcing anti–money laundering rules effectively, which was not the same as being personally involved in laundering money or financing illegal activities. Ben Stafford rejected this argument in his letter, stating that the offense Zhao admitted to under the Bank Secrecy Act is explicitly criminal, not civil or regulatory. He explained that it carries criminal penalties outlined in Section 5322 of Title 31 of the United States Code titled Criminal Penalties. Stafford said Warren only repeated what the Justice Department said when it made public the plea that Zhao made in November 2023 and called his actions “a criminal violation” of the Bank Secrecy Act. The claims that Guillén made could not hold up in court because the law itself said that Zhao’s offense was criminal and punishable by imprisonment.

This week’s Global Macroeconomic Calendar is packed with events that could significantly sway market sentiment, impacting everything from Bitcoin’s price action to altcoin volatility. Staying informed about these key financial events isn’t just about traditional markets; it’s about anticipating potential shifts that reverberate across the entire digital asset ecosystem. Let’s dive into what’s on the horizon. Why Does the Global Macroeconomic Calendar Influence Crypto? You might wonder why central bank speeches or employment data in the U.S. have a bearing on decentralized digital assets. The truth is, global economic health, interest rate policies, and inflation concerns directly affect investor risk appetite. When traditional markets face uncertainty or interest rates rise, investors often pull back from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a stable or expansionary economic outlook can encourage capital flow into digital assets. Therefore, closely monitoring the Global Macroeconomic Calendar provides a significant edge. This week presents several pivotal moments that could offer insights into the future direction of monetary policy and economic health. Understanding these events can help you make more informed decisions. Monday, November 4: Kicking Off with Fed Insights 11:35 a.m. UTC: FOMC member Michelle Bowman speaks. The week begins with insights from a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) member. Michelle Bowman’s remarks will be closely watched for hints on the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates, inflation, or the overall economy. Her perspective offers valuable context for market participants. It could influence dollar strength and, by extension, crypto market sentiment. Pay close attention to her tone. Tuesday, November 5: Unpacking US Employment Data 1:15 p.m. UTC: U.S. October ADP Non-Farm Employment Change. Employment data is a critical indicator of economic health. The ADP Non-Farm Employment Change report offers an early look at private sector job creation in the U.S. A stronger-than-expected report might signal a robust economy, potentially leading the Fed to maintain a hawkish stance on interest rates. Conversely, a weaker report could suggest economic slowdown, possibly leading to a more dovish outlook. Both scenarios can trigger significant market reactions, making this a key highlight on the Global Macroeconomic Calendar . Wednesday, November 6: Central Banks and Fed Voices in Focus Wednesday is particularly busy, featuring decisions and discussions from major central banks and top Fed officials. These events are often catalysts for market volatility. 12:00 p.m. UTC: Bank of England interest rate decision. The Bank of England’s (BoE) interest rate decision will impact the British Pound. It could have broader implications for global liquidity and risk appetite. While not directly U.S.-centric, major central bank actions contribute to the global financial environment that crypto markets operate within. A surprise move could ripple across continents. 4:00 p.m. UTC: U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Michael Barr and FOMC member John Williams speak. 8:30 p.m. UTC: Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller speaks. Multiple Fed officials speaking on the same day can create a confluence of opinions. Vice Chair Barr, along with FOMC members Williams and Governor Waller, will likely touch upon economic conditions, inflation, and monetary policy. Their collective comments will offer a comprehensive view of the Fed’s current thinking. Any divergence in their views or strong signals about future policy moves could cause significant market shifts. This makes it a pivotal day on the Global Macroeconomic Calendar for crypto traders. Thursday, November 7: Wrapping Up with More Fed Commentary 8:00 a.m. UTC: FOMC member John Williams speaks. The week concludes with another address from FOMC member John Williams. Following his previous remarks and those of other Fed officials, his second speech of the week might reiterate key messages or provide further clarification. Traders will be looking for consistency or any subtle shifts in the Fed’s communication. This final piece of the puzzle can help solidify market expectations for the near future. How Can You Navigate This Week’s Economic Landscape? Navigating a week filled with such important economic data requires a proactive approach. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor news feeds and reputable financial calendars for real-time updates on these events. Understand Impact: Research how specific economic indicators (like employment data or interest rates) have historically affected crypto markets. Risk Management: Be prepared for increased volatility around these announcement times. Consider adjusting your positions or setting stop-loss orders. Long-Term View: While short-term reactions are common, remember that the fundamental value proposition of many cryptocurrencies is not solely dependent on weekly macroeconomic shifts. The challenges lie in the unpredictability of market reactions. Even anticipated news can sometimes lead to unexpected price movements. However, by understanding the potential implications of each event on the Global Macroeconomic Calendar , you empower yourself to react more strategically.

The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index is a crucial indicator for any crypto investor. Right now, this widely watched index stands at 28, a number that offers significant insights into where the market’s momentum truly lies. Understanding what this score means can help you make more informed decisions about your portfolio, especially when considering the dynamic interplay between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 28 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, is a powerful tool designed to gauge the overall health and direction of the altcoin market relative to Bitcoin. It’s not just a random number; it’s a calculated metric that compares the price performance of Bitcoin against the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Notably, stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from this calculation to ensure a true reflection of speculative asset performance. So, how does it work? An official “altcoin season” is declared when a significant majority—specifically, 75% of these top 100 altcoins—outperform Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A score closer to 100 strongly signals that altcoins are broadly leading the market, indicating an altcoin season. Conversely, a score like 28, which is far from 100, suggests the opposite: we are currently in a “Bitcoin season.” This means Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, and most altcoins have struggled to keep pace. Why the Altcoin Season Index Matters for Your Crypto Portfolio A low Altcoin Season Index score, like the current 28, carries significant implications for investors. It tells us that capital is largely flowing into Bitcoin, or at least staying there, rather than rotating into altcoins for higher gains. For many investors, understanding this trend is vital because it often dictates which assets are likely to perform best in the short to medium term. During a Bitcoin season, Bitcoin tends to absorb market liquidity, sometimes even causing altcoins to decline in value relative to BTC. This market dynamic presents both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, investing heavily in altcoins during a Bitcoin season can lead to underperformance or even losses if Bitcoin continues its ascent. On the other hand, it can also signal potential entry points for savvy investors looking to accumulate promising altcoins at lower prices, anticipating a future shift. However, timing the market is notoriously difficult, and a prolonged Bitcoin dominance can test the patience of even the most experienced traders. Navigating a “Bitcoin Season”: Strategies for Success When the Altcoin Season Index is low, it’s a good time to re-evaluate your investment strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Bitcoin: Consider increasing your exposure to Bitcoin, as it typically acts as a safe haven and primary driver during these periods. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: If you’re still keen on altcoins, concentrate on projects with robust technology, strong development teams, and clear use cases. These are more likely to weather a downturn and recover strongly. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of making large lump-sum investments, consider DCA into your preferred altcoins. This strategy helps mitigate risk by spreading purchases over time, regardless of market fluctuations. Risk Management: This period is crucial for managing risk. Avoid over-leveraging or investing more than you can afford to lose, especially in highly volatile altcoins. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market sentiment, on-chain data, and global economic factors that could influence both Bitcoin and altcoins. Ultimately, a low Altcoin Season Index is a signal to exercise caution with altcoin-heavy portfolios and to potentially pivot towards assets demonstrating resilience and strength. For further insights into market trends, you might find CoinMarketCap’s Academy a valuable resource. Looking Ahead: When Could Altcoin Season Return? While the current Altcoin Season Index indicates Bitcoin’s dominance, the crypto market is cyclical. Altcoin seasons often follow periods of Bitcoin strength, especially after Bitcoin has achieved new all-time highs or experienced significant rallies. Several factors could signal a shift back towards altcoins: Bitcoin Stability: A period where Bitcoin’s price stabilizes after a strong run, allowing capital to flow into riskier, higher-potential altcoins. Major Altcoin Developments: Significant technological breakthroughs, successful mainnet launches, or widespread adoption of specific altcoin projects can trigger interest. Macroeconomic Shifts: Changes in global economic conditions, interest rates, or investor appetite for riskier assets can also influence capital flows. Monitoring these indicators, alongside the index itself, can help investors anticipate when the tides might turn. Remember, patience and strategic planning are your best allies in navigating these market cycles. The current Altcoin Season Index at 28 clearly indicates that Bitcoin is leading the charge in the cryptocurrency market. While this presents challenges for altcoin investors, it also offers opportunities for strategic positioning. By understanding how the index is calculated and what a low score implies, you can make more informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and potentially prepare for future market shifts. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always conduct your own research to navigate the fascinating world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps determine whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin. Q2: How is an altcoin season declared? A2: An altcoin season is declared when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90-day period. A score closer to 100 indicates a strong altcoin season. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 28 signify? A3: An index of 28 signifies that we are currently in a “Bitcoin season.” This means that Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of altcoins over the last 90 days, indicating Bitcoin’s dominance in the market. Q4: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A4: Not necessarily. A low index suggests caution with altcoin investments, but it can also present opportunities to accumulate strong projects at lower prices. It’s crucial to assess individual altcoin fundamentals and manage your risk. Q5: What factors could cause the Altcoin Season Index to rise? A5: The index could rise if Bitcoin’s price stabilizes after a rally, allowing capital to flow into altcoins, or due to significant developments within major altcoin projects, or favorable macroeconomic conditions that increase risk appetite. Q6: Where can I track the Altcoin Season Index? A6: You can typically track the Altcoin Season Index on cryptocurrency data platforms like CoinMarketCap, which provides real-time updates and historical data. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Every investor is always on the lookout for the next big crypto, an early-stage growth project with real utility and the ability to deliver huge returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast turning out to be that candidate. Priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has already raised more than $18.35 million, with over 85% of tokens sold thus far, which will no doubt further instill urgency among early investors. What really sets MUTM apart, however, is its dual-lending DeFi ecosystem, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending in a way that enables users to maximize capital efficiency while taking part in the most secure and scalable financial platform. According to analysts, such a structure and limited presale availability make MUTM the top crypto to buy for high upside in 2025, as it may eventually achieve 50x returns, similar to Solana’s rapid ascent, thus becoming the next big crypto opportunity in the market today. Solana (SOL) Tests Key Support Amid Downside Pressure Solana is down to about $183, consolidating around the 0.786 Fibonacci level, where buyers are protecting the lower boundary of its descending channel. It could be observed that the chart displays consistent lower highs, reflecting that downside pressure is still strong. If bulls hold this crucial zone and manage to drive the price higher beyond $190, a potential short-term rebound towards $197–$200 is possible. On the other hand, a valid break under $180 may lead to further downward movements toward $165–$170. Sentiment remains prudent for the moment, and the next few days will be crucial in determining whether the buyers would be able to take the upper hand. While investors pay close attention to support levels for SOL, some are now targeting emerging altcoins that have strong early-stage growth potential, such as Mutuum Finance’s MUTM, a promising alternative in pursuit of the next big crypto in the market. Mutuum Finance Reaches Major Milestones and Accelerates Toward New Frontiers Mutuum Finance remains among the fastest-growing crypto projects of 2025, with a record-breaking presale that has trended higher than expected. So far, the platform has concluded 5 successive funding rounds, reaching a total of $18.35 million from over 17,660 investors and solidifying its position as one of the top cryptos to buy and one of the most highly anticipated DeFi crypto launches of the year. Over 85% of Phase 6 has been sold, with MUTM at $0.035. There is still time for early investors to get in before the next round of presale brings the token price up by 20%. Among projects with great fundamentals and a growth spurt expected to last for a while, Mutuum Finance ranks high as the top crypto to buy before a possible 2026 bull run. Real Yield Opportunities Through Liquidity Staking MUTM holders can stake different assets, such as USDT, and receive steady APY returns based on trading volume. For instance, $75,000 at 12% APY could yield approximately $9,000 per year with automated compounding for increased returns. This predictable and yield-driven model places Mutuum Finance in a class of DeFi platforms that reward both short-term traders and long-term investors, setting it apart from speculative tokens and affirming its place as the next big crypto to watch. $100,000 Community Rewards Program Boosts Engagement To further ensure global participation, Mutuum Finance has announced a $100,000 giveaway , where ten participants will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Participating in the giveaway requires investors to invest at least $50 in the presale and complete several community tasks. This initiative reflects Mutuum Finance’s vision of building a value-aligned, active community. Combining active participation with economic incentives, the project builds a set of stakeholders, not merely investors, and paves the way for a more inclusive, sustainable DeFi ecosystem. At the time of writing, MUTM has raised upwards of $18.35 million from over 17,660 investors, with Phase 6 already more than 85% sold out at $0.035 per token. Early adopters still have a very short window to get in before prices increase in the next round of the presale. With its unique dual-lending DeFi ecosystem, predictable yield opportunities, and strong community incentives, MUTM blends real utility with high growth potential, making it the top crypto to buy in preparation for the 2025 bull run, and clearly positioning itself as the next big crypto for investors aiming for long-term success.

Investors Rotate to the Deflationary Noomez ($NNZ),https://timestabloid.com/litecoin-price-prediction-ltc-halving-hype-is-dead-investors-rotate/,"Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $100 , reflecting a cooling period after its post-halving momentum faded. Litecoin now struggles to regain volatility, showing a slower recovery curve across major exchanges. Analysts tracking the asset’s next cycle expect modest gains, with prices projected to rise gradually through 2025 and 2030. While LTC’s fundamentals remain intact, traders are increasingly shifting their focus toward Noomez ($NNZ) . A newly launched presale project combining deflationary supply mechanics, transparent on-chain tracking, and stage-based rewards that reintroduce excitement to the meme coin sector. Litecoin Price Prediction 2025 Analysts expect incremental gains driven by steady user adoption and consistent transaction throughput; however, the absence of innovation limits the short-term upside. Forecasts show: Minimum price: $98.81 Average price: $113.93 Maximum price: $128.81 Expected growth: +29.86% Litecoin continues to process over 150,000 transactions per day , maintaining strong network reliability and low transaction fees averaging just $0.02 per transfer . This efficiency reinforces its role as a trusted settlement layer for exchanges and remittance providers. Still, the market narrative around Litecoin has cooled. The halving event’s momentum has fully dissipated , and traders are shifting toward assets with stronger catalysts, such as presales introducing deflationary mechanics and measurable token burns. Compared to those dynamic models, LTC’s 2025 trajectory resembles a slow accumulation phase ; steady and secure, but unlikely to produce exponential gains. Litecoin Price Prediction 2030 By 2030, Litecoin may experience a more noticeable recovery, largely driven by network resilience and macroeconomic adoption. Market projections estimate: Minimum price: $208.62 Average price: $224.55 Maximum price: $245.80 ROI potential: +145.81% On-chain metrics reinforce Litecoin’s durability: daily active addresses averaged around 401,000 in 2024 , up from 366,000 in 2023. Meanwhile, transaction counts regularly exceed 170,000 per day , according to blockchain tracker data. Without fresh ecosystem upgrades or strong DeFi integration, LTC’s long-term trajectory may reflect a steady doubling in value , rather than an explosive breakout. Litecoin may reclaim more visibility by 2030, benefitting from institutional flows and cross-border payment adoption. However, in a market where clear mechanics drive speculative interest, many investors are turning to presale projects with built-in scarcity and verified tokenomics rather than relying on legacy networks alone. Litecoin vs Noomez ($NNZ): Stability vs Scarcity While Litecoin represents consistency, Noomez brings something different – measurable scarcity and on-chain verification. Where LTC offers safety, Noomez offers structure. Predictability vs. Performance: Litecoin’s predictable halving cycle generates short-lived interest. Noomez’s 28-stage presale, on the other hand, continuously reduces supply through real burns, creating sustainable demand pressure. Static Yield vs. Reward Systems: Litecoin’s fixed issuance offers no direct yield. Noomez integrates community rewards, a referral bonus, and stage-based incentives to encourage participation and retention. Transparency: The Noom Gauge publicly displays total funds raised, tokens sold, and progress per stage; a level of visibility absent from traditional legacy coins. Why Traders Are Turning to Noomez ($NNZ) The Noomez ($NNZ) presale officially entered Stage 2 yesterday as the token price increased from $0.00001 to $0.000012320 . This transition unlocked the 10% referral bonus , where both the referrer and buyer receive rewards. With each new stage, token scarcity intensifies, supported by scheduled burns and locked liquidity. Additionally, the Noom Gauge , a live on-chain tracker, visualizes every stage of progress, from total raised funds to holder count. Contracts are audited, liquidity is locked, and team wallets are vested, ensuring transparency from the start. And you can buy Noomez ($NNZ) directly on the official website before prices rise further in Stage 3. Pro Tip: Monitor the Noom Gauge to track stage progress and act quickly to potentially maximize token allocation and referral rewards.

The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly considering designating major players like Dunamu, the powerhouse behind the Upbit exchange, and Bithumb as crypto financial conglomerates . This move, if it materializes, would mark a pivotal shift in how virtual asset firms are viewed and regulated within the nation. What exactly does this mean for the burgeoning crypto market and its participants? Understanding the Designation of Crypto Financial Conglomerates Currently, South Korean law defines a financial conglomerate as a business group possessing assets of 5 trillion won (approximately $3.6 billion) or more, along with at least one financial company licensed by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Applying this framework to virtual asset operators like Dunamu and Bithumb would bring them under a new, stricter layer of oversight. Increased Scrutiny: Designated entities face enhanced supervision, including capital adequacy requirements and robust risk management protocols. Systemic Importance: Such a designation implies that these firms are deemed systemically important to the financial stability of the country. The potential classification as crypto financial conglomerates signals a growing recognition of the scale and influence of these digital asset giants within the economy. The Policy Paradox: Crypto Financial Conglomerates vs. Traditional Finance Here’s where the plot thickens. This consideration by the FTC directly challenges South Korea’s long-standing policy of maintaining a clear separation between the crypto and traditional financial sectors. For years, financial authorities have deliberately kept these two worlds apart. Why the separation? Risk Containment: The primary goal has been to prevent the inherent volatility and risks of the virtual asset market from spilling over into the broader, more stable financial system. Regulatory Clarity: It allowed for a cautious, step-by-step approach to crypto regulation without immediately integrating it into existing financial laws. However, the sheer growth of firms like Dunamu and Bithumb means their impact on the economy is undeniable, prompting the debate around their status as crypto financial conglomerates . What Are the Hurdles for Designating Crypto Financial Conglomerates? Implementing such a designation isn’t a simple flick of a switch. Critics argue that for Dunamu and Bithumb to be officially recognized as crypto financial conglomerates , fundamental changes to South Korea’s legal and regulatory framework would be essential. The existing laws were not designed with virtual asset companies in mind. Financial authorities have consistently voiced their concerns: Incorporating virtual assets into the institutional financial system could introduce systemic risk. There’s a need for a robust regulatory infrastructure specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of crypto assets. This suggests a complex legislative journey ahead, requiring careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks for all stakeholders. Implications for South Korea’s Crypto Landscape Should the FTC proceed with designating Dunamu and Bithumb as crypto financial conglomerates , the ripple effects would be significant. For the exchanges themselves, it would mean a new era of stringent compliance and oversight, potentially increasing operational costs but also lending greater legitimacy and trust. For investors, it could translate into: Enhanced consumer protection measures and clearer operational guidelines. Greater stability and transparency within the market, potentially attracting more institutional interest. Ultimately, this move could signify a broader trend towards integrating digital assets more deeply into the mainstream financial system, albeit with a cautious and regulated approach. The decision will undoubtedly set a precedent for future crypto finance regulation not just in South Korea but potentially globally, as nations grapple with how to manage large-scale crypto entities. A Pivotal Moment for Crypto Regulation The ongoing deliberation by South Korea’s FTC to potentially designate Dunamu and Bithumb as crypto financial conglomerates represents a crucial juncture for the nation’s digital asset industry. It highlights the growing tension between fostering innovation in the crypto space and safeguarding financial stability. While the path to such a designation is fraught with legal and policy challenges, the conversation itself underscores the increasing maturity and systemic importance of major crypto players. This development will be closely watched by regulators, investors, and industry participants worldwide as it could signal a new era of integrated, yet carefully controlled, crypto finance. Frequently Asked Questions About South Korea’s Crypto Regulation Q1: What does it mean for Dunamu and Bithumb to be designated as “crypto financial conglomerates”? A1: It means they would be officially recognized as systemically important financial entities, subject to stricter oversight, capital requirements, and risk management protocols similar to traditional financial institutions. Q2: Why is this designation considered controversial? A2: It contradicts South Korea’s long-standing policy of intentionally separating the volatile crypto market from the traditional financial system to prevent systemic risks. Q3: What are the current criteria for a business group to be designated as a financial conglomerate? A3: A business group must have assets of 5 trillion won (about $3.6 billion) or more and own at least one financial company licensed by the Financial Services Commission. Q4: What changes would be required for this designation to proceed? A4: Fundamental changes to South Korea’s existing legal and regulatory framework would be necessary, as current laws are not designed for virtual asset companies. Q5: How might this impact crypto investors in South Korea? A5: It could lead to enhanced consumer protection, greater market stability, and increased transparency, but also potentially stricter operational requirements for exchanges.

Imagine a future where investing in XRP is as straightforward as buying a traditional stock. Well, that future might be just around the corner, as a is expected to launch in the U.S. within the next two weeks. This groundbreaking news comes from Nate Geraci, CEO of Novadius Wealth Management, who believes this development could be a significant turning point for the entire digital asset space. What is a and Why Does it Matter? Many investors are eager to understand the significance of a . An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or in this case, a cryptocurrency like XRP. Crucially, a spot ETF means it directly holds the underlying asset, rather than futures contracts, offering a more direct exposure to the asset’s price movements. The introduction of a carries several compelling benefits: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors can gain exposure to XRP without the complexities of directly buying and securely storing the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies the investment process significantly. Regulatory Clarity: An ETF approval signals growing acceptance and regulatory comfort with the asset, which is vital for mainstream adoption. Institutional Adoption: It opens doors for large institutional investors, such as pension funds and wealth managers, who often prefer regulated investment products that fit within their existing frameworks. This direct exposure through a provides a more transparent and often more secure way for a broader audience to participate in XRP’s potential. The Road to a : A Regulatory Journey The path to a has been anything but smooth, especially given the challenging U.S. regulatory environment. For five long years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was locked in litigation with Ripple, the company behind XRP. This extensive legal battle, which concluded just three months ago, was a major hurdle for any XRP-related investment product. The resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple case proved to be a pivotal moment. A U.S. court ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to the public on exchanges, providing much-needed clarity. This legal precedent has undoubtedly paved the way for serious discussions and potential approvals around an XRP-backed investment product. Nate Geraci suggests that the launch of such an ETF could deliver a ‘final blow’ to regulators who have historically taken an anti-crypto stance. This sentiment highlights a potential shift in the regulatory tide, indicating a growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional financial structures. Impact and Implications: What Does a Mean for Crypto? The potential launch of a carries profound implications for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. What could this mean for your portfolio and the future of digital finance? Potential Price Action: Increased demand from both institutional and retail investors, who now have an easier access point, could lead to significant price movements for XRP. Enhanced Legitimacy: An ETF approval further legitimizes XRP as a mainstream asset class. This can attract more capital, talent, and innovation into the ecosystem. Market Maturation: This development signifies the maturing state of the crypto market. It mirrors the evolution seen in traditional finance with commodity ETFs, indicating that digital assets are steadily integrating into global financial systems. This development could unlock substantial capital flows, propelling XRP into a new era of adoption and recognition, and potentially influencing other altcoins awaiting similar regulatory clarity. Preparing for the Future: Navigating the Landscape As we stand on the cusp of this potential launch, what should investors consider regarding a ? A well-informed approach is always crucial in the dynamic crypto market. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements from the SEC and the asset managers involved. Dates and details can change rapidly. Understand Risks: While ETFs offer benefits like ease of access, all investments carry risks. Do your own thorough research and understand the underlying asset. Market Volatility: Be prepared for potential price volatility around the launch and in its initial trading period, as markets react to the news and new capital flows. Fees and Providers: Research different ETF providers and their associated fees to ensure you choose an option that aligns with your investment strategy. The arrival of a is undoubtedly a landmark event, but a measured and informed approach is always key to navigating the evolving digital asset landscape successfully. The anticipation surrounding a launch in the U.S. within weeks marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This potential development, coming on the heels of significant regulatory clarity for XRP, promises to enhance accessibility, attract institutional capital, and further legitimize digital assets. It represents a powerful step forward, potentially reshaping how investors engage with XRP and signaling a new chapter for crypto in the regulated financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Spot XRP ETF? A Spot XRP ETF is an investment fund that directly holds XRP, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price movements without having to buy and store XRP themselves. It trades on traditional stock exchanges. Q2: When is the Spot XRP ETF expected to launch? According to Nate Geraci, CEO of Novadius Wealth Management, a is expected to launch in the U.S. within the next two weeks. Q3: How does a Spot XRP ETF differ from a futures ETF? A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset (XRP), while a futures ETF holds futures contracts that bet on the future price of XRP. Spot ETFs generally offer more direct price exposure. Q4: What are the potential benefits of a Spot XRP ETF for investors? Key benefits include increased accessibility for traditional investors, potential for greater institutional adoption, and a signal of regulatory clarity and legitimacy for XRP as an asset class.

The BCC’s Insights Unit surveyed 4,638 firms, most of them small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and found that 84% of companies with 10 or fewer employees either receive too few export orders to make a difference or rarely engage in international trade. Bigger companies, which have more resources and well-established supply chains, are doing better: 42% of those with 250 or more employees have seen growth in their export orders. William Bain, the head of trade policy at the BCC, called the results “deeply worrying” and noted that the gap between small and big exporters is growing. The potential merits of new trade deals will not be realized unless small delegators receive more support. He added that a 25% improvement in UK exports could raise long-term GDP growth by 0.6%, but this would only be possible if smaller exporters were able to access new markets. However, the World Trade Organization recently supported such concerns. The report on the UK’s trade policy states that the country’s export contribution to GDP has returned to its pre-crisis level following the pandemic. Since Brexit, exports from the UK to the European Union have decreased by almost 30%, while the number of small enterprises that have ceased exporting to the bloc exceeds 16,000. Government signs trade deals, but small firms still struggle The UK government has struck a flurry of trade deals with countries such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, as well as holding talks with India, while renegotiating its digital trade agreement with the US. Despite the dispersal of such deals, the small firms they were intended to empower remain far removed from the debate. Bain, as well as the BCC and other business groups, argue that the government’s assistance is too concentrated and in dire need of modernization. Bain said that new trade deals were only as effective as a company’s capacity to apply them, warning that without government investment in trade education, digitisation, and local export advisers, small businesses would remain locked out. The Department for Business and Trade, however, refuted the claim, insisting that it was already taking action. The government has recently increased the lending limits of UK Export Finance from £60 billion to £80 billion, allowing small exporters to access affordable funding. The department said that encouraging exports was transformative for productivity, job creation, and economic growth. However, insiders revealed that it was making “across-the-board” cuts behind the scenes. According to a Financial Times survey, three private sources indicate that DBT reduced its labor by 20%. Many regional advisers who award one-on-one assistance to small firms were included in the reductions. Experts call for digital trade solutions and hands-on help Trade enthusiasts argue that the administration should streamline export processes and transition to digital trade systems . According to Chris Southworth, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce UK, Structural barriers are holding back growth among the smallest businesses. First among them is the paper-heavy, bureaucratic red tape that accompanied leaving the EU. Additionally, access to cheap trade credit and information about what red tape to expect in new markets will be crucial. Small businesses require digital systems, accurate cost forecasts, and assurance that goods will move through security. The BCC is calling for a “Trade Accelerator” to help us achieve this goal. Additional online training for exporters will be included in the proposal, along with a simplified customs system and specific grants for small companies seeking to cross borders for the first time. The group has advised the Chancellor to lay the blueprint in the following week’s Budget or risk losing global growth prospects. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

He added that the case is one of the most important in U.S. history and said he does not want to distract from the decision. The Supreme Court will hear two combined cases on November 5 that will question the President’s use of an emergency law to set global tariffs. The lawsuits say his actions went too far and even surpassed the limits of presidential power. Trump says tariffs make America great again Trump stated that he imposed tariffs to protect American workers and businesses from unfair competition from other countries that had taken advantage of the United States through unfavorable trade agreements for many years. He explained that the U.S. will only remain safe and powerful if it can use tariffs quickly and with full authority. But if that power is taken away from them, the economy will slowly fall behind those of other bidding countries. The President explained that the new agreements increased production in the United States and reduced the country’s dependence on essential goods. He said that without these tariffs, America will lose its bargaining power and one of the few tools that can quickly protect its economy in times of crisis or unfair treatment from foreign governments. The Oval Office leader said that if the Supreme Court rules against him, the decision could even push America to become a Third World country. He explained that all the country’s wealth and safety were tied to his ability to use the tariffs when necessary, so losing all that power could lead to years of decline. Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on November 2 and stated that he would not attend the Supreme Court hearing because he did not want to divert attention away from the significance of the case. He said the case should focus on the legal issues, rather than on him personally, because it was bigger than himself. Businesses and lawyers prepare for a historic Supreme Court battle The Supreme Court will decide whether President Donald Trump went too far when he used an emergency law from 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods. Congress created the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enable presidents to act quickly when the country faces threats from hostile foreign nations . However, Trump went overboard and applied the same law to both rival and ally nations, citing a desire to “protect national security and rebuild American industries.” The case consists of two separate lawsuits that American companies have filed against each other. Learning Resources, Inc. brought the first case, stating that they struggled to produce and sell affordable learning tools because the tariffs increased the cost of materials and manufacturing. V.O.S. Selections, Inc. brought the second case and stated that they had to increase their charges for liquor products because the tariffs had significantly increased importation costs. Both companies argued that the tariffs are illegal because Trump’s actions contravened the Constitution’s separation of powers. Jeffrey Schwab is the lead lawyer representing V.O.S. Selections and the interim director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center. He said his team will show the Supreme Court that the IEEPA law was intended only to address serious threats, such as terrorism or financial attacks, not to set everyday trade policies. He added that the White House could gain too much power and the role of Congress could weaken if a president could use emergency laws to impose tariffs at will. Many legal experts and economists oppose Trump, but the president claims that his policies have strengthened America economically and strategically.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.2581 Market Cap $419.85M Trading Volume $11.59M Circulating Supply 1.618B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.157 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2716 24-hour Low $0.2601 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.81% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.3312 14-Day RSI 37.67 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 37 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.3812 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is down 3.73%, trading at $0.258 after rejection at $0.27. Bears dominate, but oversold signals hint at a possible pause in selling. Flow coin 1-day price analysis As of November 3, Flow (FLOW) is trading at $0.258, down 3.73%, as the token faces renewed selling pressure after failing to sustain above the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.271. The upper band around $0.284 remains a tough ceiling, while the lower band near $0.257 now acts as immediate support, which is currently being tested. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI at 36.90 indicates bearish dominance but is inching toward oversold territory, suggesting that downside pressure may soon ease. Meanwhile, the MACD shows a mildly negative bias, with the MACD line at -0.017 and the signal line at -0.019, signaling weak momentum and limited buyer confidence. If FLOW holds above $0.257, a rebound toward $0.27 is possible, but breaking below $0.255 could invite further declines toward $0.245. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOW has retraced sharply after briefly testing $0.27, sliding back to $0.258. The Alligator indicator shows compressed lines around $0.265, implying a loss of trend direction and potential consolidation ahead. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI sits at 48.14, indicating near-neutral momentum but leaning bearish as it trends downward. This suggests that unless FLOW reclaims $0.265, sellers may continue to pressure prices lower. The structure shows a fragile short-term setup, with potential retests of the $0.257–$0.255 zone before any recovery attempt. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3162 SELL SMA 5 $0.2942 SELL SMA 10 $0.2843 SELL SMA 21 $0.2816 SELL SMA 50 $0.3312 SELL SMA 100 $0.3615 SELL SMA 200 $0.3812 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2974 SELL EMA 5 $0.3199 SELL EMA 10 $0.3494 SELL EMA 21 $0.3691 SELL EMA 50 $0.3773 SELL EMA 100 $0.3840 SELL EMA 200 $0.4233 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW remains under mild selling pressure, with $0.257 acting as a crucial pivot zone. A breakdown here could accelerate losses toward $0.245, while a bounce above $0.27 would signal early recovery momentum. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow Forte goes live on Flow. Forte is live on Flow.

BTC could continue to move down if it stays below the $110,000 resistance. Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $109,500 support. The price is trading below $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $109,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it trades below the $107,400 zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Rejection Bitcoin price failed to stay above the $110,500 pivot level and started a fresh decline . BTC dipped below $110,000 and $109,500 to enter a bearish zone. The decline was such that the price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $106,312 swing low to the $111,000 high. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $109,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading below $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . If the bulls attempt a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $109,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $109,800 level and the trend line. The next resistance could be $110,500. A close above the $110,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $111,200 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $113,500 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $115,000 and $115,500. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $109,800 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support is near the $107,400 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $106,312 swing low to the $111,000 high. The first major support is near the $106,500 level. The next support is now near the $105,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $104,200 support in the near term. The main support sits at $103,500, below which BTC might struggle to recover in the short term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $107,400, followed by $106,500.

The blockchain also leads in smart contracts and decentralized finance, as its network is still a place where many developers and institutions build upon. The Ethereum price debate is now about real-world adoption and efficiency of the network, not hype. Scaling upgrades, staking growth, and new Layer 2 solutions will continue to help maintain dominance as rivals rise. Meanwhile, Remittix(RTX) , a fast-growing DeFi project inspired by Ethereum’s model, is turning blockchain innovation into practical payment solutions — bridging crypto directly to traditional finance in ways that showcase where the next phase of adoption is heading. Ethereum Price Prediction and Market Overview Ethereum is selling at $3,859.62, a significant drop by 0.04% in the last 24 hours with market capitalization of $467.08 billion, while the daily trading volume is about $20.04 billion, which is a 28.84% drop. According to analysts, though the main chain is not as active as in the early parts of 2024, staking demand, low gas fee Layer 2 networks, and institutional adoption are still driving ETH’s long-term confidence. Debate on Ethereum price prediction spans wide targets, with some targeting ETH revisiting $1,000 under strong correction pressure and others seeing $5,000 or even $100,000 coming into the next cycle. Remittix Bridges Crypto and Real-World Payments Where Ethereum built the foundation for DeFi, Remittix is focusing on turning that innovation into practical use. The project has already raised $27.8 million in private funding, showing clear demand for its PayFi model — a payment bridge that allows crypto transfers directly into bank accounts across 30+ countries. Priced at $0.1166 per token, Remittix is rapidly building credibility. The team is fully verified by CertiK and currently ranked #1 globally for pre-launch tokens, a rare distinction that signals strong security and technical validation. The Remittix wallet beta is also being expanded to include more iOS users, allowing community members to test and improve the upcoming release. Beyond security and wallet testing, the project’s roadmap includes future listings on BitMart and LBank, which are set to bring greater accessibility and liquidity. How Remittix Is Transforming Crypto Utility Trends: Verified and ranked #1 by CertiK for pre-launch tokens Raised $27.8 million+ in private funding for its PayFi solution Offers direct crypto-to-bank transfers across global markets Expanding beta wallet testing for real-world application Ongoing $250,000 community giveaway and 50% bonus promo A New Phase for Real Utility Tokens As Ethereum continues refining its scaling and DeFi infrastructure, Remittix represents the next generation of practical blockchain projects built for mainstream users. The Remittix DeFi project combines Ethereum’s technological reliability with a service model focused on instant cross-border payments — a $19 trillion market waiting for disruption. Its focus on transparency, real-world use, and certified security sets it apart in an increasingly crowded space. Whether Ethereum reaches $5,000 or more, the emergence of projects like Remittix shows where blockchain’s future growth is truly heading — toward usability, trust, and global adoption.

Drawing from a conversation he once had with Ripple CTO David Schwartz, he said he asked whether “there’s value in being differentiated,” and Schwartz’s immediate reply was “Absolutely.” Vet explained that this moment reinforced his belief that the XRPL’s design stands apart from most other blockchains because it stays true to the principle of independence. I remember at XRP Vegas, right before i went on stage with David Schwartz. We talked about the XRP Ledger and i asked him, if there's value in being differentiated. He enthusiastically nodded and replied ""Absolutely!"" Opposed to other people views, the XRPL is the last chain… — Vet (@Vet_X0) November 1, 2025 A Network Built on Independence Vet emphasized that the XRPL remains one of the few blockchains still faithful to the original “ be your own bank ” concept. His remarks highlighted how the network’s structure prioritizes autonomy over dependence on intermediaries. In his view, the XRPL allows users to operate “without relying on others,” maintaining control over their assets and transactions. This independence has always been at the core of blockchain’s purpose, but according to Vet, many newer networks have drifted toward centralization through layers of governance and complex incentives. Unlike platforms that introduce high infrastructure costs or impose transaction taxes through built-in token mechanics, the XRPL is designed for accessibility. Running a node remains relatively inexpensive, ensuring that participation in the network is not limited to a small group of entities. Freedom from Protocol Control In his post, Vet described how other blockchains often rely on mechanisms that function like hidden taxes. These can take the form of staking rewards, validator incentives, or other systems that indirectly direct value toward centralized participants. By contrast, the XRPL’s model avoids such structures. It focuses instead on efficiency, minimal fees, and the ability for anyone to interact directly with the ledger without permission or protocol-level barriers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For Vet, this distinction speaks to the network’s philosophical foundation, a commitment to ensuring that users retain full control . He compared the XRPL’s approach to an “eBay without eBay,” meaning a marketplace that operates entirely without a central authority. The Power of Differentiation Vet concluded his message by returning to the question he posed to Schwartz. The XRPL’s differences, once seen by some as limitations, now represent its greatest strength. It is not another smart contract chain competing in a crowded field, but occupies a distinct space where utility is a priority . Vet noted, “If you want these things, then there is only the XRPL.” In a market saturated with lookalike technologies, the XRPL’s identity is defined by what it does not imitate. Its value, as both Vet and Schwartz agreed, lies in being different and in staying that way. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This collaboration aligns with Bitget’s UEX framework, a unified ecosystem connecting centralized trading, decentralized liquidity, and tokenized instruments within one interoperable platform. By combining Fasanara’s quantitative investment approach with Bitget’s trading infrastructure and onchain execution layer, the partnership represents a step toward a more fluid, technology-powered global capital network. “Fasanara has been at the forefront of redefining how institutional capital interacts with innovation,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget . “This partnership reflects the growing convergence between traditional asset management and blockchain infrastructure. Together, we’re building new pathways for liquidity, tokenization, and global market access — shaping how finance will look like the decade ahead.” “At Fasanara, we see blockchain and tokenization as key enablers for the next evolution of financial markets,” said Alessandro Balata, Portfolio Manager, Fasanara Digital . “Partnering with Bitget allows us to combine institutional-grade investment strategies with a high-performance exchange ecosystem.

The price is now showing bearish signs and is at risk of another decline in the near term. XRP price failed to continue higher above $2.550 and corrected some gains. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above $2.410. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price formed a short-term top near $2.550 and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.520 and $2.50 levels. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2.377 swing low to the $2.552 high. The price even spiked below $2.42 but remained stable above $2.40. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.480 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance and the trend line. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.720. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.580 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.410 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2.377 swing low to the $2.552 high. The next major support is near the $2.380 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.380 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.320. The next major support sits near the $2.250 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.20. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

At the same time, CZ’s legal team clashed with US Senator Elizabeth Warren’s lawyer over claims she defamed him in a post criticizing Donald Trump’s pardon. Warren’s attorney dismissed the threat of legal action by insisting her comments were factual and based on Zhao’s guilty plea for failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. CZ Sparks Aster Rally The native token of the decentralized exchange protocol Aster surged by more than 30% on Sunday after Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao revealed that he personally purchased over $2.5 million worth of the asset. CZ shared the news on X by disclosing his wallet holdings and stating that he “bought some Aster today, using my own money on Binance.” He also explained that he is not an active trader, “I buy and hold.” The post immediately fueled excitement across the market, and propelled Aster’s price from $0.91 to a peak of $1.26, before stabilizing around $1.11 at press time. The sudden price spike mirrored similar reactions seen in the market recently, like when privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash jumped 30% after an endorsement from crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes. For Aster, CZ’s endorsement triggered a big surge in activity, with data from DefiLlama showing its trading volume skyrocketing from $224 million to over $2 billion within 24 hours. The project’s market cap also climbed sharply from $1.8 billion to over $2.5 billion. The move attracted widespread attention across crypto circles as traders rushed to follow CZ’s lead. A user known as “Gold” on X announced they opened a position in Aster shortly after the post, calling it a rare and significant event. “CZ, the most influential figure in crypto and creator of the largest platform in crypto, announced his purchase of ASTER with personal funds. That’s it. Don’t overthink it,” they wrote. However, CZ later commented that he hoped to buy more tokens at lower prices, and added that he rarely invests in tokens other than Aster and BNB, which he purchased eight years ago and still holds. Despite the enthusiasm, some large investors are betting against the rally. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reported that two whales opened big short positions on Aster, with one holding 42.97 million tokens worth $52.8 million and another shorting 15.3 million tokens valued at $19.1 million. Both traders have liquidation prices just above $2, suggesting they expect Aster’s rally to reverse. CZ’s connection to Aster dates back to earlier projects. His family office, YZi Labs invested in Aster’s predecessor, Astherus, before it merged with decentralized perpetuals platform APX Finance in late 2024 to form Aster. Although CZ previously congratulated the team on X and encouraged them to “keep building,” his exact level of involvement is still a bit unclear. Warren Rejects CZ’s Defamation Threat Meanwhile, a lawyer representing US Senator Elizabeth Warren rejected claims that she defamed Changpeng “CZ” Zhao in a social media post after his pardon by President Donald Trump. The dispute centers on an Oct. 23 X post in which Warren criticized Trump’s decision by saying Zhao “pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison.” Zhao’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén, accused Warren of spreading false and defamatory statements, and demanded she retract the post or face legal action. In response, Warren’s lawyer Ben Stafford said any defamation claim “would be without merit,” and argued that Warren’s comments were factually accurate and based on publicly available information. He pointed out that Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance, a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, for which he served a four-month prison sentence. Stafford explained that Warren’s post “is true in all respects” and “accurately represented widely reported facts,” pointing out that a public figure like Zhao could not succeed in a defamation case without proving “actual malice.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren Warren’s post also alleged that Zhao “financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon,” which attracted some attention to Binance’s reported ties to Trump’s family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg both reported that Binance played a role in creating the group’s stablecoin, USD1, which was later used in a $2 billion deal involving Emirati state-owned investment firm MGX’s purchase of a stake in Binance. Politico later reported that Zhao’s pardon came after Binance and its legal team spent months lobbying key figures in Trump’s circle. In a letter seen by the New York Post , Goody Guillén said Zhao “will not remain silent while a United States Senator seemingly misuses the office to repeatedly publish defamatory statements that impugn his reputation.” She demanded that Warren retract statements in both her social media post and a related Senate resolution criticizing Trump’s pardon, and threatened to “pursue all legal remedies” if she failed to comply.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-03 05:30:00

He emphasized that he is not a trader but a long-term holder, consistent with his past investment approach. In a post on X, CZ shared a snapshot of his cryptocurrency wallet, showing his Aster holdings . “I am not a trader. I buy and hold,” he wrote, adding that the purchase was made on Binance using his personal money. Shortly after the disclosure, the price of the Aster token jumped more than 30% from $0.91 to $1.26 after the post and later settled at about $1.22. The market value for the token also increased from $1.8 billion to over $2.5 billion, and its daily trading volume increased from $224 million to more than $2 billion. CZ buys Aster with his own money and raises its prices Following CZ’s move, traders immediately started buying the Aster token because they looked up to Zhao, and his comments instilled trust in the project. One trader on X, known as “Gold,” even said it was a big moment for the market because CZ had never bought a token outside of BNB by Binance before. Gold wrote, “CZ, the most influential figure in crypto and creator of the largest platform in crypto, announced his purchase of ASTER with personal funds. That’s it. Don’t overthink it.” However, it’s not the first time such news has affected a token’s price, as famous or trusted individuals can make comments that convince other traders to buy as well. Before CZ bought Aster, for example, Arthur Hayes said the price of Zcash could be very high in the future. His opinion made many people buy the token, and its price even increased by 30%. Zhao did not expect so many people to buy Aster immediately after his post because he posted again and said, “damn, I was hoping to buy some more at low prices.” Aster, a decentralized exchange protocol that focuses on cross-chain trading and liquidity solutions, has been gaining traction among decentralized finance (DeFi) users. However, the project’s fundamentals remain under scrutiny. Big investors bet against Aster as Zhao’s connection to the token attracts attention Some whales think the excitement behind the rise in Aster’s price will fade, so they acted quickly to profit if the price falls. Two of these whales borrowed tokens to sell and buy back later at a lower price if the cost drops, a strategy called shorting. One of the whales built a short position worth $52.8 million and held almost 43 million Aster tokens, while the other created a $19.1 with a liquidation price near $2. People also began asking questions about Zhao’s involvement in Aster following his significant announcement. It was later reported that the CZ’s family office, YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs), invested in Aster when it was Astherus before partnering with APX Finance in late 2024 to become Aster. Traders began to suggest that there was more to Zhao’s investment than met the eye. A representative from BNB Chain said both BNB Chain and YZi Labs supported Aster. However, they did not say if CZ worked on the project himself or had influence over the decisions made. Some traders believe Zhao stands to gain significantly more than what is being announced from this investment and has been aware of it for a long time, while others consider it a normal investment. For now, Aster needs to demonstrate that it can grow independently and without Zhao’s support to maintain the trust of traders and investors. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Saylor shared the phrase “November's color is orange” on the X platform. This statement was linked to the large Bitcoin purchases that followed similar posts in the past. Historical data shows that MicroStrategy typically announces new acquisitions within days of such “Saylor Tracker” announcements. A new BTC acquisition announcement could be made tomorrow.

On-chain data from Lookonchain shows that BitcoinOG (1011short) has deposited about 13,000 BTC worth $1.48b to Kraken since Oct. 1, while early adopter Owen Gunden has transferred 3,265 BTC worth $364.5m to Kraken since Oct. 21. The timing of these transfers, which comes as Bitcoin trades near $108,000, has sparked speculation about potential profit-taking or short positioning by long-time holders. Analysts caution that deposits do not confirm immediate sales, but often precede heightened market activity and volatility. Pseudonymous Whale Appears to Revive Bearish Bets With New Deposits BitcoinOG (1011short) is a pseudonymous whale known for shorting Bitcoin during major market swings. The entity gained notoriety after timing the Oct. 11 crash, reportedly earning nearly $197m in profits by closing large short positions. Bitcoin OGs are dumping $BTC ! BitcoinOG(1011short) has deposited ~13K $BTC ($1.48B) to Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, and Hyperliquid since Oct 1. Owen Gunden has deposited 3,265 $BTC ($364.5M) to Kraken since Oct 21. https://t.co/qyZllJWfFS https://t.co/u3b8zn5iYe pic.twitter.com/qQe3dYlnfp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 3, 2025 Since then, the wallet cluster linked to “1011short” has consistently sent BTC to exchanges like Kraken, Binance, Coinbase and Hyperliquid, suggesting preparation for leveraged trades or liquidation. Recent transfers include 500 BTC ($55m) to Kraken on Nov. 2, alongside several smaller deposits ranging between 70 and 150 BTC to Hyperliquid. On-chain analysts say this pattern mirrors previous cycles where the trader built short exposure following market rebounds. Veteran Bitcoin Whale Reactivates Wallet as Market Stabilizes Near $110K Owen Gunden, a well-known Satoshi-era holder, has also become active again after years of relative dormancy. Between Oct. 21 and Nov. 3, he transferred 3,265 BTC ($364.5m) to Kraken in multiple batches. These transactions include 364 BTC on Oct. 22, 1,448 BTC on Oct. 29 and 483 BTC on Nov. 3. Gunden, an early investor who reportedly amassed over 15,000 BTC during Bitcoin’s early years, has long been viewed as a symbolic “true OG” — someone who held through multiple cycles. His recent deposits, however, mark one of his largest exchange inflows in years, hinting at either partial profit realization or portfolio rebalancing. Arkham data shows that several of Gunden’s wallets, containing decade-old coins, have been reactivated since late October. The movements coincide with Bitcoin’s price consolidation around the $110,000–$115,000 range after a volatile October marked by leveraged liquidations and shifting rate expectations. Traders Weigh Whether Whale Deposits Signal Sales or Strategic Repositioning Analysts describe the overall mood as cautious. Whale inflows of this size typically signal increased supply and can precede sharp price swings, especially when liquidity thins. For traders, the key question is whether these deposits translate into outright sales or remain dormant on exchanges. Historically, inflows from high-profile OG wallets often spark short-term corrections of 5% to 10%, followed by renewed accumulation once selling pressure fades.

He also said the bank aims to attract large foreign investments and focus on virtual assets. The head of state stressed that the bank is a private business project that is expected to attract significant investment into the country. He also confirmed that neither the government nor his family will be involved in the bank’s operations. Japarov denies any ties of his family to Bereket Bank 🇰🇬 President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov chaired the second meeting of the National Council on the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies The session was attended by #Binance founder Changpeng Zhao ( CZ ) @cz_binance President Japarov emphasized that… pic.twitter.com/ajSgXGG1dT — AB 🔶 BNB (@Abrlien) October 24, 2025 He responded to questions about previous reports claiming that former Jogorku Kenesh Speaker Marat Sultanov and his son, Nurdoolot Nurgozhoev, were among the founders of Bereket Bank. Japarov said that he urges his family members to engage in business, start production, and attract investors to the country. He also added that none of his family members wishes to take part in government affairs in the future. Japarov maintained that all his family members are engaged in private business that attracts investors to Kyrgyzstan. He also alleged that it would sound like self-promotion for his family if he were to list all the investors his relatives have brought in and all the projects they’re implementing. “Do not move your capital abroad; on the contrary, bring it into the country.” – Sadyr Japarov , President of Kyrgyzstan. The head of state promised to reveal in detail what his brothers have been doing, the projects Rustam has carried out, and the amount of investment they have brought into the country once his presidential term comes to an end. Japarov argued that the whole world is currently moving toward virtual assets. He also confirmed that he had suggested to Zhao that Bereket Bank be made a state bank, but CZ said he doesn’t want to participate in a government project. The President and CZ later agreed to open a private bank once his initiative to create a state bank was not supported. Japarov said he appointed Marat Sultanov to handle organizational matters, as he was an experienced banker. According to the report, CZ and Sultanov proposed that Nurdoolot also participate in the project, which the President later agreed to after some consideration. Japarov also acknowledged that Kyrgyzstan has established friendly relations with CZ. He also said CZ sees interest in the country since it’s developing and has an uncompromising fight against corruption and organized crime. CZ signed an agreement with the country’s National Investment Agency in April and pledged to cooperate with the government in cryptocurrency and blockchain development in Kyrgyzstan. The President argued that CZ doesn’t visit every country, and that many states have not had success in inviting him. He also believes that the techpreneur’s arrival in Kyrgyzstan will lead to the influx of billions of dollars in investment into the country through Bereket Bank. Japarov revealed that other investors will also appear among the bank’s founders. The President also stated that the bank will benefit the state and its citizens. The bank will operate as a regular bank, but will primarily focus on dealing with virtual assets and digital currencies. The head of state also argued that the bank will bring only benefits to the people of Kyrgyzstan. According to the report, the bank’s profits will be shared with the public, and assistance will also be provided to orphans and those in need. Kyrgyzstan launches stablecoin on Binance’s BNB Kyrgyzstan also unveiled a new stablecoin, KSGT, which is pegged to the country’s som currency. The country’s President also instructed the economic ministry to improve the legislative framework for digital assets, calling on the council to submit proposals for a state digital asset reserve within two months. Japarova also instructed the National Bank to initiate pilot testing of the digital som, a Central Bank Digital Currency separate from the KGST stablecoin. According to a separate announcement, the CBDC will initially launch by connecting the National Bank with commercial banks to facilitate transfers. It will then connect the Central Treasury to enable social and government payments, followed by a test of offline or low-connectivity payments.

The market watchers now wonder about the Ethereum price prediction for November. They are curious to see whether the price builds support above key levels and hands the baton to Layer 2 tokens for the next leg. On the other hand, analysts are talking about how Remittix (RTX) could lead to gains as a payments-first altcoin with clear product progress. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is a Rebound Possible Ethereum trades near $3,870 and recent action shows heavy volume into resistance and quick profit-taking that sent the price lower. In most Ethereum price prediction playbooks, that is what a failed breakout looks like. Bulls now want a clean base that forms above prior demand before any push toward the old highs. If spot flows firm and fear cools, a steady grind higher can follow rather than a sharp reversal. If the seller’s force closes below nearby supports, the tape can test deeper areas before any recovery. Even so, the common Ethereum price prediction for late 2025 keeps the long-term trend intact as long as buyers defend higher lows. The swing that matters is whether price can reclaim control above four thousand and hold it on daily closes. Remittix (RTX): Utility Rail Set To Lead Gains Remittix is a PayFi project that turns crypto into everyday payments. It lets people send crypto to real bank accounts in more than 30 countries with real time FX. This utility story is why some analysts expect RTX to lead gains when risk returns. It plays into the same network effects that help Ethereum, but it focuses on payments that users understand. The current project figures show over 682 million tokens sold, over $27.8 million raised and a price near $0.1166. The team is verified by CertiK and ranked at the top for pre-launch tokens. There is a 15% USDT referral paid daily and a $250,000 giveaway to grow the base. Four reasons RTX stands out; Users can send crypto to real bank accounts in minutes across more than thirty countries. The product puts utility first and aims to power real transaction volume across borders. The stack is audited by CertiK, which supports trust for new users and partners. Global payout rails are already integrated and still expanding with new corridors. Where This Leaves November’s Playbook The near-term Ethereum price prediction leans toward a base build after a sharp rejection. Hold above four thousand with rising spot demand and the door opens to four thousand seven hundred into strength. If support fails, expect a patient reset before flows return. In either case, watch Layer 2 names and Remittix for leadership once the tape steadies, since clear utility and lower costs often guide the next leg higher.

This rise had triggered positive sentiment in the market, with calls for the altcoin bull run to finally begin. However, the tide has since turned, and hopes for another altcoin season have been dashed. Now, the index has crashed back downward, moving toward its yearly lows. Altcoin Season Index Falls To 39 From 78 The Altcoin Season Index on the CoinMarketCap website has declined to a score of 29, representing an over 50% crash from its September highs. Back then, the Altcoin Season Index had climbed to a score of 78 , suggesting that altcoins were in a bull market. However, this move was short-lived with the market crash that followed, especially in the month of October. This index takes into account how the top 100 altcoins by market cap have performed against the Bitcoin price over a 90-day period and uses it to score the chart. The more altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin during this timeframe, the higher the score on the index. A score of 29 means that only 29 altcoins of the top 100 have seen better performance compared to the Bitcoin price over this 90-day period. The likes of Binance-backed ASTER and ZCASH’s ZEC lead this list after seeing an over 900% increase each during this time. Interestingly, the Ethereum price appears in the list of altcoins outperforming the market leader , coming in with a 5.18% increase for ETH compared to the 4.32% decline suffered by Bitcoin at the time of writing. What This Means For Altcoins The current score of 29 on the Altcoin Season Index represents the poor performance of altcoins over the last few months, as they were especially rocked by the October 10 crash. However, this is not completely bad news for the altcoin market, going by historical performance . Looking back, a bull run has always begun when the index falls to low levels. Before the September 2025 rally, the Altcoin Season Index had fallen below 40 before marking a bottom. Thus, the current low index score, coupled with market sentiment declining into fear, could suggest that a bottom is close .",Altcoins|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin season Altcoin season|Altcoin season news|altcoins|Altcoins news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-03 06:00:24

The company sold 108.6 million shares, which included an extra 8.4 million shares, at the upper limit IPO price of HKD 131.50 per share, after exercising an option to snowball the deal size. Seres filed for its Hong Kong listing in April, aiming to establish a platform for international capital operations, and has confirmed that the HK-listed stock will start trading on November 5 under the ticker HKG: 9927. It has been listed on the SSE (Shanghai Stock Exchange) since 2016 and has a market capitalization of nearly $35.8 billion (RMB 254.8B), gaining over 20% so far this year. The EV maker reportedly started gauging investor interest for the HK listing in October, with plans to raise between $1.5 and $2 billion. The Huawei partner met the investors in mid-October and agreed that the deal size might change. Meanwhile, listing proceeds have already exceeded the four-year high of $26 billion projected for 2025. Seres offers IPO shares at a 22% discount Seres’ HK listing price represents a 22% discount to the $21.8 (155.19 Yuan) closing price on October 31 on the SSE. However, the company’s deal is reportedly Hong Kong’s eighth listing that raised over $1 billion this year. China Galaxy Securities Co. and China International Capital Group both co-sponsored the company’s HK listing. The EV maker’s partnership with Huawei is also reportedly beneficial to the continued growth and stability of its stock price, and it is expected to boost profits by up to 72% to a record 10.2 billion Yuan in 2025. Meanwhile, the AITO brand maker’s Stock Connect eligibility and A-H share fungibility remain unclear, which could maintain price disparities between its Hong Kong and Shanghai listings. The fresh capital, however, is expected to strengthen the company’s global expansion. The HK listing will also make the company the first luxury NEV maker to achieve an A+H listing (listed in both Hong Kong and mainland China). AITO models exceed 800,000 deliveries to date The EV maker’s deliveries across all AITO models have reportedly exceeded 800,000 units to date. Seres has stepped up its product development this year, launching several new models, including the AITO M5 and M7, the family-oriented M8, and the M9 2025 edition. According to Seres, the AITO M9 alone has sold over 250,000 units in at least 84 weeks, apparently setting the record for EVs in the 500,000 RMB price category. The M9 also recorded an overall NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 85.2, ranking it at the top of the list of NEV models. Meanwhile, the AITO M8 has reportedly maintained its position as the brand’s bestseller for four straight months, surpassing 100,000 deliveries in the 400,000 RMB price range. The M7 also quickly stood out in the market, achieving over 200,000 deliveries within 36 days of its launch. AITO, the brand, ranked first in the 2025 H1 Brand Development Confidence Index, as per Landroads Consulting’s First Half New Energy Vehicle Brand Health study. The research covered 67 NEVS brands and collected data from over 7,800 NEV owners, highlighting NPS as a key measure of customer loyalty. Seres’ Q3 earnings report showed revenue of 110.53 RMB, and the net profit attributable to shareholders in the first three quarters of 2025 reached 5.31 billion RMB, representing a 31.56% YoY growth. The growth was reflected in the latest ranking of China’s top 500 companies, with Seres jumping 270 places to 190th, becoming one of the fastest-growing companies of the 2024 Golden Bull Most Valuable Investment Award list.

Given Gemini’s recent history of turning subtle messages into tangible product launches , many believe this teaser signals a major development tied to XRP. Next week's looking real XRP coded — Gemini (@Gemini) November 2, 2025 What is Gemini Planning for XRP? The post has led market watchers to suspect that a new integration or service could soon arrive on the exchange. Some speculate it may involve deeper XRP support across Gemini’s payment products or an institutional offering related to the asset. Gemini released similar XRP-related teasers in August. These culminated in the launch of the Gemini Credit Card XRP Edition , which allowed cardholders to earn rewards in XRP. Because of that precedent, several in the community believe Gemini could be signaling a similar move, possibly hinting at another financial product featuring XRP or an expansion of its credit or staking services. Reactions Across the XRP Community The XRP community reacted quickly to the post, with comments showing curiosity and excitement. One user wondered whether Gemini’s statement alluded to the Clarity Act’s passage and its potential impact on digital assets such as XRP . Another commenter emphasized that XRP’s strong fundamentals would help it prevail over time. A deeper integration of Gemini’s exchange could give the digital asset more use cases and attract more users. Another community member suggested the post could hint at CBDC developments , another area where XRP has excelled. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Others speculated that next week could bring news of spot XRP ETF approval , another institutional gateway for XRP. Some noted that they plan to accumulate more tokens before any potential announcement. Several users expressed gratitude for Gemini’s continued engagement with the XRP Ledger, saying the ecosystem needs visibility and innovation. What Could Be Next for Gemini and XRP? While Gemini has not released any further details, its phrasing and the context of previous teasers suggest that an XRP-related update could arrive soon. Many investors see Gemini’s willingness to feature XRP-branded initiatives as a sign of its confidence in the token’s long-term role in digital finance. If history repeats itself, the exchange’s latest message could mark another milestone for XRP integration within Gemini’s expanding ecosystem.

Warren’s Lawyer Rejects CZ’s Defamation Threat, Says Her Post Was Factually Correct",https://cryptonews.com/news/sen-warrens-lawyer-rejects-cz-defamation-threat-says-her-post-was-factually-correct/,"A lawyer for US Senator Elizabeth Warren has dismissed threats of a defamation lawsuit from Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, arguing that her comments about his criminal case were accurate and backed by public record. Key Takeaways: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s lawyer dismissed Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s defamation threat. Zhao’s team demanded a retraction after Warren linked his guilty plea to anti-money laundering violations. Warren’s attorney argued the post accurately described Zhao’s Bank Secrecy Act conviction and didn’t imply he was charged with direct money laundering. The dispute stems from an Oct. 23 post on X in which Warren criticized former President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Zhao, describing the move as “corruption.” Zhao’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén, responded with a legal threat, demanding the senator retract the post or face legal action for “defamatory statements that impugn his reputation.” Warren’s Lawyer Dismisses CZ Defamation Threat, Says Her Statement Was Accurate In a letter obtained by Punchbowl News , Warren’s attorney Ben Stafford rejected the accusations, saying, “Any threatened defamation claim would be without merit,” and noting that Zhao “pled guilty to violating an anti-money laundering law.” Warren wrote on X that Zhao “pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison.” Zhao disputed the characterization days later, saying there were “no money laundering charges.” Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program at Binance, a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. He was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024. In the same post, Warren alleged that Zhao “financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon,” referencing Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reports that Binance helped develop “USD1,” a stablecoin tied to Trump’s family venture, World Liberty Financial. Stafford defended Warren’s comments as “true in all respects” and consistent with “publicly available and widely reported facts.” He added that Zhao, as a public figure, could not succeed in a defamation case without proving “actual malice” — that is, proof Warren knowingly made false claims. Meanwhile, Zhao’s attorney said her client “will not remain silent while a United States Senator misuses her office to publish defamatory statements.” The letter also demanded Warren retract parts of her Senate resolution condemning Trump’s pardon of Zhao. Stafford rejected those demands, asserting that Warren’s post “simply references the fact that Mr. Zhao pled guilty to a violation of US anti-money laundering law” and did not imply he was convicted of money laundering itself. Binance Eyes US Comeback After Trump Pardons Founder Changpeng Zhao Binance is reportedly exploring ways to re-enter the US market following President Donald Trump’s pardon of founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, according to Bloomberg. The exchange is weighing options such as merging its US affiliate with its global platform or allowing its main exchange to serve American users directly. Zhao’s pardon, granted after his 2023 guilty plea for anti–money laundering violations, has reignited scrutiny amid Binance’s $2 billion deal with Trump’s family-backed crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. The clemency removes prior legal barriers that had restricted his involvement in Binance operations. Zhao, whose net worth stands at $61.4 billion, remains one of the most powerful figures in crypto, overseeing an ecosystem with $8.7 billion in on-chain assets. The pardon comes as Trump continues to court the digital asset industry, with his family reportedly earning over $1 billion from crypto ventures . The post Sen.

The latest move is the third phase of Operation Ironside, a joint Australian Federal Police and FBI investigation. According to ABC News , authorities have seized crypto assets worth around AU$58 million ($37.9 million) tied to the probe. The FBI had built an app dubbed AN0M to interpret criminal communications secretly. Using the encrypted messaging app, the authorities tracked down illicit communications related to drug smuggling and crypto transactions. The new phase was launched after the High Court approved the use of AN0M messages as evidence. Deputy Police Commissioner Linda Williams said that the move is a “significant blow to organized crime across South Australia.” She called the arrests “unprecedented,” adding that 300 police officers were involved in several raids. “I think you can anticipate more arrests, but probably not at the [tempo] that you have seen today,” she added. FBI Used AN0M to Track Crypto-Related Crimes The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) installed AN0M on modified phones that lack cameras, GPS, or browsers, designed to appeal to criminals seeking secure communication for illicit activities. The application was allegedly hidden in each phone’s calculator. The FBI worked with the Australian Federal Police, who “developed a world-first capability to unscramble encrypted communications.” Together, they secretly captured all data sent between devices using the platform, the ABC report read. The AN0M app included features like self-expiring messages, the ability to take and send photos, voice alteration and file storage. Soon, hundreds of criminals were arrested as part of Operation Ironside in Australia. Per the Australian Federal Police, almost 1,000 suspects had been arrested around the world, with weapons and money laundering involving crypto. “This is a really strong deterrent message to organised criminals operating in South Australia,” said Deputy Commissioner Williams. “We have been able to leverage the intelligence from the encrypted AN0M app to bring this to a successful resolution.” Crypto Crime Investigations Places ‘Burgen’ on Enforcement Agencies: Europol Recently, Europol warned that the misuse of crypto for criminal use is “ becoming increasingly sophisticated .” In a report released last week, the law enforcement agency noted that the growing sophistication of criminal tactics poses risks to the crypto sector and scam victims at large. “The misuse of crypto and blockchain technology for criminal purposes is becoming increasingly sophisticated, complex and organized,” said Burkhard Mühl, Head of Europol’s European Financial and Economic Crime Centre. As a result, investigating these crypto-linked crimes has become a “burden” for agencies worldwide, he added.

In a recent 60 Minutes interview, he claimed that he didn’t know who CZ was, but he pardoned him because he “heard” his case was a “Biden witch hunt.” When pressed by host Norah O’Donnell on why he freed a man whom he didn’t know, the POTUS said: “Well, here’s the thing. I know nothing about it because I’m too busy doing other… My sons are into it. I’m glad they are, because it’s probably a great industry, crypto. I think it’s good. You know, they are running a business, they are not in government.” According to a full CBS transcript of the interview, Trump avoided a question about potential corruption on the matter, given his family’s broader involvement with the cryptocurrency industry, and added, “I’m not concerned. I’d rather not have you ask the question.” The President’s claims are controversial, to say the least, given the recent history between Binance and the crypto businesses run by his family. Recall that the exchange facilitated a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin a few months back. Trump’s initial decision to pardon CZ led to an immediate backlash from Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who condemned the move. Binance’s founder fought back, accusing her of misrepresenting the nature of the charges against him. CZ warned Warren to retract her statements or face legal consequences. On Sunday, the Senator’s lawyers rejected the defamation threat, stating that her post was factually correct. “Senator Warren’s post is true in all respects and therefore cannot be defamatory. Senator Warren accurately represented publicly available and widely reported facts. The “charge” referenced in Senator Warren’s X post refers to the “charge” to which Mr. Zhao pled guilty and as to which President Trump had just pardoned him,” reads the statement.

DOGE is trading at press time at approximately $0.1868 , which represents a 0.21 percent decline on a day-to-day basis and a 6.55 percent decline every week. The market capitalization is close to $27.4 billion, which indicates a long-term popularity but not much in the short term. Key support is shown at $0.1848, and the overhead resistance is at $0.19. Any failure to hold this level may push Dogecoin price prediction targets to the downward trend of $0.17 or even $0.1750. Analyst Ali Martinez is more bearish. He explains that in case the token does not support $0.18, there is a possibility that it may drop to support 0.07. Both CoinMarketCap and TradingView analysts posit that the recent stagnation in the token could be a bigger trend – as investors sell out of meme coins and buy functional assets. Although Dogecoin continues to enjoy a good community sentiment, its failure to innovate in the technology field exposes it to the threat of newer, more utility-driven competitors . Remittix: Utility Takes the Lead as Meme Coins Lose Steam As meme coins flatten, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as the go-to token for investors seeking utility, speed, and compliance. The project’s upcoming CEX listing has fueled excitement, while its ecosystem already supports crypto-to-fiat payments across 30+ countries. With whale wallets increasing their exposure, Remittix continues to dominate smart money inflows heading into Q4. Here’s what’s driving the momentum behind Remittix: Wallet beta live, enabling instant global transfers from crypto to real bank accounts CertiK-verified with full KYC, establishing strong investor confidence and credibility $27.8M raised, positioning RTX among the most successful ongoing crypto projects 15% USDT referral rewards, claimable daily through the Remittix dashboard Business API integration, linking merchants and payment providers to blockchain rails These features cement Remittix as a leader among upcoming crypto projects, blending low gas fees, compliance, and real-world adoption. As interest in Dogecoin cools, RTX’s focus on solving crypto-to-bank transfers gives it the edge in long-term growth potential. Dogecoin’s Decline Signals a Shift to Real Utility The recent Dogecoin price prediction identifies a declining speculative stage of meme coins, which is replaced by utility-based assets such as Remittix . Although DOGE can continue to exist in the history of crypto, it is obvious that the future is occupied by projects that have a real effect and can scale the ecosystem. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy now, Remittix stands ready to redefine how digital assets move across the world.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/black-swan-capitalist-xrp-vs-solana-isnt-even-a-debate-heres-why/,"Western Union’s decision to build a new stablecoin on Solana has become a major topic of interest across the digital asset space. The move positioned Solana as a central player in Western Union’s digital payment expansion. Yet not everyone is convinced that it poses a challenge to XRP’s long-held dominance in institutional liquidity. Among those holding that view is Vandell Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist. He reaffirmed that Solana and XRP were designed for fundamentally different purposes, stating, “XRP vs Solana isn’t even a debate.” XRP vs Solana isn’t even a debate. XRP was built for institutional liquidity. Solana was built for retail applications. Get it together people. — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) November 1, 2025 Diverging Blockchains and Different Audiences Aljarrah made his stance clear in a recent post, stating, “XRP was built for institutional liquidity. Solana was built for retail applications.” His words echo a sentiment shared by many in the XRP community who see XRP’s infrastructure as uniquely suited for large-scale, regulated financial transfers. Solana’s architecture, while efficient for decentralized finance and consumer-facing applications, was never intended to solve the problems XRP targets in the cross-border payment sector. XRP’s Enduring Role in Cross-Border Settlements Despite this notable partnership, experts like Aljarrah maintain that XRP serves as the benchmark for institutional-grade liquidity solutions. The digital asset was developed to enable fast, cost-efficient, and regulatory-compliant cross-border transactions between banks and payment providers. Ripple has spent years building relationships with financial institutions worldwide and integrating with global payment corridors. While Western Union’s collaboration with Solana represents innovation in stablecoin issuance, it does not replace XRP’s role in financial settlements. XRP’s function as a bridge asset remains one of the few solutions proven to handle large-value transfers under institutional constraints. Aljarrah and others believe this distinction is critical when comparing the two ecosystems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Will XRP Dominate the Global Financial Market? Western Union’s pivot toward Solana follows a broader trend of traditional finance exploring blockchain technology for various use cases. However, XRP’s focus on institutional adoption positions it differently from networks like Solana that cater to consumer and developer communities. The XRP Ledger was built with compliance, liquidity management, and interoperability in mind, and financial entities prioritize these features. The digital asset’s infrastructure remains tailored for banks and remittance providers seeking efficient liquidity mechanisms. XRP’s foundation in institutional finance ensures its relevance in the cross-border payments landscape. Many experts believe it will play a much larger role, moving trillions across the world rather than through Western Union.

Here Are the Pairs to Be Delisted,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-futures-releases-new-delist-list-here-are-the-pairs-to-be-delisted/,"Binance announced that it will be removing some perpetual contracts from its futures trading platform, Binance Futures. Binance Futures to Remove Multiple Perpetual Contracts The exchange announced that all positions in the relevant contracts will be closed and the delisting process will be completed following the automatic reconciliation process. According to the official announcement, the USDⓈ-M KDAUSDT perpetual contract will be closed and removed from the system as of 12:00 on November 6, 2025, and the COIN-M AXSUSD and THETAUSD perpetual contracts will be closed and removed from the system as of 12:00 on November 7, 2025. Binance recommended that users manually close their open positions before these dates. Otherwise, the system will perform an automatic reconciliation process. Additionally, as the contracts approach their retirement, new position openings will be restricted. This means that the KDAUSDT contract will be disabled starting at 11:30 AM on November 6th, and the AXSUSD and THETAUSD contracts will be disabled starting at 11:30 AM on November 7th. Binance emphasized that all necessary technical preparations have been completed to ensure that the removal of contracts does not negatively impact the user experience. This move is part of Binance Futures' strategy to maintain market liquidity and trading efficiency. The platform continues to optimize its product offering by regularly delisting contracts with low trading volume or those requiring technical updates. *This is not investment advice.

As the macroeconomic tailwinds ignite investor optimism, Bitcoin Hyper – a Layer 2 solution emerges as the one of the next 100x cryptos as it aims to bring speed, scalability, and innovation to Bitcoin’s Layer 1. The project has already raised $25.6M in its presale, signaling the growing investor conviction in its long-term potential. Early buyers expect a 553% upside if price predictions hold true. Despite Bitcoin’s Uptober buzz that made rounds earlier last month, the coin’s performance was disappointing. The US-China trade tensions triggered a massive market crash on October 10th, and $BTC, which had touched an ATH of $126K dipped to $103K within a week. However, true to its well-known resilience, Bitcoin was among the first to rebound, consolidating near $110K. Then came the Fed’s 25 bps rate cut , which caused $BTC to slip slightly again – but traders aren’t too concerned, as $BTC dips following FOMC meetings have historically been followed by rallies. That said, the trade tensions between the US and China have also eased with President Trump and President Xi agreeing on a trade framework in a face-to-face meeting in Busan. The market absorbed the news and reacted positively, pushing $BTC up modestly to $111K. As of press time, $BTC trades at $107K . That said, optimism remains high among Bitcoin holders this November. With Strategy’s Saylor hinting at a potential $BTC buy soon, traders expect fresh institutional inflows to put crypto back in the driver’s seat this November. Simultaneously, investors are looking for emerging altcoins with strong upside to ride Bitcoin’s next bull run. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – a Layer 2 project in the making – aims to revitalize Bitcoin’s aging network with speed, scalability, and innovation. Investor conviction in the project’s potential is already evident, with its presale soaring past $25.6M. Why Bitcoin’s Blockchain Needs an Upgrade Bitcoin is the spark that ignited the $3.64T crypto revolution, and its market dominance of 59.6% continues to make it one of the most trusted cryptos globally. However, Bitcoin’s has several issues: Slow transaction speed, as the network now processes around 2–10 tx/s as opposed to Solana’s 800–1,200 tx/s. As of November 2, Bitcoin’s average confirmation time sits at 34.10 minutes, compared to Solana’s 400–600 milliseconds . Low throughput and slow confirmations have turned everyday Bitcoin payments into a hassle for its users. Network sluggishness creates congestion, so users compete for limited block space, which increases the fees even for small-value transactions. Bitcoin’s rigid architecture lacks native support for smart contracts and dApps, rendering Bitcoin’s blockchain impractical for modern DeFi needs. It’s pretty clear by now – while Bitcoin is a great store of value and hailed as digital gold, its blockchain continues to weigh it down with inherent limitations. So, is there a way for $BTC holders to step up their game? Well, that’s where Bitcoin Hyper steps up as a savior, turning Bitcoin’s limitations into opportunities. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – A Layer-2 Leap Forward for the World’s Oldest Blockchain Any network aiming for DeFi domination must master three core areas. Bitcoin Hyper stands out as a clear winner on all fronts. 1. Speed The project will integrate with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – the DNA behind Solana’s lightning-fast transactions – to deliver unsurpassed speed to $BTC users. While Bitcoin’s current network processes transactions sequentially, the SVM integration will process thousands of transactions in parallel, enabling high-performance smart contracts and scalable dApps within the Bitcoin ecosystem. 2. Scalability/cross-chain operability Bitcoin Hyper will use a Canonical Bridge to deliver seamless cross-chain operability. Once you deposit $BTC into the Canonical Bridge, it mints an equivalent amount of wrapped $BTC on the Layer 2. These tokens are your key to trading in DeFi, buying NFTs, or interacting with dApps. You can withdraw your $BTC back to the main chain at any time using the same bridge. So, you’re not locked into the $HYPER ecosystem once you join. 3. Security And the best part is that Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 is protected by Bitcoin’s iron-clad security at all times. The L2 will batch transactions from the main chain, compress them into succinct zero-knowledge proofs, and commit them to Bitcoin’s base chain Learn more about the process in our ‘What Is Bitcoin Hyper’ guide. At the center of this scalable, lightning-fast, and secure ecosystem lies $HYPER , the native token that fuels everything within. With $HYPER in your portfolio, you can: Pay for instantaneous transactions at near-zero fees Access an entire suite of DeFi tools from staking, swapping, lending, yield farming, and more Unlock native smart contracts and decentralized apps Participate in ecosystem governance Moreover, the project plans to build a unified web and mobile dashboard for users, featuring seamless wallet integrations that enable seamless interaction with dApps across devices. Here’s how to buy $HYPER in 4 simple steps. $HYPER Presale Heats Up – Early Investors Anticipate Explosive Gains Bitcoin Hyper has already turned heads by amassing $25.6M in its presale. Whale buys have driven much of this success, with one whale scooping $HYPER worth $93K just two days ago . One $HYPER today sits at $0.013215 with a juicy staking APY of 46%. If our $HYPER prediction comes true, one token could surge to $0.08625 by 2026. That means a $500 investment in $HYPER today could grow into $3,265 in one year – a 553% increase. And, that’s an upside from price appreciation alone. Remember, you can also earn passive income by staking your tokens. With the next price jump just a day away, now’s your cue to grab $HYPER before the presale takes off! Secure your $HYPER and ride the Bitcoin revolution.

Sure, BTC remains the market bellwether, but higher-risk, higher-reward investors are now looking at alternatives that boast explosive potential. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a top crypto to invest in and the next crypto to explode, currently changing hands at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 85% of tokens already sold and more than $18.35M raised. The disruptive dual-lending DeFi model, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending in one platform, enables users to maximize their capital efficiency while participating in one of the fastest-growing ecosystems. For those looking to invest in the best crypto during a market slowdown, MUTM presents a rare opportunity to capture early-stage growth ahead of its wider launch, making the altcoin a must-watch in the 2025 crypto cycle and the next crypto to explode. Bitcoin (BTC) Testing Key Support Zone as Markets Remain Uncertain Bitcoin recently tapped the support zone at $107,000–$108,000 with a modest bounce that brought some relief to traders. However, the market remains cautious as BTC should reclaim the $113,500 level soon to avoid heightened downside risk. A close week below this critical zone may trigger a larger correction, so investors will be carefully weighing their next moves. While Bitcoin faces this technical pressure, many investors are looking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a top crypto to invest in that’s been gaining traction largely due to its DeFi utility and early-stage growth potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars Away with Momentum Records Mutuum Finance remains one of the most talked-about projects in the DeFi community, and its current impossible-to-stop presale gains momentum. In Phase 6, MUTM is currently selling for $0.035, a 250% premium from the initial price of $0.01 in Phase 1, and is going to make early adopters a three-digit payoff. To date, Mutuum Finance has accrued over $18.35 million raised by more than 17,660 investors, where almost 85% of Phase 6 has already been sold. Phase 7 will see the price reach the next stage at 20% higher, transferring to the estimated exchange listing price of $0.06. This fast-rising valuation puts into the limelight high investor confidence and increasing popularity of Mutuum Finance as the top crypto to invest in and the next crypto to explode this year. Purchases by Credit and Debit Cards Make Participation Easier Than Ever Before Smooth Credit and Debit Card payment facilities have also been introduced by Mutuum Finance, through which investors around the world can buy MUTM tokens without limits. This will eliminate barriers to entry that have in the past prevented experienced crypto investors and newcomers from participating and expand the scope of the project globally. Powerful, Resilient, and DeFi Infrastructure Essentially, Mutuum Finance is the over-collateralized lending system intended to protect lenders and ensure maximum liquidity and platform resilience. The loan-to-value ratio in the protocol is conservative, while the protocol limits the borrowing of 75% of deposited collateral to have a balance between opportunity and security. Giving an example, a lender depositing $8,000 in ETH can borrow up to $6,000 with rewards in the form of mtTokens. Rewards are given 1:1 with the deposit in yield-generating receipt tokens that grow automatically over time and create passive growth. Borrowers can also deposit $3,000 in stablecoins and borrow the same sum in other assets at fixed rates, where yield is generated but holdings are not sold. It is self-sustaining, and the organic growth of APY incentivizes those who provide liquidity early to create a stable environment where growth is promoted. MUTM can be identified as the top crypto to invest in, since it offers both short-term profitability and long-term fundamentals of the DeFi future by integrating real utility with lasting value creation. Backed by real DeFi innovation and fast-growing demand, MUTM is the next crypto to explode and the top crypto to invest in while Bitcoin fluctuates below $110,000. Mutuum Finance has seen over 17,660+ investors, $18.35 million raised thus far, and Phase 6 has already been 85% sold at $0.035 per token. Get your tokens now before the next price boom, and put yourself at the front of the next crypto to explode in 2025.

Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $1,036.3, as bears target $993. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 5.14 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-03 07:35:06

As one of the best-performing crypto this year, Bitcoin’s continued price appreciation is undeniable. This is due not only to the Trump administration’s strong support and its decision to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve, but, more importantly, to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut in September, which has increased institutional demand for Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin is projected to achieve triple-digit returns in both 2023 and 2024, it has only gained 30% year-to-date. Given the slow growth of the Bitcoin market, how can BTC holders maximize their short-term returns? To effectively capitalize on Bitcoin’s opportunities and maximize profitability in this volatile market, it takes more than just passion; it also requires solid, secure, and reliable support. This is precisely what H Mining specializes in. What is HMining?

The RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&P Global, came in at 50.6 last month, down from September’s 51.2, which had been the strongest reading in six months. Economists polled by Reuters had expected 50.9. Survey respondents pointed to “rising trade uncertainty” as the culprit behind the sharp drop in new export orders, which fell at the fastest clip since May. Both production and new business expanded more slowly than in September, while manufacturer confidence hit a six-month low. When asked about their 12-month outlook, firms were “the least upbeat in six months,” the survey found. There was one silver lining. Factory employment actually grew for the first time since March, hitting its highest level since August 2023. Gap with official data The private survey’s 50.6 reading , still above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction, looked considerably better than the official government PMI released Friday, which showed manufacturing contracted to 49.0, the sharpest decline in six months. Private surveys (previously run by Caixin and S&P Global) tend to paint a rosier picture than official figures because they focus more heavily on export-oriented factories. The RatingDog survey polls 650 manufacturers in the second half of each month, while the official PMI covers more than 3,000 firms and surveys them at month-end. Dongming Xie, who heads Asia macro research at OCBC Bank, expects the manufacturing PMI to recover somewhat in coming months, thanks to the recently extended U.S.-China trade truce and anticipated improvement in export orders. Trade deal provides breathing room The two powers reached an agreement last week after Presidents Trump and Xi met in South Korea, easing tensions that had sparked worries about a global slowdown. Under the deal , Washington will cut its fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods in half to 10%, bringing the overall tariff rate on Chinese products to roughly 47%. Beijing, meanwhile, has agreed to suspend its sweeping rare earth export restrictions. The U.S. is also holding off on implementing a 50% ownership “penetration rule” under export controls and has paused its Section 301 probe into China’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries. A White House statement Saturday said China will drop its antitrust and trade investigations into U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia and Qualcomm, and resume buying American agricultural goods like soybeans and energy exports. Goldman sees stronger growth Goldman Sachs raised its China growth forecasts last week, encouraged by the trade deal and China’s push to bolster manufacturing and exports. The bank now expects 5% real GDP growth this year and 4.8% in 2026, up from prior estimates of 4.9% and 4.3%. Chinese manufacturers have spent this year diversifying away from the U.S. market, ramping up shipments to Southeast Asia and Europe instead. U.S.-bound exports have dropped by double digits year-over-year every month since April. That’s been largely offset by a 14.7% jump in exports to Southeast Asia through September, an 8.2% increase to the EU, and over 28% growth to Africa. Overall, China’s exports rose 6.1% in the first three quarters while imports slipped 1.1%. But strong export numbers haven’t been enough to mask deeper problems in the world’s second-largest economy. Growth slowed to 4.8% in the third quarter—the weakest in a year. Fixed-asset investment, including real estate, fell 0.5% in the first nine months, marking the first decline since the pandemic in 2020.

The two-day summit gathered leaders, institutional investors, and innovators from blockchain, cryptocurrency, Web3, and mining sectors across more than 100 countries, to explore the latest trends shaping the future of the crypto industry. As one of the industry’s leaders, HTX showcased its latest strategies in global market expansion and ecosystem innovation, earning strong recognition from both industry peers and international media for its vision, resilience, and influence in the global crypto landscape. HTX Ventures Head: “Rebuilding Market Confidence Requires Stable Liquidity and Security” During the conference, Alec Goh, Head of HTX Ventures, joined a panel discussion titled “Crypto Market 2025: New Growth or Continued Stagnation?” where he shared in-depth insights on the structural shifts shaping the digital asset market. Alec noted that the Oct 11 black swan event revealed the fragility of the current crypto market structure, from thin liquidity and excessive leverage by retail investors to overreliance on a few large market makers. The automated deleveraging mechanisms on exchanges, he said, triggered a domino effect that further deepened the market drawdown. “The market is now entering a post-speculation consolidation phase, similar to what we saw in 2016 or 2019,” Alec explained. “While short-term excitement has cooled, real builders are quietly expanding their share of the market. To restore retail confidence, the industry must return to fundamentals of stronger liquidity, safer trading systems, and higher-quality projects.” Looking ahead, Alec identified AI and blockchain integration as the next major development cycle, drawing parallels to the early days of DeFi in 2018. “In the next two to three years, we may see AI Agents interacting directly with smart contracts, and Initial Model Offerings (IMOs) emerging as a new fundraising paradigm. That could mark the start of the next major wave.” HTX Ventures Rises to the Top Tier, Focusing on Ease of Use and Practicality At the conference’s awards ceremony, HTX Ventures , the investment arm of HTX, was honored with the title of “Web3 Venture Capital Fund of the Year.” The recognition highlights the firm’s global influence, forward-looking investment strategy, and consistent outperformance across the Web3 sector. Over the past three years, HTX Ventures has achieved a 2.25x multiple on invested capital (MOIC), reflecting its disciplined approach to identifying high-potential blockchain projects. In addition, HTX was ranked among the Top 3 centralized exchanges of the year, reaffirming its position as one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in the global crypto industry. These honors reflect the market’s confidence in HTX’s leadership in innovation, investment foresight, and industry advancements. As Alec emphasized, HTX Ventures remains committed to its mission of “making blockchain easier and more useful.” Moving forward, it will continue focusing on the DeFi, AI agents, RWA tokenization, and blockchain infrastructure sectors, accelerating the growth and adoption of quality Web3 projects worldwide. With its steady strategic execution and sharp insight into industry trends, HTX continues to strengthen its dual role as a global leader in digital asset trading and a major Web3 venture investor. The company remains focused on advancing innovation in trading, investment, and governance, and on fostering a more open, efficient, and sustainable crypto ecosystem with more global builders and investors.

Key Takeaways: Trump said he “doesn’t know” Binance founder CZ Zhao despite pardoning him last month. He dismissed questions about Binance’s $2B deal linked to his family’s stablecoin, saying he was “too busy.” The president also blamed Democrats for the prolonged government shutdown and renewed criticism of Obamacare. During a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday night , the president was pressed about Zhao’s case and his family’s crypto-linked business dealings but brushed off questions, calling the case a “Biden witch hunt.” When asked why he pardoned Zhao, who pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money laundering laws, Trump replied, “Okay, are you ready? I don’t know who he is… I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that and I heard it was a Biden witch hunt.” Trump Shrugs Off Question on Binance’s $2B Deal Interviewer Norah O’Donnell followed up, pointing out that Binance had “helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase” of the Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin. Trump dismissed the question, saying, “I know nothing about it because I’m too busy.” Asked about his family’s involvement in crypto, the president said his sons are “running a business” and insisted he was not personally involved. “I’m glad they are [in crypto] because it’s probably a great industry. They’re running a business, they’re not in government,” he said. The president’s comments come amid ongoing scrutiny over the links between Binance and World Liberty Financial, a Trump family venture that has reportedly received backing from crypto firms. The pardon of Zhao, who was sentenced to four months in prison, has drawn widespread criticism from lawmakers who view it as a potential conflict of interest. See President Donald J.

WATCH IN FULL: pic.twitter.com/i95cQ3Gqei — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) November 3, 2025 During the same interview, Trump shifted to domestic issues, including the ongoing government shutdown, now on track to become the longest in US history. “The Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it,” he said. The president did not outline a plan to reopen the government but said he expects Democrats to “give in.” Pressed on healthcare, Trump renewed attacks on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), calling it “terrible” and “too expensive.” Warren’s Lawyer Rejects CZ Defamation Threat As reported, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s lawyer has dismissed CZ’s threat of a defamation lawsuit , insisting her comments about his criminal conviction were factually correct and supported by public records. The dispute stems from an Oct. 23 post on X, where Warren criticized former President Donald Trump’s pardon of Zhao , calling it “corruption.” Zhao’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén, demanded a retraction, accusing Warren of damaging her client’s reputation. In response, Warren’s attorney, Ben Stafford, said any defamation claim would be “without merit,” emphasizing that Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance. Stafford clarified that Warren’s post did not claim Zhao was charged with direct money laundering, only that he broke AML laws — a statement “true in all respects,” he said. Warren also alleged that Zhao “financed Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon,” citing media reports linking Binance to the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, Binance is reportedly exploring ways to re-enter the US market following President Donald Trump’s pardon of CZ.

Experts Reveal the Altcoin Poised to Surge 50x Once BTC Cools Off,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-correction-incoming-experts-reveal-the-altcoin-poised-to-surge-50x-once-btc-cools-off/,"The world’s most dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), is showing signs of fatigue. With the crypto market recently seeing sharp moves, analysts are now warning of a possible correction in BTC’s price and when that happens, it may trigger a massive shift toward altcoins. At the same time, investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy now in case this shift happens. One clear message is emerging: a correction in Bitcoin could signal the start of the next phase, where a new DeFi project could lead the narrative. Market data show that as BTC dominance falls, opportunities are opening up elsewhere and the pressure is mounting to find the next big altcoin in 2025 before everyone else catches on. Bitcoin (BTC): The Trigger Point Bitcoin is currently perched at high levels following a strong rally, but that strength may be its undoing. Analysts highlight that a 10-20% drop in BTC could ignite an altcoin surge as capital rotates out of the king coin. For investors thinking ahead, this means watching BTC’s support zones closely. If BTC fails to reclaim key resistance near $119,000, it could prompt a deeper correction toward the $97,000. Once Bitcoin cools off, altcoins become the play. The shift marks a window for early-stage crypto investment in top altcoins before the crowd catches on. Remittix: The Altcoin Poised to Pop The spotlight now lands firmly on Remittix . In the context of a Bitcoin correction, Remittix is emerging as perhaps the best DeFi altcoin to hold. Why? Because it combines real-world utility (crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries) with security credentials, and listing promises. Investors are already calling it “XRP 2.0”. If BTC stumbles, expect flows into undervalued crypto projects like this one as traders chase returns beyond the big name coins. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Global Reach: send crypto and land fiat in 30+ countries with 30+ fiat currencies supported. Real-World Utility: sits at the intersection of crypto and traditional banking — not just speculation. Security First: verified by audit firm CertiK and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens on their platform. Presale Momentum: over $27.8 million raised and 682+ million tokens sold at $0.1166 per token. Listing Pipeline & Wallet Reveal: Confirmations of listings on major centralized exchanges (CEX) like BitMart and LBank, plus beta wallet dropping ahead of full launch. While many coins claim to offer payments or DeFi features, Remittix stands out because it targets crypto-to-bank fiat transfers, not just crypto-to-crypto. That real-world bridge gives it a different profile from many speculative tokens. Also, while many altcoins rely solely on hype, RTX is delivering product milestones and raising significant capital. With a relatively modest market cap compared to megacoins, the potential upside is meaningful — especially if Bitcoin corrects and risk capital flows into projects like this. $250 000 Giveaway & Referral Drive – Act Now Remittix isn’t just building; it’s launching a full campaign to reward holders. Add the publicised $250,000 giveaway, thousands of entries and over 40,000 holders already — your chance to be part of one of the fastest-growing crypto ICOs.

Warren’s Lawyer Dismisses CZ’s Defamation Threat As Baseless,https://bitcoinist.com/sen-warrens-lawyer-dismisses-czs-defamation-threat-as-baseless/,"Senator Elizabeth Warren has formally pushed back against a threatened defamation claim from Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s legal team, saying any lawsuit would be without merit. The exchange centers on a social media post Warren made on Oct. 23 and the lawyers’ competing accounts of what her post meant and whether it repeats information already in public records. Warren’s Lawyer Pushes Back According to a letter filed by Warren’s attorney, Ben Stafford, the senator relied on public DOJ materials and court records when she commented about the matter. Stafford wrote that a defamation suit would lack legal basis and that public statements from the US Department of Justice were the source for key factual points. Reports have disclosed that Stafford’s response stressed First Amendment protections for commentary about public figures. Warren’s Post And Sources Based on reports, Warren’s post referenced language that appeared in DOJ disclosures from 2023 and related filings. Those public documents were cited by multiple outlets that obtained the letters exchanged between the parties. The story has been reported by mainstream and crypto-focused newsrooms, and the primary letters — one demanding a retraction and the other replying — were highlighted as central evidence in the dispute. CZ pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison. But then he financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon. Today, he got it. If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption, it owns it. pic.twitter.com/NsWeaJcVeK — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) October 23, 2025 CZ’s Legal Demand And The Timeline CZ’s legal demand was sent by Teresa Goody Guillén, who is identified in coverage as counsel for Zhao, co-founder and former CEO of Binance. The demand requested a retraction of Warren’s Oct. 23 post and threatened litigation if the post were not removed. CZ publicly said he might sue unless the post was taken down. On Lawsuits & Pardons In November 2023, Zhao admitted guilt for not keeping Binance’s Anti-Money Laundering program up to standard, violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and was later sentenced to four months in prison by a Seattle court in April 2024. Warren later fueled controversy with a post on X claiming Zhao had financed US President Donald Trump’s stablecoin project and sought a pardon , a statement that reignited public debate over Trump’s connection to Binance and his family’s crypto startup, World Liberty Financial. Legal Hurdles For A Defamation Suit According to legal commentators quoted in reporting, defamation claims against public figures face a high bar under US law because plaintiffs must show “actual malice” — that a false statement was made knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth. That standard was raised in classic Supreme Court rulings and was referenced repeatedly in the coverage as a reason why some lawyers view a suit here as a long shot.

The S&P Global South Korea Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell from 50.7 in September to 49.4 in October, indicating further stress in Asia’s fourth-largest economy at the start of the final quarter of 2025. The PMI data released on November 3 revealed that companies reported lower output and new order intakes, while employment levels fell fractionally for the first time in three months. In October, manufacturers frequently cited the effects of U.S. tariffs and the sluggish domestic economy as factors influencing demand and production. The report emphasized that demand and production also impacted manufacturers’ purchasing decisions and inventory levels. U.S. tariffs drive up costs for manufacturers On the price front, the PMI statistics from October showed that rising raw material prices were the primary cause of a significant increase in input costs. Companies noted that tariffs and a weak currency rate have led to higher price pressures on foreign-sourced inputs. According to the PMI report, the rate of input price inflation stayed higher than the series average even as it eased to a four-month low. The report claimed that, due to the necessity of passing on increased costs to consumers, output charges were raised for the eleventh consecutive month, albeit at the slowest rate in three months. S&P Global analyst Usamah Bhatti commented that the improvement observed towards the end of the third quarter “largely evaporated” in October. He noted that domestic demand faltered and new export orders, particularly from the United States, resumed their decline. “Manufacturers noted that tariffs further impacted the sector, as new export orders fell into decline again, particularly emphasizing the decrease in U.S. export demand.” – Usamah Bhatti , Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. Bhatti explained that historical high inflationary pressures had persisted, with foreign raw material prices frequently rising due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. He claimed that the outlook for the coming months appears mixed. Trump and Lee trade pact reshapes U.S.–Korea relations The downturn came just after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump reached an agreement on October 29 to set a 15% ceiling on U.S. tariffs on Korean automobiles and auto parts. Trump and South Korea struck an initial trade deal in July, with South Korea announcing plans to invest $350 billion in the U.S. South Korea also planned to spend approximately $100 billion on liquefied natural gas as part of the initial trade agreement with Trump. In return, Trump promised to reduce the initial 25% tariff imposed on South Korea to 15%. Kim Yong-beom, Lee’s chief of staff for policy, revealed that $200 billion of the $350 billion will be paid in cash installments, capped at $20 billion per year. The remaining $150 billion will be used for investments in shipbuilding. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, Kim claimed that the planned payment schedule enables the Korean side to control currency stability while maintaining a long-term commitment to the entire investment amount. Kim explained that the $20 billion annual cap is a step to safeguard local economies as industrial cooperation continues. U.S. and Korean companies will collaborate on production and technology in the shipbuilding section of the deal. Kim emphasized that Korean shipyards will continue to dominate the shipbuilding sector. South Korea claims that until the initial investment is recovered, the profits will be divided 50/50. The White House published a fact sheet late Saturday that included further information regarding the trade deal that was negotiated last week in South Korea between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. According to the White House’s new release, China will halt its probes into U.S. semiconductor makers and refrain from imposing export bans on rare earth metals. The U.S. will postpone plans to impose a 100% tax on Chinese exports to the U.S., which were scheduled to take effect this month. The United States will also postpone some of Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” on China for an additional year. Get seen where it counts.

Here’s How XRP Becomes Reserve Asset",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-decentralizes-xrp-goes-global-heres-how-xrp-becomes-reserve-asset/,"As regulatory direction begins to take shape in the U.S. through legislation like the already passed Genius Act and the highly anticipated Clarity Act , the groundwork for institutional and global adoption appears to be forming. Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently shared his outlook on the changing landscape, emphasizing that Ripple’s decentralization and policy clarity could transform XRP’s role in global liquidity markets. XRP’s Fully Decentralized Framework XRP operates on a fully decentralized network, independent of Ripple and maintained by a global set of validators. This structure aligns with the Clarity Act’s definition of “mature blockchain systems,” which classifies decentralized assets as digital commodities rather than securities. Aljarrah highlighted how regulatory clarity could validate XRP’s already decentralized nature and position it for institutional adoption and cross-border financial integration. Ripple decentralizes. $XRP goes global. The Clarity Act clears the path for institutions, nations, and the IMF to adopt it. Speculation dies. Real liquidity takes over. https://t.co/0hvtLUVxfu — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 2, 2025 The Clarity Act and Institutional Liquidity The Clarity Act presents a formal framework to distinguish decentralized digital assets from securities. This legislative clarity has created anticipation within the financial community, as institutions have long required compliance certainty before engaging in large-scale blockchain-based settlements. For XRP, which has already been integrated into various cross-border payment solutions , this represents an opening for accelerated institutional adoption. Aljarrah suggests that once this framework is implemented, the Clarity Act will “clear the path for institutions, nations, and the IMF to adopt it.” Such a transition would signify a substantial shift from speculative trading toward real utility-driven demand . Liquidity generated through institutional and sovereign use would fundamentally alter XRP’s market dynamics, creating a foundation for sustained value based on transaction volume rather than market sentiment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From Speculation to Global Liquidity The vision outlined by Aljarrah points toward an ecosystem where speculation gives way to functional liquidity. As financial entities seek efficient settlement mechanisms, XRP’s speed, scalability, and compliance-friendly design could make it a central component of international payment infrastructure. This would place XRP in a unique position as one of the few digital assets capable of supporting real-time cross-border liquidity at scale . That recognition would provide the regulatory assurance required for global integration, aligning with Aljarrah’s forecast of a transition where “speculation dies” and “real liquidity takes over.” At that point, XRP’s trajectory toward becoming a global reserve asset would no longer rely on market optimism but on established participation by financial institutions and potentially, as Aljarrah envisions, international organizations such as the IMF.

With over a million connected wallets, $650+ million in transaction volume, and over 20 million on-chain interactions, Tea-Fi is proving that DeFi can be both powerful and accessible. At the center of this ecosystem is the $TEA token, fueling a self-sustaining network built on real yield, shared value, and true decentralization, and a perpetual reward engine fueled by the TeaPOT. The Tea-Fi Vision: DeFi that Feels Effortless DeFi’s biggest challenge has always been complexity: multiple wallets, gas fees, and fragmented liquidity. Tea-Fi solves this with a fully abstracted, multi-chain experience, making it as intuitive as a Web2 app while remaining fully decentralized. Users can swap, stake, spend, and earn across 40+ blockchains without worrying about bridges or native gas. Core Innovations Powering the Ecosystem 01. TeaPOT- Rewards Powered by Real Yield The TeaPOT is Tea-Fi’s protocol-owned liquidity vault, capturing platform fees and partner revenues to channel them back into $TEA buybacks, user rewards, and ecosystem growth. It is a sustainable yield engine based on real protocol revenue rather than emissions. 02. Yield Engine – Optimized Rewards for All From staking to synthetic assets, users can earn optimized rewards through Tea-Fi’s on-chain yield programs, all transparently tied to the protocol’s revenue streams. 03. SuperSwap – Cross-Chain Swaps Made Simple Tea-Fi’s SuperSwap feature lets users swap and bridge across 40+ chains in one click, turning what was once a multi-step process into a single seamless transaction. 04. Easy-Gas – Gasless by Design Users can pay fees in stablecoins or any of the supported tokens in their wallet, unlocking a truly gasless DeFi experience across over 40 blockchains, removing one of the biggest barriers to entry for everyday users. 05.

53975884,619237,1762157326,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53975884.jpeg,"Bitcoin Hyper Defies Market Slump, Viral Crypto Presale Nears $26M",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-nears-26m-best-crypto-presale/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin Hyper’s upcoming Layer-2 solution upgrades the slow and clunky Bitcoin blockchain for Web3, unlocking a wide range of use cases across DeFi, NFTs, and real-world tokens – to name just a few. While Bitcoin is widely regarded as digital gold, Bitcoin Hyper extends that idea, turning it from a store of value into a thriving ecosystem for creative new decentralized applications. Currently, early backers can grab Bitcoin Hyper’s native crypto by joining the viral presale that has already smashed through $25.6M. Bitcoin has rightfully earned the title ‘digital gold’. Today, it’s a reliable store of wealth, as demonstrated by its 174,410,533% lifetime growth . Now compare that to gold’s , and you’ll understand why the term fails to capture Bitcoin’s potential. This is because Bitcoin doesn’t just preserve value like gold. It generates value, thanks to the underlying blockchain technology that continues to disrupt industries. AI and real-world tokenisation, in particular, are predicted to take crypto to new heights. However, this Web3 expansion has nothing much to do with the Bitcoin network. Sure, Bitcoin remains the crypto king with a massive market cap of $2.14T. But its underlying blockchain constrains its speed and functionality. While Bitcoin was introduced to the world as a peer-to-peer digital cash network, it’s still far away from accomplishing that dream. Can you imagine paying for coffee with $BTC? With its speed sometimes as low as 2.8 transactions per second , $BTC transactions are simply not designed for everyday payments. Bitcoin’s market cap comes as a surprise when you compare the blockchain’s speed to traditional payment networks like Visa, which is capable of handling around 65K transactions per second . In fact, there is a long list of blockchains that rank higher than Bitcoin in speed. Solana, in particular, is well-known for its fast network – theoretically capable of 65K transactions per second . More importantly, its developer-friendly blockchain is a hot hub for creative new Web3 projects. What sets Bitcoin apart from gold is its technological foundation. Interestingly, however, that foundation is built on other blockchains. Bitcoin’s network constraints prevent it from exploring new crypto frontiers like DeFi, NFTs, gaming and real-world tokenization. This gap explains why institutions are diversifying their reserves into altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and BNB, which offer both speed and programmability. It’s about time Bitcoin overcame these bottlenecks and turned the long-held dream of hitting $1M into a tangible possibility. And that’s where Bitcoin Hyper is stepping up to the plate, placing it among the best crypto presales of the year. How Bitcoin Hyper Unlocks Bitcoin’s Full Potential Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is developing a Layer-2 solution that could finally address Bitcoin’s lack of speed and programmability – all while maintaining its proven security framework. At the heart of the solution is a non-custodial Canonical Bridge , which helps issue a wrapped version of Bitcoin on the Layer-2 network, which can then be used across the broader Web3 ecosystem. More importantly, it could finally bring DeFi, NFTs, micropayments, and real-world assets to the Bitcoin blockchain at near-zero transaction costs. This is made possible by the Solana Virtual Machine , which makes the network compatible with smart contracts. In other words, Bitcoin could soon evolve into a Web3 hub, without relying on the reputation of other blockchains to drive its growth or expand its market cap. As companies increasingly accumulate Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset and crypto regulations become friendlier, the importance of a project like Bitcoin Hyper can’t be stressed enough. Given this promising backdrop, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction sees the native crypto $HYPER potentially outperforming Bitcoin in terms of annual ROI. Being much younger and having a smaller market cap, it could have considerably more room for returns. Read our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper for step-by-step instructions on joining one of the best crypto presales this season. $25.6M Raised: Why You Shouldn’t Miss the Presale Window Bitcoin Hyper is now hosting the presale of $HYPER tokens, where early backers can grab it for fixed, discounted prices. Since the token is used for transactions, staking incentives, and governance, its long-term growth is tied to both network adoption and Bitcoin’s journey ahead. For the same reason, the token is expected to take off once it hits exchanges, especially if the launch aligns with the next crypto super cycle. While 30% of the token supply is set aside for product development, 20% is reserved for marketing. And product development is progressing steadily, instilling confidence in its future. Whales have already begun accumulating the token for low prices in the presale, with some transactions worth $379K and $274K . But there isn’t much time left to buy the token at its current price of $0.013215 and unlock a 46% staking APY. The price is set to increase in just one day. Join the $HYPER presale now. But as always, do your own research before investing in crypto. This is not financial advice.

Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, flagged this colossal movement from Ceffu, a prominent institutional digital asset custodian, to an unknown digital wallet. Valued at an incredible $265 million, this single USDC transfer immediately sparks numerous questions about its origin, its ultimate destination, and its potential impact on the broader market dynamics. What Exactly Happened with This Massive USDC Transfer? On a recent occasion, the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert reported a significant transaction involving 265,000,000 USDC. This substantial amount of the stablecoin was moved from Ceffu, a platform known for providing institutional-grade custody solutions. The funds were sent to an address categorized simply as an ‘unknown wallet’. This type of USDC transfer , especially given its sheer size, often captures the attention of investors and analysts alike, as it represents a considerable shift in digital asset holdings. Why Does Such a Large USDC Transfer Matter to the Market? When hundreds of millions of dollars worth of a stablecoin like USDC move, it’s more than just a routine transaction; it can be a strong signal. Such a massive USDC transfer can have several implications for market sentiment and future price action. For instance, large movements often precede significant trading activity or could indicate a major institutional player repositioning assets. It could also point to: Market Sentiment Shifts: A large inflow or outflow of stablecoins from exchanges can influence perceived demand or supply. Potential OTC Deals: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks often facilitate large trades, which might involve moving significant amounts of stablecoins off-exchange. Institutional Interest: Big transfers can signal a large institution entering or exiting positions, or simply rebalancing their portfolio. Security and Custody Practices: The movement of funds from a custodian like Ceffu highlights the ongoing importance of secure digital asset management. Understanding the Players: Ceffu and the ‘Unknown Wallet’ Ceffu is not just any wallet service; it’s an institutional-grade platform offering secure custody and liquidity solutions. When funds move from Ceffu, it often suggests that a significant entity, likely an institution or a high-net-worth individual, is behind the transaction. The term ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the address is not publicly linked to a known entity like an exchange or a specific company. This doesn’t inherently imply malicious activity. In the crypto world, ‘unknown’ could mean a private cold storage wallet, an OTC trading desk, a market maker, or even another institutional client’s secure address. Therefore, every USDC transfer to such a wallet requires careful, unbiased interpretation. Navigating the Waters: What Can We Learn from This USDC Transfer? While the specifics of this particular USDC transfer remain shrouded in mystery, such events offer valuable lessons for everyone in the crypto space. They underscore the dynamic nature of digital asset markets and the importance of staying informed. For investors, monitoring these ‘whale’ movements can provide clues about potential market trends. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation does not always equal causation. Always conduct your own research and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on large transfers. This 265 million USDC transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the often opaque nature of large-scale cryptocurrency movements. While the specifics remain undisclosed, such events underscore the need for vigilance and informed decision-making in the fast-paced digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? A1: USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable at $1.00. It is fully backed by reserves of cash and short-duration U.S. government bonds. Q2: What is Ceffu? A2: Ceffu is an institutional digital asset custodian that provides secure, compliant, and scalable infrastructure solutions for institutions looking to engage with the crypto economy. Q3: Why are large cryptocurrency transfers called ‘whale movements’? A3: Large transfers are often referred to as ‘whale movements’ because they involve amounts significant enough to potentially influence market prices or sentiment, much like a whale in the ocean can create large ripples. Q4: Does a large USDC transfer mean the market is about to crash or pump? A4: Not necessarily. While large transfers can sometimes precede significant market moves, they can also be for various non-speculative reasons like OTC deals, rebalancing portfolios, or moving funds to cold storage. It’s one data point among many. Q5: How can I track similar large transactions? A5: Services like Whale Alert, Etherscan, and other blockchain explorers allow users to track large transactions across various cryptocurrencies and blockchains in real-time.

A recent incident in Gwangsan-gu, Gwangju, starkly illustrates the dangers of crypto-lure theft . Police have arrested two foreign nationals, both in their 30s, on aggravated theft charges. They are accused of stealing 70 million won (approximately $50,700) from another man, using a deceptive cryptocurrency transaction as their bait. Understanding the Threat of Crypto-Lure Theft This incident, reported by Yonhap News, involved the suspects luring their victim with the promise of selling discounted cryptocurrency. Instead of a legitimate exchange, they allegedly absconded with the cash. This type of scam, known as crypto-lure theft , exploits the victim’s trust and desire for a good deal, bypassing secure trading platforms. Such schemes highlight a growing challenge in the digital asset space. As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, so too do the methods criminals use to exploit them. The allure of quick profits or exclusive access often blinds individuals to the inherent risks involved in these unregulated, person-to-person transactions. Why Are Crypto-Lure Theft Scams on the Rise? The increasing value and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies make them prime targets for theft. Scammers capitalize on several factors: Information Asymmetry: Many new investors lack full understanding of crypto security. Desire for Discounts: The appeal of ‘cheap’ crypto can override caution. Pseudonymity: Criminals often hide behind fake identities, making them harder to trace. This creates a fertile ground for crypto-lure theft , where the promise of a lucrative deal masks a clear intent to defraud. It’s a classic con, updated for the digital age, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance. Safeguarding Your Assets from Crypto-Lure Theft Protecting yourself from crypto-lure theft requires proactive steps and a healthy dose of skepticism. Here’s how you can stay safe: Use Reputable Exchanges: Always conduct transactions through established, regulated cryptocurrency exchanges. They offer security protocols and a verifiable transaction history. Verify All Offers: Be extremely wary of unsolicited offers for discounted crypto, especially from unknown individuals or through social media. If it sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Avoid Cash Deals: Direct cash transactions for crypto are highly risky and should be avoided. They lack the security and traceability of digital platforms. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics. Knowledge is your strongest defense against evolving threats. The Gwangju arrests demonstrate that law enforcement is actively pursuing these criminals. However, personal responsibility in securing your digital assets remains paramount. The Legal Ramifications of Crypto-Lure Theft Crimes like crypto-lure theft carry severe legal consequences. In South Korea, aggravated theft charges can lead to significant prison terms. Authorities globally are enhancing their capabilities to track and prosecute digital asset criminals, often collaborating across borders. These arrests send a strong message that such illicit activities will not go unpunished. The incident in Gwangju is a critical reminder for everyone engaging with cryptocurrencies. While the potential for innovation and growth is vast, so are the opportunities for exploitation. By understanding the mechanisms of crypto-lure theft and implementing robust security practices, you can significantly mitigate your risk. Prioritize caution and informed decision-making to protect your digital investments. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Scams Q1: What defines a “crypto-lure theft”? A1: It’s a scam where victims are lured by fake offers of buying/selling crypto, often discounted, leading to theft of their funds. Q2: How can I spot a fake crypto offer? A2: Look for unrealistic discounts, high-pressure sales, demands for cash, or offers from unverified sources. Trust your instincts. Q3: Should I ever buy crypto with cash in person? A3: It’s highly risky and generally advised against. Use secure, regulated exchanges for all transactions to ensure safety. Q4: What if I fall victim to crypto theft? A4: Immediately contact local police and provide all details. Also, report to the exchange if applicable. Time is crucial. Stay informed and protect your investments!

Powered by $TEA,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/tea-fi-redefines-defi-one-superapp-infinite-yield-powered-by-tea,"Hong-Kong, Hong Kong SAR, November 3rd, 2025, Chainwire Tea-Fi , the all-in-one DeFi SuperApp, is setting a new benchmark for the future of DeFi by merging simplicity, scalability, and sustainability into one seamless experience. With over a million connected wallets, $650+ million in transaction volume, and over 20 million on-chain interactions, Tea-Fi is proving that DeFi can be both powerful and accessible. At the center of this ecosystem is the $TEA token, fueling a self-sustaining network built on real yield, shared value, and true decentralization, and a perpetual reward engine fueled by the TeaPOT. The Tea-Fi Vision: DeFi that Feels Effortless DeFi’s biggest challenge has always been complexity: multiple wallets, gas fees, and fragmented liquidity. Tea-Fi solves this with a fully abstracted, multi-chain experience, making it as intuitive as a Web2 app while remaining fully decentralized. Users can swap, stake, spend, and earn across 40+ blockchains without worrying about bridges or native gas. Core Innovations Powering the Ecosystem 01. TeaPOT- Rewards Powered by Real Yield The TeaPOT is Tea-Fi’s protocol-owned liquidity vault, capturing platform fees and partner revenues to channel them back into $TEA buybacks, user rewards, and ecosystem growth. It is a sustainable yield engine based on real protocol revenue rather than emissions. 02. Yield Engine - Optimized Rewards for All From staking to synthetic assets, users can earn optimized rewards through Tea-Fi’s on-chain yield programs, all transparently tied to the protocol’s revenue streams. 03. SuperSwap - Cross-Chain Swaps Made Simple Tea-Fi’s SuperSwap feature lets users swap and bridge across 40+ chains in one click, turning what was once a multi-step process into a single seamless transaction. 04. Easy-Gas - Gasless by Design Users can pay fees in stablecoins or any of the supported tokens in their wallet, unlocking a truly gasless DeFi experience across over 40 blockchains, removing one of the biggest barriers to entry for everyday users. 05. Self-Custodial Wallets Tea-Fi’s self-custodial smart wallet ensures users maintain full control over their assets, combining the convenience of web2 with the security of Web3. 06. TeaCard With TeaCard, users can spend crypto in real life while feeding value back into the Tea-Fi ecosystem, bridging DeFi flexibility with real-world utility. 07. Protocol-Aligned Apps (PAAs) Third-party dApps such as NOGA , integrate directly into the Tea-Fi ecosystem, contributing to protocol revenue and expanding Tea-Fi’s reach across multiple DeFi verticals. By fueling the TeaPOT, they further strengthen the ecosystem’s self-sustaining economy The $TEA Token: The Core of a Circular Economy The $TEA token lies at the heart of Tea-Fi’s flywheel. Every transaction, integration, and user activity flows into the TeaPOT, creating continuous buybacks, compounding rewards, and sustainable value capture. $TEA serves three primary roles: Utility: Powers all yield, staking, and reward systems. Governance: When locked as vTEA, it grants voting power and boosts APYs. Value Capture: Feeds protocol revenue back into buybacks and incentives. The result is a deflationary token economy driven by usage, not speculation. Growth, Partnerships, and Traction Tea-Fi’s rise has been powered by integrations with Polygon Labs, Katana, and NOGA, enabling frictionless scalability across ecosystems. The numbers speak for themselves: Over 2 million connected wallets 20+ million transactions $560+ million total volume $5+ million TVL 1+ million global users The Road Ahead: Activating the $TEA Economy TGE goes live at 12 PM UTC, 3 November 2025 on Kraken, Kucoin and MEXC unlocking the next phase of Tea-Fi’s mission to empower users through governance, yield participation, and vTEA alignment. Tea-Fi’s goal is clear: make DeFi as easy as traditional finance, owned by the users, powered by real yield, and built to last. About Tea-Fi Tea-Fi is a DeFi SuperApp that merges the usability of Web2 with the transparency of Web3. Through innovations like account abstraction, multi-chain compatibility, and its protocol-owned liquidity vault (TeaPOT), Tea-Fi enables users to experience DeFi as it was meant to be: simple, sustainable, and rewarding.

When 2,300 BTC, valued at approximately $252 million, moved from an unknown wallet directly to PayPal, it immediately captured the attention of market watchers. What Exactly Happened with This Massive Bitcoin Transfer? The cryptocurrency tracking service, Whale Alert, recently reported a significant transaction: 2,300 Bitcoins were moved from an unidentified digital wallet. This substantial Bitcoin transfer was directed towards PayPal, a major player in the digital payments space. The Amount: A staggering 2,300 BTC. The Value: Approximately $252 million at the time of the transaction. The Destination: PayPal, a well-known financial technology company. The Origin: An ‘unknown wallet,’ adding a layer of mystery to the event. Such large movements, often referred to as ‘whale transactions,’ typically signal potential shifts in market dynamics. Investors and analysts closely monitor these transfers for clues about future price action or institutional involvement. Unpacking the ‘Unknown Wallet’: Who Initiated This Bitcoin Transfer? The identity of the sender behind this considerable Bitcoin transfer remains shrouded in mystery. The term ‘unknown wallet’ often refers to an address that hasn’t been publicly linked to an identifiable entity, such as an exchange or a known institutional investor. Several theories are circulating: An Early Adopter: A long-term holder cashing out a portion of their holdings. An Institutional Investor: A large fund or corporation making a strategic move. An Exchange Movement: Although less likely given the ‘unknown wallet’ tag, it could be an internal transfer or rebalancing. The lack of transparency surrounding the sender’s identity only amplifies the intrigue and contributes to the ongoing market speculation. Understanding who is behind such a significant Bitcoin transfer could offer valuable insights into market sentiment. What Does a Bitcoin Transfer to PayPal Imply for the Market? The destination of this large Bitcoin transfer —PayPal—is particularly noteworthy. PayPal has increasingly embraced cryptocurrency services, allowing users to buy, sell, and hold various digital assets, including Bitcoin. This transaction could imply several things: Increased Liquidity: A large influx of BTC to a platform like PayPal could indicate an intention to sell, potentially increasing market liquidity. Institutional Adoption: It might signal a major institutional entity leveraging PayPal’s crypto infrastructure for large-scale operations. Market Sentiment: Depending on the ultimate purpose, it could be seen as either a bullish sign (new funds entering the ecosystem) or a bearish one (large sell-off impending). Such a substantial movement to a mainstream platform like PayPal highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance and the crypto world. It underscores the evolving landscape of digital asset management and trading. Navigating the Future: Will This Bitcoin Transfer Set a New Precedent? The implications of this massive Bitcoin transfer extend beyond just the immediate transaction. It raises questions about the future direction of cryptocurrency adoption and the role of mainstream payment platforms. Here are some potential future trends and considerations: Enhanced Integration: We might see more large-scale crypto movements facilitated by traditional financial services. Regulatory Scrutiny: Transactions of this magnitude could attract further attention from financial regulators. Market Maturation: Such events signify the increasing maturity and institutionalization of the crypto market. While the immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price remains to be seen, this event certainly adds another layer to the complex narrative of cryptocurrency’s journey into mainstream finance. It’s a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the digital asset space. In conclusion, the unprecedented Bitcoin transfer of 2,300 BTC to PayPal from an unknown wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a significant event that sparks vital discussions about market dynamics, institutional involvement, and the evolving role of digital assets. As the crypto world continues to grow, such movements will undoubtedly shape its future trajectory, demanding close attention from investors and enthusiasts alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does ‘unknown wallet’ mean in cryptocurrency transactions? An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly identified or linked to a specific individual, exchange, or institution. These transactions often spark speculation due to the anonymity of the sender. 2. Why is a 2,300 BTC transfer considered significant? A transfer of 2,300 BTC, valued at approximately $252 million, is considered a ‘whale transaction’ due to its sheer size. Such large movements can influence market sentiment and potentially impact Bitcoin’s price. 3. Does PayPal directly hold the transferred Bitcoin? When Bitcoin is transferred to PayPal, it typically means it’s moved into PayPal’s managed cryptocurrency accounts. Users can buy, sell, and hold crypto through PayPal, but they usually do not have direct control over the private keys. 4. What are the potential market impacts of such a large Bitcoin transfer to PayPal? The potential impacts include increased market liquidity if the BTC is intended for sale, a signal of growing institutional interest in using mainstream platforms for crypto, or a shift in market sentiment depending on the sender’s ultimate intentions. 5. Is this Bitcoin transfer a sign of increased institutional adoption? While the sender’s identity is unknown, a large Bitcoin transfer to a mainstream financial platform like PayPal could certainly be interpreted as a sign of increasing institutional comfort and engagement with the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin has dropped below $108k, while Ether risks dipping to the $3,500 psychological level. XRP, Ripple’s native coin, has reclaimed its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, this milestone has more to do with BNB’s poor performance in recent weeks than XRP’s strength. XRP reclaims fourth spot as BNB slips BNB, the native coin of the Binance ecosystem, has lost its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, after losing 10% of its value in the last seven days. Since hitting an all-time high of $1,370 on October 13, BNB has lost 24% of its value and now risks dropping below the $1k psychological level. The coin’s poor performance in recent weeks has allowed XRP to overtake it on the CoinMarketCap list. XRP is now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $144 billion, while BNB’s market cap has slipped to $142 billion. XRP has failed to show strength in recent weeks despite Ripple’s integration into mainstream finance on the rise. Trading activity in CME’s XRP and Micro XRP futures has increased since their debut in May, with 567,000 contracts worth nearly $27 billion traded. Furthermore, futures Open Interest (OI) reached a record of $1.4billion in September, indicating strong institutional appetite. Ripple’s technology and token are increasingly being adopted by some of the leading financial institutions in the world. h Furthermore, Ripple’s $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury is a strong indication that the company intends to merge blockchain liquidity with corporate cash management. The acquisition also expands Ripple’s client base to more than 1,000 enterprises in 160 countries. However, these developments haven’t boosted XRP’s price as the coin is still trading below $2.5 per coin. XRP could retest the $2.20 swing low The XRP/USD 4-hour chart remains bearish and inefficient as the coin has failed to rally in recent weeks. The $1.50 zone continues to act as a strong support, which could likely hold in the long term. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.41 per coin. The technical indicators are currently bearish, suggesting that sellers are currently in control. The MACD lines crossed over into the negative territory on Wednesday, flashing a sell signal that has lasted nearly a week. The RSI of 45 is below the neutral 50 and could enter the oversold region if the selloff continues. If the bearish trend continues, XRP could retest the recent swing low of $2.2 in the near term. However, if the bulls regain control of the market, XRP could rally towards the first major resistance level at $2.70. A sustained bullish run would allow the coin to hit the TLQ at $3.0.

Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters recently shared a compelling vision: nearly all global financial transactions are poised to migrate onto blockchain transactions ledgers. This isn’t just a distant dream; it’s a future he believes is rapidly approaching. Speaking at the prestigious Hong Kong FinTech Week 2025, Winters articulated a future where traditional finance fully embraces cryptocurrency’s underlying technology. He emphasized that every asset, from real estate to equities, will eventually be digitized. This bold outlook has even been shared directly with Hong Kong’s leadership, underscoring the seriousness of this anticipated shift. Why Are Global Financial Blockchain Transactions Inevitable? The move towards blockchain isn’t merely a trend; it’s driven by fundamental advantages that address long-standing inefficiencies in traditional finance. Winters’ perspective highlights the inherent benefits this technology offers for processing financial activities. Enhanced Efficiency: Blockchain ledgers can facilitate faster settlement times, often reducing processes from days to minutes or even seconds. This means quicker access to funds and streamlined operations for businesses and individuals alike. Increased Transparency: Transactions recorded on a blockchain are immutable and verifiable. This creates a transparent audit trail, reducing fraud and fostering greater trust among participants. Reduced Costs: By minimizing the need for intermediaries and automating processes through smart contracts, the operational costs associated with traditional financial transactions can be significantly lowered. Greater Security: The cryptographic nature of blockchain technology provides robust security, making it highly resistant to tampering and unauthorized access. This is crucial for safeguarding sensitive financial data. These benefits collectively paint a picture of a more robust, efficient, and accessible global financial system powered by blockchain transactions . The shift isn’t just about adopting new tech; it’s about fundamentally improving how money moves around the world. What Challenges Must Be Overcome for Widespread Blockchain Transactions? While the vision for a blockchain-powered financial world is compelling, it’s not without its hurdles. Realizing Winters’ prediction requires navigating several complex challenges. Regulatory Clarity: One of the biggest obstacles is the lack of a unified, global regulatory framework for digital assets and blockchain technology. Clear guidelines are essential for institutional adoption and investor protection. Scalability Solutions: Current blockchain networks need to scale significantly to handle the immense volume of global financial transactions. Developing robust and efficient scalability solutions is paramount. Interoperability Standards: For a truly integrated system, different blockchain networks must be able to communicate and interact seamlessly. Establishing common standards for interoperability is a key area of focus. Cybersecurity Risks: As with any digital technology, robust cybersecurity measures are vital to protect against potential threats and ensure the integrity of the system. Standard Chartered, as a major financial institution, is actively involved in these discussions. They are collaborating with regulators and industry players to address these issues, paving the way for a smoother transition to a future dominated by blockchain transactions . The Transformative Impact of Digitized Assets and On-Chain Finance The implications of this shift extend far beyond just transaction processing. The digitization of assets, as highlighted by Winters, promises to unlock new economic opportunities and reshape financial markets. Consider the potential for: Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs): Imagine fractional ownership of real estate, art, or commodities, making illiquid assets more accessible and tradable. This could democratize investment opportunities on an unprecedented scale. New Financial Products: The programmability of blockchain allows for the creation of innovative financial instruments and services, tailored to specific needs and accessible globally. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: By reducing barriers to entry and lowering costs, blockchain can extend financial services to underserved populations worldwide, fostering greater economic participation. Standard Chartered’s engagement with Hong Kong’s leadership demonstrates a proactive approach to integrating these advancements into the broader economic landscape. The bank is not just observing; it’s actively shaping the environment for future blockchain transactions . The Future is On-Chain: A Concluding Thought Bill Winters’ prediction isn’t just a forecast; it’s a powerful signal from the heart of traditional finance. The move towards processing most global financial transactions on blockchain ledgers represents a fundamental paradigm shift. While challenges remain, the clear benefits in efficiency, transparency, and security are too compelling to ignore. We are witnessing the foundational steps of a truly revolutionary transformation in how the world conducts its financial affairs.

Data from Tokenomist shows seven major one-time unlocks exceeding $5 million and nine linear unlocks releasing more than $1 million per day. Ethena (ENA) dominates the unlock schedule with 171.88 million tokens worth $63.05 million becoming available. MEME follows with 3.45 billion tokens valued at $5.22 million. Ethena (ENA) and MEME unlock events dominate schedule Among all of them, the Ethena unlock is the single biggest value release during the period. The 171.88 million tokens becoming liquid could affect the market situation. This unlock has been set according to a vesting schedule, which specifies the dates on which early investors and team members receive tokens. The release of 3.45 billion tokens by MEME carries a lower dollar value at $5.22 million but represents a higher percentage of unlock supply at 5.98%. MOVE ranks third among one-time unlocks with 50.00 million tokens worth $3.37 million. This is representative of 1.82% of the unlock supply. BounceBit (BB) follows with 29.93 million tokens at a value of $3.07 million and 3.85% of its total unlock schedule. RED contributes 5.54 million tokens worth $1.78 million at 2.40% of unlock supply. Additional one-time unlocks surpass $5 million threshold Another 24.64 million SXT valued at $1.28 million are unlocked into circulation, which accounts for about 1.62% of unlock supply. The major one-time releases are rounded out by MAVIA, with 11.89 million tokens valued at $1.15 million. This MAVIA unlock represents 16.92% of the unlock supply: the highest among the major cliff events. ENA, MEME, MOVE, BB, RED, SXT, and MAVIA have combined one-time unlocks totaling approximately $78M. These are cliff events, where tokens unlock on a predetermined vesting schedule that aligns with project milestones, investor lockups, or team allocations. Solana leads linear unlock schedule Solana leads in the linear unlock category, with 493.73K tokens scheduled for release, valued at $92.20 million, representing 0.09% of circulating supply. TRUMP token comes a distant second, with 4.89 million tokens valued at $36.68 million, representing 2.45% of circulating supply. Worldcoin (WLD) adds another 37.23 million tokens worth $30.84 million at 1.64% of supply, while Dogecoin (DOGE) unlocks 96.74 million tokens worth $17.82 million. However, this is only 0.06% of the meme coin’s huge circulating supply. AVAX unlocks 700K tokens, worth $12.96 million, representing 0.16% of the circulating supply. Astar (ASTER) contributes 10.28 million tokens valued at $12.34 million at 0.51% of supply. Bittensor (TAO) releases 25.20K tokens, worth $12.17 million, accounting for 0.26% of supply. Story Protocol unlocks 2.32 million tokens worth $9.84 million at 0.72% of supply. Ether.fi rounds out the major linear releases, unlocking 8.53 million tokens worth $8.34 million, or 1.51% of supply. Linear unlocks differ from cliff events in that they release tokens constantly, rather than in single large batches. Linear vesting is probably the most common vesting used by projects to minimize market supply increases. Lesser-known tokens reveal fluctuating unlock progress Beyond the majors, a number of smaller market cap tokens have unlock events in the period according to CoinMarketCap . Hyperbot (BOT) has 18.75% unlock progress, with the next 18.53 million BOT worth $427,044.63. The release represents 1.85% of total locked tokens. BONDEX (BDXN) has 45.33% unlock progress, with 19.92 million BDXN valued at $637,024.29 scheduled, or 1.99% of locked supply. VaporFund (VPR) has 86.90% unlock progress, with 12.86 million VPR incoming, which accounts for 1.29% of the remaining locked tokens, valued at $5,243.64. Sleepless AI’s unlock progress stands at 41.79%, with the scheduled release of 17.69 million AI tokens worth a combined $1.15 million. This unlock represents 1.77% of total locked supply. Smaller projects usually see more significant price action from unlocks due to generally lower liquidity and trading volume. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

With its low fees and high transaction speed, it has become a magnet for developers launching new tokens and traders searching for early opportunities. However, in a space filled with constant competition, staying visible is not easy. That’s where the Volume Bot Solana comes in — an automated system that helps projects sustain activity, balance liquidity, and gain exposure across decentralized exchanges. For new tokens, maintaining consistent volume is often the difference between visibility and obscurity. The Volume Bot Solana provides a controlled way to keep markets active and data charts appealing to potential investors. What Is a Volume Bot Solana A Volume Bot Solana is an automated trading solution that continuously performs buy and sell transactions on decentralized exchanges such as Raydium, Meteora, and Jupiter. It uses randomized timing, varied trade sizes, and multiple wallets to create trading activity that resembles natural market movement. The main goal of a Volume Bot Solana is to maintain steady on-chain activity, which helps tokens appear on trending lists on analytics platforms like DexScreener and Birdeye. By keeping liquidity pools active, it enhances token visibility and supports healthier chart patterns that attract genuine traders. How a Volume Bot Solana Works When activated, the bot connects directly to Solana’s smart contracts and executes trades within designated liquidity pools. It can be configured to alternate between buys and sells, manage timing intervals, and adjust order amounts to create consistent yet unpredictable patterns. Many developers use control dashboards or Telegram interfaces to monitor and modify performance in real time. This allows for fine-tuning — keeping the activity natural while avoiding repetitive or detectable behavior. The Benefits of Using a Volume Bot Solana The Volume Bot Solana serves several important purposes for token teams and developers: Keeps liquidity stable by ensuring ongoing buy and sell activity Improves visibility on DEX analytics and trending boards Builds trader confidence through consistent chart performance Reduces slippage by maintaining depth in liquidity pools Creates a testing ground for evaluating price reactions and market behavior This combination of functionality and realism helps projects stand out during their early stages, when establishing market presence is most difficult. Risks and Responsible Usage While a Volume Bot Solana can significantly boost visibility, excessive or predictable trading can look unnatural and reduce credibility. Transparency and moderation are key to effective use. Developers should treat automation as a support mechanism, not a replacement for real trading and community interaction. A responsible approach focuses on sustainable growth — balancing automated trading with genuine participation, marketing, and utility. The Broader Role of Volume Bots in Solana DeFi The introduction of Volume Bots on Solana represents a growing shift toward algorithmic liquidity management. Instead of relying solely on external market makers, developers can use automation to maintain exposure and trading flow directly through smart contracts. This evolution highlights the importance of efficiency and decentralization in modern DeFi. Volume Bots allow projects to maintain a strong market presence while reducing the overhead and risks associated with centralized intervention. Conclusion A Volume Bot SOL is more than a tool for generating trades — it’s a system for maintaining market health, visibility, and engagement in a competitive DeFi ecosystem. By sustaining consistent and realistic activity, it helps projects stay on traders’ radar while supporting stable liquidity conditions. When implemented thoughtfully, a Volume Bot Solana can be the difference between a token that fades away and one that grows steadily through both automated and organic market participation.

Recently, a significant Bitcoin price drop has captured headlines, sending ripples across the digital asset landscape. According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC has dipped below the crucial $109,000 mark, with current trading figures on the Binance USDT market showing it at $108,990.47. This unexpected move has left many wondering about the immediate future of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces behind a sudden market shift like this Bitcoin price drop is crucial for any investor. While no single factor is ever solely responsible, several elements often contribute to such movements. These can range from macroeconomic indicators to specific industry news. Market Sentiment: Investor confidence plays a massive role. Any negative news, whether about regulations, security breaches, or broader economic concerns, can quickly turn sentiment bearish. Whale Activity: Large sell-offs by significant holders (often called “whales”) can exert considerable downward pressure on prices, especially in less liquid markets. Technical Indicators: Breaking key support levels can trigger automated sell orders, accelerating a downward trend. The $109,000 level may have been a psychological or technical support point for many traders. Global Economic Factors: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation worries, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to de-risk, pulling capital from more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. This latest dip serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility within the crypto space. It underscores the importance of staying informed and understanding the various influences that can impact asset values. How Does a Bitcoin Price Drop Impact the Broader Market? When Bitcoin, the market leader, experiences a significant shift, it rarely happens in isolation. The ripple effect of a Bitcoin price drop can be felt across the entire altcoin market. Many altcoins are often correlated with BTC’s performance, meaning they tend to follow its general trajectory. For instance, if Bitcoin sees a downturn: Altcoins often follow suit: Many digital assets are paired against BTC, so a drop in Bitcoin’s value can directly impact their price in USD terms. Investor confidence wanes: A bearish Bitcoin market can lead to a broader loss of confidence, causing investors to withdraw from other crypto assets as well. Liquidation events: Traders using leverage might face liquidations, further exacerbating selling pressure across the board. However, it’s also worth noting that some altcoins occasionally decouple from Bitcoin’s movement, especially those with strong fundamental news or unique developments. Still, for the most part, Bitcoin remains the bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. What Should Investors Do During a Bitcoin Price Drop? Periods of volatility, like the current Bitcoin price drop , can be unsettling. However, they also present opportunities for those who approach the market with a clear strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Calm and Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions often lead to losses. Take a step back and evaluate the situation rationally. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: This is a good time to review your initial investment thesis. Are your assets still aligned with your long-term goals? Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, a dip can be an opportunity to buy more at a lower price, spreading your investment over time. Research and Learn: Use this time to deepen your understanding of market dynamics, technical analysis, and fundamental factors influencing crypto prices. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders if you’re actively trading. Remember, the crypto market is known for its cycles of boom and bust. Patience and a well-thought-out strategy are often key to navigating these fluctuations successfully. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $109,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such dips can be concerning, they are also a natural part of any evolving asset class. By understanding the potential triggers, observing the broader market impact, and adopting a disciplined investment approach, individuals can better navigate these volatile periods. Staying informed through reliable sources like Bitcoin World is paramount for making well-considered decisions in this exciting yet challenging space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Mustafa Suleyman told CNBC during an interview at the AfroTech Conference in Houston this week that researchers should abandon work aimed at building AI systems that appear conscious. He called it the wrong approach entirely. “I don’t think that is work that people should be doing,” Suleyman said at the conference where he gave a keynote speech. “If you ask the wrong question, you end up with the wrong answer. I think it’s totally the wrong question.” As Microsoft’s leading figure in artificial intelligence, Suleyman has become a prominent critic of efforts to develop AI services that could make people believe the technology can suffer or feel emotions. Last year, he wrote “The Coming Wave,” a book examining dangers posed by AI and similar emerging technologies. In August, he published an essay arguing for building AI to help people rather than imitate them. Growing market for AI companions sparks debate This conversation unfolds amid a competitive race among tech companies to create AI companions, including offerings from Meta and Elon Musk’s xAI. The matter becomes increasingly intricate as the generative AI sector, spearheaded by Sam Altman’s OpenAI, pursues artificial general intelligence, systems capable of human-level cognitive performance. Altman said in August that artificial general intelligence isn’t a particularly helpful term anymore. He said models are simply improving rapidly, and people will depend on them for increasingly more tasks. For Suleyman, separating growing AI capabilities from any possibility of human feelings matters deeply. “Our physical experience of pain is something that makes us very sad and feel terrible, but the AI doesn’t feel sad when it experiences ‘pain,'” Suleyman explained . “It’s a very, very important distinction. It’s really just creating the perception, the seeming narrative of experience and of itself and of consciousness, but that is not what it’s actually experiencing. Technically you know that because we can see what the model is doing.” He pointed to biological naturalism, a theory from philosopher John Searle stating that consciousness requires a living brain’s biological processes. “The reason we give people rights today is because we don’t want to harm them, because they suffer. They have a pain network, and they have preferences which involve avoiding pain,” Suleyman said. “These models don’t have that. It’s just a simulation.” Suleyman acknowledged that studying consciousness remains a developing science. He didn’t call for blocking others from researching the topic, recognizing that different organizations have different goals. However, he stressed his strong opposition to the concept. “They’re not conscious,” he said. “So it would be absurd to pursue research that investigates that question, because they’re not and they can’t be.” Microsoft takes different path than competitors Suleyman is traveling to speak publicly about risks involved in pursuing AI consciousness. Before Houston, he appeared at the Paley International Council Summit in Silicon Valley last week. There, he announced Microsoft won’t create chatbots for sexual content, contrasting with competitors. As reported by Cryptopolitan , Altman revealed in October that ChatGPT now lets adult users have sexual conversations, while xAI offers a provocative anime companion. “You can basically buy those services from other companies, so we’re making decisions about what places that we won’t go,” Suleyman said again at AfroTech. Speaking at AfroTech, Suleyman said he chose Microsoft partly because of its history, stability, and wide technological reach. CEO Satya Nadella personally recruited him. “The other thing to say is that Microsoft needed to be self-sufficient in AI,” he said. Nadella started a mission 18 months ago to ensure the company could train its own models completely in-house using its own data.

According to the latest data from Santiment, the Ethereum exchange reserves are low at the same time as the bearish shorts. This has happened in previous cycles as well. On the other hand, the spotlight has shined brightly on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now at $0.035 in the presale stage and raking in 17,660 supporters and $18.35 million. Thus, it seems to be the best cryptocurrency to purchase today given the desire for secure income rather than volatility. With ETH going through this turbulence, the linear rise of MUTM entices buyers wanting the best of altcoins. Ethereum Faces the Setup of a Possible Short Squeeze Traders have accumulated heavily in the shorts as Ethereum has moved down to $3,700, and this has given Ethereum quite a bearish bias that has been identified as a reversal signal through analytics provided by Santiment. The level of Ethereum reserves has fallen significantly to historic lows, thereby reducing the selling pressure and paving the way for counter-intuitive moments of recovery during each dip. This has been quite trying when looking at the resilience of Ethereum in its core smart contract area. On the other hand, institutions have been doing their best to counter the pessimism, and the $72.5 million ETF purchase made by BlackRock on October 28 being a strong signal that ETH has the best tokenization in the business. This has been a strong indication to the owners of the cryptocurrency that the level of $3,500 might just come to pass as a floor, paving the way for the jump to $4,000. All the same, the volatility of ETH has made many switch their investments. Mutuum Finance Presale Charges Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has moved to phase 6 in its presale event and has been 85% accumulated at the current price of $0.035 per token. This price has seen a 250% increase from the initial price at phase 1 at $0.01. This has helped the project raise $18.35 million from 17,660 unique participants. Phase 6 has been sped up towards the finish, intensifying the rush—to lock in safe tokens before the price surge of 20% to $0.04 in Phase 7, en route to a $0.06 launch that can deliver 410% returns. Yet token holders have already solidified this advantage as their portfolios are ready for the DeFi explosion. Anyone feeling the squeeze of Ethereum’s struggles must look towards the best cryptocurrency to invest in, MUTM. Leaderboard Drives Daily Engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced a 24-hour leaderboard for its dashboard, pitting the top 50 token holders as the day-long leader receives a $500 reward in the form of a $500 MUTM prize for completing the first trade at 00:00 UTC. This has led to some level of competition as the leaders showcase their faith in the project by purchasing tokens worth $2,158.51, $1,819.48, $1,250.89, and $1,052.23. Ethereum struggles as shorts continue to dismantle the price; however, the leaderboard provides the interaction and profits required in the cryptocurrency holdings. Buy-and-Distribute Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a buy-and-distribute system in place, sending fees back to buy tokens on open markets and distribute to mtToken stakers, creating a cycle where the very actions drive price up. As the lending business booms, the effect has been to drive up demand through purchase activities rewarded by additional tokens of Mutuum Finance, further bolstering their status. Giveaway Sparks Increased Level of Participation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced the $100,000 giveaway in order to reward 10 people $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This has contributed significantly to raising the stakes as the community has shown enthusiasm coupled with actual tangible rewards. This has made the community submit their entries to the competition as the whole seems to get involved towards the development of the project. The struggles faced by Ethereum have revealed that the best cryptocurrency to invest in is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM’s yields and passion ignite the hope of 410% ROI in the altcoin’s promises.

Bitcoin balances stood at approximately 64,000 BTC and are a 3.13% decrease from the previous September 22 snapshot. Ethereum holdings fell 5% to around 542,200 ETH. The declines occurred while USDT balances surged 27.89% to approximately 6.389 billion tokens. The proof of reserves snapshot provides transparency into the exchange’s asset backing. Bybit maintains these monthly reports to show sufficient reserves backing all customer deposits. Bitcoin holdings decline 3.13% in October The Bybit user Bitcoin balance fell from 66,048 BTC on September 22 to 63,980 BTC on October 22. The drop of 2,068 BTC is notable considering the price of Bitcoin at the moment. This decrease in funds held may indicate users withdrew Bitcoin, or rotated into other assets during the past month. The exchange kept its reserve ratio for Bitcoin at 103%, meaning the wallet assets were 3% above user deposits. Source: Wu Blockchain . The Bitcoin reserve ratio calculation shows 61,976 BTC in user assets versus 63,980 BTC in wallet assets. Monthly Bitcoin outflows from exchanges typically indicate bullish sentiment by users as they move their holdings to self-custody wallets. Ethereum reserves fell by a larger percentage than Bitcoin, slipping from 570,714 ETH to 542,165 ETH. The 28,549 ETH decline is the equivalent of roughly $105 million at today’s prices. The 5% cut surpassed Bitcoin’s decline of 3.13%. User assets totaled 532,033 ETH while wallet assets contained 542,165 ETH, producing a 101% reserve ratio. The reserve ratio remains healthy but lower than Bitcoin’s 103% backing. USDT’s holdings surge 27.89% as users seek stability While Bitcoin and Ethereum balances declined, USDT holdings rose from 4.995 billion to 6.389 billion tokens. The increase of 1.393 billion USDT equates to a 27.89% gain, the largest percentage change among major assets in the snapshot. The user USDT assets stood at 5.802 billion while wallet holdings reached 6.389 billion, producing a 110% reserve ratio. Stablecoin reserve ratios above 100% instill confidence in the capability of redemption. Ethena’s USDE stablecoin declined the most in the October snapshot. Holdings fell from 871.26 million to 502.11 million tokens, or by 369.15 million USDE. The decline of 42.37% is substantially larger compared to the declines witnessed among the other major assets. The total user assets of USDE stood at 496.25 million with wallet holdings totaling 502.11 million to maintain a 101% reserve ratio. Wallet assets on Bybit still exceeded user deposits for USDE. Reserve ratios show healthy backing across assets The October snapshot revealed reserve ratios exceeding 100% for all major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin maintained 103% backing, Ethereum showed 101%, while most other assets ranged from 100% to 110%. Several tokens displayed higher reserve ratios. USDC reached 153%, UNI showed 117%, and SHRAP maintained 109%. These elevated ratios shows substantial excess reserves beyond customer requirements. PEPE, COMP, CRV, DOGE, and DYDX each maintained 102% reserve ratios. Other tokens like BLUR, OP, DOT, POL, RENDER, S, SAND, SHIB, WLD, and USDE showed exactly 100% or 101% reserve ratios. Stablecoin reserve ratios show particularly strong backing in the October snapshot. USDC led with 153% backing, showing Bybit wallet holdings of 920.25 million versus user assets of 599.38 million.

53978123,619223,1762162251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53978123.jpeg,Solana Foundation Exec Slams XRP Hype: ‘Show Me the Data’,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-foundation-exec-xrp-hype/,"Solana Foundation executive Vibhu Norby ignited a fresh round of cross-ecosystem debate this weekend, challenging XRP supporters to ground their bullish narratives in verifiable network metrics rather than aspiration. In a series of posts on X, Norby said he “want[s] Ripple and XRP to succeed at an insane degree,” but argued that “the community does not argue with facts, even though the data is readily available.” He added: “as a longtime engineer and truth seeker, that bothers me.” Norby Says XRP Growth Stalled The core claim is that—measured by on-chain activity—the XRP Ledger’s growth has been “extremely mediocre” relative to faster-growing chains, most notably Solana. Citing XRPScan, he said the “active daily accounts shows no 3-year improvement, hovering around 25,000 daily active accounts,” while “this year, Solana is averaging over 2.5 million daily active accounts. That’s 100x.” Short of debating sentiment or distant roadmaps, he framed the discussion as empirical: “The fiction is very far ahead of the facts.” The activity gap was a through-line in Norby’s posts. On throughput, he pointed to XRP’s roughly 1–1.5 million daily transactions and contrasted that with Solana’s order-of-magnitude higher traffic: “the total daily transactions, around 1.5 million per day, is outclassed by Solana which is handling about 100 million per day.” While exact daily figures vary with market conditions and data providers, independent dashboards corroborate the broad picture: XRP’s transactions typically sit in the low-single-digit millions per day, while Solana’s effective user-facing throughput has been documented near the ~1,000 TPS range with peaks far higher under stress; counting all transaction types, Solana’s raw transaction count regularly dwarfs legacy chains. “Currently, XRPL is handling about 17 TPS, according to XRPScan. Solana executes 1000 non-vote TPS on mainnet, and often more,” Norby said. Norby also trained attention on value transfer rather than just message count. “XRP’s transfer volume today is about $50–60 billion per month. However, Solana’s October stablecoin transfer volume alone, which is a small subset of all network assets, was almost $2 trillion,” he wrote. Anticipating the most common rejoinder—“oh it’s all fake, bots, etc.”—Norby argued that the Solana-side data excludes wash behavior in the stablecoin tallies he referenced and that fee structures are not a sufficient explanation for alleged bot asymmetry. “Given both XRPL and Solana have similarly low transaction fees, there’s no reason why Solana would uniquely attract bots that XRPL wouldn’t,” he wrote, adding that the on-chain payments edge in Solana remains “a huge measurable margin” even after obvious noise filters. The exchange quickly broadened beyond raw counters to product-market fit . One defender asserted that “XRP isn’t for retail and memecoins. Financial institutions are heavily regulated and slow to adopt.” Norby rebutted that premise bluntly: “They haven’t been slow to adopt – lol. They’re just adopting stablecoins, not XRP.” In a separate reply to a question about what’s driving Solana’s relative outperformance, Norby’s answer was a one-word thesis: “Technology.” He later summarized the posture of the XRP army he believes the data supports with a pointed quip: “Solana is a bridge currency.” Norby also dismissed the idea that RippleNet’s progress should be conflated with on-chain traction: “One cannot have a view on RippleNet because it appears to be simply a private business. Therefore it’s hard to argue it has any bearing on XRP.” That distinction echoes long-standing commentary that RippleNet, as an enterprise messaging and settlement network, can operate independently of XRP unless specific corridors use On-Demand Liquidity mechanisms. “Offchain connections are entirely commoditized,” Norby added, casting political or banking relationships as insufficient substitutes for measurable on-chain usage. As the thread grew, community pushback coalesced around two counterclaims: that XRP’s design goal is institutional settlement rather than retail-heavy app ecosystems, and that a “HODL-heavy” holder base naturally depresses daily active address counts. Norby responded that Solana, too, is held by large numbers of passive investors—“Believe it or not, many people also just buy SOL and hold”—but “the difference is that people also actually use Solana.” He concluded with a challenge: “Open offer to any community member or Ripple executive: let’s do a livestream debate right here on X. You bring facts, I bring facts. Facts are important. Let the internet decide who wins.” He also hosted a public X Space to continue the discussion. https://t.co/DnhmpYDmRX — vibhu (@vibhu) November 2, 2025 None of the above makes Ripple’s endgame impossible. Norby repeatedly allows that “it is very possible that XRPL wins,” framing his argument as a present-tense snapshot rather than a terminal verdict. But his counsel to investors is unsparing: “If you hold XRP as an investment, you need to seriously consider how much longer it’s worth waiting around.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.40.",XRP|SOL news|solana|Solana news|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Scan,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|SOL|XRP|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-03 09:30:51

Related Reading: Forget Billions—XRP Could Hit Trillions, Leading Expert Says The SPAC deal aims to raise $1 billion to build what Evernorth calls a large XRP treasury. Ripple and co-founder Chris Larsen contributed XRP to the project. Nine days after the SPAC announcement, reports said Evernorth had already received $1 billion worth of XRP. The merger is targeted to close in Q1 2026. On Contributions & Cash Buying Because the early inputs were paid in XRP rather than cash, immediate upward pressure on exchange order books did not happen. Market purchases require fiat or cash to be placed into public markets. SBI’s announced $300 million cash pledge is one example of money that could be used to buy XRP outright. But so far most of the headline amounts are XRP moved into a treasury, not fresh cash hitting exchanges. It is my understanding the new @evernorthxrp venture will raise $1BN through XRP direct investment, as announced and as we’ve seen on the chain. So you thinking “how will that affect open market XRP?”. Let me explain. There next plan is to IPO on stock exchange. This will raise… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 27, 2025 Analyst Signals Incoming ‘Shock’ Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and active voice in the XRP community, told followers on X that the bigger event may still be ahead. He said the IPO itself could bring billions in new cash. If those funds are later used to buy XRP on the open market, he warned, existing supply could tighten and a “supply shock” might follow. Van Code did not offer a fixed timetable. Other commentators, including a market voice known as Nietzbux, have already framed the development as strongly bullish for XRP. Why The Timing Matters Based on reports, the sequence is what could change prices: cash raised first, then purchases on public markets. If that order is reversed — cash arrives and large buys follow quickly — liquidity could be tested. Exchanges have varying depth. A single large buyer can move prices more in thin markets than in thick ones. That is simple market mechanics. It is also why some community members are watching the SPAC schedule closely. There will come a time where XRP and XRPL is just where you keep most of your wealth. That is called Treasury. Hint hint. — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 17, 2025 Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashback: Mirror Move Hints At Record-Breaking Surge XRP’s Role And The Broader Narrative A number of developers and analysts now speak of XRP not only as a payment bridge but also as a treasury asset inside the XRPL ecosystem. Van Code suggested that a time may come when people keep a big share of their wealth in XRP and on the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz has emphasized similar ideas about self-custody and on-ledger utility. Those themes are being reused as part of the argument for long-term demand.

South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has officially announced a temporary Bithumb DYDX suspension for deposit and withdrawal services concerning dYdX (DYDX) tokens. This move, while temporary, is crucial for anyone holding or planning to transact with DYDX on the platform. What’s Behind the Bithumb DYDX Suspension? The primary reason for this temporary halt is an essential network upgrade. Starting at 9:00 a.m. UTC on November 6, Bithumb will pause all DYDX deposits and withdrawals. This proactive step ensures the stability and security of the dYdX network, which ultimately benefits all users. Network upgrades are common in the fast-evolving crypto space. They often introduce new features, improve performance, or patch security vulnerabilities. Therefore, such a Bithumb DYDX suspension is a necessary part of maintaining a healthy and robust blockchain ecosystem. How Does This Impact DYDX Holders on Bithumb? For users who hold DYDX on Bithumb, it’s important to understand the immediate implications. During the suspension period, you will not be able to deposit new DYDX tokens into your Bithumb account or withdraw existing DYDX tokens from it. Trading of DYDX on Bithumb, however, is typically unaffected by deposit and withdrawal suspensions, but users should always verify the latest announcements from the exchange. Key Takeaways for Users: Plan Ahead: If you need to move your DYDX tokens, ensure you do so before the 9:00 a.m. UTC deadline on November 6. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Bithumb’s official announcements for updates regarding the upgrade’s progress and the resumption of services. Consider Alternatives (Temporarily): If urgent transactions are required, you might need to explore other platforms where DYDX deposits and withdrawals are active, understanding the associated risks and transfer fees.

While digital assets often march to their own beat, the underlying strength or weakness of traditional fiat currencies, particularly the US Dollar , can send significant ripples through the entire financial ecosystem. As the Dollar continues its upward trajectory, investors are keenly watching crucial private sector data for clues on its next move and the potential implications for everything from Bitcoin to altcoins. This article delves into the forces driving the Dollar’s performance and how key economic indicators could shape the future of both traditional and digital markets. The Resilient US Dollar : A Safe Haven Amidst Uncertainty The US Dollar has consistently demonstrated its role as a global safe haven asset, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or geopolitical instability. Its recent ascent, often measured by the Dollar Index (DXY), reflects a confluence of factors. Global inflation concerns, ongoing conflicts, and a flight to quality among international investors have bolstered demand for the world’s primary reserve currency. This strength isn’t just an abstract financial concept; it has tangible impacts across markets. A stronger Dollar typically means that commodities priced in USD, such as oil and gold, become more expensive for buyers holding other currencies, potentially dampening demand. Conversely, it can make imported goods cheaper for American consumers but makes U.S. exports more expensive, affecting trade balances. For cryptocurrency investors, a robust Dollar can sometimes signal a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, where capital flows out of perceived riskier assets, including digital currencies, and into the relative safety of the Dollar. Understanding these dynamics is vital for anticipating broader market movements. Decoding Private Sector Data : What to Watch For The health of the economy is often best reflected through its Private Sector Data . These reports offer a granular look at business activity, employment, and consumer behavior, providing crucial insights that government-issued statistics might not capture as quickly or comprehensively. For market participants, monitoring these indicators is not just a matter of curiosity; it’s a strategic imperative for forecasting economic trends and potential shifts in monetary policy. Key private sector indicators include: Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI): Published by entities like S&P Global, PMI surveys manufacturing and services sectors. A reading above 50 generally indicates expansion, while below 50 suggests contraction. Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Reports: Similar to PMI, ISM reports provide detailed insights into manufacturing and non-manufacturing (services) sectors, covering new orders, production, employment, and inventories. ADP National Employment Report: This report, published by ADP, estimates private-sector employment changes, often serving as a precursor to the official government jobs report. Retail Sales Data: While sometimes a government release, private aggregators also provide insights into consumer spending, which is a significant driver of economic growth. Consumer Confidence Surveys: Reports from organizations like The Conference Board gauge consumer sentiment about current and future economic conditions, influencing spending patterns. These data points, when viewed collectively, paint a detailed picture of economic momentum. Here’s a quick overview of some critical private sector indicators: Indicator Publisher/Source Frequency Significance PMI (Manufacturing/Services) S&P Global Monthly Measures economic health, business activity, and sentiment in key sectors. ISM (Manufacturing/Services) Institute for Supply Management Monthly Provides broader economic trends, including supply chain health and pricing pressures. ADP Employment Change ADP Monthly Estimates private sector job growth, often impacting market expectations for official labor data. Consumer Confidence Index The Conference Board Monthly Reflects consumer outlook on the economy, influencing future spending and investment. The Ripple Effect of Economic Data on Global Markets The release of significant Economic Data sets off a chain reaction across global financial markets. Central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, meticulously analyze these reports to inform their monetary policy decisions. Stronger-than-expected data indicating robust growth or persistent inflation can prompt a more hawkish stance, leading to interest rate hikes or a continuation of restrictive policies. Conversely, weaker data might signal a need for more accommodative policies, such as rate cuts or quantitative easing. This interplay has profound effects. For equity markets, higher interest rates can increase borrowing costs for companies and reduce the present value of future earnings, potentially leading to stock market corrections. Bond yields tend to rise with expectations of higher rates, making fixed-income investments more attractive relative to riskier assets. The cryptocurrency market, while often seen as uncorrelated, is increasingly sensitive to these macro shifts. When traditional markets face headwinds due to tighter monetary policy, the ‘risk-off’ sentiment can spill over, leading to downward pressure on digital asset prices. The challenge for investors lies in discerning genuine trends from temporary noise and understanding how conflicting data points might influence policy makers. Navigating Dynamic Forex Market Trends : Strategies for Investors The foreign exchange (Forex) market is the largest and most liquid financial market globally, where currencies are traded. Understanding Forex Market Trends is crucial for international businesses, global investors, and even individual traders. The US Dollar’s strength or weakness directly impacts major currency pairs like EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD. For instance, if the Dollar strengthens against the Euro, the EUR/USD pair will typically decline. Investors can employ various strategies to navigate these trends. Carry trades, where one borrows in a low-interest-rate currency and invests in a high-interest-rate currency, can be profitable when interest rate differentials widen. Businesses engaged in international trade often use Forex markets to hedge against currency fluctuations, mitigating the risk of adverse exchange rate movements impacting their profits. Individual traders utilize both technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) and fundamental analysis (economic data, central bank policies) to make informed decisions. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Regularly check economic calendars for upcoming data releases and central bank announcements. Monitor Interest Rate Differentials: These are key drivers for currency movements. Diversify: Consider how currency movements might impact your overall portfolio, especially if you hold international assets. Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing to manage exposure to volatile currency pairs. The benefits of engaging with Forex include its 24/5 accessibility and high liquidity, offering numerous opportunities for both hedging and speculation, provided one approaches it with a well-researched strategy. Shaping the Interest Rate Outlook : The Fed’s Next Move At the heart of the Dollar’s trajectory and broader market sentiment is the Interest Rate Outlook , primarily dictated by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. The Fed operates under a dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and maintaining price stability (controlling inflation). Every piece of economic data, especially from the private sector, is scrutinized for clues on how it might influence these objectives and, consequently, the Fed’s next move on interest rates. If private sector data suggests a robust labor market and persistent inflationary pressures, the Fed is more likely to maintain a hawkish stance, potentially signaling further rate hikes or a prolonged period of higher rates. Conversely, signs of economic slowdown or cooling inflation could lead to a more dovish outlook, paving the way for rate cuts. Higher interest rates typically strengthen the Dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive to foreign investors seeking better yields. This can lead to capital inflows, further boosting the Dollar’s value. The implications are far-reaching: from the cost of borrowing for mortgages and corporate loans to the attractiveness of various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, which may become less appealing when risk-free returns from bonds are higher. The ongoing challenge for the Fed is to navigate these complex signals, balancing the need to control inflation without triggering a severe economic downturn. A Vigilant Eye on Macro Trends for Smarter Decisions The intricate dance between the US Dollar , crucial Private Sector Data , and the resulting Forex Market Trends underscores the interconnectedness of global finance. As investors, particularly those in the volatile cryptocurrency space, it is imperative to keep a vigilant eye on these macroeconomic indicators. The strength of the Dollar, influenced by economic reports and the prevailing Interest Rate Outlook , serves as a powerful barometer for overall market sentiment. Understanding these dynamics allows for more informed decision-making, enabling investors to better anticipate market shifts and adjust their strategies accordingly. In a world where financial markets are increasingly intertwined, knowledge of these fundamental drivers is not just an advantage; it’s a necessity for navigating the complex landscape and seizing opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the DXY and why is it important? A1: The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is a measure of the value of the US Dollar relative to a basket of six major foreign currencies. It’s important because it provides a general indication of the Dollar’s strength or weakness on a global scale, influencing everything from commodity prices to international trade. Q2: How does private sector data differ from government data? A2: Private sector data, often collected by organizations like S&P Global , the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) , and ADP , focuses on specific industries or segments of the economy based on surveys and proprietary methodologies. Government data, collected by agencies like the U.S. Census Bureau or the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is typically broader, more official, and often subject to revisions. Both are crucial for a comprehensive economic picture. Q3: What is the impact of a strong Dollar on cryptocurrency? A3: A strong Dollar can have a mixed impact on cryptocurrency. Often, it signals a ‘risk-off’ environment where investors prefer safer assets, potentially leading to outflows from riskier assets like crypto. However, some argue that Bitcoin, in particular, can also act as a hedge against fiat currency instability, especially in countries experiencing hyperinflation or currency devaluation. Q4: Who publishes the most influential private sector economic reports? A4: Some of the most influential private sector economic reports are published by organizations such as S&P Global (for PMIs), the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) (for ISM Manufacturing and Services reports), ADP (for employment data), and The Conference Board (for Consumer Confidence). Q5: How can investors use economic data to inform their trading decisions? A5: Investors can use economic data to anticipate potential shifts in central bank monetary policy, identify emerging economic trends, and gauge market sentiment. Strong data might suggest a bullish outlook for the Dollar and potentially a bearish one for riskier assets if it implies higher interest rates. Conversely, weak data could signal the opposite. By integrating data analysis into their strategies, investors can make more informed decisions across various asset classes.

They are a popular tool for both hedging and leveraged trading. The Binance perpetual futures delisting means these specific contracts will no longer be available for trading on the platform. Why Does Binance Announce a Perpetual Futures Delisting? Exchange delistings, especially for perpetual futures, often stem from a range of factors. While Binance hasn’t provided detailed explanations for this specific Binance perpetual futures delisting , common reasons include: Low Liquidity: Contracts with insufficient trading volume can become difficult to manage, leading to poor price discovery and increased volatility.

Recently, prediction markets expanded above $1B in monthly volumes. Kalshi prediction markets set a monthly trading volume record, breaking above $4.39B in October. The platform, which does not rely on a blockchain to settle its predictions, relied mostly on sports bets to get ahead of Polymarket. Kalshi activity reached peak levels in October, driven by the overall expansion of prediction markets and interest in trading current events. | Source: Dune Analytics . For Kalshi, the strongest week was at the end of October, when the platform achieved nearly $1B in notional volumes. In the past month, overall Kalshi activity was at a higher baseline. Kalshi also gained exposure on a general expansion of prediction markets, linked to active current events. The activity did not always reflect the accuracy of predictions, as the platform recently miscalculated the results of the Dutch elections, alongside Polymarket. Kalshi taps Web2 users While Polymarket existed for crypto natives, Kalshi’s success lies in quickly reaching Web2 users. The integration with Robinhood and the general availability of predictions gives Kalshi a head start in mainstream adoption. Polymarket still relies on wallet and crypto usage, and has a barrier to entry, still requiring some crypto ownership. Despite the expanded marketing, Kalshi still went through glitches, including a market outage. Polymarket also had a temporary outage, though still allowing experienced traders to use its API and continue their positions. The platform is still viewed with skepticism, due to its aggressive influencer marketing, and attempts to take over crypto native traders. Can Kalshi pass Polymarket? In October, Polymarket came in second among prediction markets, with $2.29B in cumulative volumes. For Polymarket, this was the most successful month since October 2024, when volumes surpassed $2B for the first time. Polymarket relied on smaller bets, surpassing its activity levels from the last quarter of 2024. As of October 31, the exchange carried over 76K active wallets, breaking the record from the activity surrounding the US Presidential Elections in 2024. Active wallets expanded from lows of around 14K in October, showing Polymarket could reverse its fortunes. In late 2025, Polymarket still carries most of the volumes for current events. On both Kalshi and Polymarket, the New York mayoral election is still the most active prediction pair. Kalshi reported volumes above $71B, but Polymarket’s pair reported $365M in trades, showing heightened activity and remaining the leading market for the past month. As of November 2025, Polymarket searches on Google are also more active compared to interest in Kalshi. In the past couple of weeks, attention for Polymarket is also higher. The on-chain platform is also widely used in the hopes of an eventual airdrop. Both Kalshi and Polymarket are still facing doubts that their approach to risk is not actual gambling. How prediction markets are viewed by users, and regulated by regional authorities, may be the main factor in limiting growth. In the coming year, Kalshi and Polymarket may also meet with more competition from other rising platforms. As crypto trading slows down, predictions may become a key alternative to direct trading.

With volatility dropping and volume remaining high, several analysts are pointing to this monthly close as a potential turning point. Fibonacci Support Has Held Since 2023 BTC has exhibited a transparent trend since the beginning of 2023. Support has been located at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level for every significant correction so far. These levels—approximately $24,843, $49,200, $79,225, and currently $100,547—have indicated local bottoms prior to the recovery of the price. Source: Cas Abbé/X Notably, the most recent monthly candle dropped to the $100,500 area and bounced. This level now serves as a key reference point. According to analyst Cas Abbé, “ If BTC closes a monthly candle below it, the bull run will be most likely over. ” The price remains above this threshold for now, but the margin is narrowing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s weekly chart is also showing technical stress. According to Super₿ro, the Bollinger Bands are now at their tightest point on record, with the Bollinger Band Width indicator near 15. This level reflects a rare drop in volatility, often seen before sharp price moves.

BTC took out the lower bound around $108,500, clearing that level. Another cluster remains near $112,000, with stronger interest building between $105,000 and $106,000. Ted Pillows pointed to large bids around the $106,000–$107,000 zone and added, “What if we dump in the first week and then pump to a new ATH?” These levels are also near long liquidation zones, which could trigger more volatility in the short term. Long-Term Holders Are Selling Into Strength Data from CryptoQuant shows that long-term holders sold over $33 billion worth of BTC in October. This created daily selling pressure of up to $1 billion. CryptoPatel noted that these units came from addresses active across multiple market cycles. “These aren’t weak hands. These are OGs booking profits near the top,” they said. Demand from US investors has slowed in recent weeks, and some large traders have started taking short positions. One of them is Peter Brandt, who confirmed a short in Bitcoin futures.

This increase was primarily driven by investors seeking yield opportunities during the crypto market's slowdown. Stablecoin Transaction Volume on the Ethereum Network Reaches Record $2.8 Trillion in October In October, stablecoin volume on Ethereum surpassed the previous record of $1.94 trillion (September 2025), increasing by 45% month-over-month. Circle's USDC led the way in volume, with $1.62 trillion in transactions. Tether (USDT) came in second with $895.5 billion. MakerDAO's DAI stablecoin came in third with $136 billion in volume. Presto Research analyst Min Jung noted that interest in the stablecoin sector has surged following Circle's IPO and the passage of the Genius Act. Yield farming, particularly around “liquid yield tokens,” has become extremely active, Jung said. At a time when Bitcoin and Ethereum lost 11.5% of their market value and 16.4%, investors were observed using stablecoins as a liquidity management and yield tool. Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu stated that investors were holding their capital in stablecoins to allocate it to new opportunities during this period. According to experts, this record increase in stablecoin transaction volume indicates that the sector is maturing and is no longer just speculative but expanding into real use cases such as payments and cross-border transactions. *This is not investment advice.

In a significant shift, the firm has revised its US Dollar forecast upwards, signaling a potentially stronger greenback for longer. This pivotal adjustment is rooted in two primary factors: the Federal Reserve’s cautious approach to interest rate cuts and the burgeoning economic advantage the United States is gaining from its leadership in artificial intelligence. For investors, traders, and anyone keen on understanding global macro trends, this shift has profound implications. Let’s explore the driving forces behind UBS’s updated outlook and what it could mean for the global economy and your portfolio. Why the US Dollar Forecast is Shifting? UBS’s revised outlook for the US Dollar is not just a minor tweak; it reflects a fundamental reassessment of global economic dynamics. Historically, the dollar’s strength often correlates with interest rate differentials and economic stability. The current recalibration by UBS points to a sustained period where the US economy is expected to outperform its peers, making dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Interest Rate Differentials: The expectation of higher-for-longer interest rates in the US, compared to other major economies, makes holding dollars more appealing for yield-seeking investors. Economic Resilience: The US economy has shown remarkable resilience, consistently surprising analysts with strong employment figures and consumer spending, even in the face of tighter monetary policy. Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of global uncertainty, the US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency. Ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic slowdowns in other regions enhance this appeal. This upward revision suggests that previous expectations for a significant dollar depreciation were premature. Instead, UBS now anticipates the dollar to maintain its strength, potentially appreciating against major currencies like the Euro and the Japanese Yen. This forecast is a critical piece of information for businesses engaged in international trade and investors with diversified portfolios. The Slower Pace of Fed Rate Cuts : What It Means At the heart of UBS’s updated forecast is the Federal Reserve’s evolving stance on monetary policy. The market had initially priced in aggressive rate cuts for 2024, but persistent inflation and robust economic data have prompted the Fed to adopt a more measured approach. This slower pace of Fed rate cuts is a key determinant of dollar strength. What Factors Influence the Fed’s Decision? The Federal Reserve’s mandate includes achieving maximum employment and stable prices. Several indicators guide its policy decisions: Inflation Data: While inflation has moderated from its peaks, it remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is a particular concern. Employment Figures: The US labor market has remained remarkably strong, with low unemployment rates and consistent job growth. This strength reduces the urgency for the Fed to stimulate the economy through rate cuts. Economic Growth: Better-than-expected GDP growth indicates that the economy can withstand current interest rate levels without falling into recession. Originally, markets anticipated three to five rate cuts in 2024. Now, the consensus is shifting towards fewer cuts, perhaps two or even one, starting later in the year. This “higher for longer” interest rate environment in the US makes dollar-denominated assets, such as Treasury bonds, more attractive compared to those in economies where central banks are expected to cut rates sooner or more aggressively. This differential in interest rates directly supports a stronger dollar, as global capital flows towards higher-yielding opportunities. America’s Emerging AI Advantage Perhaps the most forward-looking aspect of UBS’s revised forecast is the emphasis on the United States’ leadership in artificial intelligence. The AI advantage is not just a technological edge; it’s rapidly translating into tangible economic benefits, boosting productivity, fostering innovation, and attracting significant investment. How is AI Boosting the US Economy? Productivity Growth: AI technologies are enabling businesses across various sectors to automate tasks, optimize processes, and make data-driven decisions, leading to significant gains in productivity. This productivity surge can help offset inflationary pressures and support stronger economic growth without overheating. Innovation Hub: The US is home to the world’s leading AI research institutions, tech giants, and a vibrant startup ecosystem. This environment fosters continuous innovation, creating new industries and job opportunities. Companies like NVIDIA and OpenAI are at the forefront, driving massive investment and technological advancements. Capital Inflow: Global capital is increasingly flowing into US-based AI companies and related infrastructure. This investment not only fuels further growth but also strengthens the dollar as foreign investors convert their currencies to invest in the booming US tech sector. Talent Attraction: The US continues to attract top AI talent from around the globe, further solidifying its position as the epicenter of AI development and application. This technological lead provides a structural tailwind for the US economy, differentiating it from other developed nations that may not be as far along in AI adoption and innovation. The economic benefits from AI are expected to be long-lasting, providing a sustained boost to US competitiveness and attractiveness for investors. UBS Economic Outlook : Key Drivers and Projections The latest UBS economic outlook paints a picture of a resilient US economy supported by a hawkish Federal Reserve and a transformative technological wave. Their projections now factor in a more protracted period of dollar strength, influencing various currency pairs and global capital flows. What are UBS’s Specific Projections? While specific numerical forecasts can fluctuate, the core message from UBS is clear: the dollar is expected to remain strong against major currencies for the foreseeable future. This contrasts with earlier predictions from many analysts who foresaw a significant weakening of the dollar as global central banks caught up with the Fed’s tightening cycle. The revised outlook impacts: EUR/USD: Expected to trade at lower levels than previously anticipated, reflecting the diverging economic paths and monetary policies between the Eurozone and the US. USD/JPY: Likely to remain elevated, given the Bank of Japan’s continued ultra-loose monetary policy and the significant interest rate differential. Emerging Market Currencies: A stronger dollar typically puts pressure on emerging market currencies, making dollar-denominated debt more expensive and potentially leading to capital outflows. This comprehensive assessment by UBS underscores the interconnectedness of monetary policy, technological innovation, and currency markets. Their analysis provides a crucial benchmark for understanding the likely trajectory of the dollar in the coming months. Navigating the Global Economy : Investor Insights For investors, understanding the implications of a stronger dollar and a robust US economy is paramount. The shift in the global economy ‘s landscape, as highlighted by UBS, demands a strategic re-evaluation of portfolios. What Should Investors Consider? Dollar-Denominated Assets: A stronger dollar enhances the returns for international investors holding US assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, when those returns are converted back to their local currencies. US Equity Market: The US equity market, particularly the technology and AI sectors, is likely to remain attractive due to strong corporate earnings potential and innovation. Companies benefiting directly from AI advancements could see continued growth. Commodities: A strong dollar often has a dampening effect on commodity prices, as most commodities are priced in dollars, making them more expensive for non-dollar holders. Currency Hedging: For international investors with significant exposure to non-dollar assets, considering currency hedging strategies might be prudent to mitigate potential losses from a depreciating local currency against the dollar. Diversification: While the US outlook is strong, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and geographies remains a fundamental principle of sound investment. The interplay of monetary policy, technological leadership, and geopolitical factors creates a dynamic environment. Investors who adapt their strategies to these evolving conditions will be better positioned to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the outlook for the US dollar and economy appears robust, it is important to acknowledge potential challenges and risks that could alter this trajectory. Persistent Inflation: If inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated, forcing the Fed to maintain higher rates for an even longer period, it could eventually stifle economic growth. Global Economic Slowdown: A significant slowdown in other major economies could eventually drag down US exports and corporate earnings, impacting overall growth. Geopolitical Risks: Escalating geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world could trigger market volatility and impact investor confidence, potentially leading to unpredictable capital flows. AI Regulation and Ethics: While AI offers immense benefits, increasing regulatory scrutiny or unforeseen ethical challenges could slow its adoption or impact the profitability of AI companies. Fiscal Health: Concerns about the US national debt and fiscal deficits could eventually weigh on investor sentiment and the dollar’s long-term stability. These factors highlight that economic forecasts are always subject to revision based on new data and unfolding events. Vigilance and adaptability remain key for navigating the financial markets. Conclusion: The Dollar’s Enduring Strength in an AI-Driven Era UBS’s revised dollar forecast marks a significant moment in global financial markets. Driven by a Federal Reserve committed to combating inflation with a slower pace of rate cuts, and critically, by the United States’ undeniable lead in artificial intelligence, the dollar is poised for a period of sustained strength. This confluence of prudent monetary policy and transformative technological innovation is creating a powerful economic tailwind for the US. For investors, this means a re-evaluation of strategies, with a potential emphasis on dollar-denominated assets and the burgeoning AI sector. While challenges remain, the narrative of US economic resilience, fueled by its AI advantage, is set to dominate the global financial discourse for the foreseeable future, offering both opportunities and a call for strategic adaptation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding UBS’s latest dollar forecast and its implications: What is UBS’s updated US Dollar forecast? UBS has raised its forecast for the US Dollar, predicting a stronger greenback for a longer period. This is a significant shift from earlier expectations of a more rapid depreciation, reflecting a more optimistic view of the US economy’s resilience and its technological edge. Why is the Federal Reserve slowing its rate cuts? The Federal Reserve is adopting a cautious approach to rate cuts primarily due to persistent inflation remaining above its 2% target and a surprisingly strong US labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have indicated a need for more evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards the target before making aggressive cuts. How does the US’s AI advantage impact the dollar? The US’s leadership in artificial intelligence is driving significant productivity gains, fostering innovation, and attracting substantial global capital into its tech sector. This economic boost makes the US an attractive investment destination, increasing demand for the dollar and contributing to its strength. Companies like NVIDIA and OpenAI are examples of this driving force. What are the implications for global investors? A stronger dollar generally makes dollar-denominated assets more appealing. Investors might consider increasing exposure to US equities, particularly in the tech and AI sectors. It also means other currencies might weaken against the dollar, impacting international trade and investment flows. Diversification and currency hedging strategies become more relevant. Could this outlook change? Yes, economic forecasts are dynamic. Factors such as unexpected inflation surges, a severe global economic downturn, significant geopolitical events, or shifts in central bank policies could all lead to revisions in the outlook. Investors should remain informed and adaptable.

Matteï received backing from both socialist and far-right members to add a new clause dubbed Article 977 to France’s tax code, which introduces a tax on “unproductive wealth.” However, it still must pass through the Senate and be included in the final 2026 budget before it becomes law. Under the amendment , the levy would be set at a flat rate of 1%, applied to the portion of net taxable assets exceeding €2 million. The measure also comes with an additional excise tax on tobacco products to supposedly balance the projected loss in government revenue, If enacted, it would replace the country’s current real estate wealth tax framework, Impôt sur la Fortune Immobilière (IFI), with a broader system encompassing several other assets. French lawmakers are reforming a decades-old wealth tax law for crypto France abolished its previous general wealth tax in 2018, replacing it with the IFI, which applies only to real estate not tied to professional activity. Matteï told the National Assembly that this legislation is “economically inconsistent,” excluding from taxation several forms of “idle wealth” like gold, art, and digital assets, while penalizing property that contributes to the economy. “The reform removes productive real estate from the base, properties rented for more than one year and meeting environmental standards, while integrating unproductive assets: non-productive real estate, tangible movable property like gold, cars, yachts, digital assets, and life insurance funds not allocated to productive investment,” the amendment’s explanatory note read. The reaction from the French crypto community has been strongly negative, with naysayers like Éric Larchevêque, co-founder of hardware wallet maker Ledger, saying it “punishes all savers who wish to financially anchor themselves to gold and Bitcoin in order to protect their future.” Writing about his sentiments on X last Saturday, Larchevêque told individuals holding substantial amounts of digital assets they might be forced to sell their crypto holdings to meet tax obligations if they lack other liquid assets. Après le rejet de la taxe Zucman, je pensais qu'on allait enfin pouvoir passer à autre chose et revenir à nos vrais sujets positifs de contribution économique au pays. Mais voila que l'amendement de l'IFI sur la richesse ""improductive"" a été voté hier soir. Seront désormais… — Eric Larchevêque (@EricLarch) November 1, 2025 He also cautioned that while the initial threshold is set at €2 million, lawmakers could later lower it, which could negatively impact investors within France’s borders. “Crypto is equated with an unproductive reserve, not useful to the real economy. This is a major ideological error, punishing the holding of value outside the fiat monetary system,” Larchevêque concluded. According to Cyrille Briere, a decentralized finance entrepreneur and consultant for Lagoon Finance, the law only affects crypto holdings, as the government has exempted stocks. “France recently voted a 1% yearly capital tax on unproductive assets when their worth exceeds €1.3 million. Yes, you read correctly: capital, not profit. That asset class includes cryptos but excludes stocks,” he wrote on X Sunday evening, responding to Larchevêque’s opinionated post. Briere stated that the measure might discourage investment and innovation and challenged lawmakers’ motives for safeguarding traditional financial instruments while going after Bitcoin holders. “If you don’t want your cryptos stolen either by kidnappers or the state,” he added sarcastically, “just ask your old pal Larry Fink to convert them to stocks.” France looking to accumulate BTC amid taxation queries French lawmakers are pushing to tax “unproductive crypto wealth” just a week after pro-crypto proponents tabled a bill proposing to accumulate up to 2% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply in a national strategic reserve, similar to the plans of the current US administration. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the proposal championed by Eric Ciotti, the president of the center-right Union of the Right (UDR), could make France the first European country to formally establish a Bitcoin treasury. Alexander Laizet, Director of Bitcoin Strategy at The Blockchain Group, explained that the initiative could acquire approximately 420,000 BTC over a period of seven to eight years through nuclear and hydroelectric-powered mining, combined with perpetual holding of the coins.

November 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Founder of Strategy, Saylor, has hinted at another major Bitcoin Purchase, which will make it the company’s 13th consecutive $BTC buying streak. In a post on X, Saylor noted that ‘Orange is the color of November.’ Historically ‘Orange’ hints from Saylor have meant that a Bitcoin buy is in the offing. With Strategy already holding 640,808 BTC , the company’s portfolio has appreciated by over 48% since its inception. That said, the company’s last buy was just last Monday where it accumulated another 390 $BTC. Strategy’s most recent purchase amid the recent market volatility is another example of Saylor’s unshakable faith in Bitcoin and its long-term value. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has waved the truce flag with China by signing a new trade deal with President Xi. With Saylor’s bullish tweet and favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, analysts expect $BTC to rally this November. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Layer-2 scalability project designed to make life easier for $BTC holders, is now perfectly positioned to ride this momentum. Find out what makes Bitcoin Hyper the next crypto to explode. Bitwise CEO Says Wall Street Will Dive Into Crypto Within a Year — Is Pepenode ($PEPE) the Next Crypto to Explode? November 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitwise’s Hunter Horseley cited on X that every wall street institution will be involved in crypto by next year. His forecast isn’t farfetched as the growing trend in TradFi show that global institutions managing over $30T are actively expanding their exposure to digital assets. Although DeFi only accounts for less than 0.5% of TradFi’s total market scope , its growing influence is evident through tokenization, yield products, and programmable real-world asset structures.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are climbing again, and traders are analyzing crypto charts to find the next major opportunity. Investors are now looking for projects that offer real use cases, not just hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out as a crypto to buy now, combining strong presale demand with innovative lending features and stablecoin-backed reliability. Its design is focused on long-term value creation, making it a strategic choice for those preparing for the next bull run. Presale Strength and Early Gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4 billion tokens and has already generated about $18.3 million across presale phases. Currently in Phase 6 at $0.035, 72% of the 170 million token allocation has been sold to over 17,700 holders. The next phase will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% increase. An investor who swapped $5,000 in SOL for Phase 1 MUTM at $0.01 now holds a stake worth $17,500 and will reach $30,000 when the token reaches Phase 11 pricing at $0.06. Analysts forecast up to 8x growth post-listing as platform adoption increases. This presale momentum demonstrates strong demand and positions MUTM as a top contender for attention from both retail and institutional participants, including crypto ETF funds that track emerging high-demand tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building dual lending options through Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. Investors will lend, borrow, and earn interest while keeping their assets as collateral. The upcoming V1 of protocol on Sepolia Testnet, launching in Q4 2025, will include Liquidity Pools, mtToken, and Debt Token systems. In the early stage, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This infrastructure ensures that participants experience real decentralized finance operations, not just presale promises, giving early adopters exposure to working DeFi mechanics. Stablecoin Innovation and Oracle Reliability A major growth driver for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be its decentralized stablecoin, pegged at $1. Users will mint the stablecoin when borrowing against ETH and burn it when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust interest rates to keep the peg stable, while arbitrage mechanisms will maintain balance. Overcollateralization protects the system, ensuring security for all participants. This stablecoin will create a reliable flow of borrowing activity, leading to continuous lending volume, recurring platform fees, and stronger MUTM ecosystem benefits. Early and long-term users will profit from this structure as it supports consistent token demand and platform growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also use Chainlink-based oracles for precise price discovery. Fallback oracles and aggregated feeds will support redundancy, ensuring accurate valuations for ETH, BTC, and stablecoins. The logic is straightforward: accurate prices lead to fewer wrongful liquidations, increasing confidence from large lenders, attracting more liquidity, driving borrowing activity, raising platform revenue, and fueling ecosystem growth. This reliable pricing will position MUTM as a secure, transparent choice in a bullish market, appealing to investors seeking a stable, performance-driven asset. Exchange Readiness and Market Visibility With proven presale traction and a functioning testnet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to gain attention from Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges. A listing will amplify exposure, attract new investors, increase liquidity inflows, and enhance global visibility. A market strategist who correctly predicted DOT’s early bull run now projects MUTM to surge 10× within its first quarter of listing, citing its verified audit, working DeFi infrastructure, and growing community support. Exchange participation will create further momentum, making early acquisition during the presale a strategic advantage for investors looking to maximize returns in the next market upswing. Security and Leaderboard Incentives Security remains a cornerstone for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project will operate under the guidance of a CertiK audit, including Manual Review and Static Analysis, with a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and Skynet 79.00, requested on 2/25/2025 and revised 5/20/2025. The 50,000 USDT bug bounty program incentivizes reporting of issues, rewarding critical findings up to $2,000 and lower severity issues proportionally. These measures ensure that the mainnet will launch securely, instilling confidence in new participants as the bullish cycle gains momentum. A new update has been added to the 24-hour leaderboard — a daily reward system. The user who ranks first each day will earn a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they make at least one transaction during that 24-hour period. The leaderboard refreshes automatically at 00:00 UTC every day. The next price rise for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be to $0.040, and Phase 6 is almost sold out. MUTM is the best crypto to buy right now because it has stablecoin-backed lending, accurate oracle-based pricing, and a lot of people are buying it before it becomes public. Investors getting ready for a bull market will find its infrastructure, security, and exchange readiness very appealing. Don’t wait until it goes public; the next market leader is being constructed right now, and those who get in early will benefit from an ecosystem that is growing quickly and is in high demand.

Near Protocol price prediction is a hot topic among investors and blockchain enthusiasts alike. With its innovative technology and growing ecosystem, Near Protocol has carved a significant niche. Many are now asking: could NEAR crypto be on the verge of an explosive surge, potentially doubling its value by 2030? This comprehensive guide dives deep into the factors influencing NEAR’s future, offering insights into its potential trajectory over the coming years. Understanding Near Protocol: What Drives NEAR Crypto? Before we delve into specific price predictions, it’s crucial to understand what Near Protocol is and what makes it unique. Near Protocol is a decentralized application platform designed to make dApps usable on the web. It aims to solve some of the most pressing challenges faced by other blockchain networks, such as scalability, speed, and user-friendliness. Sharding Technology: Near Protocol utilizes a unique sharding mechanism called Nightshade.

These core technological advantages position Near Protocol as a strong contender in the competitive Layer 1 blockchain space, attracting developers and users who seek efficient and scalable solutions. Historical Performance: A Look Back at NEAR Token Analysis To project future movements, a thorough NEAR token analysis of its past performance is essential. Since its launch, NEAR has experienced periods of significant growth and market corrections, characteristic of the volatile crypto market. The token’s journey has been marked by: Initial Public Offering (IPO) and Early Growth: After its launch, NEAR gained traction, benefiting from the broader crypto bull runs and increasing interest in scalable blockchain solutions. Market Corrections: Like most cryptocurrencies, NEAR has also faced downturns during bear markets, testing the resilience of its community and technology. Key Milestones: Price surges often correlated with major protocol upgrades, successful ecosystem projects, significant partnerships, or increased developer activity on the network. Understanding these historical trends helps us contextualize current market conditions and anticipate how future developments might impact the Near Protocol price prediction . The token has demonstrated its ability to recover and grow, reflecting underlying confidence in its technology and vision. Factors Influencing Near Protocol Price Prediction Predicting cryptocurrency prices is complex, influenced by a multitude of interconnected factors. For a robust Near Protocol price prediction , we must consider both internal protocol developments and external market dynamics. Here are some critical factors: Technological Advancements and Upgrades: Continuous improvements to Near’s sharding, scalability, and security features can significantly boost investor confidence and adoption. The successful implementation of new functionalities makes the network more attractive for dApp development and user engagement. Ecosystem Growth and Adoption: The number of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Near, the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi protocols, and the expansion of its user base are vital indicators. More projects and users mean higher demand for NEAR crypto for transactions, staking, and governance. Partnerships and Integrations: Collaborations with major tech companies, other blockchain networks, or traditional finance institutions can open up new use cases and introduce Near to a broader audience, driving demand. Macroeconomic Conditions and Regulatory Environment: Broader economic trends, such as inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Additionally, evolving crypto regulations worldwide can either foster or hinder adoption. Competitive Landscape: Near operates in a highly competitive Layer 1 blockchain space, vying with established players like Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot. Its ability to innovate and maintain a competitive edge is crucial for sustained growth. Market Sentiment and Speculation: Social media trends, news cycles, and overall market sentiment play a significant role in short-term price movements. Hype and fear can lead to rapid price swings. These elements combine to create a dynamic environment where the value of NEAR is constantly being reassessed by the market. NEAR Price Forecast: Expert Insights for 2025 Looking ahead to 2025, various analysts and models offer a range of perspectives on the NEAR price forecast . The general sentiment leans towards continued growth, driven by anticipated advancements within the Near ecosystem and a potential resurgence in the broader crypto market. Many experts believe that by 2025, Near Protocol will have further cemented its position as a leading Layer 1 blockchain. The completion of key roadmap milestones, such as further sharding enhancements and increased interoperability with other chains, could act as significant catalysts. Potential Scenarios for NEAR in 2025: Bullish Scenario: If the overall crypto market experiences another bull run, fueled by institutional adoption and clearer regulatory frameworks, NEAR could see substantial gains. Strong dApp growth, particularly in DeFi and NFTs on the Near network, would further bolster its value. In this scenario, some predictions suggest NEAR could reach significant new highs, potentially surpassing previous all-time highs. Moderate Growth Scenario: A more conservative outlook anticipates steady but less dramatic growth. This would be driven by organic adoption and consistent development, even if the broader market remains somewhat subdued. NEAR would continue to build its ecosystem and attract users, leading to gradual price appreciation. Bearish Scenario: Should the crypto market face prolonged downturns, or if Near Protocol encounters significant technical challenges or fails to attract sufficient developer talent and user adoption, its price could stagnate or decline. Increased competition could also pressure its market share. While specific price targets vary widely, the consensus points to a positive outlook for Near Protocol 2025 , contingent on successful execution of its roadmap and favorable market conditions. Investors should conduct their own research and consider these various possibilities. Navigating the Future: Near Protocol 2026-2030 Outlook The long-term outlook for Near Protocol 2025 (extending to 2026-2030) suggests an even greater potential for growth, including the possibility of an explosive 2X surge or more. This extended timeframe allows for the full maturation of Near’s technology and widespread adoption. By 2030, the blockchain landscape is expected to be vastly different, with highly scalable and interoperable networks taking center stage. Near Protocol’s foundational design, focusing on sharding and usability, positions it well to thrive in such an environment. Key drivers for long-term growth: Mass Adoption of Web3: As Web3 technologies become more integrated into daily life, platforms like Near, which prioritize user experience, are likely to see exponential growth in user numbers and transaction volume. Interoperability Solutions: Near’s commitment to interoperability, connecting with other blockchains, will be crucial. This allows for seamless transfer of assets and data, expanding its utility and network effects. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): The increasing prevalence of DAOs built on Near could drive demand for NEAR tokens for governance and participation. Continued Innovation: The Near Foundation’s dedication to research and development will ensure the protocol remains at the forefront of blockchain innovation, adapting to new challenges and opportunities. If Near Protocol successfully executes its long-term vision, maintains its technological edge, and fosters a vibrant ecosystem, achieving a 2X surge from current levels by 2030 is a realistic, if not conservative, projection. Some more optimistic models even foresee higher multiples, driven by widespread institutional and retail adoption. Potential Challenges and Risks for NEAR While the future for Near Protocol appears promising, it’s important to acknowledge the potential challenges and risks that could impact its growth trajectory and NEAR price forecast . Intense Competition: The Layer 1 blockchain space is fiercely competitive. Near must continuously innovate to stay ahead of rivals like Ethereum (with its scaling solutions), Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot, which also offer high-performance alternatives. Technological Hurdles: Implementing advanced sharding and maintaining network security at scale are complex tasks. Any significant technical setbacks or vulnerabilities could erode trust and hinder adoption. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies poses a risk. Unfavorable regulations in key markets could impact NEAR’s accessibility and utility. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. External market shocks, global economic downturns, or significant shifts in investor sentiment can lead to rapid price corrections, regardless of a project’s fundamentals. Centralization Concerns: While Near is decentralized, concerns about validator distribution or governance concentration could arise as the network scales, potentially impacting its long-term appeal. Investors should carefully weigh these risks against the potential rewards when considering an investment in NEAR crypto . Actionable Insights for Investors: Is NEAR a Buy? Given the detailed NEAR token analysis and future projections, what are the actionable insights for potential investors? Deciding whether NEAR is a good investment depends on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and personal research. Here are some considerations: Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Before investing, delve deeper into Near Protocol’s whitepaper, development roadmap, team, partnerships, and community activity. Understand its technology and competitive advantages. Consider Your Investment Horizon: Short-term trading in cryptocurrencies is highly speculative. For those looking at the long-term Near Protocol price prediction (2025-2030), a ‘hodling’ strategy might be more suitable, focusing on the project’s fundamental growth. Risk Management: Allocate only capital you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk assets. Diversifying your portfolio across different assets and sectors can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of Near Protocol’s official announcements, network upgrades, ecosystem developments, and broader crypto market news. Information is power in this fast-moving space. Technical vs. Fundamental Analysis: While fundamental analysis (project strength, adoption) drives long-term value, technical analysis can help identify optimal entry and exit points for those interested in shorter-term trades. While an explosive surge is certainly a possibility, a balanced approach, combining optimism with caution, is always advisable.

The statement, which revisits one of the boldest projections in the XRP community, reflects the analyst’s continued confidence in his technical analysis framework. While no specific timeframe was mentioned, the forecast suggests a significant revaluation if market dynamics align with historical technical patterns. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $2.40. For Dark Defender’s projection to materialize, XRP would need to rise by approximately 1,400% from its current level. The analyst has consistently based his long-term outlook on Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci extensions, both of which point to potential upward cycles once consolidation phases conclude. XRP targets $36.76. Better get used to hear this. — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) October 31, 2025 Community Reactions Reflect Skepticism While Dark Defender’s confidence remains intact, the broader response on X was defined by skepticism and frustration from traders and observers. User afsheenjaf voiced strong doubt, questioning what real catalyst could propel XRP above even $5, let alone $36. He dismissed the idea as unrealistic, highlighting the lack of clear market drivers and criticizing what he described as overly optimistic projections unsupported by tangible developments. User J expressed disappointment over the repetition of similar forecasts in the past, noting that such high expectations have been heard “all the time” but have never materialized. He remarked that many in the community are to “nothing ever happening,” reflecting fatigue over repeated high-value targets without results. Similarly, Danuxis offered a critical perspective on crypto analysts more broadly, comparing them to “fortune tellers” who often share optimistic scenarios to attract engagement or paid subscriptions. His comment underscored a growing sense of skepticism among investors who view extreme predictions as detached from current market realities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Persistent Optimism vs. Market Realities Despite the criticism, supporters of Dark Defender’s outlook argue that XRP’s fundamentals remain strong, citing its role in global payments and institutional partnerships as long-term catalysts. They maintain that broader adoption and expanding utility could eventually justify higher valuations. However, critics contend that such optimism overlooks the slow pace of real-world adoption and the disconnect between Ripple’s business progress and XRP’s market performance. The debate underscores a widening divide between technical analysts projecting future breakouts and investors demanding verifiable catalysts. Dark Defender’s $36.76 target stands as a bold declaration of faith in technical structure and market cycles. Whether XRP can achieve such a valuation will depend on a convergence of favorable conditions—market sentiment, liquidity growth, institutional usage, and global regulatory alignment—all of which remain uncertain in the near term.

Recently, a significant clarification emerged directly from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, regarding the relationship between the memecoin GIGGLE and the educational initiative known as Giggle Academy . This crucial announcement aims to set the record straight and provide much-needed clarity for the community, especially those interested in the evolving crypto landscape. What’s the Buzz Around GIGGLE and Giggle Academy? The rise of memecoins has been one of the most intriguing phenomena in the crypto space. These digital tokens, often inspired by internet memes or popular culture, gain value primarily through community hype and speculation rather than inherent utility. GIGGLE, a memecoin that recently gained traction, quickly caught the attention of many. Simultaneously, the concept of Giggle Academy , an educational project supported by CZ, has been gaining momentum. This initiative focuses on providing accessible education, aligning with broader philanthropic goals. The similar names naturally led to speculation and a potential misunderstanding: was GIGGLE the official cryptocurrency for the Giggle Academy? This overlap created a scenario where a direct statement was necessary to avoid any misrepresentation or confusion among potential supporters and investors. CZ’s proactive approach underscores the importance of transparent communication in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Why Did Changpeng Zhao Make This Clarification? Changpeng Zhao, a highly influential figure in the crypto industry, used his platform on X (formerly Twitter) to address the growing speculation head-on. He explicitly stated that the GIGGLE memecoin is not the official coin of Giggle Academy . This distinction is vital for several reasons: Preventing Misinformation: Official endorsements carry significant weight. Without a clear statement, users might mistakenly believe GIGGLE was an official part of the Giggle Academy ecosystem, potentially influencing investment decisions based on false premises. Protecting the Academy’s Integrity: Giggle Academy is an educational charity. Associating it directly with a speculative memecoin without official ties could dilute its mission or expose it to market volatility beyond its control. Ensuring Transparency: CZ’s clarification demonstrates a commitment to transparency, a cornerstone of trust in the crypto space. He acknowledged the donations being made through the coin but emphasized the lack of official connection. This move highlights the ongoing challenge of separating legitimate projects from community-driven tokens, especially when names or concepts might overlap. For anyone involved with Giggle Academy , this clarification provides a clear boundary. How Does Binance Support Charitable Projects Related to Giggle Academy? While GIGGLE is not the official coin, Binance, under CZ’s leadership, has shown support for charitable endeavors, including those aligned with the spirit of Giggle Academy . In a separate announcement, Binance revealed its plan to donate 50% of spot and margin trading fees generated from GIGGLE to charitable projects. These donations are specifically directed towards initiatives supported by the Giggle Fund. This means that while the memecoin itself isn’t “official,” its trading activity on Binance can still contribute positively to charitable causes. It’s an interesting model where market activity, even around a non-official asset, can be leveraged for social good. This initiative underscores Binance’s broader commitment to philanthropy and its understanding of the power of community-driven efforts. It also provides a clear example of how platforms can channel market interest into tangible benefits, even when the underlying asset is independent of a specific project like Giggle Academy .

The buzz around Decentraland Price Prediction is strong, with investors and enthusiasts eager to know where MANA is headed. Will Decentraland’s virtual world thrive, and can MANA reach the significant $1 mark by 2030? This comprehensive guide explores the factors influencing MANA’s trajectory, offering insights into its potential from 2025 to 2030. Understanding Decentraland: The Genesis of a Digital World Before diving into price predictions, it is crucial to grasp what Decentraland truly represents. Decentraland is a decentralized virtual world built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can buy, sell, and develop virtual land (LAND NFTs), create content, and engage in a digital economy. This ecosystem uses two tokens: LAND: A non-fungible token (NFT) representing parcels of virtual land within Decentraland. Each piece of LAND is unique and permanently owned by a community member. MANA: The fungible cryptocurrency used to purchase LAND, goods, and services within the Decentraland ecosystem. It acts as the utility token and the governance token, allowing holders to vote on key policy proposals. The vision behind Decentraland is to create a user-owned and governed metaverse, free from the control of any single corporation. This decentralized approach is a core appeal for many in the crypto space, fostering community and continuous innovation, directly impacting the utility and value of Decentraland MANA . Key Factors Influencing Decentraland MANA’s Price Trajectory Predicting the future price of any cryptocurrency, especially one intertwined with an evolving concept like the metaverse, involves analyzing a multitude of factors. For Decentraland MANA , these influences range from technological advancements to broader market sentiment: User Adoption and Engagement: The number of active users, the vibrancy of the community, and the volume of transactions within Decentraland are primary indicators of its health. More users mean more demand for LAND and MANA. Platform Development and Innovation: Continuous improvements to the Decentraland platform, such as better graphics, enhanced user experience, new SDK features for creators, and integration with other Web3 technologies, can attract new users and retain existing ones. Partnerships and Collaborations: Strategic alliances with major brands, celebrities, or other metaverse projects can significantly boost visibility and utility, driving demand for MANA. For example, events hosted by major companies in Decentraland draw considerable attention. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Trends: As with most altcoins, MANA’s price is often correlated with the overall performance of the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bull runs tend to lift all boats, while bear markets can exert downward pressure. Metaverse Sector Growth: The general growth and acceptance of the metaverse concept globally will play a crucial role. If the metaverse becomes a mainstream part of digital life, Decentraland stands to benefit immensely. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving regulations around cryptocurrencies and virtual assets can impact investor confidence and market access, affecting MANA’s price. Competition: Decentraland operates in a competitive space with other metaverse projects like The Sandbox, Somnium Space, and Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Its ability to innovate and attract users relative to competitors is vital. Historical MANA Price Prediction: A Look Back Understanding MANA’s past performance provides context for future predictions. Launched in 2017 through an ICO, MANA initially traded at very low prices. It saw significant surges during the 2021 crypto bull run, propelled by the growing excitement around the metaverse concept, especially after Facebook rebranded to Meta. MANA reached its all-time high of over $5 in November 2021. However, like many cryptocurrencies, MANA experienced a substantial correction in 2022, alongside the broader crypto market downturn. This period of consolidation and price adjustment is typical in nascent markets. Analyzing these cycles helps in formulating a more realistic MANA Price Prediction for the years ahead. The token’s resilience during bear markets and its ability to rebound during periods of market recovery are key indicators for long-term investors. Expert Opinions and Analyst Insights on MANA’s Future Crypto analysts often use a combination of technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and market sentiment to project future prices. While specific figures vary, a general consensus emerges regarding Decentraland’s potential. Technical analysis identifies potential support and resistance levels using chart patterns and indicators. Fundamental analysis evaluates the intrinsic value of Decentraland – its technology, development team, partnerships, and user base. The ongoing development of the Decentraland SDK, events, and increasing utility within the metaverse are strong fundamentals. Market sentiment, influenced by news and social media trends, also plays a significant role. Many experts believe that as the metaverse continues to evolve and attract mainstream attention, projects like Decentraland, with a head start and a robust ecosystem, are well-positioned for growth. However, they also caution about the volatility inherent in the crypto market and the nascent stage of metaverse development. Decentraland Price Prediction 2025: What to Expect? Looking ahead to 2025, several factors could shape MANA’s price. The market might be in a recovery phase from previous downturns, potentially fueled by a renewed interest in Web3 and metaverse technologies. We anticipate continued development within Decentraland, attracting more users and creators. Key drivers for Decentraland Price Prediction in 2025: Increased institutional interest in metaverse assets. Maturation of the Ethereum ecosystem (e.g., scalability solutions). More real-world brands establishing a presence in Decentraland. Improved user experience and accessibility of the platform. Based on these considerations, here’s a potential price outlook for MANA in 2025: Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $0.60 $0.90 $1.30 This projection suggests that reaching the $1 mark by 2025 is a realistic possibility under favorable market conditions and sustained development within the Decentraland ecosystem. MANA Price Target for 2026-2030: The Road to $1 and Beyond? The long-term outlook for Decentraland is tied to the broader success of the metaverse concept. If the metaverse becomes as integral to our digital lives as the internet, then projects like Decentraland could see exponential growth. The question of whether the MANA Price Target can reach significant milestones like $1 and beyond depends on several long-term trends. 2026: Sustained Growth and Innovation By 2026, we expect Decentraland to have solidified its position as a leading metaverse platform.
