ZachXBT also warned Pump.fun followers that the hackers were promoting scam tokens through false announcements on the page. The hackers posted their first tweet about one hour ago promoting a fake pump.fun governance token dubbed $PUMP. The post stated, ‘Introducing $PUMP, the OFFICIAL Pump.fun GOVERNANCE token, where DEMOCRACY has never been this degen.’ The hackers added that they would be rewarding the ‘OG DEGENS.’ The post has since then been deleted. pumpdotfun account is hacked ⚠️ $PUMP is heavily bundled and will dump pic.twitter.com/7wOy7lhka5 — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) February 26, 2025 The hackers have posted 3 more tweets in the past hour, with one promising that the token would not be a bundle and would be launched via Pump.fun. Another tweet asked the memecoin launchpad’s followers whether to launch a legit token called hackeddotfun. The hackers further encouraged users to pump the coin to $100 million. The last tweet stated that the hackers were ‘here to save crypto,’ promoting another token called $HACKED. The hackers alleged that none of the token’s supply would be owned and not bundled. The tweets notably included CAs for followers to engage with. ZackXBT still encouraged users not to interact with any of the CAs or links posted. The 3 posts have also been deleted since. The Solana memecoin launcher has still not commented on the situation, and it is unclear whether the platform is aware of the hack. A Pump.fun staff member has still reportedly acknowledged the hack, informing followers that the platform was investigating the situation. ZackXBT connects the hack to Jupiter DAO and DogWifCoin hacks ZachXBT mentioned in another Telegram post that Pump.fun X account hack could be connected to the Jupiter DAO X account hack this February and DogWifCoin’s hack in November last year. The investigator still insisted that the hacks were possibly not the fault of the teams. ZachXBT further speculated that the threats could be connected to X social engineering employees with fraudulent documents or emails. The investigator also suggested that the exploitation of an X panel could be another probable cause of the compromised accounts. Jupiter Exchange’s X account suffered a hack on February 6, prompting the team to announce the incident on the official Jupiter DAO page. The team warned users not to engage with any of the links, CAs, or information shared on the exchange’s X account. The incident was not the first the platform experienced over the past few months, leading users to discuss whether to boycott the exchange. Hackers had exploited the JUP token airdrop account about one year ago, costing users approximately $1 million. DogWifCoin’s X account suffered a hack on November 15 last year, where hackers attempted to scam the memecoin’s followers through phishing links. The project still reported that the hackers did not manage to steal any funds from users. Pump.fun hack comes a few days after Bybit’s incident Bybit Hack Forensics Report As promised, here are the preliminary reports of the hack conducted by @sygnia_labs and @Verichains Screenshotted the conclusion and here is the link to the full report: https://t.co/3hcqkXLN5U pic.twitter.com/tlZK2B3jIW — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 26, 2025 The recent Pump.fun X account hack comes only a few days after one of the top exchanges, Bybit, experienced a cyber-attack. The Bybit hack was tied to the North Korean cybercrime organization Lazarus Group, leading to about $1.4 billion in losses. The exchange’s attack was one of the largest hacks recorded in crypto history, standing above the Ronin Network cyber-attack 3 years ago, which cost users about $625 million. The hackers swiped $400,000 ETH from one of the exchange’s cold wallets. The attack happened during a routine transfer from the exchange’s hot wallet despite the transaction undergoing multiple checks, including a sign-off from Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhao. Chainalysis reportedly confirmed that the attack was tied to social engineering, with the hackers taking advantage of the cold wallet signers through phishing attacks. The exchange immediately executed security protocols to manage the situation. The exchange’s deposits and withdrawals went back to normal on Saturday after Bybit handled the backlog of over 500,000 withdrawal requests. Bybit also announced that the exchange worked to return its ETH reserves back to 1:1. Lookonchain data also revealed that the platform’s reserves were back to 100% by February 24 through loans, ETH purchases, and whale deposits. Bybit’s CEO announced further steps to ensure the capture of the Lazarus Group through the Lazarus Bounty Program. Zhao outlined that the bounty site, the first the crypto industry ever had, would employ complete transparency. The exchange has employed a team to ensure the website remains up-to-date. Bybit hackers use Pump.fun to launder stolen funds Thanks to @caLilyLiu and the @pumpdotfun team for taking swift action to block and remove a Solana-based token whose creator may be affiliated with hacker groups, ensuring the security of the ecosystem. This is a great example of proactive security in action — Bybit (@Bybit_Official) February 23, 2025 The Bybit hackers attempted to use Pump.fun to launder the stolen funds through scam memecoins. The attempt came after the hackers split the stolen funds across multiple wallets, for which several exchanges were on the lookout. ZachXBT revealed that the cyber-criminals received $1.08 million in USDC in one wallet before bridging the funds to Solana. The hackers shifted the funds through a complex web of money laundering schemes, passing them through BSC wallets before sending them back to Solana. The group later created scam memecoins to guise transactions as memecoin trades, including through the QinShihuang token. The hackers managed to trade $26 million through the token before the Solana memecoin launcher blocked it. Pump.fun has blocked several other memecoins tied to the Bybit hackers. Bybit applauded the efforts of the Memecoin launcher to prevent money laundering in the ecosystem. The exchange tweeted that Pump.fun’s efforts showed proactive steps to ensure user safety and prevent fraudulent behavior. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s foray into the digital asset world. It turns out, like many public figures and savvy investors, Trump too has dipped his toes into the crypto waters. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence has peeled back the curtain, revealing that a crypto wallet linked to Donald Trump currently holds a substantial portfolio of digital currencies. But the ride hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. Let’s delve into the fascinating details of Trump crypto wallet and the rollercoaster of value it has experienced. Donald Trump Crypto Wallet: A Peek into the Holdings Thanks to the transparent nature of blockchain technology and the investigative prowess of firms like Arkham Intelligence, we can get a glimpse into the crypto holdings of public figures. In the case of Donald Trump, it appears he possesses a crypto wallet that, as of recent data, contains approximately $1.6 million worth of crypto assets . This revelation sparks numerous questions: What types of cryptocurrencies are held in the wallet? How has the value of these holdings changed over time? What does this mean for Trump’s stance on the crypto industry? Let’s break down what we know so far. The $1.6 Million Portfolio: A Snapshot According to Arkham Intelligence’s data, the Trump crypto wallet holds a diverse range of digital currencies. The most significant portion of this portfolio is comprised of a token called TROG. As of the latest valuation, TROG alone accounts for a whopping $877,000 within the wallet. While the specifics of other crypto assets in the wallet haven’t been detailed in this initial report, the presence of TROG as the dominant holding is noteworthy and warrants further exploration. From $10 Million to $1.6 Million: The Value Rollercoaster The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and even high-profile figures like Donald Trump aren’t immune to its swings. Just a little over a month ago, on January 10th, the estimated value of the Donald Trump crypto wallet stood at an impressive $10 million. However, in a relatively short span of just 48 days, the wallet’s value has experienced a significant downturn, plummeting by $8.4 million to reach the current $1.6 million mark. This dramatic decrease highlights the inherent risks and fluctuations associated with investing in crypto assets . Here’s a quick look at the value fluctuation: Date Estimated Value Change January 10th $10 Million – February 27th (Approx.) $1.6 Million -$8.4 Million TROG Token: The Major Player in Trump’s Crypto Portfolio The dominance of TROG within the Trump crypto wallet raises eyebrows and prompts questions about this particular cryptocurrency. With a valuation of $877,000, TROG constitutes a significant chunk of the portfolio. Understanding TROG becomes crucial to understanding the overall dynamics of Trump’s crypto holdings. Is TROG a meme coin? Is it associated with any specific project or community? Further investigation into TROG is needed to decipher its role and potential impact on the wallet’s performance. While Arkham Intelligence’s data reveals the presence and value of TROG, more details are needed to fully understand: The origins and purpose of the TROG token. The market capitalization and trading volume of TROG. The potential risks and rewards associated with holding a significant amount of TROG. Celebrity Crypto Holdings: A Growing Trend? Donald Trump isn’t the only public figure venturing into the world of digital currencies.

Diversifying crypto holdings across different types of coins and projects can help mitigate risk. Volatility is Inherent: The dramatic value drop in Trump’s wallet underscores the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Investors should be prepared for price swings and invest responsibly.

40883494,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134624,1740612455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Whales’ Shocking 6,813 BTC Dump Sends Market Reeling",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whales-btc-dump/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The usually calm waters of the Bitcoin market are looking choppy. Why? Because Bitcoin whales , those colossal holders of vast amounts of BTC, have just executed a significant sell-off, sending ripples across the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just any ordinary transaction; it’s a hefty 6,813 BTC dump, the largest we’ve witnessed since July. Let’s dive deep into what this means for the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market . Why Are Bitcoin Whales Dumping BTC Now? The million-dollar question, or rather, the multi-billion dollar question, is: why now? Whale activity is often seen as a bellwether for market sentiment, and a large BTC dump like this can signal various things. Here are a few potential reasons: Profit Taking: After periods of price appreciation, even Bitcoin whales might decide to lock in profits. If they bought Bitcoin at lower prices, selling now could represent a substantial return. Market Correction Anticipation: Whales, with their vast resources and analytical capabilities, might foresee a potential market correction. Dumping a significant portion of their holdings could be a preemptive move to avoid larger losses if prices decline. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large investors often rebalance their portfolios to manage risk and optimize returns. This BTC dump could be part of a broader strategy to shift funds into other assets, whether within or outside the crypto space. External Economic Factors: Macroeconomic events, regulatory changes, or geopolitical uncertainties can influence whale behavior. These external pressures might be driving some whales to reduce their Bitcoin exposure. Decoding Whale Activity: What Does a 6,813 BTC Dump Mean? Santiment, a renowned on-chain analytics platform, highlighted this significant BTC dump , noting its correlation with Bitcoin price movements. According to their report on X, wallets holding 10+ BTC – categorized as whales and sharks – are key indicators of market direction. A decrease of 6,813 BTC from these wallets is not just a blip; it’s a substantial outflow that can impact market dynamics. Metric Data Platform Santiment Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Type Whales and Sharks (10+ BTC holdings) BTC Dump Amount 6,813 BTC Period Since last week Significance Largest decline since July Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Crypto Market Historically, significant whale activity , especially large sell-offs, has often been associated with increased market volatility and potential price drops. Here’s how this BTC dump could affect the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market : Short-Term Price Pressure: An immediate effect could be downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . A large sell order increases supply in the market, which, if demand remains constant, can lead to price depreciation. Market Sentiment Shift: Whale moves can significantly influence market sentiment. When large holders sell, it can create fear and uncertainty among other investors, potentially triggering further sell-offs and amplifying price declines across the crypto market . Volatility Spike: Expect increased volatility in the short term. The market might react sharply to this news, leading to wider price swings as traders and algorithms adjust to the changing supply dynamics. Altcoin Impact: Bitcoin’s price movements often cascade into the altcoin market. If Bitcoin experiences a significant dip due to this BTC dump , altcoins are likely to follow suit, potentially leading to a broader market correction. Navigating the Whale-Infused Crypto Market: Actionable Insights So, what should you do amidst this whale activity ? While predicting the market with certainty is impossible, here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment and follow reputable crypto news sources. Understanding whale activity and market sentiment is crucial. Manage Risk: In times of increased volatility, prudent risk management is paramount. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocation, setting stop-loss orders, or reducing leverage if you are engaged in trading. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and corrections are a natural part of its cycle. If you have a long-term investment horizon, short-term fluctuations caused by BTC dumps might present buying opportunities. Diversification: Diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can help mitigate risks associated with specific asset volatility. Consider exploring other promising cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Crypto Volatility The recent BTC dump by Bitcoin whales serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the crypto market . While it has introduced a degree of uncertainty, it also underscores the importance of staying informed, managing risk effectively, and maintaining a balanced perspective. Whale activity is just one of many factors influencing Bitcoin price , and the market’s long-term trajectory will depend on a multitude of evolving dynamics. As always, navigate these waters with caution, knowledge, and a strategic approach to thrive in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

The nation’s official press agency published a video on its YouTube page showing the Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at a press event at the construction site, laying the first foundation stone on what will one day become Pacific Airport (official name). However, bitcoiners have been dismayed to discover that the 40-minute event contained no mention of Bitcoin City – the BTC “haven” it is supposed to serve. Bitcoin City Airport – Bukele Lays Foundation Stone Bukele first announced plans to build Bitcoin City in November 2021, claiming it would become a tax-free haven for international Bitcoiners. In 2022, the President unveiled further plans to build the airport, designed by the Mexican architect Fernando Romero. However, the original airport plans date back to 2018, predating both the Bitcoin City plan and the nation’s adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender (September 2021). The Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Mexican architect Fernando Romero discuss plans to build “Bitcoin City Airport,” officially known as Pacific Airport, in 2022. Critics have slammed Bukele’s plans for the airport and Bitcoin City, claiming work had failed to begin on both projects, years after they were first announced. Bukele spoke at the event, claiming that in “phase one” of its operation, the airport would have two gates. He said the airport’s initial capacity would be 300,000 passengers per year, claiming that builders would complete “phase one” of construction by 2027. However, the government plans to expand the airport in two further “phases.” The second phase will see the number of gates increased to 10, with the final phase seeing an expansion to 18. In its final form, this will allow the airport to serve 5 million passengers per year. Bukele said that the “initial investment” cost of the project was $320 million. The President added: “This airport is not just a runway. It is a gateway for development, tourism, investment, and economic growth. In the 10 years, we expect it to generate 50,000 jobs and a per annum GDP growth rate of 1.5%.” El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at a press event for the Pacific Airport building project. (Source: Secretaría de Prensa El Salvador/YouTube/Screenshot) New Jobs Bukele added that the project would also create 10,000 “direct and indirect jobs” in its first phase. And he claimed the project would have an immediate impact on the economy. He said it would generate $300 million in revenue in its first year of operation. #AeropuertoDelPacífico | El Gobierno del Presidente @nayibbukele construirá el Aeropuerto del Pacífico en tres fases. Aquí detallamos en qué consiste cada una de ellas. #SecretaríaDePrensa pic.twitter.com/c1tmIaAht7 — Secretaría de Prensa de la Presidencia (@SecPrensaSV) February 26, 2025 However, talk of Bitcoin was conspicuously absent at the event, as was mention of the Bitcoin City project. Observers claim that whereas the government once bundled the two projects together, officials are no longer doing so. The Spanish-language media outlet Criptonoticias wrote: “[The government says that this] aeronautical project, originally announced in 2018, will be operational within two years. The event marks a concrete step towards its realization. On the other hand, the vision of Bitcoin City – presented to great fanfare in 2021 – remains shrouded in uncertainty. To date, no clear deadlines or tangible progress have been outlined for the city, which was supposedly designed for bitcoiners.” Boost for La Unión The government will build the airport in the La Unión area, near the Conchagua Volcano. The volcano, per the government’s plans, is to be the focal point of Bitcoin City. At its peak, according to the original design, will be a thermal plant that powers Bitcoin mining rigs . In late 2021, Bukele promised that Bitcoin City would not require residents to “ever” pay income tax. He also said there would be no property tax or local taxes in the city, with VAT the sole levy for residents. However, Bukele appears to have lost none of his enthusiasm for Bitcoin. Earlier this week, the country’s National Bitcoin Office paid around $94,050 per coin to buy BTC 7 for the state’s reserves .

You’re not alone. Investors are digesting a mixed bag of signals as major U.S. stock market indexes concluded trading on a varied note. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broader S&P 500 managed to eke out gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average faced headwinds, closing in the red. Let’s dive into what this intriguing market behavior means for your portfolio and the broader economic landscape. Decoding the Day’s Stock Market Performance The closing bell painted a picture of nuanced performance across the primary U.S. stock market benchmarks. Here’s a quick snapshot: S&P 500: Climbed slightly by +0.02% Nasdaq Composite: Posted a moderate gain of +0.26% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Declined by -0.43% This ‘mixed’ closing suggests a market grappling with diverse forces, where certain sectors or types of stocks are experiencing positive momentum while others are under pressure. But what exactly does this mean for you as an investor? S&P 500: A Razor-Thin Gain in the Stock Market The S&P 500 index, often seen as a barometer of the overall U.S. stock market health, barely nudged into positive territory with a marginal 0.02% increase. This near-flat performance indicates a state of equilibrium, where buying and selling pressures were almost perfectly balanced across the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Is this a sign of market stability, or just a pause before the next big move? Investors are keenly watching for signals that could tip the scales. Nasdaq: Tech Sector Drives Modest Gains Outperforming its counterparts, the Nasdaq Composite Index registered a 0.26% gain. This positive performance was largely propelled by the technology sector, which continues to be a significant driver of market momentum. Are tech stocks leading the charge once again? The Nasdaq’s positive close suggests that investor confidence remains robust in growth-oriented tech companies, even amidst broader market uncertainties. This could be attributed to ongoing innovation, strong earnings in specific tech segments, or simply the sector’s perceived resilience in a fluctuating economic environment. Dow Jones: Industrial Downturn Weighs on the Index In contrast to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a notable decline of 0.43%. This downturn in the Dow, which is heavily weighted towards industrial and more traditional ‘blue-chip’ companies, could indicate weakness in these sectors. Several factors might be at play, including concerns about industrial demand, rising input costs, or sector-specific headwinds. The divergence between the Nasdaq and Dow highlights the sectoral variations within the broader stock market and underscores the importance of portfolio diversification. Critical Market Analysis: Decoding the Mixed Signals What are we to make of this mixed market performance? Here’s a breakdown of potential interpretations and actionable insights: Uncertainty Prevails: A mixed market often reflects underlying uncertainty in the economic outlook. Investors may be hesitant to commit strongly in either direction, leading to choppy trading sessions and varied index performance. Sector Rotation: The divergence between the Nasdaq and Dow could signal a sector rotation. Investors might be shifting away from traditional industrial stocks towards growth sectors like technology, or vice versa, depending on their economic outlook and risk appetite. Economic Data Dependency: Market movements are increasingly sensitive to economic data releases. Upcoming inflation reports, jobs numbers, and GDP figures could significantly sway investor sentiment and market direction. Geopolitical Factors: Global events and geopolitical developments continue to play a crucial role. Uncertainties related to international relations, trade policies, and global economic conditions can contribute to market volatility and mixed performance. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: In a mixed market, staying updated on market news, economic data, and geopolitical events is more crucial than ever. Knowledge is your best tool to navigate uncertainty. Diversify Your Portfolio: The sectoral differences highlighted today reinforce the importance of diversification. A well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk and potentially capitalize on opportunities across different market segments. Exercise Caution: Mixed signals suggest a need for caution. Avoid impulsive decisions and consider a more measured approach to investing, especially in volatile periods. Review Your Strategy: Regularly review your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, especially in light of evolving market conditions. Conclusion: Navigating the Cautious Stock Market Landscape Today’s mixed closing across major U.S. stock market indexes underscores a landscape characterized by caution and selective optimism. While the Nasdaq demonstrated tech sector strength and the S&P 500 held its ground, the Dow’s decline serves as a reminder of the varied pressures at play. For investors, this environment necessitates vigilance, informed decision-making, and a strategic approach to portfolio management.

I'm Ben Schiller, managing editor at CoinDesk. In this issue: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade Goes Live Avalanche Visa card launched Ethereum Foundation executive director leaving Hackers using GitHub to steal bitcoin Network News PECTRA GOES LIVE ON TESTNET: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live on the Holesky testnet Feb. 24 but failed to finalize in the expected time. The Pectra hard fork combines together 11 major upgrades , or ""Ethereum improvement proposals"" (EIPs), into one package. At the heart of this is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user-experience of crypto wallets. The proposal, which was scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in just 22 minutes , will allow wallets to have some smart contract capabilities, as part of a broader strategy to bring account abstraction to Ethereum — a concept that makes the usability of wallets a lot less clunky. Another key proposal, EIP-7251, will allow validators to increase the maximum amount they can stake from 32 to 2,048 ETH. The proposal is supposed to ease some of the technicalities that validators who stake ETH face today: Those that stake more than their 32 ETH have to spread that across multiple validators, making the process a bit of a nuisance. By lifting the maximum stake limit and combining those validators, it could speed up the process of setting up new nodes. Holesky is the first of two testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. The next test is supposed to occur on the Sepolia testnet on Mar. 5. But according to Christine Kim, a Vice President of Research at Galaxy, developers could delay it depending on the scale of today's issue. After Pectra goes live on both testnets, developers will ink in a final date to activate the upgrade on mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . MIYAGUCHI LEAVES ETHEREUM FOUNDATION ROLE: Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi is leaving her position to transition to a new role as president at the organization. The news comes as the nonprofit goes through a leadership shake-up and as Ethereum has become less popular for new builders in recent months, with some even blaming Miyaguchi’s leadership as for why the blockchain’s token price is lagging behind other cryptocurrencies. “This new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships, and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly,” Miyaguchi wrote in a blog post published Feb. 25. The Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that supports the development of the Ethereum blockchain. Founded in 2014, Miyaguchi joined in 2018 and has been the executive director ever since. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote in a post on X that “every success of the EF - the steady execution of Ethereum hard forks, client interop workshops, Devcon, Ethereum's culture and steadfast commitment to its mission and values, and more - is in part a result of Aya's stewardship.” — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . AVALANCHE VISA CARD LAUNCHES: The Avalanche Foundation, the non-profit that helps steward the development of the Avalanche blockchain, said its much-anticipated Avalanche Card, a Visa credit card that allows users to purchase items with their cryptocurrency, is live and ready to be used. The card was developed in collaboration with Rain, a blockchain-based card issuing platform. It enables users to spend their Avalanche tokens (AVAX), wrapped AVAX, and stablecoins USDT and USDC at any store that takes Visa, the foundation said in an email. While other teams have also released credit cards tied to a user's crypto holdings, the news signals the further integration between traditional financial technologies and cryptocurrency. The Avalanche Foundation said in October that it planned to introduce the card, focusing on signing up users from Latin America and the Caribbean. According to the card’s website , the credit card will be linked to users' “new self-custody wallet and unique address per asset.” “In a move to double down on mainstream adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), Avalanche remains committed to powering accessible inroads to blockchain for every type of user,” the team said. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . HACKERS USE GITHUB TO NAB BTC: The GitHub code you use to build a trendy application or patch existing bugs might just be used to steal your bitcoin (BTC) or other crypto holdings, according to a Kaspersky report. GitHub is a popular tool among developers of all types, but even more so among crypto-focused projects, where a simple application may generate millions of dollars in revenue. The report warned users of a “GitVenom” campaign that’s been active for at least two years but is steadily on the rise, involving planting malicious code in fake projects on the popular code repository platform. The attack starts with seemingly legitimate GitHub projects — like making Telegram bots for managing bitcoin wallets or tools for computer games. Each comes with a polished README file, often AI-generated, to build trust. But the code itself is a Trojan horse: For Python-based projects, attackers hide nefarious script after a bizarre string of 2,000 tabs, which decrypts and executes a malicious payload. For JavaScript, a rogue function is embedded in the main file, triggering the launch attack. Once activated, the malware pulls additional tools from a separate hacker-controlled GitHub repository. Once the system is infected, various other programs kick in to execute the exploit. How can users protect themselves? By scrutinizing any code before running it, verifying the project’s authenticity, and being suspicious of overly polished READMEs or inconsistent commit histories. Because researchers don’t expect these attacks to stop anytime soon: “We expect these attempts to continue in the future, possibly with small changes in the TTPs,” Kaspersky said. — Shaurya Malwa Read more .

More than two years ago when Elon Musk took over Twitter, there was a lot of drama both behind the scenes and publicly. While most members of the free world jubilated, having had enough of Twitter’s censorship and use as a tool for propaganda, those who worked every day to make the platform work were worried. A fork in the road The new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, was a man who had built his brand around efficiency and who had a reputation for taking decisions and letting the chips fall where they may. Of course, they had reason to worry because when Musk took charge, he asked Twitter employees in an email with the subject line “A Fork in the Road” to either dedicate themselves to an “extremely hardcore” work environment or leave the company. Photo of Elon Musk wielding the chainsaw that Argentine president, Javier Milei gave to him at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) It’s been some time since then, and four ex-Twitter workers have just prevailed in a recent series of closed-door arbitration proceedings over claims they were illegally denied severance. This win has observers predicting Musk will be visiting courtrooms a lot in the future as the billionaire is using the same formula he used to mold Twitter into an efficient platform in his new capacity as the head of DOGE. The billionaire’s cost-cutting strategies have been thrust into the national spotlight as he takes a similar approach to reduce the federal workforce. One of his latest moves has included sending more than two million federal workers an email with the same gist as his “Fork in the Road” message. It gave those who received it the option to leave but be paid through the end of September, while warning them of an impending downsizing. Musk had the email sent as he took up his new role as key adviser to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Donald Trump. The argument of the four workers The four former Twitter employees successfully argued that they didn’t respond to the email and did not resign. Still, they were terminated, which entitled them to severance promised by the company before it came under Musk’s management. After Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion and immediately downsized by more than half the staff, former employees responded by filing complaints. The early losses for Musk in arbitration could build pressure for a settlement of similar allegations by individual workers demanding compensation of anywhere from nearly $100,000 to more than $1 million. According to what Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing former employees in arbitrations, wrote in a memo, the 20 cases she’s won so far have cost the company at least twice the amount of contested severance pay because the awards have also included interest, arbitration expenses and legal fees. The memo in question came from an unidentified former Twitter employee. In response to a request for comment, Liss-Riordan refused to discuss specifics about severance awards as the company has insisted they remain confidential. She’s reportedly representing more than 2,000 former employees who want their own pound of flesh from Musk. This time around, trade unions and Democrats are at the forefront of the litigation efforts. Is Musk going too far? Even though he is still fighting litigation from what he pulled when he took over Twitter, Musk has used a similar playbook in his DOGE gig with the Trump administration. Not only did he send federal workers the “Fork in the Road” email, Musk followed it up with an ultimatum this past weekend that demanded that they justify their positions in writing or risk dismissal. And if there was any confusion about where Trump stands on the matter, it was cleared up when the president said on Tuesday that workers who did not respond to Musk’s demands could lose their jobs. This has caused some grumbling from the general public even though a majority of them have supported DOGE’s actions and the skeletons they’ve been revealing in the government’s closet. Addressing growing discontent about the brash and aggressive actions of the Musk-led agency, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is out again doing damage control and trying to reassure the public that the end will justify the means. Photo of White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on stage at CPAC with Mercedes Schlapp, Former WH Strategic Senior Advisor for President Trump. Source: Karoline Leavitt (X/Twitter) “All of President Trump’s executive actions are lawful, constitutional, and intended to deliver on the promises he made to the American people,” Leavitt said Tuesday. “Partisan elected officials and judicial activists who seek to legally obstruct President Trump’s agenda are defying the will of 77 million Americans who overwhelmingly re-elected President Trump, and their efforts will fail.” Trump has also defended Musk’s actions, highlighting them as a legitimate bid to get rid of fraud and waste in the US government. Meanwhile, those affected by those actions like the employee unions, Democrats in Congress and even some constituents in Republican-leaning districts, have been protesting against them. The recent arbitration decisions that favored the ex-employees indicate there may be legal challenges in the future in response to Musk’s handling of layoffs and severance agreements. Twitter’s former employees talk about Musk Musk’s takeover of Twitter foreshadows what comes next for US government workers, especially those who got the boot. One former senior employee at Twitter, who worked extensively under Musk before leaving the company, told CNN the billionaire’s actions align with his “algorithm that he basically touts as his … keys to success with anything.” “[B]asically, question every requirement, assume that every requirement that anybody ever gives you is dumb. Question it, eliminate it wherever possible,” they said. “I remember him directly saying, ‘If you’re not adding things back in afterwards, then you weren’t cutting hard enough to start with.’” Two former Twitter employees who spoke on the subject asked not to be named so they could speak freely about their time at the company and avoid any potential retaliation from Musk. It reportedly only took Musk hours to fire Twitter’s top executives after taking over. Within days, he had dismissed around 3,500 employees, which was about 50% of the company’s total staff. In the end, he eliminated 80% of Twitter’s workforce, demanded everyone return to the office, and often required employees to work far more than 40 hours a week. Musk’s DOGE is making similar moves throughout government; the United States Agency for International Development is about to shut down; the Office of Personnel Management was directed to prepare to eventually cut as much as 70% of its workforce; and the General Services Administration was told to present proposals to cut 50% of business expenses, according to multiple sources in the know. Photo of American president Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Twitter executive chairman and DOGE head. Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) “Elon seems to think that he’s bought the federal government now, and he’s playing out the same series of events” as he did at Twitter, said Liss-Riordan. Federal government workers now have until Thursday to decide whether they wish to remain in their roles and accept the Trump administration’s new demands through Musk, which include being “reliable, loyal, trustworthy,” or to resign and accept a buyout paying them through September. Unfortunately, if they take the deal, there is no guarantee they will get the money because it is unclear if Trump has the authority to guarantee that.

The cryptocurrency world has just been rocked by a cyberquake of epic proportions. News has broken about a cryptocurrency hack targeting Bybit, and the numbers are staggering. We’re talking a colossal $1.4 billion vanishing act – yes, you read that right, billion with a ‘B’! This isn’t just another Tuesday in crypto; this is a seismic event that’s got everyone in the digital asset space talking. Let’s dive into the details of this alarming Bybit hack and what it means for the future of crypto security. What Exactly Happened in This Massive Crypto Hack? According to a bombshell report from Unfolded, the crypto market insight platform, citing data from Coin Metrics, this crypto hack is not just big; it’s record-breaking. To put it in perspective, the reported $1.4 billion loss eclipses even the infamous Mt. Gox collapse and the more recent FTX implosion. That’s a hefty sum of digital dough, making this incident one of the largest hacking incidents in the history of cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick rundown of what we know so far: The Target: Cryptocurrency exchange platform, Bybit. The Stolen Asset: A staggering $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH). The Suspected Culprit: The notorious North Korean hacker group, Lazarus. The Source of Information: Unfolded report on X, citing Coin Metrics data. Imagine the sheer scale of this operation! $1.4 billion in ETH – that’s not loose change; that’s a treasure trove of digital gold spirited away in a single heist. This Bybit hack immediately raises some critical questions. How could such a massive breach occur? And what does this mean for the crypto security landscape moving forward? Bybit Hack vs. Crypto History: How Does This Compare? When we talk about significant losses in the crypto world, names like Mt. Gox and FTX often come to mind. These were watershed moments that shook investor confidence and prompted serious discussions about regulation and security. But how does this cryptocurrency hack stack up against these infamous events? Let’s take a comparative look: Incident Estimated Loss Key Features Bybit Hack (Reported) $1.4 Billion Ethereum stolen, suspected Lazarus Group involvement, reportedly largest crypto hack. Mt. Gox Collapse (2014) Approximately $450 Million (at the time, much higher value now) Massive Bitcoin theft, led to exchange bankruptcy, significant impact on Bitcoin’s early days. FTX Implosion (2022) Estimated $8-10 Billion (various asset types) Internal mismanagement and misuse of funds, not purely a hack, but a catastrophic loss of user funds. As you can see, while FTX involved a larger sum in total assets lost due to its complex nature of mismanagement, the Bybit hack , if confirmed at $1.4 billion from a direct hack, stands out as potentially the largest *pure* hacking incident in terms of stolen value. Mt. Gox, while impactful in its time, is dwarfed by this new figure. This comparison underscores the severity and unprecedented scale of the Bybit hack . Lazarus Group: Are They Really Behind This Crypto Heist? The name “Lazarus Group” sends shivers down the spines of cybersecurity experts and crypto enthusiasts alike. This North Korean hacking collective has been implicated in numerous high-profile cyberattacks, often with financial gain as the primary motive to fund the North Korean regime. Their alleged involvement in the Bybit hack is certainly plausible, given their track record and sophistication. Why Lazarus Group? Here’s what makes them a prime suspect: History of Crypto Theft: Lazarus Group has been linked to multiple major cryptocurrency heists over the years, demonstrating their expertise in targeting crypto exchanges and wallets. Sophisticated Techniques: They are known for using advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics, making them incredibly difficult to detect and defend against. Financial Motivation: North Korea faces significant economic sanctions, and cryptocurrency theft is believed to be a key source of revenue for the regime. Previous Attacks: They have been associated with attacks on other crypto platforms and financial institutions globally. While investigations are likely still underway to definitively confirm Lazarus Group’s involvement in this crypto hack , their profile and past activities strongly suggest they could be the masterminds behind this audacious operation. If confirmed, it highlights the ongoing threat posed by state-sponsored cybercriminals to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Crypto Security: Is Enough Being Done to Protect Digital Assets? The Bybit hack is a stark reminder that even with advancements in crypto security , vulnerabilities persist. The question isn’t just about *if* exchanges can be hacked, but *when* and *how*. This incident throws a spotlight on the continuous cat-and-mouse game between cybersecurity professionals and sophisticated hacking groups. What are some critical areas in crypto security that need urgent attention? Enhanced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Beyond basic password protection, robust MFA is crucial, including hardware keys and biometric verification. Cold Storage and Secure Key Management: A significant portion of crypto assets should be held in cold storage, offline and away from potential online threats. Secure key management practices are paramount. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Exchanges must conduct frequent and thorough security audits by reputable firms and engage in penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities proactively. Advanced Threat Detection Systems: Implementing AI-powered threat detection systems to monitor network activity and identify suspicious patterns in real-time. Employee Training and Awareness: Human error is often a weak link. Comprehensive cybersecurity training for all employees is essential to prevent phishing attacks and social engineering. Decentralization and Transparency: Exploring decentralized exchange models and enhancing transparency in security practices can build greater user trust and resilience. The Bybit hack should serve as a wake-up call for the entire crypto industry to double down on crypto security measures and continuously innovate to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Moving Forward: Actionable Insights After the Bybit Crypto Hack So, what can be learned from this devastating Bybit hack , and what actionable steps can be taken by exchanges, users, and the broader crypto community? For Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Invest Heavily in Security Infrastructure: Allocate significant resources to bolster crypto security infrastructure, employing cutting-edge technologies and expertise. Collaborate on Threat Intelligence Sharing: Share threat intelligence and best practices with other exchanges to create a stronger collective defense. Enhance User Education: Provide users with comprehensive resources and education on crypto security best practices to protect their own accounts. Improve Incident Response Plans: Develop and regularly test robust incident response plans to effectively manage and mitigate the impact of security breaches. For Cryptocurrency Users: Use Hardware Wallets: Store significant crypto holdings in hardware wallets for enhanced security. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication: Activate MFA on all exchange accounts and crypto-related services. Be Vigilant Against Phishing: Exercise caution with emails, links, and messages, and be wary of phishing attempts.

Amidst fluctuating global markets, a prominent crypto strategist is pointing towards a critical zone for Bitcoin that could set the stage for a significant price rally. Let’s dive into why the $70,000–$75,000 range is being touted as a robust foundation for Bitcoin and what this means for its future trajectory. Decoding Bitcoin Support Levels: The $70K–$75K Fortress According to Blockworks, Joel Kruger, a seasoned crypto strategist at LMAX Group, has identified a compelling Bitcoin support level between $70,000 and $75,000. This isn’t just arbitrary speculation; it’s a technical analysis-backed observation suggesting that Bitcoin has built a strong base within this price range. But what exactly makes this zone so significant? Historical Price Action: Previous price movements likely consolidated around this level, indicating buyer interest and resistance to further downward pressure. Technical Indicators: Various technical analysis tools may align to confirm this zone as a key area where buying demand outweighs selling pressure. Market Sentiment: Investor behavior and overall market confidence around Bitcoin at these levels contribute to the strength of this support. Kruger’s analysis suggests that this robust Bitcoin support level isn’t just a temporary floor; it’s a launchpad for potential upward momentum. Think of it as a solid foundation upon which Bitcoin can build its next ascent. Is a Price Rally to $110K on the Horizon? The million-dollar question – or should we say, the $110,000 question – is whether this support level can indeed propel Bitcoin to new heights. Kruger believes so, suggesting that a price rally past $110,000 is a distinct possibility. This optimistic outlook is underpinned by several factors: Factor Explanation Bitcoin as Store of Value In times of economic uncertainty and traditional market volatility, Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold or store of value becomes increasingly attractive. Portfolio Diversification Investors looking to diversify their portfolios away from traditional assets may turn to Bitcoin, especially amid concerns over global trade tensions and hawkish monetary policies. Institutional Adoption Continued institutional interest and adoption of Bitcoin further legitimize it as an asset class and drive demand. While traditional markets might be experiencing headwinds due to global economic factors, Bitcoin’s unique value proposition could act as a tailwind, fueling this potential price rally . Why Bitcoin’s Store of Value Narrative Matters Now More Than Ever In a world grappling with economic uncertainties, the narrative of Bitcoin as a ‘store of value’ gains significant traction. But what does this really mean, and why is it so crucial for Bitcoin’s price trajectory? Hedge Against Inflation: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin has a limited supply, making it a potential hedge against inflation. As traditional currencies potentially lose purchasing power, Bitcoin’s scarcity becomes increasingly appealing. Safe Haven Asset: In times of geopolitical instability or economic downturns, investors often seek safe haven assets. Bitcoin is increasingly being considered as a digital safe haven, similar to gold. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust security features offer an alternative to traditional financial systems, attracting individuals seeking greater control and security over their assets. This ‘store of value’ narrative is not just theoretical; it directly influences demand. As more investors recognize and embrace Bitcoin’s role in preserving wealth, the demand for Bitcoin increases, potentially driving up its price and contributing to the predicted price rally . Navigating Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s Role in Portfolio Diversification The current global economic landscape is marked by volatility. Trade tensions, shifts in central bank policies, and geopolitical events are creating uncertainty in traditional markets. In such an environment, portfolio diversification becomes paramount. How does Bitcoin fit into this picture? Low Correlation with Traditional Assets: Bitcoin has historically shown a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This means that Bitcoin’s price movements are often independent of traditional market fluctuations, making it an effective diversification tool. Risk Mitigation: By including Bitcoin in a portfolio, investors can potentially mitigate overall portfolio risk. When traditional assets underperform, Bitcoin may act as a counterbalance, cushioning potential losses. Enhanced Returns: While diversification aims to reduce risk, it can also enhance returns. Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can boost overall portfolio performance, especially when traditional markets are stagnant or declining. For investors seeking to navigate the choppy waters of today’s markets, Bitcoin offers a compelling option for diversification, potentially enhancing portfolio stability and returns. This increased adoption for diversification purposes further strengthens the bullish case for Bitcoin and its potential to reach the predicted price rally targets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this analysis, and how can you leverage this information? Monitor Support Levels: Keep a close eye on the $70,000–$75,000 Bitcoin support level . A sustained hold above this zone could signal further upward momentum. Stay Informed on Market Dynamics: Be aware of global economic factors, traditional market trends, and regulatory developments that could influence Bitcoin’s price. Consider Portfolio Allocation: If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and diversification benefits, consider strategically allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin, keeping risk tolerance in mind. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Always conduct thorough research and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. This analysis provides insights, but it’s not financial advice. The crypto market is dynamic and fast-paced. Staying informed, understanding key technical levels like Bitcoin support levels , and considering Bitcoin’s broader role in the financial landscape are crucial for navigating this exciting asset class. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Resilient Foundation and Future Potential In conclusion, the analysis highlighting the $70,000–$75,000 zone as a strong Bitcoin support level paints an optimistic picture for the cryptocurrency’s near future. While global market uncertainties persist, Bitcoin’s inherent strengths as a store of value and a diversification tool could very well propel it towards – and potentially beyond – the $110,000 mark. Keep watching this space; the crypto journey is far from over, and Bitcoin continues to be at the forefront of this financial revolution.

The Bitcoin market just witnessed a truly astonishing event. In a single hour, a staggering 8,826.43 Bitcoin (BTC) were withdrawn from major cryptocurrency exchanges. This significant Bitcoin withdrawal is turning heads and sparking conversations across the crypto sphere. What does this massive movement of Bitcoin mean for the future of the market? Let’s dive deep into the details. What’s Behind This Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal? According to data from CryptoQuant, a leading cryptocurrency analytics platform, a substantial amount of Bitcoin has left centralized exchanges in the last 60 minutes. Specifically, CryptoQuant reported that: Bitfinex saw an outflow of 5,425 BTC. Coinbase Advanced experienced a withdrawal of 1,118 BTC. Binance recorded 971 BTC in outflows. These are not small numbers. Such a large and rapid Bitcoin withdrawal suggests a significant shift in investor sentiment or strategy. CryptoQuant suggests that these withdrawals, particularly from exchanges that do not offer custody or OTC (Over-the-Counter) trading services, could indicate new wallet transfers. But what does that actually mean? Decoding the Exchange Outflows: New Wallets or Something More? When we talk about exchange outflows , it essentially means Bitcoin is moving off of exchanges and likely into private wallets. This is often interpreted as a bullish signal because: Reduced Selling Pressure: Bitcoin held on exchanges is readily available for selling. When large amounts are withdrawn, it reduces the immediate supply available for trade, potentially decreasing selling pressure and supporting price appreciation. Long-Term Holding: Moving Bitcoin to personal wallets often signifies a long-term holding strategy. Investors may be less inclined to sell if their Bitcoin is securely stored offline, indicating confidence in future price increases. Institutional Accumulation?: Large exchange outflows could be a sign of institutional investors accumulating Bitcoin for their treasuries or long-term investment portfolios. Institutions often prefer to hold their assets in secure, non-custodial solutions. However, it’s crucial to consider alternative explanations. While CryptoQuant suggests “new wallet transfers,” we should also ponder: OTC Deals: While mentioned as less likely by CryptoQuant for these specific exchanges, large withdrawals can sometimes be related to Over-the-Counter (OTC) deals where large blocks of Bitcoin are traded privately, and then withdrawn from exchanges. Custodial Solutions: Although CryptoQuant notes exchanges not supporting custody, it’s possible some withdrawals are related to movements to different custodial solutions, though this might be less likely to occur in such a short timeframe. Impact on the Crypto Market: Is This a Bullish Signal? The immediate impact of such significant exchange outflows on the crypto market is often perceived as positive. Why? Because it hints at reduced supply and potentially increased scarcity. Think of it like this: If demand remains constant or increases while the readily available supply on exchanges decreases, basic economics suggests prices could rise. This Bitcoin withdrawal event could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s future, signaling that large holders are choosing to store their BTC rather than trade it actively on exchanges. However, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, and no single event guarantees a specific outcome. Other factors also play a crucial role, including: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic factors, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events can all influence crypto prices. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in regulations concerning cryptocurrencies can have a significant impact on market sentiment and price action. Overall Market Sentiment: General investor mood, fear and greed levels, and media narratives can drive short-term price fluctuations. BTC Transfers: Understanding the Movement of Bitcoin Understanding BTC transfers is key to interpreting on-chain data like these exchange outflows . When we see large BTC transfers off exchanges, it’s essential to ask: Who is moving the Bitcoin? Is it retail investors, whales (large holders), institutions, or exchanges themselves rebalancing their reserves? Where is the Bitcoin going? Is it moving to known custodial wallets, cold storage, or unknown addresses? What is the likely motivation? Is it accumulation, long-term storage, participation in DeFi (Decentralized Finance), or something else entirely? Analyzing BTC transfers in conjunction with other on-chain metrics and market indicators can provide a more comprehensive picture of market dynamics. Are Institutional Investors Fueling the Bitcoin Outflow? The potential involvement of institutional investors in these exchange outflows is a hot topic. Institutions are increasingly entering the crypto space, and their investment strategies can significantly impact the market. If institutions are indeed behind these large withdrawals, it could signify: Growing Institutional Adoption: Large Bitcoin withdrawal events could be further evidence of increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Institutions typically have a longer investment horizon than retail traders. Their accumulation of Bitcoin for long-term holding could contribute to sustained price appreciation over time. Market Maturation: Increased institutional participation often signals a maturing market, bringing more stability and potentially reducing volatility in the long run (though short-term volatility can still be significant). However, definitively attributing these outflows to institutional investors requires more data and analysis. Following on-chain movements and tracking institutional announcements and filings can provide further clues. Conclusion: A Significant Event, But Context is Key The astonishing Bitcoin withdrawal of 8,826.43 BTC from exchanges in just one hour is undoubtedly a significant event. It suggests a potential shift in supply dynamics and could be interpreted as a bullish signal for the crypto market . Whether it’s driven by institutional investors , whales moving funds to new wallets, or a combination of factors, it warrants close attention. However, remember that the crypto market is complex and influenced by numerous variables. While this Bitcoin withdrawal is noteworthy, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Always consider the broader market context, macroeconomic factors, and your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions based on a single event.

40884072,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134662,1740613399,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: Justin Sun SEC Case Nears Potential Resolution – What it Means for Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/justin-sun-sec-case-settlement/,"The crypto world is buzzing with news that could potentially alter the landscape of digital asset regulation. According to a recent report from Solid Intel on X, Justin Sun, the influential founder of Tron (TRX), is reportedly exploring a settlement in his ongoing civil fraud case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This urgent development could signal a significant shift in how regulatory bodies approach cryptocurrency projects and their leaders. But what exactly does this mean for Justin Sun, Tron holders, and the broader crypto ecosystem? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. Justin Sun SEC Case: Unpacking the Allegations In March 2023, the SEC dropped a bombshell lawsuit against Justin Sun, accusing him of a range of serious violations. The charges are multifaceted and strike at the heart of regulatory concerns within the cryptocurrency space. The SEC’s accusations against the Tron Founder include: Selling Unregistered Securities: The core of the SEC’s argument revolves around the allegation that TRX tokens and BitTorrent (BTT) tokens were offered and sold as unregistered securities. Under U.S. law, securities must be registered with the SEC unless they qualify for an exemption. The SEC claims that Sun and his entities failed to register these tokens, thus violating securities laws. Fraudulent Scheme: Beyond unregistered securities, the SEC alleges that Sun engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the secondary market for TRX. This involves accusations of wash trading, where the same individual or entity acts as both the buyer and seller to create artificial trading volume and inflate the perceived demand for TRX. Market Manipulation: The SEC further contends that Sun orchestrated a manipulative scheme to artificially inflate the trading volume of TRX. This alleged manipulation was intended to create a false impression of active trading and investor interest in TRX, potentially misleading other investors. Airdrops as Unregistered Securities: Adding another layer to the complexity, the SEC also classified airdrops of TRX and BTT as unregistered securities offerings. Airdrops, typically used for marketing and distribution, are being scrutinized under the lens of securities regulations, raising significant questions for future token distribution models. These are serious accusations that have cast a shadow over Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem. The potential TRX Settlement now being explored could represent a crucial turning point in this legal battle. TRX Settlement on the Horizon: What Could Resolution Look Like? News of a potential settlement brings a glimmer of hope for a resolution to this protracted legal saga. While the specifics of any potential TRX Settlement remain undisclosed, settlements in SEC cases often involve several components: Settlement Component Potential Implications for Justin Sun & Tron Financial Penalties (Fines & Disgorgement) Substantial fines and disgorgement (returning ill-gotten gains) are common. This could impact Tron’s treasury and Sun’s personal finances. Cease-and-Desist Orders An order to halt specific activities deemed unlawful. This might involve changes to how Tron operates, particularly regarding token sales and marketing. Undertakings & Compliance Measures Agreements to implement specific compliance measures to prevent future violations. This could include enhanced reporting, oversight, or changes to governance structures. Admission of Guilt (Varying Degrees) Settlements can range from admitting no guilt to admitting certain facts or agreeing to findings without admitting or denying the allegations. The level of admission can significantly impact public perception and future legal implications. For Tron holders, a settlement could bring a sense of clarity and reduce the uncertainty surrounding TRX. However, the terms of the settlement will be crucial. Large financial penalties could indirectly impact the Tron ecosystem, while required compliance measures might alter future operations. Conversely, a settlement could be viewed positively, removing a major legal overhang and potentially boosting investor confidence in TRX. Crypto Regulation and the SEC Lawsuit: A Broader Industry Perspective The SEC Lawsuit against Justin Sun is not an isolated incident. It’s part of a broader trend of increased regulatory scrutiny on the cryptocurrency industry. The SEC has been actively asserting its jurisdiction over digital assets, particularly those it deems to be securities. This case, along with others, highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the crypto space and the need for regulatory oversight to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Key aspects of the broader Crypto Regulation landscape illustrated by this case include: Securities Classification: The SEC’s stance on classifying many cryptocurrencies as securities remains a contentious issue. The Howey Test, used to determine if an asset is an investment contract and thus a security, is being applied to digital assets, often leading to debates and legal challenges. Enforcement Actions: The SEC is increasingly using enforcement actions, like the lawsuit against Justin Sun, to signal its regulatory boundaries and deter non-compliance. These actions can have significant repercussions for crypto projects and the market as a whole. International Regulatory Coordination: Crypto regulation is not just a U.S. issue. Global coordination among regulatory bodies is becoming more important as crypto markets are inherently international. The outcome of the Justin Sun case could have ripple effects on international regulatory approaches. The Need for Clarity: Many in the crypto industry call for clearer regulatory guidelines. The ambiguity surrounding regulations can stifle innovation and create uncertainty. Cases like this underscore the urgency for more defined rules of the road for crypto businesses to operate within legal frameworks. Tron Founder’s Response and Potential Defense Strategies While Justin Sun has maintained a public profile and continued to be active in the crypto space throughout the SEC investigation, his direct legal defense strategies have been less publicly discussed. However, in similar cases, potential defense arguments often revolve around: Token Utility vs. Investment Contract: Arguing that TRX and BTT tokens primarily serve utility purposes within the Tron network and are not solely investment contracts. This challenges the SEC’s classification of these tokens as securities. Lack of Intent to Defraud: Contesting the allegations of fraud and market manipulation by arguing that any trading activity was not intentionally manipulative or fraudulent. This requires demonstrating a lack of malicious intent and potentially presenting alternative explanations for the trading patterns the SEC flagged. Due Process and Fair Notice: Raising concerns about due process and whether sufficient notice was given regarding the SEC’s evolving interpretation of securities laws in the context of cryptocurrencies. This argument often centers on the novelty of crypto assets and the lack of clear, pre-existing regulations. A settlement could indicate a strategic decision by Justin Sun to avoid a potentially lengthy and costly legal battle, regardless of the strength of his potential defenses. Settlements often represent a compromise, allowing both sides to mitigate risks and move forward. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Key Takeaways for the Industry The Justin Sun SEC Case and the potential TRX Settlement offer valuable lessons for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Legal Compliance: Crypto projects must prioritize legal compliance from the outset. This includes seeking legal counsel early, understanding securities laws, and implementing robust compliance programs. Transparency and Disclosure: Increased transparency and clear disclosures about token sales, tokenomics, and project operations are crucial for building trust with investors and regulators. Engage with Regulators: Proactive engagement with regulatory bodies can be beneficial. Open communication and a willingness to address regulatory concerns can foster a more constructive dialogue and potentially mitigate future enforcement actions. Decentralization and Governance: Projects should consider robust decentralization and governance models to reduce reliance on central figures and potentially mitigate regulatory risks associated with centralized control. Monitor Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. Staying informed about the latest regulatory developments, both in the U.S. and globally, is essential for navigating this complex environment. Conclusion: A Developing Story with Far-Reaching Implications The potential settlement in the Justin Sun SEC case is a developing story with potentially far-reaching implications for Justin Sun, Tron, and the broader cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the increasing regulatory scrutiny on digital assets and the urgent need for clarity and compliance within the crypto space. As the details of any potential TRX Settlement emerge, the crypto world will be watching closely to understand the full ramifications of this landmark case. This situation serves as a crucial reminder of the evolving regulatory landscape and the importance of navigating it proactively and responsibly.

According to Saylor, Bitcoin is an open protocol for enhancing personal freedom and expanding free markets through networks. The endorsement is particularly taking place against the backdrop of economic policies and financial independence. Saylor, a well-known supporter of Bitcoin, argues that the asset offers an environment that can replace traditional finance systems. He speaks this at a time when there is a push for digital currencies that would enhance a country’s monetary independence. Bitcoin is the best way to promote personal liberties and free markets. It offers an open protocol for prosperity that can be delivered to everyone via digital technology. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) February 26, 2025 Bezos’ controversy over editorial policy Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, recently changed the policy for the paper’s opinion section. According to the new policy, only content that promotes free markets and individual freedoms will be allowed. David Shipley, who is the editor responsible for the opinion page, tendered his resignation regarding the change. Bezos supported the policy, arguing that free markets and liberties for its people are good for the country. He also noted that the internet offers enough outlets for opposition opinions and implied that the subject is selected on purpose. Although Bezos’ decision became a subject of debate, certain industry analysts argue that he is not alone in this, as media outlet owners have always influenced their outlets’ editorial policies. Some people state that, in large measure, private ownership enables editorial freedom, though this may lead to perceptible bias. Bitcoin adoption among public companies surges At the same time, the number of operating companies that have adopted Bitcoin in their investment plans is rapidly growing. According to Cryptopolitan, the acquisition of BTC by public corporations increased to 139% in 2023. It is also important to mention that Bitcoin has not taken more than 1 % of the country’s Treasury. Bitcoin was compared to the Internet, and it remains undiscovered as far as its use in saving and payment systems is concerned. The report also explained that companies have been acquiring over 1000 BTC per day since January 2024. Also, 80% of the publicly listed firms made an investment in Bitcoin last year. Bitcoin’s price has now dipped to 83,500, the lowest level it has been at since November 2024. The cryptocurrency has dropped by $12,820 in the last three trading days, leading to over $1 billion in leveraged long liquidations, as per CoinGlass.

According to recent reports from Aggr News, this closure comes without any enforcement action, marking a potentially significant moment for Gemini and the broader landscape of crypto regulation . Are we witnessing a shift in regulatory approaches, or is this a unique case for Gemini? Let’s dive into what this means for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, and industry observer. Decoding the SEC Investigation Gemini Closure: What Happened? For those following the intricate world of digital assets, regulatory scrutiny is no stranger. The SEC’s investigation into Gemini SEC , a well-known cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, has been a point of concern and speculation. The exact details of the investigation were never fully public, adding to the uncertainty. However, the outcome is now clear: the SEC has decided to close the case without pursuing any charges or regulatory action against Gemini. This is a crucial development because: No Enforcement Action: The most immediate takeaway is that Gemini has avoided potential penalties, fines, or restrictions that could have arisen from SEC enforcement. Validation for Gemini: The closure can be interpreted as a form of implicit validation for Gemini’s operations and compliance measures, at least in the context of this particular investigation. Broader Market Sentiment: Such news can positively influence market sentiment, suggesting that not all regulatory engagements necessarily lead to negative outcomes for crypto platforms. To put this into perspective, consider the table below comparing potential outcomes of SEC investigations: Outcome Impact on Company Market Perception Enforcement Action (Fines, Restrictions) Financial penalties, operational limitations, reputational damage Negative, potential market downturn for the company and sector Investigation Closure (No Action) Avoidance of penalties, affirmation of compliance (in this instance) Positive, potential market boost for the company and sector Why is the SEC Investigation into Gemini Significant for Crypto Regulation? The SEC’s decision regarding the SEC investigation Gemini isn’t just about one exchange; it carries broader implications for the entire crypto regulation landscape. Here’s why this closure is being closely watched: Precedent Setting? While each case is unique, decisions from regulatory bodies like the SEC can set precedents or at least provide signals about their current stance. The lack of action in this instance might be interpreted by some as a less aggressive approach, although it’s crucial not to overgeneralize. Clarity (or Lack Thereof): The crypto industry has long sought clearer regulatory guidelines. While this specific closure provides relief, it doesn’t inherently offer broad clarity on SEC’s overall approach to digital asset regulation. The industry still awaits comprehensive frameworks. Investor Confidence: News like this can subtly boost investor confidence. It suggests that established players in the crypto space can navigate regulatory scrutiny and emerge without major repercussions, fostering a sense of stability. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”Gemini SEC Investigation Closure”] What Does This Mean for Gemini and Other Crypto Exchanges? For Gemini SEC , this news is undoubtedly a victory. It allows them to move forward without the shadow of an ongoing investigation, potentially strengthening their position in the competitive cryptocurrency exchange market. But what about other exchanges? Benchmarking Compliance: Other exchanges will likely scrutinize this case to understand what might have contributed to the SEC’s decision. Was it Gemini’s compliance protocols, their engagement with regulators, or other factors? It serves as an informal benchmark. Continued Vigilance: Despite this positive outcome for Gemini, no crypto exchange can afford to become complacent. Regulatory scrutiny remains a constant in the industry, and proactive compliance is paramount. Market Competition: A relieved Gemini can now focus more intently on growth and innovation, potentially intensifying competition among crypto exchanges. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Crypto Exchange Gemini and Regulations The closure of the SEC investigation Gemini is a noteworthy event, but the journey of crypto regulation is far from over.

Bybit concluded from the review that ""the credentials of a Safe developer were compromised,"" which allowed the Lazarus hacking group to gain unauthorized access to the Safe wallet and subsequently deceive Bybit staff into signing the malicious transaction. However, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that despite the wallet's infrastructure being compromised by social engineering, the hack would not have been possible had Bybit not ""blind signed"" the transaction. The term refers to a mechanism where a smart contract transaction is approved without comprehensive knowledge of its contents. Safe also issued a statement saying that ""Safe smart contracts [were] unaffected, an attack was conducted by compromising a Safe {Wallet} developer machine which affected an account operated by Bybit."" It also pointed out that a ""forensic review of external security researchers did NOT indicate any vulnerabilities in the Safe smart contracts or source code of the frontend and services."" The apparent back and forth between both companies mirrors that of WazirX and Liminal Custody, which blamed each other following a $230 million exploit last July. On-chain data analyzed by ZachXBT shows that Lazarus is attempting to launder the stolen funds, with 920 wallets currently being tainted with the ill-gotten gains. The funds, perhaps inadvertently, have been commingled with stolen funds from hacks targeting Phemex and Poloniex, linking Lazarus Group to all three.Read more: Bybit Declares ‘War on Lazarus’ as It Crowdsources Effort to Freeze Stolen Funds",Finance|Lazarus group|Hack|Bybit,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-26 23:46:39

The future of Bitcoin mining post-2028 halving is looking less like a gold rush and more like an energy crunch. Mara Holdings (MARA), previously known as Marathon Digital, has sounded the alarm, and it’s a wake-up call the crypto world needs to hear. Are you ready to navigate the turbulent waters ahead for Bitcoin miners ? The Looming Shadow of Bitcoin Halving: What’s the Fuss? For those new to the crypto game, let’s quickly break down what a Bitcoin halving is and why it’s such a big deal. In simple terms, a Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that happens roughly every four years where the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is cut in half. This is designed to control the supply of Bitcoin, making it scarcer over time, mimicking precious metals like gold. Think of it as digital gold becoming even more digitally scarce! Historically, halvings have been associated with price surges, driven by this reduced supply and increased scarcity narrative. However, Mara Holdings is pointing towards a less discussed, but equally critical consequence – the impact on energy costs for miners. While everyone’s been focused on price predictions, are we overlooking the practicalities of keeping the Bitcoin network running? Energy Costs: The Achilles’ Heel for Bitcoin Miners? Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process. Massive server farms, humming 24/7, are needed to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This requires significant electricity consumption, and for many miners, especially those relying on older, less efficient equipment, energy costs are already a major operational expense. Mara Holdings highlights a critical point: most miners are still plugged into the traditional power grid. This means they are subject to fluctuating energy prices, and as demand for electricity grows globally, these prices are unlikely to decrease. Post-halving, when mining rewards are slashed, the equation changes drastically. Miners will need to be significantly more efficient to remain profitable. Imagine running a business where your revenue is automatically cut in half every four years – you’d need a solid strategy to survive, right? Mara Holdings’ Stark Warning: Adapt or Perish Mara Holdings, a significant player in the Bitcoin mining space, isn’t just speculating; they’re sharing insights from the front lines. Their shareholder letter, as reported by CoinDesk, isn’t sugarcoating the situation. They explicitly state that many miners, especially those who fail to adapt, may not survive the rising energy costs after the 2028 halving. This isn’t just about profitability; it’s about survival in a rapidly evolving and competitive landscape. The core message from Mara Holdings is clear: differentiation and diversification are no longer optional – they are essential. Miners who simply operate as ‘price takers,’ passively accepting market conditions, will likely struggle. This calls for a proactive and strategic approach. What exactly does this proactive approach entail? Strategies for Bitcoin Mining Survival: Beyond Price Speculation So, how can Bitcoin miners navigate this impending energy cost crisis and thrive beyond the 2028 halving? Here are some key strategies to consider: Embrace Renewable Energy: This is perhaps the most crucial step. Miners need to aggressively transition towards renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power. Not only is this environmentally responsible, but it also offers a pathway to more stable and potentially cheaper energy costs in the long run. Imagine powering your mining operations with sunshine – a truly decentralized and sustainable approach! Improve Mining Efficiency: Investing in the latest generation of mining hardware is paramount. Newer ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are significantly more energy-efficient than older models. Upgrading equipment can dramatically reduce the energy consumed per Bitcoin mined, directly impacting profitability. It’s like upgrading from a gas-guzzling car to a fuel-efficient hybrid. Diversify Revenue Streams: Relying solely on Bitcoin mining rewards might become increasingly risky. Miners should explore diversifying their revenue streams. This could include: Offering hosting services for other miners. Participating in transaction fee markets. Exploring opportunities in adjacent sectors like AI and high-performance computing, which can leverage similar infrastructure. Strategic Location Selection: Location, location, location! Miners need to strategically choose locations with access to affordable energy, favorable regulatory environments, and potentially cooler climates to reduce cooling costs. Think of regions with abundant renewable energy resources or those offering incentives for green energy adoption. Hedging and Risk Management: Implementing robust hedging strategies to mitigate price volatility and energy cost fluctuations is crucial. This can involve using derivatives markets and securing long-term energy contracts. Diversification: The Crypto Mining Game Changer? Mara Holdings’ emphasis on diversification isn’t just about surviving the halving; it’s about future-proofing the crypto mining industry. The crypto landscape is rapidly evolving, and miners need to adapt to remain relevant and profitable. Diversification can take many forms, from exploring different cryptocurrencies to mine (although Bitcoin remains dominant) to venturing into related tech sectors. The core idea is to move beyond being solely reliant on Bitcoin price fluctuations and mining rewards. By diversifying, miners can create more resilient and sustainable businesses, capable of weathering market volatility and adapting to technological advancements. It’s about building a broader foundation for long-term success in the dynamic world of crypto. The Road Ahead: Navigating the Post-Halving Landscape The message from Mara Holdings is clear and compelling: the Bitcoin halving in 2028 and beyond will present significant challenges for miners, primarily driven by rising energy costs. However, these challenges are not insurmountable. By embracing innovation, prioritizing efficiency, diversifying revenue streams, and adopting sustainable practices, Bitcoin miners can not only survive but thrive in the evolving crypto ecosystem. The future of Bitcoin mining hinges on proactive adaptation and strategic foresight. Those who heed the warning and take decisive action will be best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. The energy crisis isn’t just a threat; it’s a catalyst for innovation and a push towards a more sustainable and resilient Bitcoin network.

40884318,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134677,1740613802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: Sen. Lummis Champions Landmark Crypto Regulation with FIT21 and GENIUS Act,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lummis-champions-crypto-regulation/,"In a powerful move that could redefine the future of digital assets in the United States, Senator Cynthia Lummis has stepped into the spotlight, urging immediate action on two groundbreaking pieces of legislation: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and the Stablecoin Act, also known as the GENIUS Act. For anyone invested in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, this is a pivotal moment. Let’s dive into what these bills mean and why Senator Lummis’s advocacy is making waves in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation . Why is Senator Lummis Pushing for Crypto Regulation Now? Senator Lummis, a well-known advocate for responsible innovation in the digital asset space, has consistently emphasized the need for clear and concise rules to govern the cryptocurrency market. Her recent call to action during a congressional hearing underscores the growing bipartisan consensus that the U.S. needs to establish a robust framework for crypto regulation to foster growth while protecting consumers and investors. The urgency stems from several factors: Investor Protection: The current lack of clarity leaves investors vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation. Clear regulations can provide a safety net and boost confidence in the market. Innovation and Growth: Ambiguity stifles innovation. A well-defined regulatory landscape can encourage businesses to build and innovate within the crypto space in the U.S., rather than moving overseas. Global Competitiveness: Other countries are actively developing their crypto regulations. The U.S. risks falling behind if it doesn’t establish its own framework, potentially losing out on economic opportunities. Market Stability: Unregulated markets can be volatile. Clear rules can contribute to a more stable and predictable crypto environment. Senator Lummis believes that FIT21 and the GENIUS Act are crucial steps towards achieving these goals. Let’s break down each bill to understand their individual significance. Decoding the FIT21 Act: A New Dawn for Crypto Classification? The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21 Act , is arguably the more comprehensive of the two bills. Its primary aim is to provide much-needed clarity on how cryptocurrencies should be classified under U.S. law. Currently, the debate often revolves around whether a cryptocurrency should be considered a security or a commodity. This distinction is critical because it determines which regulatory agency—the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)—has jurisdiction. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what the FIT21 Act proposes: Key Feature Description Primary Classification Classifies most cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities. Regulatory Agency Grants the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) primary regulatory authority over crypto commodities. Decentralization Focus Emphasizes the degree of decentralization of a cryptocurrency network in determining its classification. More decentralized networks are more likely to be considered commodities. Clarity for Businesses Aims to provide a clear legal framework for crypto businesses to operate within, reducing uncertainty and encouraging compliance. By classifying cryptocurrencies as commodities, the FIT21 Act seeks to recognize the unique nature of these digital assets and apply a regulatory approach that is more suited to their decentralized and transactional characteristics. This move could potentially unlock significant innovation and investment in the crypto space, as it provides a more predictable and less burdensome regulatory path compared to being classified as securities. The GENIUS Act: Taming the Wild West of Stablecoins? The Stablecoin Act, or GENIUS Act (though it’s officially known by a longer, more formal title), zeroes in on stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins have become increasingly important in the crypto ecosystem, serving as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. However, their rapid growth has also raised concerns about their stability, reserves, and potential risks to the financial system. The GENIUS Act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins. Here’s what it entails: Federal Oversight: Proposes federal oversight of stablecoin issuers, likely under a banking regulator or a newly designated agency. Reserve Requirements: Seeks to mandate that stablecoin issuers hold adequate reserves to back their stablecoins, ensuring that they can maintain their peg and meet redemption requests. Transparency and Auditing: Aims to increase transparency by requiring regular audits and public disclosure of stablecoin reserves and operations. Consumer Protection: Focuses on protecting consumers by ensuring stablecoin stability and providing recourse in case of issuer failure. The GENIUS Act is particularly timely given the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market and the potential systemic risks associated with these assets. By establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuers, the legislation aims to foster trust and stability in this critical segment of the crypto market, paving the way for broader adoption and integration with the traditional financial system. Bipartisan Support: A Ray of Hope for Crypto Legislation? One of the most encouraging aspects of the push for FIT21 and the GENIUS Act is the bipartisan support it’s garnering. As The Block reported, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are recognizing the need to advance stablecoin legislation and broader crypto regulation in the new Congress. This bipartisan momentum is crucial because it increases the likelihood of these bills moving forward and eventually becoming law. In a politically polarized environment, finding common ground on complex issues like crypto regulation is a significant achievement and signals a growing understanding of the importance of this sector. Why is bipartisan support so vital? Increased Probability of Passage: Bipartisan bills have a much higher chance of passing through both houses of Congress and being signed into law by the President. Political Stability: Bipartisan support ensures that crypto regulation is less likely to be drastically altered with changes in political power, providing long-term stability for the industry. Broader Acceptance: Bipartisan consensus can help build public trust and acceptance of crypto assets by demonstrating that regulation is not a partisan issue but a matter of national economic and technological importance. Senator Lummis’s call for action is therefore not just a voice from one side of the political spectrum but represents a growing consensus that spans party lines. This unified front significantly strengthens the prospects for meaningful crypto regulation in the U.S. What are the Potential Benefits of FIT21 and the GENIUS Act? If FIT21 and the GENIUS Act are successfully passed and implemented, the potential benefits for the crypto industry and the broader U.S. economy are substantial: Clarity and Certainty: The most immediate benefit is the clarity these bills would provide. Businesses and investors would have a much clearer understanding of the rules of the game, reducing legal and regulatory uncertainty. Attracting Investment: Clear regulations can attract significant investment into the crypto space. Institutional investors, in particular, are more likely to enter the market when there is a well-defined regulatory framework. Fostering Innovation: By providing a predictable regulatory environment, these bills can encourage innovation in crypto technologies and applications. Businesses can focus on building and growing without constant fear of regulatory crackdowns. Consumer Protection: Both bills prioritize consumer protection, whether through stablecoin reserve requirements or clearer rules for crypto exchanges and service providers. This can enhance trust and confidence in the market. Global Leadership: By establishing a comprehensive and forward-looking regulatory framework, the U.S. can reassert its leadership in financial innovation and technology, attracting crypto businesses and talent from around the world. These benefits are not just theoretical. Countries that have already implemented clear crypto regulations, like some in Europe and Asia, are seeing increased investment and innovation in their digital asset sectors. The U.S. has the potential to unlock similar growth by embracing sensible and forward-thinking crypto regulation . Challenges and the Road Ahead While the momentum behind FIT21 and the GENIUS Act is encouraging, the path to passage is not without its challenges. Here are some hurdles that need to be overcome: Regulatory Turf Wars: There may be ongoing debates and negotiations between different regulatory agencies (SEC, CFTC, banking regulators) regarding their respective roles and jurisdictions under these new laws. Lobbying and Opposition: Incumbent financial institutions and other interest groups may lobby against certain aspects of these bills, seeking to protect their existing market positions. Complexity of Implementation: Even if passed, implementing these laws will be a complex undertaking, requiring detailed rule-making and coordination among various agencies. Evolving Technology: The crypto space is rapidly evolving. Regulations need to be flexible and adaptable to keep pace with technological advancements and prevent unintended consequences. Despite these challenges, the bipartisan support and the clear need for crypto regulation provide a strong foundation for moving forward. Senator Lummis’s vocal advocacy is a crucial catalyst in pushing these important conversations and legislative efforts ahead. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto in the U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis’s urgent call for the passage of the FIT21 and GENIUS Act marks a pivotal moment in the quest for clear and effective crypto regulation in the United States. These bills represent a significant step towards establishing a framework that can foster innovation, protect consumers, and ensure market stability in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. With bipartisan support growing and the need for clarity becoming increasingly pressing, the crypto industry and its stakeholders are watching closely to see if this moment will translate into landmark legislation that shapes the future of finance. The potential is immense, and the time for action, as Senator Lummis emphasizes, is now.

His expertise is expected to aid in crafting more adaptable rules that balance innovation with accountability. Former Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) announced on Wednesday via X that he has joined venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) as a senior advisor, following the conclusion of his two-decade tenure in the U.S. Congress. Patrick McHenry Announces a16z Position “Excited to share that I’m joining @a16z as a Senior Advisor,” McHenry said . “Technology is the future of economic growth, and I’m eager to help innovators navigate the policy landscape so they can build.” Excited to share that I’m joining @a16z as a Senior Advisor! Technology is the future of economic growth, and I’m eager to help innovators navigate the policy landscape so they can build. — Patrick McHenry (@PatrickMcHenry) February 26, 2025 McHenry did not elaborate on his specific responsibilities but emphasized his commitment to removing “bureaucratic barriers for American entrepreneurs.” “For too long, D.C. has created barriers for startups and emerging companies,” McHenry continued. “It’s time to level the playing field and ensure that Little Tech—the next generation of builders—gets a fair shot.” Andreessen Horowitz’s Role in Tech and Crypto A16z, founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, has made substantial investments in the technology and blockchain sectors. The Silicon Valley-based firm was a major contributor to Fairshake, a digital asset super PAC focused on supporting crypto-friendly congressional candidates ahead of the 2024 U.S. elections. Andreessen, known for advising key figures in the tech sector such as Mark Zuckerberg, has voiced concerns about regulatory policies under the Biden administration after previously backing Democratic candidates. McHenry’s Background in Digital Asset Legislation McHenry, a key advocate for digital asset legislation during his time on Capitol Hill, briefly served as Speaker pro tempore of the House after Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s removal in late 2023. In May 2024, he spearheaded efforts to pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act through the House of Representatives, marking a rare instance of bipartisan cooperation in crypto regulation. News of McHenry’s latest venture comes just weeks after he announced a new advisory position at fintech payments organization Stripe. Crypto’s Policy Battle Moves Beyond Capitol Hill For years, McHenry fought to bring regulatory clarity to digital assets from within Congress. Now, as a senior advisor to one of crypto’s most powerful venture firms, his role shifts from lawmaker to industry advocate. This transition highlights a broader trend in the financial sector: when regulatory progress stalls in Washington, the private sector steps in to steer the conversation. A16z has already been active in political funding, backing pro-crypto candidates and advocating for industry-friendly policies. With McHenry onboard, the firm is doubling down on its efforts to influence the rules of the game. Whether this fosters constructive dialogue with regulators or deepens tensions between Washington and the crypto industry will become clear over time, but one thing is certain—policy decisions affecting digital assets are no longer confined to legislative chambers. What does McHenry’s move to a16z signify for the future of crypto regulation? His appointment signals a growing recognition that regulatory expertise is vital not only in public policy but also in shaping the private sector’s approach to technology. By bringing his legislative experience to a16z, McHenry is positioned to help craft frameworks that balance innovation with effective oversight—a trend increasingly observed as traditional regulators and private firms work more closely together. How might McHenry’s extensive background in legislative advocacy benefit a16z? McHenry’s history of advancing bipartisan crypto legislation and reducing bureaucratic barriers can provide a16z with nuanced insights into the regulatory process. His expertise is likely to inform strategic decisions that align with both industry innovation and the evolving demands of regulatory bodies, helping the firm navigate complex policy environments. Can this strategic hire influence the balance between regulatory oversight and innovation in crypto? Yes, by leveraging his deep understanding of regulatory processes, McHenry can help shape policies that encourage innovation while ensuring necessary consumer protections. His involvement at a16z may facilitate more constructive interactions between industry players and regulatory agencies, potentially leading to a more balanced and supportive framework for digital assets. What challenges might arise from transitioning from a public office role to a private advisory position? One challenge is managing the potential conflict of interest between public policy advocacy and private sector goals. Additionally, the shift requires navigating the political nuances of regulatory reform while maintaining credibility among both regulators and industry stakeholders. Ensuring transparency and objective decision-making will be key to overcoming these hurdles.

Meanwhile, Hedera (HBAR) is showing technical potential, but its movement depends on breaking key resistance levels. Amid these uncertainties, Web3Bay is gaining traction for its practical approach to decentralization. By reshaping e-commerce with blockchain-based transparency and cost efficiency, Web3Bay has already raised $1.5 million in presale funding, drawing strong interest from venture capitalists and crypto whales seeking sustainable investments. Web3Bay Presale: Why VCs & Whales Are Loading Up on Decentralized Shopping Web3Bay is attracting serious investor attention, as its presale has already surpassed $1.5 million in early fundraising. Currently in Stage 4, Web3Bay has already sold over 380 million tokens at a batch price of $0.00456, signaling strong confidence from both venture capitalists and crypto whales. One key reason for this interest is Web3Bay’s vision of redefining e-commerce through decentralization, removing intermediaries and lowering costs for buyers and sellers. As a result, institutional investors recognize its potential to disrupt traditional online marketplaces, offering greater transparency and ownership over digital assets. Consequently, the surge in presale participation reflects growing interest in blockchain-driven retail, a sector poised for major transformation. Unlike speculative memecoins, Web3Bay presents a real-world use case, positioning itself as a promising long-term investment. Thus, early adopters are securing tokens at a discount before prices increase in future stages. Looking ahead, as Web3Bay continues to gain traction, its presale momentum suggests a strong market debut, making it a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the shift toward decentralized commerce. HBAR Eyes Bullish Reversal as Double-Bottom Pattern Forms Hedera (HBAR) is showing signs of a potential trend shift since it has formed a double-bottom pattern around the $0.21 support level. Additionally, this structure, combined with bullish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicates that the ongoing downtrend may be losing strength. To confirm an upward move, HBAR must break through $0.258, aligning with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. If successful, a breakout could trigger further gains toward $0.278, an area of previous price congestion. However, failure to hold above $0.217 may lead to another drop toward $0.20 before a possible rebound. From a technical standpoint, Elliott Wave analysis suggests a five-wave impulsive structure in development, with the third wave potentially pushing HBAR past key resistance levels. At present, HBAR trades at $0.214, with intraday highs of $0.229 and lows of $0.205. A break below $0.217 would invalidate the bullish setup, signaling further consolidation before any decisive movement. Shiba Inu’s $0.01 Dream: Reality Check for 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB) has captivated the crypto community, transforming from a meme into a significant player. However, the aspiration for SHIB to reach $0.01 by 2025 faces substantial challenges. For this to happen, drastic token burns would be required to reduce its vast supply, along with the development of robust use cases beyond its meme origin and significant adoption driven by large-scale investors. At present, SHIB’s price remains far from this target, and while there’s potential for growth, expecting a surge to $0.01 appears overly optimistic. In contrast, emerging projects like Dawgz AI are gaining attention. Unlike SHIB, which heavily relies on community enthusiasm, Dawgz AI offers tangible utilities, such as automated trading bots designed to optimize profits. This shift suggests a growing investor interest in cryptocurrencies that provide real-world applications and consistent returns, moving beyond the traditional meme coin hype. Final Thoughts Investors often weigh potential against practicality, and Web3Bay stands out by offering a real-world use case rather than relying on speculation. While Shiba Inu’s ambitious price target faces steep challenges and HBAR’s movement depends on overcoming resistance levels, Web3Bay is already demonstrating strong market confidence. With over $1.5 million raised and 380 million tokens sold, its decentralized e-commerce model is attracting both institutional and retail investors. As the presale continues to gain momentum, Web3Bay presents a compelling case for those seeking a sustainable, utility-driven investment over short-term hype.

With meme coins dominating headlines, early investors are constantly looking for the next breakout project. While Dog (Bitcoin) continues to be the big dog in the crypto space, and SLERF makes waves, a new contender is stealing the spotlight— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). Arctic Pablo Coin is more than just another meme token. This project is quickly gaining traction with an innovative staking system, referral rewards, and an engaging presale journey. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin, Dog (Bitcoin), and SLERF, offering insights into what makes these meme coins so exciting. Earn While You Hold: Arctic Pablo Coin Offers 66% APY During Presale One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s standout features is its lucrative staking rewards. During the presale, investors can stake their APC tokens and earn a massive 66% APY. This provides a strong incentive to hold and boosts long-term profitability. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about passive income—it also rewards active supporters. The project offers referral incentives where users can invite others and earn rewards in return. By spreading the word, investors can grow their holdings without spending an extra dime. Arctic Pablo coin is among the Top New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential . Meme coins thrive on strong communities, and Arctic Pablo Coin is no different. The project hosts engaging community competitions where participants can win APC tokens or USD rewards. This adds a gamified element, increasing engagement and drawing in more investors. With the crypto market constantly evolving, staying ahead with innovative incentives makes all the difference. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Heats Up – Now at Penguinopolis! Unlike traditional meme coin presales , Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) follows a one-of-a-kind journey, moving from one location to another instead of fixed stages. Currently, APC has arrived at Penguinopolis, marking the 12th phase of its journey. This moment presents a golden opportunity for investors, with the current price set at $0.000067 per APC and a total of over $1.61 million already raised. With an anticipated launch price of $0.008, APC offers a massive ROI potential of 11,844.78% from its current value. An investor putting in $1,000 today would receive 14,925,370.00 APC tokens, which could skyrocket to an incredible $14,925,370.00 at launch. As Arctic Pablo Coin continues moving forward, its price will increase, making this a limited-time entry point before the next surge Dog (Bitcoin): The Undisputed King of Meme Coins Dog (Bitcoin) remains the top dog in the meme coin market, solidifying its position as a leader in the crypto space. Recently, the coin has experienced a significant surge in on-chain activity, with whale transactions and adoption rates skyrocketing. This uptick highlights growing confidence among both retail and institutional investors, who are increasingly recognizing the value of meme coins beyond their viral appeal. As more platforms and merchants integrate Dog (Bitcoin) as a payment method, its utility and relevance continue to expand. Institutional interest has also surged, with major players entering the market and driving further momentum. Dog (Bitcoin) is not just a meme—it’s a cultural phenomenon and a testament to the enduring power of community-driven projects in the crypto world. SLERF: The Rising Meme Coin Shaking Up the Crypto Space SLERF has been making waves in the crypto world with its unexpected partnerships and community-driven growth. What started as a fun meme coin has quickly evolved into a serious contender, drawing the attention of traders and investors alike. With new exchange listings, increasing adoption, and a rapidly growing user base, SLERF is proving that it has the potential to break into the mainstream. The coin’s high trading volume reflects strong market interest, and recent developments suggest that SLERF is gearing up for a major rally. As the meme coin market remains one of the most volatile yet rewarding crypto spaces, SLERF defies expectations. With its expanding ecosystem and loyal community, this meme coin is one to watch closely in the coming months. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out The meme coin sector is buzzing with opportunities, but few projects offer as much growth potential as Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . With its high APY staking rewards, lucrative referral incentives, and engaging presale journey, APC draws massive attention from investors. While Dog (Bitcoin) continues to dominate and SLERF’s rapid expansion is turning heads, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as one of the top new meme coins with the potential for massive returns. Currently, in the Penguinopolis phase, APC’s price is still at an early entry point—but not for long. The price will increase as it moves to its next destination, making now the perfect time to invest. Don’t miss out on one of the most explosive presales in the crypto space!

As the excitement surrounding memecoins wanes, prices have dropped to their lowest levels in several months. Following the historic hack of the ByBit exchange and President Trump’s controversial tariff proposals, the overall crypto market has seen a downturn, with Bitcoin falling 12% in the past week. In contrast, Solana has plummeted 22%, reaching a new five-month low. Solana Struggles As New Data Shows Dramatic Drop As reported by Fortune, the decline in Solana’s value can be attributed to its association with recent celebrity-backed memecoin scandals, particularly the LIBRA incident. This cryptocurrency surged to a nearly $5 billion market cap before crashing, following promotion from Argentine President Javier Milei, whose involvement has sparked outrage and prompted an investigation. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Overextended—Is A Market Shakeup Imminent? Zach Pandl, head of research at the crypto asset manager Grayscale, noted that this incident has highlighted the volatility and risks associated with memecoins, stating, “The current phase of memecoin trading on Solana is over.” Solana’s rise as the preferred blockchain for memecoin development was largely due to its low transaction costs, high transaction speeds, and user-friendly infrastructure. Platforms like Pump.fun facilitated the rapid creation of cryptocurrencies on Solana, leading to a peak of over 71,000 memecoins launched in a single day. However, this number has since dwindled to just 26,000, according to data from analytics firm Dune. Analysts Warn Of Potential Drop Below $100 While many memecoins lack intrinsic value and are often linked to scams, Pandl suggested that the recent memecoin frenzy had some positive impacts on the Solana ecosystem. “It onboarded users, generated revenue, and helped stress test the Solana blockchain in various ways,” he explained. “In that sense, memecoin trading is one of the many building blocks to developing the next generation of financial infrastructure.” Adding to Solana’s woes, the open interest for Solana futures has declined by 44% over the past month, dropping from an all-time high of $6.39 billion to just $3.57 billion today. This decline indicates a reduction in investor confidence and interest in leveraging Solana positions. Related Reading: Panic Sell? Bitcoin’s $86K Fall Wipes Out $1 Billion In Trades CoinGecko data also shows a similar pattern from investors, as trading volume has dropped 54% in the last 48 hours, representing only $5 billion of Solana’s total market cap of $66 billion. Currently trading at $134, analysts have identified this price point as a crucial support zone in the ongoing downtrend. According to Crypto General, if this support fails to hold, the next support level could fall below $100, representing a drop of more than 65% from Solana’s all-time highs.

The forensic report left former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao with more questions than answers, and he heavily criticized them, claiming the report was written in vague language to brush over the issues. According to Safe’s investigation report , the forensic review into the targeted attack by the Lazarus Group on Bybit concluded that this attack targeted the Bybit Safe was achieved through a compromised Safe developer machine. The hack resulted in the proposal of a disguised malicious transaction that saw the hackers draw funds from Bybit’s wallet. According to the report, the forensic audit on external security researchers did not indicate any shortcomings in the Safe smart contracts or source code of the frontend and services. The report also indicated that the Safe team conducted a thorough investigation and has now reinstated Safe on the Ethereum mainnet with a phased rollout. The Safe team has fully rebuilt, reconfigured all infrastructure, and rotated all credentials, ensuring the attack vector is fully eliminated. The Safe frontend remains operational with additional security measures in place. However, the report cautioned users to carry out extreme caution and remain vigilant when signing transactions. CZ criticizes Safe’s forensics report for not being detailed enough I usually try not to criticize other industry players, but I still do it once in a while. 😂 This update from Safe is not that great. It uses vague language to brush over the issues. I have more questions than answers after reading it. 1. What does ""compromising a Safe… https://t.co/VxywHyzqXb — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) February 26, 2025 The report has received heavy backlash from Binance founder and former CEO CZ. According to CZ, the report is not detailed enough to address all concerns and has gaping holes as to how the occurrence happened. CZ first questioned what “compromising a Safe developer machine” means. He also questioned how the hackers compromised the subject machine and wondered if it was social engineering, a virus, or something else. CZ also expressed concerns about how a developer machine gained access to an exchange account. He asked if some code got remotely deployed from the developer machine straight to the prod. CZ also expressed his concerns about how the hackers bypassed the ledger verification step at multiple signers. He questioned if the signers failed to verify properly or if they did a blind signing. Bybit also embarked on a deep forensics investigation by contracting to blockchain security firms Sygnia and Verichains. The aim of the investigations centered around the three signers’ hosts as a follow-up on the $1.4 billion hack. CZ also questioned if the $1.4 billion was the largest address managed using Safe and why the hackers didn’t target other wallets. CZ also asked what lessons other “self-custody, multi-sig” wallet providers and users can learn from the ordeal. The investigations from Sygnia concluded that the cause of the incident was a malicious code emanating from Safe’s infrastructure. The report concluded that Bybit’s infrastructure was not affected or compromised in any way during the attack. The report highlighted that the investigations will deepen further to confirm the recent findings. Preliminary conclusions from Verichains revealed that the benign JavaScript file of app.safe.global was replaced on February 19th with malicious code aimed at maiming Bybit’s Ethereum Multisig Cold Wallet. Verichains investigators also recommended that further investigations be conducted to confirm the root cause. Lazarus Group reportedly launders Bybit funds via meme coins UAE-based Bybit exchange fell victim to hackers last week, resulting in the loss of $1.5 billion. The exchange’s CEO said the funds were drawn from one of Bybit’s cold multisig wallets. According to onchain data, North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group, believed to be behind the attack, was observed to have been leveraging memecoins to launder the stolen funds. Cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT reported that Lazarus Group distributed several meme coins on Pump.fun. Binance has also been affected by malicious attacks from cyber criminals. Recently, Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur Joe Zhou reported that scammers sent him a message through the usual Binance number where he typically receives his verification codes, telling him his account was accessed from North Korea. Joe Zhou got on a call with the attackers who misled him into sending funds to a different wallet. Zhou managed to act fast and recover most of his funds before the hackers cashed out.

Neiro has surged 15.06% in the last 24 hours, gaining traction within the Ethereum community, while Floki Inu has seen a 2.24% daily increase despite its 13.93% weekly decline. These tokens are making waves, but all eyes are on BTFD Coin, whose presale has now crossed $6.20 million, drawing in bullish investors at a record pace. Meme coins have evolved beyond simple internet jokes, turning into full-fledged investment opportunities. With BTFD Coin leading the charge as the next crypto to explode , thanks to its 3650% ROI potential, a booming referral program, and an active community, traders are looking for their next high-reward bet. Will Neiro and Floki Inu continue their streak, or will BTFD’s presale momentum make it the most explosive pick? BTFD’s $6.20M Frenzy: 3650% ROI Potential Has Investors Stacking Up BTFD Coin’s presale has been unstoppable, rapidly selling over 70 billion tokens and attracting more than 11,000 investors. With Stage 14 currently live at $0.00016, early buyers are seizing the 100% bonus offer using the LAUNCH100 code—which means double the tokens for every purchase. BTFD is more than just hype—it has an entire ecosystem fueling its success. Its P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, offering players the chance to earn while gaming, while its 90% APY staking program keeps long-term holders raking in passive income. This multi-pronged approach is why analysts predict a post-listing moon price of $0.006—a staggering 3650% potential return for presale investors. Investors who act fast could secure a massive upside. A $5,000 investment at $0.00016 per BTFD token could balloon to $18,750 at $0.0006. But if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price, that same investment could skyrocket to $187,500—an opportunity too good to ignore. For those looking to stack even more tokens, BTFD’s Referral Program is a game-changer. Top 20 referrers get 10% of the total raise in BTFD tokens, making it one of the most rewarding systems in the market. Simply share a referral code, and both the referrer and referee win. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Securing BTFD tokens during presale is quick and easy. Investors need to: Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Visit the BTFD presale page , connect their wallet, and enter the LAUNCH100 code to double their tokens. Complete the purchase and get ready to ride with the bulls. With only two presale stages left, the current $0.00016 price won’t last much longer. This is the perfect dip for those looking to join the bull run before BTFD hits major exchanges.

According to a Wednesday X post from Gemini co-founder and President Cameron Winklevoss, the SEC informed Gemini on Monday that it was closing its investigation into the New York-based crypto exchange and would not be filing enforcement charges against it. But the anti-climactic resolution to the long-running investigation was unsatisfying to Winklevoss, who said in his X post that the SEC’s retreat “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.” “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation,” Winklevoss wrote. “The SEC’s behavior in aggregate towards other crypto companies and projects cost orders of magnitude more and caused unquantifiable loss in economic growth for America.” Winklevoss said that, without consequences for both the SEC and the individual staff members involved in the investigations of Gemini and other crypto companies, other federal agencies could again, in the future, “bully, harass and attack a lawful industry and then decide one day to simply say we’re good and walk away.” In his post, Winklevoss suggested that any agency that “refuses to write rules before it opens an investigation or brings an enforcement action” should be required to reimburse defendants “for 3x [their] legal costs.” Winklevoss also called for all SEC staff members involved in the probe into Gemini to be publicly fired, and their “names, roles, and the actions they participated in should be posted on the SEC website.” “It should not be acceptable to bring the full might of the U.S. government to bear against fledgling companies in a nascent industry and then hide behind a faceless agency or say you were ‘just doing your job’ or ‘following orders.’ These individuals had a choice,” Winklevoss wrote. “They could have asked to be reassigned or resigned. Nobody was forcing them to work at the SEC. Nonetheless they chose to violate their oath and the agency’s mission to ‘make a positive impact on the U.S. economy, our capital markets, and people’s lives’ and instead aided and abetted an unlawful war against a lawful industry.” The SEC’s decision to drop its probe into Gemini comes shortly after it dropped similar investigations into Uniswap Labs, Robinhood Crypto and OpenSea. Earlier Wednesday, the SEC also filed a joint motion to pause its litigation against the Tron Foundation and Justin Sun, similar to recent motions filed in its cases against Coinbase and Binance.

Extreme fear continues to grip the market as SOL fails to find strong support, with bears maintaining control since the cryptocurrency hit its all-time high back in January. Since then, Solana has retraced over 55%, leaving investors uncertain about its short-term prospects. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Down Below Key Demand – Analyst Expects A Drop To $1.65 The broader crypto market remains under pressure, with altcoins struggling to regain bullish momentum. Analysts warn that further declines could be on the horizon if SOL fails to hold key levels. Crypto expert Ali Martinez shared on-chain metrics on X, revealing that Solana’s transfer volume has plummeted dramatically. According to the data, Solana’s transfer volume has dropped from $1.99 billion in November 2024 to just $14.57 million today. This significant decline suggests a steep drop in network activity and interest, raising concerns about the current state of the Solana ecosystem. With bearish sentiment dominating the market and on-chain activity slowing, the coming days will be crucial for SOL. If bulls fail to defend key support levels, Solana could see further downside. However, a strong recovery in volume and price action could indicate renewed interest and potential for a reversal. Solana Struggles Below $150 as Bears Maintain Control Solana is facing significant selling pressure, struggling to break above the $150 mark as bears dominate price action. The broader market sell-off has taken a heavy toll on SOL, with meme coins experiencing some of the steepest declines. Solana, which previously benefited from the meme coin hype cycle, is now seeing a major pullback as speculation fades. Related Reading: Litecoin Trading Activity Increases Over The Past Month – Potential LTC ETF Draws Speculation The price action remains weak as Solana trades below key demand levels that once sustained its long-term bullish structure. Bulls have lost momentum, failing to establish a strong recovery, while bears continue to drag the entire market down. If SOL fails to hold above current demand levels, further downside could be expected in the short term. Martinez’s on-chain data highlights a troubling trend for Solana’s network activity. According to Glassnode, Solana’s transfer volume has plummeted from $1.99 billion in November 2024 to just $14.57 million today. This dramatic drop indicates a sharp decline in network usage and trading activity, further reflecting the cooling-off period in meme coin speculation. The coming days will be critical for Solana. If SOL can hold above key demand levels, a recovery phase could begin. However, continued weakness in volume and price action could lead to further declines, making it essential for bulls to reclaim momentum soon. Price Struggles At $140 Amid Selling Pressure Solana (SOL) is trading at $141 after experiencing days of intense selling pressure, struggling more than most altcoins in the current market downturn. The broader crypto market has faced extreme volatility, with many assets seeing sharp declines. However, Solana remains one of the worst-hit, failing to establish strong support or momentum for a potential rebound. If bulls can defend the $140 level, there is a chance for a short-term recovery. Holding above this crucial demand zone could provide the foundation for a push back above key resistance levels. However, sentiment remains weak, and any further downside in Bitcoin or the broader market could send SOL into deeper corrections. Related Reading: Cardano Remains In Consolidation – Expert Projects 25% Price Move If Solana fails to maintain its current support, the next critical level to watch is $130, where buyers may attempt to step in again. However, a sustained breakdown below this mark would increase the risk of further declines into lower demand zones. The coming days will be crucial for Solana’s price action, as investors wait to see whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if bears will continue to drive the price downward.

However, while Ripple’s XRP remains a major player, a new AI-powered altcoin is stealing the spotlight. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , an emerging Ethereum gem, is attracting serious investor attention with its staggering 40,780% growth potential. As its presale heats up at $0.0420 , crypto whales and smart money are pouring in millions, setting this AI wonder up for an explosive post-listing rally. Investors looking for life-changing returns are locking in their positions early, making sure they don’t miss out on what could be the best AI-driven crypto play of the year. XRP Price Action: A Historic Rally In The Making? Ripple’s XRP has been a key player in the crypto market, currently ranking among the top digital assets by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. With a price hovering around its recent highs, the XRP price at $2.690 is hinting at a significant rally reminiscent of its previous bull runs. Ripple’s ongoing legal battles with the SEC have kept market sentiment volatile, but a potential resolution could send the XRP price soaring. While Ripples’s XRP remains a dominant force, analysts suggest that WallitIQ (WLTQ) could outshine it in terms of raw percentage gains. Unlike Ripple’s XRP, which has already established itself in the market, this AI-powered altcoin is in its early stages, with a presale price of just $0.0420 . Given its AI functionalities and robust use cases, it presents an even stronger investment case. With its explosive growth trajectory of 40,780%, WallitIQ (WLTQ) could deliver astronomical gains, surpassing the XRP price rally in sheer returns.

With its high potential and real-world applications, analysts agree that this AI-powered altcoin is a must-watch, especially as the alt season approaches. Investors who get in at $0.0420 now could be positioning themselves for massive financial gains instead of waiting for the XRP price to play out its projections.

WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the next major crypto opportunity. Its cutting-edge AI features, real-world utility, and massive 40,780% growth potential make it the hottest presale in the market.

Pseudonymous trader Pentoshi tells his 858,600 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins now have less potential to print the same level of gains seen in 2017-2021 because the market has significantly expanded and the total market cap started at a much higher level this cycle. “Well some updated thoughts. I think for alts, we will never see a run like 2017-2021 again. But I also said that previous to this run. The space is just way too big now, with hundreds of millions of people, whereas there, we really did start at 0 for DeFi (decentralized finance) and in 2017 all alts combined were $13 billion. We just started at such a high floor.” He also says that the robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) sector may start dominating investor interest at the expense of alts. “I also believe the next bubble won’t even be in crypto. It’s likely going to be in robotics/AI. 50% of the global GDP is labor, a $50 trillion annual market… These fields are moving at lightning speed and likely to have the most allocations. Of course, there will be big opportunities here, a lot of that will end up back in utility too. Memecoins I think are too extractive, and while people call utility a meme, they have stood the test of time.” However, the veteran trader says there still remains the potential this cycle for the total crypto market cap to surge to around $4.4 trillion. The total crypto market cap is $2.97 trillion at time of writing, down 8.9% in the last 24 hours. “It’s just a maturing market, and for most of us. We got in pretty damn early and got to capture immense upside. It just isn’t realistic to expect the cycles of the past because eventually returns would be smoothed out. It couldn’t last forever. It takes far more now to move the capital than before. I never expected anything wild this cycle, my expectations for alts were maybe 2x the previous highs and for total [crypto market cap] to reach $4.4 trillion or so, which was a pretty conservative estimate. We may still even get there yet. But I think we need to set realistic expectations for alts in general and the market.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Markets data shows a prolonged selling spree among Bitcoin ETFs could escalate the BTC price downtrend further. Bitcoin (BTC) losses in February surpass 20% amid NVIDIA rally Bitcoin (BTC) remains under intense bearish pressure, sinking to fresh multi-month lows as macroeconomic uncertainty and aggressive capital rotation weigh on the market. BTC has now lost over 20% in February, marking its worst monthly performance since the FTX collapse in November 2022. NVIDA Price Action After Q4 Earnings Report, Feb 26 2025 While the BTC price decline has been primarily attributed to multiple macro factors, one of the biggest catalysts emerged from an unexpected source: NVIDIA’s explosive earnings report. The semiconductor giant posted $39.3 billion in Q4 revenue, marking a 12% increase quarter-over-quarter and a staggering 78% jump year-over-year. Profits also skyrocketed, with GAAP earnings per share (EPS) at $4.93, up 33% from the previous quarter, while non-GAAP EPS soared 28% to $5.16. This blockbuster performance triggered a 5% rally in NVIDIA’s stock, adding over $500 billion to its market capitalization within a single session. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Action Feb 26, 2025 As capital flooded into high-growth AI stocks, Bitcoin suffered. BTC price plunged 5% on Thursday alone, dropping from $86,680 to $82,256, highlighting a dramatic loss of investor confidence in digital assets. The sharp correction reflects mounting concerns over U.S. protectionist trade policies, geopolitical tensions, and sticky inflation, which could drive investors toward traditional equity markets rather than speculative assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs bleed $2.1 billion in six consecutive days Beyond NVIDIA’s dominance in equity markets, Bitcoin’s downtrend has been reinforced by a persistent exodus of institutional capital from BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded outflows for six straight trading sessions, wiping out $2.1 billion from the market. This trend began on February 18 and intensified after NVIDIA’s earnings, as investors reallocated funds toward high-performing tech stocks. Bitcoin ETF Flows, Feb 2025 | Source: Fairside Breakdown of Bitcoin ETF Outflows (Feb 18 – Feb 25), according to Fairside data: Feb 18: -$60.7M Feb 19: -$64.1M Feb 20: -$364.8M Feb 21: -$62.9M Feb 24: -$539.0M Feb 25: -$1.14B Total Outflows: $2.1 billion withdrawn in six days This persistent outflow suggests that institutional investors are shifting away from Bitcoin exposure in favor of equities. If NVIDIA’s rally continues and capital rotation intensifies, BTC could remain vulnerable to further downside. The absence of fresh inflows into BTC ETFs weakens Bitcoin’s support structure, raising the risk of a deeper correction below $80,000 in the short term. If macroeconomic pressures persist, BTC could struggle to reclaim its psychological support at $85,000, leaving it exposed to further losses. Bitcoin is facing a perfect storm of capital flight, macroeconomic uncertainty, and an AI-driven stock market frenzy. The $2.1 billion ETF outflow underscores investor hesitancy, with BTC’s February losses now exceeding 20%. With NVIDIA absorbing billions in liquidity, Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory hinges on whether capital outflows slow or accelerate. If AI stocks continue their ascent and BTC ETF redemptions persist, Bitcoin could be at risk of testing $80,000 sooner rather than later. BTC Price Forecast: $80K support at risk Bitcoin price forecast charts show momentum remains under severe bearish pressure, with BTC trading at $84,784 after a 20.53% decline over the past 26 days. The sell-off has intensified as BTC breaks below key support levels, with Bollinger Bands (BB) indicating extreme volatility. The price is now hovering near the lower BB at $86,736, while the upper BB sits at $102,907, highlighting the magnitude of recent downside moves. BTC Price Forecast The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to 25.92, a deeply oversold level not seen in months. Historically, RSI below 30 suggests that BTC could be due for a short-term relief rally. However, the downtrend remains strong as the RSI continues to trend lower, confirming sustained selling momentum. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim the mid-BB resistance at $94,822, bearish pressure could drive BTC toward the psychological $80,000 level, where buyers may attempt to re-enter. Despite the bearish breakdown, a potential short-term bounce remains possible if BTC stabilizes above $84,500 and RSI begins to recover. If Bitcoin closes a daily candle above $86,736, bulls may regain control and push prices toward $90,000. However, failure to hold above $84,000 could accelerate losses, exposing BTC to a steeper drop below $80,000 in the coming sessions.

Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a long-time proponent of the Bitcoin and digital asset industry, presided over the hearing with assistance from ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ). The witnesses included Tim Massad, former CFTC Chair and Research Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University; Jai Massari, Chief Legal Officer at Lightspark; Jonathan Jachym, Global Head of Policy and Government Relations at Kraken; and Lewis Cohen, Partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP. Setting the tone for the meeting, Senator Lummis stated that she intends to do her part in passing bipartisan legislation for Bitcoin and stablecoins. (This was one of the few times during the meeting that the word “Bitcoin” was mentioned. One of the only other times in the hearing it was mentioned was when Massad voiced that he’s objected to the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve .) Throughout the hearing, Massad stressed the importance of monitoring stablecoin transactions. He suggested extending the “regulatory perimeter” to address AML (Anti-Money Laundering) challenges associated with stablecoins and even proposed that smart contracts be designed in a way that mitigates the risk of bad actors using them. “Our entire [Bank Secrecy Act] framework relies on centralized intermediaries.” @timmassad calls on Congress to extend the “regulatory perimeter” and require “stablecoin issuers to aggressively monitor transactions and freeze stablecoins.” pic.twitter.com/Y5TyGRx4i1 — Nick Anthony (@EconWithNick) February 26, 2025 “[We might] program smart contracts so that transactions can’t go through unless someone has been properly vetted,” said Massad. Massad also suggested that stablecoin issuers “aggressively monitor stablecoin activity” as a means to keep an eye out for AML violations. Massari pointed out that authorities can also surveil stablecoin transactions, as these assets run on public blockchains. She also called for sensible regulation around the technology — so long as it isn’t too heavy-handed. “We have a tendency [when regulating] financial services to take the new thing and cram it into the old,” she said. What is more, she also advocated for a “common set of standards” to govern stablecoin issuers so that users can feel more confident in all stablecoins being properly backed. Jachym made efforts to shift the focus of the hearing from stablecoins to the Digital Asset Market Structure bill , claiming that it was “critical” that regulatory agencies construct clear guidelines for which digital assets are securities and which aren’t. He didn’t receive much uptake though. Massad stated that discussing stablecoins was more important than discussing the market structure bill, making the case that the market structure bill isn’t a pressing matter, as regulators can work with existing securities laws to regulate crypto markets. Jachym stressed the point that “the jurisdictional lines [around] digital assets should be simple” and said that “the lack of regulatory certainty in the U.S. has impeded growth [in the crypto industry.]” Cohen made a similar claim, stating that crypto entrepreneurs in the U.S. “feel the constant threat of litigation,” alluding to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s “ regulation-by-enforcement ” approach. He also shared that the “uncertain regulatory environment has left both consumers and users of digital assets at risk.” The only participant in the hearing who directly pushed back on the U.S. government’s desire to (over)regulate digital assets was Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH). “The government has this total and complete desire to control things,” said Senator Moreno, who went on to share that a number of recent technologies have been used for illicit purposes, not just crypto. “Why all of a sudden when we got to digital currencies did we think here in Washington, D.C. that we are going to decide the pace of innovation?” he concluded. Throughout the meeting, the subcommittee members asked the witnesses which jurisdictions around the world the U.S. should take cues from in modeling its digital asset regulatory framework. Massad made the case for Europe and the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, which the European Union just put into effect, while Jachym suggested looking to states like Wyoming, where Kraken is based, to learn from the crypto laws the state’s legislature has passed . While the Senators on the subcommittee and the witnesses present offered various perspectives on the topics discussed, a certain sentiment permeated the hearing, which was that it’s high time politicians on both sides of the aisle come together to create clear rules of the road for the crypto industry. “Bipartisan support for crypto policy is no longer a distant goal on the horizon,” said Jachym, with a certain sense of relief.

The bill was moved to the House floor by the House Ways and Means Committee through a 26-16 split, and now, the Republicans, who currently dominate the House, are in support of cryptocurrencies. The Ways and Means Committee just passed H.J.Res. 25 – a resolution that repeals an unfair and unworkable cryptocurrency rule that would hamper cryptocurrency holders and the IRS with additional, burdensome paperwork. pic.twitter.com/HRJ1yWJSZA — Ways and Means Committee (@WaysandMeansGOP) February 26, 2025 The resolution targeted an IRS regulation that was passed in December, in which DeFi projects should be classified as brokers. As per the rule, DeFi platforms are required to provide the same reportage standards as brokers involved in equities or debt securities trading. This includes the provision of Form 1099 tax documents to users. The US Treasury Department has stated that the form may assist with reducing errors and improving compliance. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) claims that the measure burdens DeFi projects unnecessarily while excluding foreign persons. According to Smith, the regulation protects international competitors by setting extremely high standards for U.S. projects only. However, some of the major crypto firms and lobbying groups, such as the Blockchain Association, have opposed the rule. Last week, they sent a letter to Congress asking the congressmen to rescind the regulation. Critics of the rule have also expressed similar opinions, stating that the rule will hamper innovation and put undue pressure on DeFi platforms. Rep. Mike Carey went further by stating that the regulation would overburden both taxpayers and the IRS. Republican Rep. Jason Smith, who is the chairman of the committee, accused the federal government of overreaching existing tax laws. Democratic lawmakers, however, have defended the rule as essential, mainly regarding tax compliance. Rep. Richard Neal defended the regulation, stating that it is against tax avoidance and that the law requires everyone to pay what is due. If this rule is repealed, revenue loss would aggregate to $3.9 billion within a decade in the United States alone. Broader crypto industry response The resolution corresponds to initiatives in the Senate, where Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) presented a similar measure in January. Cruz also expressed his disapproval of the IRS rule by arguing that blockchain technology faces risks of stagnation in the United States. However, the resolution cannot take effect without approval by both chambers of Congress and the president, which is a provision of the Congressional Review Act. If adopted, the measure will repeal the IRS rule, meaning that DeFi projects will no longer be subject to tax reporting. The IRS has recently made clear the taxation on staking rewards for cryptocurrencies by stating that they are subject to tax when received. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The Wednesday hearing, framed as the jumping-off point for further Congressional action on digital asset regulations, was the first hosted by the banking committee's new digital assets subcommittee and chaired by Wyoming Republican Cynthia Lummis , a longtime crypto proponent . ""We're on the precipice of finally creating a bipartisan legislative framework for both stablecoins and market structure,"" Lummis said in her opening statement, referring to draft legislation she introduced with New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand as a natural counterpart to the House's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. Stablecoins will be first on the committee's agenda though, she said, echoing statements made by White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks and South Carolina Republican Tim Scott, who chairs the overall Senate Banking Committee. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, one of the hearing's four witnesses, told the lawmakers to focus on stablecoin legislation for the moment and defer any market structure efforts ""for several years."" ""For four years, the crypto industry has called on the SEC and CFTC to develop rules and guidance and to stop regulating by enforcement; that is now happening,"" he said. ""The SEC has dropped enforcement cases and launched a crypto task force to tackle these issues. We should let these regulatory issue initiatives make progress before rushing to rewrite the securities law."" Existing proposals to update market structure regulations to address crypto have the potential to ""create more confusion than clarity,"" he added, particularly around defining how a digital asset might be a security, commodity or something else. These proposals could potentially undermine existing securities laws, especially if they address decentralized finance. ""That term is used to describe a lot of things that aren't decentralized,"" Massad continued. ""There are almost always some vectors of control. And even if a process is decentralized or automated, that does not mean it should be exempt from regulation."" Virginia Democrat Mark Warner asked the panelists to discuss the possibility of stablecoin users conducting know-your-customer processes, noting that an issuer may conduct KYC but that a stablecoin may be transferred between wallets without those intermediate transfers going through a KYC process. ""I want to get to a regulatory framework that works, but I have seen — echoing what others have said from the classified side — oh my gosh, a whole bunch of bad stuff,"" Warner said. ""So help me figure out, and I recognize [for] some people, the anonymity and and the disintermediation role the blockchain plays, but how do we put some minimum protections from issuer all the way back to conversion to fiat?"" Lightspark co-founder and Chief Legal Officer Jai Massari noted that even though self-custodied wallets don't conduct KYC, ""there is an immutable on-chain record of those transactions that can be monitored, not only by the issuer, but [by] third parties, including law enforcement."" While mixers and other tools can obfuscate transactions, custodial wallets still conduct KYC at the end of a chain of transfers, she noted. ""I agree that we need to continue, as the industry has done, to develop new tools to address these issues,"" said Massari.",Policy|Senate Banking Committee|Cynthia Lummis|Stablecoin legislation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-27 01:10:23

40887792,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/depin-pledge-slashes-cloud-costs-by-80-says-fluence,1740620045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/40887792.jpeg,"DePIN Pledge Slashes Cloud Costs by 80%, Says Fluence",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/depin-pledge-slashes-cloud-costs-by-80-says-fluence,"On February 26, 2025, Fluence launched the “DePIN Pledge” in Denver, promising to cut cloud computing costs by 60-80% using Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). Centralized giants like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud dominate 70% of the global cloud market, per 2024 estimates, but their prices strain Web3 projects. Fluence, backed by $14 million in funding, says DePIN can slash those bills while boosting decentralization. Here’s the data-driven story. DePIN Pledge Targets Sky-High Cloud Costs Fluence , a DePIN cloudless computing platform founded in 2017, launched the DePIN Pledge to push Web3 and crypto firms toward decentralized infrastructure. Tom Trowbridge, Fluence’s Co-Founder & CEO, said on February 26, 2025, “We expect a wide range of DePIN products and services used by projects and companies over the coming years.” The pledge, detailed in a press release, targets centralized hyperscalers charging 60-80% more than Fluence’s DePIN alternative. Fluence’s network, funded by $14 million from investors like 1KX, Multicoin, and Tiger Global, plans a $100 million hardware expansion. This could scale DePIN’s reach, cutting costs for Web3 users. Cost Savings: 60-80% Cheaper Than Legacy Clouds Centralized clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud lock in clients with high fees. Fluence claims DePIN reduces compute costs by 60-80% compared to these providers. The company verifies services, eliminating vendor lock-in. This cost cut targets Web3 projects struggling with rising compute demands, especially for AI and blockchain. Initial DePIN Pledge signatories include The DePIN Pledge launches with the collaboration of leading companies like Consensys, Polygon, Helium, Gelato, Impossible Cloud Network, IoTEX, Infura, Spheron, BlockScout, Pocket Network, Outlier Ventures, NodeOps, IO.NET , OpenMesh, NuNet, RapidNode, AnyType, iExec, Aleph Cloud, Heurist, Derad Network, and more. These firms commit to adopting DePIN, aiming for lower costs and decentralization, per the February 26, 2025, announcement. Clemens Wan, Solutions Architect and AI Evangelist at Consensys, stated on February 26, 2025, “DIN’s vision is to bring high-performance Web3 infrastructure, including RPC, via permissionless and decentralized mechanisms. We support the DePIN Pledge because Web3’s promise requires cost-effective, decentralized services.” This aligns with Infura’s mission to advance decentralized infrastructure. Jing Sun, Co-founder of IoTeX, added, “IoTeX’s mission is to enable true data ownership and decentralization. The DePIN Pledge highlights how decentralized infrastructure reduces costs while enhancing security and transparency.” Fluence’s $100M Hardware Push Fluence’s DePIN platform offers a low-cost alternative to centralized clouds. With $14 million raised and $100 million slated for hardware, Fluence scales its network. This expansion targets Web3’s growing need for compute power, driven by AI’s demand for data and processing. The DePIN Pledge creates a marketplace on DePINpledge.xyz, listing verified companies adopting decentralized infrastructure. Trowbridge noted, “The future of DePIN sees communities gaining control over systems shaping their lives.” This cost-saving approach counters centralized control, per the press release. Fluence’s DePIN Pledge launched on February 26, 2025, with clear goals: slash cloud costs, end centralized dependency, and empower communities. The 60-80% cost reduction could reshape Web3 economics. Signatories receive a manifesto and a DePIN Pledge NFT, auditable on Ethereum, symbolizing their commitment. Join at DePINpledge.xyz or follow #DePINPledge on X for updates.

Justin Sun And SEC Seek Case Pause This joint filing, submitted on Wednesday, indicates that both parties believe it is in their mutual interest to pause the case while they explore a potential resolution. They assert that such a stay would not prejudice any involved parties or non-parties, marking a collaborative approach to navigating the complexities of crypto regulation. This follows a similar request for a pause in the case against Binance and reflects a notable shift in the regulatory climate for digital assets in the United States since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Related Reading: Panic Sell? Bitcoin’s $86K Fall Wipes Out $1 Billion In Trades Under the acting chair Mark Uyeda, the SEC has recently closed investigations into several crypto entities, including Robinhood, the decentralized finance firm Uniswap, and the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea. Most significantly, Coinbase announced that the SEC agreed to drop its lawsuit against the largest digital asset exchange in the US, pending commissioner approval. SEC Favoring Trump’s Business Associates? These actions mark a significant pivot from the previous administration’s approach, which has been criticized by various crypto executives, many of whom celebrated the former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation in January. Specifically, the SEC sued Justin Sun in 2023, alleging that he collaborated with entities he controls, such as the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent Foundation, to orchestrate the offer and sale of “unregistered securities.” However, the recent decision to seek a stay in these proceedings suggests a reevaluation of the agency’s priorities, particularly concerning figures like Justin Sun. Related Reading: Strategy (MSTR) Crashes 55%—Is A $44 Billion Bitcoin Liquidation Possible? Corey Frayer, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America and a former adviser to Gensler, noted that the absence of fraud charges in the Justin Sun case signifies a “troubling politicization” of the SEC. The director remarked that the agency’s current approach appears to be “benefitting Trump’s business associates,” suggesting a shift in regulatory focus that aligns with the interests of the former president. This comes amid significant investments in Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI), with Justin Sun purchasing over $70 million in WLFI token’s to support this upcoming decentralized finance (DeFi) venture.

While DOGE eyes that dollar milestone, a fresh contender, Panshibi is stealing the show. This Ethereum-based, panda-themed meme coin has already hauled in a stunning $1.17 million in its presale in mere weeks, fueled by a passionate community and bold promises of 50x gains. As investors weigh their next move, the contrast between Dogecoin’s established hype and Panshibi’s explosive newcomer vibe sets the stage for a thrilling showdown in the meme coin arena. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Aiming for $1 by Year-End Dogecoin has long been a rollercoaster powered by community spirit and Elon Musk’s unpredictable influence - now amplified by his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The number 1 meme coin is trading at $0.21 as of February 25, 2025 and currently has a market cap of $31 billion. A bold Dogecoin price prediction has set the crypto world abuzz, with Dogecoin analysts eyeing a climb to $1 by the close of 2025. The year so far boasts a 130% gain, but that all-time high remains elusive, sitting 65% above today’s mark. Could Dogecoin price finally crack the dollar barrier? Dogecoin ecosystem developments offer clues. Musk’s recent appointment to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Vivek Ramaswamy under President Trump’s administration has reignited significant buzz. With an inflationary supply - no cap, just 10,000 new DOGE minted every minute - the road to $1 feels steep unless sentiment flips hard. Analysts are looking to Panshibi, a fresh contender stealing the spotlight with a presale haul that’s turning heads. Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Panda Powerhouse Surging to Life While Dogecoin claws for that $1 dream, Panshibi has stormed in, raking up $1.1 million in mere weeks during its presale - proof it’s got massive backing. Built on Ethereum’s stable blockchain, this panda-themed meme coin isn’t just coasting on cuteness. Priced at $0.005 in Stage 4 as of now, SHIBI’s presale is a 60-day dash toward $10 million, with 60% of its 2 billion token supply up for grabs. Investors are piling in, drawn by whispers of a 50x surge - or even a wild 145,000% post-launch leap - once it hits heavyweights like Binance and Uniswap. Unlike DOGE’s slow grind, Panshibi’s momentum feels like a rocket priming for takeoff and it’s not hard to see why. Early buyers get a VIP pass to the Bamboo Private Club, where NFT perks and community quests await. Security’s no joke either - a Coinsult audit greenlights its smart contract and liquidity has been locked for 10 years with team tokens sealed for two years to secure trust. Beyond the crypto hustle, SHIBI ties its gains to panda conservation, blending a feel-good mission with fat-profit potential. Dogecoin price prediction might tease $1, but Panshibi’sbrewing a storm that could dwarf it, fueled by Social-Fi flair and AI-driven engagement that’s got the crypto market buzzing. Panshibi Surges In Presale; Grab SHIBI Tokens Now! Panshibi’s roadmap is a feast: NFT drops and AI quests make SHIBI a living ecosystem, not just a ticker like Dogecoin. Analysts peg a $0.026 listing - 520% from now - with 50x chatter if whales bite. Staking alone dangles a jaw-dropping 1,200% APY, with 15% of tokens locked for rewards, ensuring long-term holders feast. Analysts think SHIBI presale must not be missed: Join Now!

However, the recent correction which triggered a massive selloff has led to investors searching for alternative cryptos that can guarantee short and long-term returns. Among the altcoins making waves is the RemittixDeFi coin which is projected to rise by over 5000% in the coming weeks. With its fantastic PayFi platform, which allows for the seamless conversion of crypto to fiat, Remittix is projected to lead the DeFi landscape revolution. Market watchers believe that Remittix could enter the top 10 DeFi coins within weeks of launching, making it one of the altcoins on investors' watchlists. Let's see why. Expert Predicts Pepe Coin Could Surge 15x in Short Term Pepe (PEPE) has seen a significant drop in price in recent weeks as a result of the general crypto market bearish sentiment which was occasioned by a series of macroeconomic developments. However, a recovery could be close. As per CoinMarketCap , Pepe price dipped 33% in the past month and 12% in the past week. Amidst these successive declines, experts remain bullish about the Pepe coin. Source: CoinMarketCap One of such experts who are positive about Pepe is Crypto Elites . The analyst claims Pepe cryptocould make a big move very soon. This move could see the price of Pepe surge by 15x in the short term. Meanwhile, Pepe market sentiment remains bearish despite showing signs of a potential rally. Source: CryptoElites on X As per TradingView , Pepe trades below the 50-day SMA with a price volatility of 13. Having hit over $10B in December, the Pepe market cap has dropped below $4B with the trading volume also shrinking. However, if it can break out from the falling wedge pattern, a potential 80% rally is possible according to Jonathan Carter on X. Shiba Inu Could See Massive Increase Despite Market Uncertainty Shiba Inu's (SHIB) run in 2025 has been rough with the Ethereum-based meme coin pricedropping by over 80% from the all time high of $0.000088. According to CoinMarketCap , Shiba Inu's price has plummeted by over 18% in the monthly chart, signaling its battle with the bear market. Source: CoinMarketCap However, Javon Marks in a tweet on X remains optimistic of a rally soon. In the Shiba Inu price analysis, Javon thinks that SHIB price is maintaining the structure of a large inverse head and shoulder pattern. This suggests that Javons 402% projection for the meme coin is still in play. Source: Javon Marks on X In terms of technical analysis, the Shiba Inu Fear and Greed index is 21 (Extreme Fear) as market sentiment remains bearish. This suggests that investors are exercising caution with the sellers having the upper hand. Should Shiba Inu's price fail to hold the $0.000012 support level, it could slide further into the bear market. However, the growing partnerships are likely to trigger a resurgence soon as more investors join the project. Remittix: The Revolutionary Platform Changing the Game with Crypto-to-Fiat Solutions While Shiba Inu and Pepe thrive on hype and speculation, Remittix (RTX) is already breaking records in the market. As it continues to make waves across the market, Remittix has already raised over $12.9M in cryptocurrency ICO funding. At the current trajectory, the presale funding might hit $20M in March. One of the driving factors is the PayFi platform, designed to allow individuals to convert over 40 different cryptos into fiat and send them to any approved global bank at no hidden fees for FX or wire. This would allow a quicker, more secure and low-cost avenue of global money transfer than traditional financial institutions. Through the Remittix pay API, businesses can accept cryptos as a form of payment and settle transactions in fiat. Although it competes with Stripe and Wise, none of them allows for crypto-to-fiat conversion. The Remittix ecosystem comes with a robust security architecture with all transactions stored in a public ledger, allowing for transparency and traceability. Sold for just $0.0671, more than 16,000 users have joined the community, with 20,000 expected in the coming days. Early investors have made over 1000% ROI which could rise to 2000% in March. Given the massive adoption, the Remittix price might surpass the 5,880% projection before the end of Q1. This makes it one of the top altcoins to invest in for massive returns in 2025. Which Altcoin Should Investors Buy for Big Gains in 2025? Shiba Inu and Pepe are undergoing corrections as they battle to break out from the dip. However, there are positive signals of these altcoins witnessing relief rallies in the coming days. As the crypto market continues to struggle, Remittix presale has continued to make waves. Its cross-border payment platform will attract more investors soon which will increase the demand for RTX. With the principles of demand and supply, the RTX price might jump to $5 on the listing in a major exchange, making it the best altcoin to buy in the dip.

Investors are flocking to this decentralized lending platform, eyeing a potential leap to $5. Meanwhile, established tokens like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) linger in slower growth lanes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charging ahead in phase two of its presale, offering a clear shot at 300% returns by launch at $0.06. Could it outpace its bigger rivals? Four reasons suggest yes, and they hinge on momentum, utility, and market timing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Riding High Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has opened phase two of its presale, listing tokens at $0.015 after a rapid first phase that raised eyebrows across the crypto market. Already, $1,424,320.08 has been raised, backed by 2,790 holders who see value in this early entry. The opening phase sold out fast, signaling urgency among buyers snapping up tokens before the price climbs. By launch, the tokenomics lock in a rise to $0.06, delivering a 300% profit for those jumping in now. Looking further, a post-launch climb to $5 isn’t a wild guess; it’s a target fueled by the platform’s lending and borrowing system. Unlike many tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ties its value to real use, not just hype. As demand surges, this phase two window narrows, pushing investors to act before the next price hike. Ripple (XRP) Facing Uphill Climb As Cardano (ADA) Lags in Speed Ripple (XRP) holds a solid spot in the crypto market, but its path to $5 feels less certain. Trading around $2.50 recently, it leans heavily on regulatory wins and adoption for cross-border payments. Progress exists, yet the pace drags compared to fresher projects. Investors note Ripple’s growth often stalls under legal pressures or market shifts, keeping it from explosive jumps. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) boasts a loyal following and steady development, hovering near $0.65 lately. Its focus on scalability and research-driven upgrades earns respect, but the gains come slowly. Investors waiting for Cardano to hit $5 face a long road, as its ecosystem grows at a measured clip. Four Reasons Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Leads the Pack Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) isn’t just riding a wave; it’s creating one. First, its presale structure locks in a 4x return at $0.06, a concrete gain baked into the plan. Second, the platform’s lending utility drives demand, letting users earn or borrow with crypto assets. Third, phase two at $0.015 offers a low entry before launch, a rare chance slipping away fast. Fourth, its post-launch potential points to $5, outstripping Ripple and Cardano’s slower trajectories in 2025. Each reason flows from the last, representing a token built for growth. 1,000 invested today in Mutuum Finance could turn into $4,000 at launch and $333,000 at $5. The crypto market thrives on opportunity, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers it. Phase two is selling quickly at $0.015, with $1.4 million already raised and 2,790 holders on board. Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) carry name recognition, but their climb to $5 leans on hope and time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clearer shot, blending presale gains with a platform ready to skyrocket. The first phase flew by, and this second one won’t linger. For those chasing a jump from $0.015 to $5 in 2025, now’s the ideal time to join the presale.

The ‘whales‘ broadly refer to the entities who own more than 1,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed For $72,000? These Metrics Could Hint So At the current exchange rate, this amount converts to a whopping $88.9 million, so the only investors who would qualify for the cohort would be the big-money ones. In the context of the current topic, the holders of focus aren’t just any ordinary whales, but in fact the largest among them: those carrying more than 10,000 BTC ($889 million) in their balance. This group may be termed as the ‘mega whales.’ Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the holdings of the Bitcoin mega whales over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin mega whales sold some of their supply during the price crash. More interesting, though, is the detail that these investors already began their selloff a few days back, a potential indication that they saw the price plunge coming. According to IntoTheBlock, this cohort was the primary seller in this window. In fact, the analytics firm has pointed out that the rest of the groups have shown combined accumulation at the same time, meaning the smaller entities are looking at the plummet as an opportunity to buy. In total, the mega whales have sold 25,740 BTC (almost $2.3 billion) over the last seven days. The behavior of the cohort could now be to keep an eye on in the coming days, as with the rest of the market buying, what these humongous investors do could tip the balance one way or the other for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loss Holders Highest Since October As BTC Crashes To $87,000 Holder balance is just one way to classify BTC cohorts. Another is through exchanges, as different platforms can host a different demographic of investors. Two exchanges in particular are generally of relevance in this type of analysis: Coinbase and Binance. Coinbase is mainly used by entities from the US, especially large institutional traders, while Binance serves global investors. An indicator that can be used for tracking the difference in behavior between the two user bases is the Coinbase Premium Index. This metric measures the percentage difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). As CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju pointed out in an X post, the Coinbase Premium Index has been negative recently. This trend, alongside the fact that Coinbase’s spot volume dominance has shot up recently (left chart), would suggest the American whales have been the main drivers during the crash. BTC Price Bitcoin approached the $86,000 mark during yesterday’s dip, but the coin has since seen a rebound as its price is now trading around $88,700.

While Bitcoin hovers near all-time highs and major altcoins fight for dominance, one low-cost crypto is making waves, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. This viral token, still priced below $1, is not only attracting retail traders but also drawing in major crypto whales who see massive upside potential. Among the hottest altcoins right now, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as the project that has gone viral, surpassing $1.5 million in its presale and gaining serious traction as a game-changer in blockchain-powered e-commerce. With whales rushing in, this token could be setting the stage for an explosive rally. What’s Causing This Altcoin to Go Viral? In the crypto world, prices don’t always tell the full story. While some investors chase the latest meme coins or short-lived hype projects, smart traders look for fundamentally strong projects with a clear use case and growing adoption. Web3Bay has gone viral for all the right reasons, tapping into one of the largest industries in the world—e-commerce. Unlike meme coins that rely on hype alone, Web3Bay is solving a real-world problem by creating a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact directly, cutting out the high fees and restrictions imposed by platforms like Amazon and eBay. This has positioned Web3Bay as a token with both utility and growth potential, making it an attractive option for long-term investors. As more traders recognize this, the project has rapidly gained momentum, with social media chatter exploding and big-money investors pouring into the presale. Crypto Whales Are Accumulating—What Do They See in Web3Bay? One of the biggest indicators of a project’s success is whale accumulation. Large-scale investors don’t chase hype—they analyze market trends, tokenomics, and real-world applications before making moves. The fact that whales are entering Web3Bay’s presale in record numbers suggests they see serious upside potential. Several factors are likely driving this whale accumulation: Low Entry Price – At just $0.004562 per token, Web3Bay is still extremely undervalued right now. Investors looking for 100x gains prefer entering projects early before mainstream adoption kicks in. Real-World Use Case – Unlike many altcoins that struggle to define their purpose, Web3Bay is bringing decentralization to e-commerce, offering buyers and sellers a more secure, transparent, and cost-effective way to trade. Growing Adoption – The presale has already surpassed $1.5 million, with more than 380 million tokens sold. As more investors jump in, early backers are seeing their holdings appreciate before the token even hits the open market. Tokenomics Designed for Growth – Web3Bay’s carefully structured token supply ensures long-term sustainability, reducing the risk of sudden crashes or massive sell-offs that plague many other low-cost cryptos. Whales recognize early-stage opportunities when they see them, and Web3Bay is proving to be one of the strongest investment options in the sub-$1 category. Web3Bay vs. Other Low-Priced Altcoins—Why It Stands Out The sub-$1 crypto space is full of risky bets, from meme coins with no real use case to projects that lack development progress. Web3Bay, however, is setting itself apart by building something that has never been done before in e-commerce. While other cryptos rely solely on speculative demand, Web3Bay has an entire decentralized ecosystem backing its value. Users can buy and sell goods with cryptocurrency while maintaining full ownership of their data and avoiding the high fees associated with centralized marketplaces. This real-world integration means that Web3Bay has the potential to see widespread adoption, leading to sustainable price appreciation rather than short-term hype-driven pumps. With a strong development team, growing investor support, and a presale that’s exceeding expectations, Web3Bay is proving why it’s the standout choice among low-priced altcoins. Could This Be the Next 100x Altcoin? Web3Bay’s viral rise has led many analysts to predict major price appreciation in the near future. Given its low presale price and strong investor demand, the numbers suggest that it could deliver massive gains once it launches on major exchanges. If Web3Bay were to reach just $0.20, it would represent a nearly 4,300% increase from its presale price, turning a $1,000 investment into over $40,000. If the token reaches $1 in the coming years, early investors could see gains of over 100x. With whales accumulating and mainstream investors starting to take notice, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Web3Bay has the potential to be one of the biggest breakout stars of 2025. Final Thoughts With major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum already highly valued, investors looking for massive returns are turning to undervalued projects that still have room to grow. Web3Bay checks all the boxes for a top-tier crypto investment—it has real utility, a growing investor base, and strong financial backing. Unlike other low-priced cryptos that rely on speculation alone, Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model provides a clear path to sustained growth. As crypto whales continue to buy in, and the presale surpasses new milestones, it’s only a matter of time before Web3Bay’s price starts climbing rapidly. For investors who want to capitalize on an early-stage opportunity before it explodes, now is the time to act.

Dogecoin, once a rocket fueled by Musk’s tweets and a fervent community, now faces a rocky road down 31% in the past month. Meanwhile, big funds are flowing elsewhere, going in on Panshibi , an Ethereum-based meme coin that’s raised $1.17 million in its presale within 33 days Let us see Panshibi’s allure and why investors anticipate a 20x surge in the coming weeks. Could Dogecoin’s Price Tumble to $0.10? As of February 26, Dogecoin price is trading at $0.212 , which marks a return of the top altcoin’s price to retest key support levels on the back of selling pressures affecting the broader market. Dogecoin’s ecosystem leans hard on Musk’s star power, but even that is proving to be insufficient to buoy DOGE these days. However while price suffers, Dogecoin’s market cap currently clinging to $31 billion means it is still the OG and number 1 meme. In Dogecoin’s recent news, Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, submitted its 19b-4 filing through NYSE Arca in late January to convert its recently launched Grayscale Dogecoin Trust into an ETF, following similar moves for XRP and Polkadot funds. Technical analysis shows a forming death cross and an RSI of 32, indicating oversold conditions but also potential for further short-term drops. Support at $0.20 is critical; if it breaks, the price might test lower levels like $0.15, aligning with bearish predictions. Dogecoin price prediction aside, Dogecoin faithfuls face a choice: ride Musk’s rollercoaster or jump ship. Many are picking Panshibi, where big funds are flowing fast. Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Panda-Powered Meme Coin Surge Panshibi attracts users because it allows them to use meme creativity to earn significant financial rewards. The developers of this ERC20 coin have built their tokenomics system with precision to support fast growth and protect investment as Dogecoin price predictions encourage investors to exercise caution. Currently priced at $0.005 in Stage 4 of its token presale, this panda-themed token blends Asian cultural appeal with cutting-edge features like Social-Fi and AI-driven community engagement, setting it apart from the typical hype-driven meme coin pack. Investors are buzzing about forecasts of a 20x or even 145,000% surge post-launch on major exchanges like Binance and Uniswap. Investors can obtain a stake in what experts consider to be the best crypto to buy in 2025. Early investors also gain access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club, unlocking exclusive perks like NFT drops and community quests, while a Coinsult-audited smart contract and a 10-year liquidity lock cement trust in its stability. Beyond the blockchain, Panshibi ties its success to panda conservation efforts, adding a layer of purpose that resonates with its growing community. Panshibi Presale Surge Is Not Ending Anytime Soon Top altcoin investors including Dogecoin and Ethereum holders are shifting stacks of money into Panshibi. They are doing this with the idea that $1,000 today could flip into $20,000 in the coming weeks if SHIBI’s 20x promise lands. While Dogecoin price predictions foresee a crash to $0.10, Panshibi dodges that pitfall with a tighter grip on its tokenomics. Today’s market is craving winners and this panda’s massive backing could see it outrun Musk’s pup. Don’t sleep on SHIBI 2025’s meme panda might just go bamboo.

Andriunin, the founder and CEO of crypto market maker Gotbit is charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit market manipulation and wire fraud in connection with wash trading activities. Gotbit allegedly offered wash trading services to cryptocurrency issuers. Wash trading is the practice of carrying out sham trades to inflate trading volume and give the impression of high market demand. Gotbit sales director Qawi Jalili, director of market making Fedor Kedrov, and the company itself have also been charged. According to Reuters’ Kedrov and Jalili are thought to be located in Russia. Gotbit allegedly offered wash trading for years Gotbit allegedly collected tens of millions of dollars for its services between 2018 and 2024. Andriunin, a 26-year-old Russian national, allegedly transfers millions of dollars of company money to his personal Binance account. He was arrested in Portugal on Oct. 8 and extradited. He will remain in custody until his trial. If found guilty of the wire fraud, Andriunin could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy charge could bring another five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. Gotbit Hedge Fund, which still operates, describes its activities as “crafting and executing a tailored growth strategy for your token. Our primary goal is to generate buy pressure within your market.” It claims on its website to have 180+ employees, as well as 1.3 billion [dollars?] in assets under management for 400+ institutional clients. The FBI caught four companies doing wash trading at the same time Gotbit’s downfall came about due to a complex sting operation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) called Operation Token Mirrors in October. The FBI created a token called NexFundAI (NEXF) and engaged the services of four companies to promote it. The company does not seem to have been involved in promoting NEXF, but it promoted tokens whose illicit backgrounds were uncovered in the larger investigation. Operation Token Mirrors led to charges against 18 people and eight companies in all. Trades with 60 cryptocurrencies were deactivated and $25 million in cryptocurrency was seized. NEXF is still being traded . Online crypto investigator ZachXBT had warned against dealing with Gotbit a year earlier. “I would be weary of any projects you see working with the market maker @gotbit_io as a leaked report shows highly questionable services offered,” he wrote on X. Among the members of its “community” shown on its website are Binance, Bybit, Crypto.com, HashKey, KuCoin and OKX. Nobody knows you when you’re an alleged wash trader Another party in the Gotbit debacle was the tremendously popular Telegram-based game Hamster Kombat. Gotbit announced in April that it was the Hamster Kombat team’s “official advisor on their web3 journey.” After Operation Token Mirrors was wound up, Hamster Kombat denied that it had ever worked with Gotbit. The company also claimed to work with the memecoin BONK beginning in August 2023. It is known to have worked with the NEIRO team. The developers of that memecoin cut ties with Gotbit after the FBI operation. ZachXBT took the NEIRO team to task for ignoring his warning. NEIRO’s anonymous CTO co-lead S responded . S said the team needed to find a market maker fast when it was okayed for listing on HTX and it was its only “warm connection.” S continued, “I had heard various bad things about Gotbit. Similarly, I’ve heard various bad things for pretty much everyone in this industry, so it’s difficult to apply discretion.” ZachXBT was not mollified.

Undoubtedly, many investors will be expecting the top crypto tokens to be among the best-performing assets in 2025. However, this new Remittixproject, currently surging in presale, may flip these tokens in percentage growth. The Remittix (RTX) project has already sold more than half its presale as investors troop in to be part of the project. Termed as the next blue-chip crypto, Remittix represents one of the top DeFi projects to look out for in 2025. SEC Likely to Drop Case with XRP as Market Sentiment Grows Bullish The ongoing legal battle between the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and XRP could be nearing its end. This is coming after the SEC dropped its ongoing case against Uniswap and other crypto companies like Coinbase, Robinhood, Binance and OpenSea, with many predicting that XRP could be the next case to be dropped. Already, the SEC has acknowledged the filing of XRP spot ETF from CoinShares and WisdomTree in recent weeks. These all combine to provide an air of bullish potential for the XRP token which has been on a decline. According to market stats , XRP price has lost 22% within the past month. Source: CoinMarketCap While the retracement still rages in the short-term, it possesses a buy zone opportunity considering the bull run that could be triggered with approval of spot ETF and case drop from SEC. In a tweet on X, crypto analyst Butcher believes the XRP price chart looks bullish and could hit $20 very soon. Source: Butcher on X Will SOL Price Dip Lower? Solana's price has lost over 41% of its value within the last month as per CoinMarketCap . This trajectory has seen the altcoin price decline below the $150 mark from an all-time high of $294.33 recorded in January. Also, Solana's market volume doesn't look good with over 40% decline on a day-to-day average over the past week. Source: CoinMarketCap Amid the price downturn, analyst Crypto King on X is projecting a rebound for Solana at the $131 level. The last time that Solana traded below $140 in November, it rebounded and triggered a parabolic surge to $257. It is likely that the same trajectory could occur in March. Source: Crypto King on X Although technical indicators from Tradingview suggest further downturn, the Solana ecosystemactivity has continued to grow with 37 out of the top 40 trending coins based on the Solana blockchain. Once the altcoin clears the current resistance zone, it is likely to witness massive rallies. Remittix (RTX) Generates Over $12.9 Million in Presale as Launch Draws Close While it is rare to see a crypto project generate over $12.9 million in presale, Remittix has done just that thanks to its revolutionary DeFi solution and exponential growth potential in the crypto market in 2025. Approximately 60% of the token's presale has been bought by investors with the expectation that the presale will sell out before the end of Q1. Most importantly, the major driving force of the Remittix project is its utility offerings. For context, Remittix is a revolutionary DeFi solution that facilitates smooth, efficient and cheap crypto-to-fiat transactions. With Remittix, users can send fiat currency to any approved global bank by simply connecting their wallet at no hidden fees outside of the flat fees charged. While companies like Coinbase facilitate crypto-to-crypto payment and Stripe offers fiat-to-fiat transactions, Remittix acts as a hybrid with its crypto-to-fiat solution. With the Remittix pay API, businesses can accept cryptos as a form of payment from customers and settle transactions in fiat. Companies can also utilize the platform to pay global workers. Remittix prioritizes the safety of investors' assets as all transactions are stored in a public ledger, allowing for easy traceability. As a decentralized peer-to-peer platform, users have full control of their assets. Sold for just $0.0671, early investors have made over 340% ROI. Given the growing momentum, the RTX price is expected to hit 100x in 2025. Top Crypto Assets to Prioritize in March Among the three highlighted tokens above, XRP and Remittix stand out as viable crypto projects to invest in ahead of Solana. Even better, Remittix comes top given its unique DeFi solution, its presale status, and its exponential post-launch growth potential. That is why, at just $0.0671, investors can buy the presale and position for the potential high-end ROIs.

Meme coins are making millionaires overnight, and with the latest market shifts, a few standout names are catching serious attention as the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Popcat (POPCAT) has surged by over 13% in the past 24 hours, pushing its market cap beyond $231 million. Meanwhile, Floki Inu (FLOKI) is expanding into DeFi with a newly approved European Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), giving it fresh momentum. But the real headline? BTFD Coin (BTFD) is entering its final presale stretch with a mind-blowing 3650% ROI potential, and the Bulls Squad is rallying hard. The meme coin race is on, and the smart money is already moving. While established names like Floki Inu and Popcat fight for traction, BTFD Coin’s exclusive presale at $0.00016 is giving early adopters a front-row seat to the biggest gains. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game fully launched, staking rewards at 90% APY, and an army of bulls behind it, this is the moment to grab the dip before the final presale stage closes. The BTFD Bulls Squad is making waves—are you in on one of the top new meme coins to invest in this month? BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad: The Final Stretch with 3650% ROI Potential Ever wonder how some investors turn small stacks into fortunes while others are stuck watching from the sidelines? It’s all about timing. BTFD Coin is at Stage 14 of its presale, and if you’re not paying attention, you could miss out on the kind of gains that crypto legends are made of. Let’s break it down. BTFD started its presale at just $0.000004 per coin. Right now, it’s sitting at $0.00016, and by the time it lists, it’ll be worth $0.0006. That’s a 275% gain at listing alone. But analysts are eyeing something much bigger—a potential moonshot of $0.006, meaning an insane 3650% ROI. Now, imagine you put $2500 into BTFD at today’s presale price of $0.00016. That gets you 15,625,000 BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at the listing, your investment grows to $9375. But hold on—if the BTFD Coin follows its projected moonshot to $0.006, you’re looking at a whopping $93,750. That’s life-changing money, and it’s exactly why the Bulls Squad is charging hard into this presale’s final phase. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. The Bulls Squad is a community-driven powerhouse, designed to help investors stack gains and ride the next bull market wave. With over 11,000 holders, more than $6.20 million raised, and 70 billion coins already sold, this isn’t a project that’s still looking for traction—it’s already moving at full speed. And the best part? BTFD’s P2E game is LIVE. That means holders can earn while playing, staking their rewards at a massive 90% APY. So, whether you’re stacking for the long haul or flipping for fast gains, BTFD is setting up investors for serious profits. Grab BTFD Coin Before the Presale Ends! This presale stage 14 is already 98.50% complete, and the price isn’t staying at $0.00016 much longer. Here’s how you can secure your stack before it jumps: Visit the official BTFD website Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Select your preferred currency (ETH, USDT, or BNB) Buy BTFD and confirm the transaction Secure your tokens before the final stage closes Don’t wait for the price to rocket—this is your chance to get in before BTFD makes history. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Expands into DeFi with New ETP Approval While BTFD is gearing up for massive presale gains, Floki Inu (FLOKI) is making waves in the DeFi space. Floki just secured approval for a European Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), expanding its reach to traditional investors. This move could boost FLOKI’s adoption, but its price remains 75.8% below its all-time high. At $0.00008401, FLOKI is seeing some recovery, but it still has a long way to go. The DeFi expansion is promising, but it doesn’t offer the same kind of explosive upside that BTFD’s presale is delivering. For long-term investors, Floki’s DeFi push could be interesting, but if you’re looking for the fastest gains right now, BTFD is where the action is. Popcat (POPCAT) Surges 13% as Meme Coin Frenzy Continues POPCAT is proving that meme coins aren’t going anywhere. In just the past 24 hours, Popcat has soared by 13%, pushing its price to $0.2363. With a market cap of $231.7 million, it’s holding strong, but it’s still 88.5% below its all-time high of $2.05. Popcat’s recent momentum comes from increased exchange listings and growing community interest, but it’s still playing catch-up. While it’s a solid project, it doesn’t have the same upside potential as BTFD Coin’s presale, where investors are getting in at the absolute ground floor. Final Thoughts: The Bulls Squad is Taking Over – Will You Join? Based on market trends and current opportunities, there’s one clear winner among the top new meme coins to invest in this month. While Floki Inu is expanding into DeFi and Popcat is gaining short-term momentum, BTFD Coin is offering the most explosive potential. With its final presale stage closing soon, a projected 3650% ROI, and a thriving Bulls Squad community, this is the meme coin opportunity that could define 2025. The choice is yours—watch from the sidelines, or join the Bulls Squad before this presale ends. The window is closing fast. Secure your BTFD now.

How much can I earn if BTFD hits its moon price? If you invest $2500 at today’s presale price ($0.00016), your holdings could be worth $93,750 if BTFD reaches $0.006. Is BTFD’s presale almost over? Yes, Stage 14 is already 98% complete, and the price will jump from $0.00016 to $0.0006 at listing. Where can I buy BTFD Coin? You can purchase BTFD through its official website before the presale ends. How does the BTFD referral program work? Users who share their referral code can earn 10% of their referral’s purchase if they make it into the top 20 referrers of the month.

PEPE Crashes Could Have Something To Do With This,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/have-pepe-holders-just-signaled-a-100x-presale-thats-live-right-now-pepe-crashes-could-have-something-to-do-with-this,"Several Pepecoin price predictions have been circulating lately, each offering conflicting forecasts about the future of the popular meme coin. While some analysts expect a rebound, others point to Pepecoin’s struggle amid mass liquidations in the market. Many investors reacted negatively to President Donald Trump’s sudden confirmation that the U.S. would impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, triggering widespread panic sales. Selling activity intensified as the tariffs' impact rippled through the crypto market, plunging hundreds of utility and meme coins into the red. Pepecoin holders have just signalled Panshibi’s ongoing ICO , a 100x presale is live now. This new meme-based project is believed to have a massive upside potential. But could its presale be the escape route for PEPE holders and other market participants looking to recover their losses? Let’s answer this question, but before that, we will look at Pepecoin price prediction. Pepecoin Price Prediction Market sentiment plays a vital role when assessing the future of digital assets. The crypto market just endured a brutal two-week stretch, with sell-offs appearing to have ended - until President Donald Trump’s tariffs announcement created new turmoil. Last Friday, there were reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would likely drop charges against Coinbase . Not too long after these reports were made public, PEPE spiked by about 6%. Yet, since then, the token has retraced its steps, deepening its losses. Market metrics show that it was in the green for just 12 days out of a possible 30 (i.e., 40%) in the past month. Since its peak last December, Pepecoin's price has remained in a downtrend, creating a descending channel characterized by lower highs and lower lows, a strong sign of selling pressure. Pepecoin is currently selling at $0.000008192 . The RSI signal, from its price charts, currently stands at 33.44, barely above the oversold zone (i.e., below 30). While this might suggest that the selling pressure is weakening, translating into a short-term rebound, the bears still have a firm grip on the market. At this juncture, Pepecoin price prediction is faced with two options. In case of a collapse from the $0.0000077 – $0.0000082 support zone under intense selling pressure, the price of Pepecoin can plummet to $0.0000065 or even lower. On the other hand, if the buyers manageto defend this pivotal level, Pepecoin can jump to $0.000010, the upper limit of its decliningchannel. On Pepecoin price prediction, most analysts believe there will be more downside, which is why Pepecoin investors are moving to a profitable project to recoup their losses. This subtleyet tactical movement leads us to Panshibi, which has created a market buzz following the start of its 60-day ICO. Panshibi: Could Explode 100x This Year While Panshibi may be new to the crypto market, its foundation is anything but random. The project is deeply rooted in Asian culture, featuring a Panda mascot - a calculated decision that could prove extremely valuable. Asia is one of the largest markets in crypto, making it a prime audience for a meme coin with cultural significance. By integrating Panda symbolism, Panshibi embodies power and resilience, positioning itself as a project capable of resisting financial market exploitation. The saying goes: With Panshibi, there is Pandas, power and profits. Panshibi is backed by a serious team with a long-term vision. This is not a bluff - the core team has locked tokens for two years and liquidity for an entire decade, proving their commitment to sustainability. Furthermore, they have made their CEX and DEX listing plans public, aiming to secure top-tier exchange listings this year. Panshibi’s 60-day presale is still on and SHIBI tokens are available at a discounted price of $0.005 each.

40891710,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=29740,1740623560,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,Dogecoin Price Prediction – Will DOGE Hit $0.40 in March?,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/dogecoin-price-prediction-february-2025/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies despite its origins as a joke. Initially created in 2013 as a parody of Bitcoin, DOGE has since gained real-world adoption, largely thanks to social media hype and support from figures like Elon Musk . As the crypto market prepares for another potential bull run in 2025, many investors are wondering: Can Dogecoin reach new all-time highs? This article breaks down Dogecoin’s price forecast for 2025 and beyond based on market trends, expert opinions, and potential catalysts. Current Market Performance Dogecoin currently trades at around $0. 20, fluctuating alongside broader crypto market trends. DOGE saw a massive surge in 2021 , reaching an all-time high of $0.73 in May before crashing alongside other cryptocurrencies. Since then, it has remained a favorite among retail investors but has struggled to regain its former highs. Short-Term Dogecoin Price Prediction (2024-2025) Many experts believe the crypto market could enter another bullish phase, benefiting Dogecoin. Here’s what analysts predict for DOGE’s price in the short term: Moderate Growth Expected : Most forecasts suggest DOGE could reach between $0.30 and $0.65 by the end of 2025 if market conditions remain favorable. Elon Musk’s Influence : Tesla and X (formerly Twitter) continue to be potential catalysts. If Musk integrates Dogecoin payments on X, DOGE could see a rapid price increase. Increased Utility : More businesses are accepting Dogecoin for payments, which could support steady price appreciation. Expert Predictions for 2025 WalletInvestor : Predicts a price range of $0.15 – $0.25 by late 2025. Changelly : Estimates DOGE could hit $0.30 – $0.40 if the crypto bull market takes off. CryptoNewz : A more optimistic forecast, suggesting DOGE might touch $0.50 if mass adoption increases. Long-Term Dogecoin Price Prediction (2026-2030) Long-term predictions for Dogecoin vary widely, depending on factors such as crypto adoption, regulatory policies, and overall market sentiment . Bullish Scenario If Dogecoin continues to gain traction as a medium of exchange , it could potentially reach $1.00 or higher by 2030 . Partnerships with major brands or integration into X for payments could be a game-changer. The broader adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions on Dogecoin’s network could improve transaction efficiency, driving price growth. Bearish Scenario If interest in Dogecoin declines or newer meme coins surpass it , DOGE could stagnate or drop below $0.05 . Regulatory crackdowns on meme coins could hinder its adoption and price potential. A prolonged bear market in crypto could keep DOGE’s price below $0.20 for years. Factors Influencing Dogecoin’s Future Price Several key factors will determine Dogecoin’s price trajectory in the coming years: 1. Elon Musk’s Endorsement Musk’s continued support for DOGE has been one of its biggest price drivers. If he integrates Dogecoin payments into Tesla or X (Twitter) , its value could surge. However, if Musk shifts focus away from DOGE, its hype could decline. 2. Bitcoin Halving & Market Trends Bitcoin’s 2024 halving is expected to trigger a crypto bull run , which typically benefits altcoins like Dogecoin. If history repeats itself, DOGE could see significant gains in 2025-2026 . 3. Real-World Adoption More merchants, platforms, and companies are accepting DOGE payments. Increased utility could drive long-term price growth and help it transition from a meme coin to a serious digital asset. 4. Competition from Other Meme Coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and newer meme tokens could overshadow Dogecoin if they offer better technology, faster transactions, or stronger communities. The meme coin market is highly competitive , making it crucial for DOGE to stay relevant. 5. Regulatory Challenges The global crypto market faces growing regulatory scrutiny , and meme coins like Dogecoin could be at risk if governments impose strict regulations. Investors should monitor legal developments closely. Is Dogecoin a Good Investment? Dogecoin remains a high-risk, high-reward asset. While it has strong community support and brand recognition, its future price depends on market trends, adoption, and continued hype . Investors should consider: Pros: Strong community backing and mainstream recognition. Potential integration into X (Twitter) payments . Historically follows Bitcoin’s bull cycles. Cons: Extremely volatile with no fixed supply limit. Meme coin competition (e.g., Shiba Inu, Floki, PEPE). Dependent on speculation and social media influence. Conclusion: Will Dogecoin Reach $1? While $1 DOGE is possible, it would require major adoption, Musk’s backing, and a booming crypto market . Most analysts predict DOGE will stay within the $0.20 – $0.50 range in the coming years , with the potential for higher gains in 2026-2030 . For investors, Dogecoin remains an exciting but speculative asset . It may not have the fundamentals of Bitcoin or Ethereum, but its meme-powered community and Elon Musk factor make it a unique play in the crypto space.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|SHIB|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-27 02:32:40

The Solana price remains a focal point for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as SOL holders assess its trajectory for 2025. Amidst Solana’s robust ecosystem, a new PayFi altcoin is gaining traction. Dubbed ""the next XRP"" by experts, this ERC20 coin offers a compelling alternative, drawing attention from SOL investors seeking the next big opportunity. This article delves into Solana’s outlook while spotlighting why this new Defi project is poised to redefine the altcoin landscape with its innovative approach to payments. Solana Price Prediction: A Shifting Landscape for SOL Holders Solana sits at $135 as of February 26, 2025 , stirring curiosity among holders about its future. This Solana price is a 21% decline over the past one week and with Solana market capitalization currently under $70 billion, SOL has faced a rocky month. While Solana price has tried to weather the storm of sell offs, a looming $2 billion FTX token unlock in March threatens further pressure. Analysts warn of a possible slide to $110 if support weakens. Despite its technical strengths, like 6.3 million daily users, Solana faces hurdles. An Argentina-based LIBRA token scandal shook confidence recently. The Solana price struggles to regain its 2024 peak near $300. Investors ponder if SOL’s rally has lost steam. Optimists still see upside. Some predict the Solana price could hit $230 by mid-2025 with speculation swirling around Franklin Templeton pushing forward with Solana ETF filings. Analysts at Coincodex estimate the Solana price to trade anywhere between $148 and $170 dollars in the coming weeks. However, bearish signals linger with volatility spiking. Holders are growing restless, seeking alternatives as uncertainty clouds Solana’s next move. Ripple’s Resurgence: XRP’s Payment Power Ripple, primarily linked to payment solutions, trades at $2.24 as of late February 2025 . A whale’s $51.8 million XRP withdrawal from an exchange sparked rally rumors. This moveslashed exchange supply, hinting at a potential price boost. The XRP Ledger saw a 40x surge in trading volume recently. Analysts like eye $5 by year-end. Some even forecast $27, echoing XRP’s 2017 highs. Yet, regulatory shadows loom, keeping the Ripple price volatile despite its payment prowess. In other news, DekaBank announced it was teaming up with Ripple Custody to deliver safe, regulated crypto trading and custody solutions for institutions. Ripple’s focus on cross-border transfers draws institutional interest. While the XRP price climbs, its legal battles with regulators persist. Investors weigh its stability against newer, agile players like Remittix in the market. Remittix: The Altcoin Gaining Traction Amid Solana price and XRP regulatory turbulence, Remittix emerges as a compelling option. Built on Ethereum, this PayFi token targets global remittances. It converts crypto to fiat instantly, slashing fees and delays. Remittix’s crypto-to-FIAT product streamlines payments across borders. Unlike XRP’s regulatory woes, Remittix prioritizes compliance and utility. It eyes the $700 billion remittance market, offering practical solutions. Analysts whisper of a 100x rally post-launch, exciting early adopters. Remittix stands out with its presale haul of more than $12.9 million. Its 300% token presale growth in 2025 dwarfs Solana’s flat performance. Targeting mass adoption via e-commerce and lending, RTX is more than a token, it's a payment revolution poised for exponential growth. Security sets Remittix apart. Institutional-grade protections build trust in a hack-prone space. Its capped supply fuels demand, unlike the Solana price facing risk of FTX dilution. Investors fleeing volatility see Remittix as a grounded bet with explosive upside. While Ripple battles regulators, Remittix builds quietly. Its instant fiat conversions outshine traditional systems. The XRP price may soar but it cannot match Remittix’s 20x growth potential. Investors see it as the next big leap, blending stability with sky-high potential. By solving global payment woes, Remittix is proving to be a utility powerhouse primed to outshine top competitors in 2025 and beyond. Join in now and don’t get left out!

This pattern could significantly slow down the next rebound phase at key price levels, raising concerns among investors about XRP’s near-term trajectory. Ripple (XRP) finds support at $2.20 as seller fatigue sets in XRP price action has leaned overwhelmingly bearish since the start of February, despite several bullish developments, including the SEC dropping charges against Ripple. This marked the end of the regulatory onslaught filed against the company under the outgoing Gary Gensler-led regime. Additionally, XRP had gained momentum when the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s spot XRP ETF filing , fueling optimism for broader institutional adoption. However, the market turned sharply negative following a hotter-than-expected inflation CPI report on Feb. 13, the $1.4 billion exploit on Bybit, and former President Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on North American neighbors Canada and Mexico. These macroeconomic factors compounded the bearish momentum, dragging XRP price to a three-week low of $2.15 on Feb. 26. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | Source: TradingView Despite these challenges, bulls made a strong push to reclaim the $2.20 level at press time. Zooming out XRP has now reached 20% losses since the start of February 2025. However, the sell-off appears to have subsided, with declining volume on on Thursday suggesting that short-term sellers may be running out of steam. If demand continues to strengthen, Ripple price could consolidate above this level before making another attempt at higher resistance zones. Rebound prospects at risk as sellers execute 2 million transactions in high-volume sell-offs XRP staged a mild 2% gain in the early hours of Feb. 27, briefly reclaiming the $2.20 level. However, market sentiment remains fragile as the U.S. tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports are set to take effect on March 1, casting doubt on the prospects of a sustained recovery. On-chain data further highlights that high-volume sell-off clusters formed earlier this week could hinder weak rebound attempts. CryptoQuant ’s Daily Transactions chart, which tracks the number of unique transactions executed on the XRP Ledger since the start of February, reflects a surge in trading activity tied to key market events. XRP Price vs. Daily Transactions The chart shows that XRP traders executed 2 million transactions on Feb. 25, coinciding with the market’s reaction to Trump’s latest tariff announcement. This represents a three-week high in transaction volume, with the last comparable spike occurring on Feb. 3, when Deepseek’s breakout triggered a U.S. tech stock sell-off that spilled into the crypto markets. Historically, when sharp price downswings align with high transaction volume, it indicates that a significant number of traders executed sell orders. As a result, when XRP approaches these key price levels during the next rebound phase, those who previously bought in at those levels may opt to exit at break-even points, creating additional resistance. For context, XRP opened at $2.70 on Feb. 3 before declining sharply and later opened at $2.32 on Feb. 25. Given the volume spikes observed at these points, XRP price is unlikely to break above these levels without a major bullish catalyst that triggers a rapid buying frenzy. Without such a catalyst, XRP’s next attempt to breach resistance could falter, keeping the price trapped in a tight consolidation range. XRP price forecast: $2.32 resistance could cap recovery efforts XRP price struggles to gain upside momentum after a steep five-day decline that erased nearly 25% of its value, sinking to $2.16. The Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility, with the price currently testing the lower band, a sign of oversold conditions. While this could attract dip buyers, the lack of strong volume inflows suggests bulls face resistance in staging a sustainable recovery. XRP price forecast The 50-day moving average at $2.51 remains well above current levels, reinforcing the bearish control. XRP must reclaim this level to restore bullish confidence. Meanwhile, the Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator at -0.50 highlights persistent bearish pressure, a key signal that sellers remain dominant. Until this turns positive, upside attempts are likely to fizzle out. A decisive close below $2.16 could open the door for a deeper correction, with the next major support near $2.00. Conversely, reclaiming $2.32—where the last rebound attempt failed—could signal early recovery signs. However, given the lack of bullish momentum and heavy sell-side volume, the path of least resistance remains downward unless a strong catalyst emerges.

Solana and Tron are two of the most widely held crypto assets, yet recent price movements have left many holders reeling from losses. In response, some investors have already started selling, fearing further declines. Market analysts warn that the worst may not be over. According to industry experts, Tron and Solanacould face an additional 40% crash within the next 48 hours, leading many investors to seek a safer alternative. The latest buzz in the market is Panshibi , a new meme coin with the potential to mint investors at least 100x in profits. Panshibi has started gaining traction, making it an attractive hedge against the looming Solana and Tron downturn. Let’s uncover the details surrounding Tron price prediction, Solana’s current outlook and why Panshibi might be the must-have in this season. Tron Price Prediction Despite new developments in the Tron ecosystem, the price action of TRX remains weak. Tron founder Justin Sun recently announced that Tether’s USDT stablecoin will soon feature commission-free transactions on the Tron blockchain. Sun’s post on X (formerly Twitter) on February 25 shows that Tron’s Gas Free feature will allow users to make USDT transactions without needing TRX for gas fees. While this should be a positive development for Tron’s long-term growth, its price action tells a different story. Tron has been on a downward trajectory, buying and selling at a current price of $0.229 . The intense selling pressure over the past two weeks has put TRX in a precarious position, with bears tightening their grip on the market. Tron's recent run shows a dearth of buying momentum, which has exposed the token to the possibility of another 40% dump this week. Unless the sellers' grip loosens, Tron might fall through critical support zones deeper into bearish territory. Solana's Decline Continues Solana started this year with bullish momentum, reaching a yearly high last month. However, February has been brutal for Solana holders, with prices tumbling by 19.5% in just one week. The price of Solana seems to be in a steep decline for almost two weeks, erasing most of the profits from its January surge. Ongoing sell-offs have caused the SOL price to plunge to $141.64 , reflecting a 15.18% drop over the week. Buyers are desperately trying to reclaim the $150 resistance level, but given the immense selling pressure, this recovery attempt seems unlikely to succeed. Analysts warn that if Solana fails to close the month above this critical price point, the bearish momentum could escalate, leading to another 40% dump. The Solana network also experienced decreasing activity, further eroding investor confidence. With technicals in red alert, most Solana holders are second-guessing their holding positions, believing that the losing trend may continue. Panshibi: The Must-Have in this Season Panshibi is proving the latest meme sensation in the market today, housing the flocking herd of investors and market participants in its safe and secure Bamboo Valley. This new meme coin is inspired by Asian culture and has a Panda mascot and a unique ecosystem designed to reward early adopters. This project is ultimately one investors cannot ignore; look at the numbers given the strong market headwinds. In a few weeks alone, Panshibi's 60-day presale has managed to surpass $1.1M, showing that the project is gaining serious traction amid a market downturn. That’s really impressive. When you buy SHIBI tokens and join the project, you unlock early access to various benefits within the Panshibi ecosystem. These benefits include staking rewards of up to 1200% APY and exclusive membership in the Bamboo VIP club, among others. Moreover, Investor confidence in Panshibi is further reinforced by its strong security measures. The team tokens are locked for two years, eliminating the risk of insider sell-offs. As of today, SHIBI tokens are available in presale at just $0.005 per token. Demand is expected to soar as more investors recognize Panshibi’s explosive potential, pushing prices higher once it hits the open market.

Meanwhile, Lightchain AI , which has already raised over $16.4 million at a presale price of $0.006, is capturing the attention of investors with its innovative AI and blockchain integration. While Solana’s potential remains strong, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world applications and scalability positions it for substantial growth in 2025. As both projects continue to develop, investors are eager to see if Lightchain AI can surpass expectations and deliver impressive returns in the near future. Can Solana (SOL) Reach $2000 by 2026? As of February 19, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $165.24. Analyst projections for SOL’s price by 2026 vary widely. Changelly estimates an average price around $1,524, with the potential to reach $1,887. Investing Haven suggests a peak between $1,250 and $2,000, possibly by 2027-2028. Meanwhile, Crypto News forecasts a potential high of $264.65 in 2026. These projections highlight differing opinions, with some analysts expecting SOL to hit $2,000 by 2026, while others predict more conservative growth. Given the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility and the rapid pace of technological advancements, precise predictions remain challenging. Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Lightchain AI’s Price Prediction for 2025- What Experts Are Saying Lightchain AI (LCAI) has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency market, with various analysts offering optimistic price predictions for 2025. Some forecasts suggest that LCAI could reach $5 by the end of 2025, driven by its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Another analysis predicts a more conservative estimate, with LCAI potentially reaching $3 by 2025, highlighting its unique features and real-world applications as key drivers for growth. These projections underscore the growing optimism surrounding Lightchain AI’s potential in the crypto space. However, it’s important to note that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and actual performance may vary. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider market risks before making investment decisions. Will Lightchain AI Be the Breakout Star of 2025? With its innovative approach to integrating AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI has positioned itself as a promising player in the crypto market. Its successful presale and growing adoption highlight strong investor sentiment and optimism for its future performance. While Solana (SOL) remains a top contender with its solid foundation in the blockchain ecosystem, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world applications and scalability may position it for more significant growth by 2025. As both projects evolve, investors are eagerly anticipating if Lightchain AI will be the breakout star of 2025. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-27 03:00:00

Though its price has dropped more than 36% over the previous month, investors still have hope. Could Dogecoin still have a big comeback? Some analysts agree, noting on the Dogecoin price chart positive trends. But is this only another hype cycle or will it truly reach $1? Remittix (RTX) another cryptocurrency is drawing interest in the market concurrently. This $0.0671 token is generating buzz in 2025 with its inexpensive, fast payments and spectacular presale. Given its deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, several analysts believe RTX may be among the best altcoins to buy right now. Before Dogecoin recovers its $0.737 ATH, could this under-the-radar altcoin hit $1? Read on to find out. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Wild Ride: A Rollercoaster of Price Swings The Dogecoin price has lately shown interesting swings. Though the change was not consistent, it dropped more than 19% over the past week. Before the bearish breakout, the Dogecoin price chart first showed consolidation between $0.265 and $0.248. A rapid decline then sent the memecoin below $0.199. Buyers intervened, though, dragging the price back above $0.213. However, shortly afterwards, bearish pressure sent the Dogecoin pricedown once more to $0.205. The past month was bearish as well; Dogecoin dropped more than 36% of its value. Notwithstanding this, the community is still hopeful and many holders still see Dogecoin’s long-term promise. Certain experts believe Dogecoin may move significantly not too far off. On the Dogecoin price chart, CryptoELITES noted a bullish breakout from a ""cup and handle"" pattern. This tendency usually points to a price rally. One of the top altcoins to hold, CryptoELITES estimates Dogecoin might surge to $5 soon . Technical indicators send conflicting messages. While the ADX, MACD, and MAs point to more selling pressure on the weekly timeframe, the Momentum Oscillator advises buying Dogecoin. Remittix (RTX) Offers Fast and Low-Cost Payments Remittix is transforming worldwide methods of money transfer. Moreover, Remittix addresses the slow and expensive problem that conventional banking systems usually bring. Following the fast conversion of over forty cryptocurrencies into fiat money, users can send crypto straight to bank accounts. This qualifies Remittix as a major participant in the remittance sector. Still, Remittix is among the best crypto investment prospects available right now. Remittix Wallet users have complete control over their digital resources. Those who use this non-custodial wallet can quickly trade, swap, and store their coins. As the platform maintains developing ties with big CEXs and DEXs and worldwide blockchain acceptance grows, RTX is among the best cryptos to invest in right now. Having already sold over 505 million tokens in a few months, the Remittix presale has raised over $12.9 million. Meanwhile, RTX is priced at just $0.0671 in the ongoing presale. This provides a fantastic starting point. Strong characteristics of RTX include deflationary tokenomics, which causes its supply to drop with time, increasing value. Trading is simple as neither buying or selling RTX is taxed. Investors could also get staking benefits ranging from 4% to 8% annually. RTX is becoming among the best cryptos to buy for long-term profits given its fast growth and great demand. Dogecoin vs. Remittix: The Next Big Crypto Winner? Though some analysts forecast a breakout, Dogecoin has seen notable fluctuations; its road to $1 is yet uncertain. Meanwhile, Remittix is creating waves with its rapid payments, explosive presale, and deflationary tokenomics. RTX is proving more than just hype with over 504 million tokens sold and over $12.9 million raised in a few months. RTX provides a fantastic entry point at just $0.0671 before its price skyrockets. Don't wait until RTX reaches $1, the presale is fast selling out and the total RTX token supply is only limited.

From the rise of Trump-related tokens like $TRUMP and $MELANIA to meme coins fueled by internet culture, the market is buzzing with opportunities. As speculation and hype drive the space, some meme coins stand out with unique narratives and massive return potential. Among the latest contenders, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Official Melania Meme ($MELANIA), and ANDY ($ANDY) are capturing attention for their innovation, community engagement, and potential for explosive gains. Let’s dive into what makes each of these meme coins a must-watch for those hunting for exponential returns. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Legendary Expedition for Unparalleled Gains Deep in the heart of the Arctic, where myths intertwine with reality, a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo embarks on a journey unlike any other. His mission? To uncover the Earth’s most hidden mysteries, with $APC coins representing his findings. But this isn’t just a story—it’s an investment opportunity with the potential for 11,844.78% returns from the current location to the launch price. Unlike traditional meme coins with fixed stages, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) progresses through different locations, each unveiling a new chapter in the explorer’s quest. Right now, Pablo has reached Penguinopolis, the 12th location, where investors can buy $APC for just $0.000067 per coin. With over $1.61 million already raised, demand is skyrocketing. When $APC lists at $0.008, early investors who bought in at the current price could see insane returns. A $500 investment today gets 7,462,685 APC, which could balloon to $59,701.48 upon launch. Arctic Pablo Coin burns unsold tokens weekly, reducing supply and boosting value. The project also offers a massive 66% APY staking program, allowing holders to earn big just by holding. Staked tokens are locked for two months post-launch, ensuring sustainability and long-term investor gains. With 221.2 billion APC in total supply, Arctic Pablo Coin has a well-structured distribution model. Fifty percent is allocated to the public presale, liquidity accounts for twenty-five percent, staking rewards are set at fifteen percent, ecosystem growth takes up twenty percent, community rewards hold ten percent, and five percent is reserved for the team with a one-year lock-in. With the presale nearing its final days, investors have a limited window to grab $APC at its lowest price. Once Penguinopolis sells out, the next location will have a higher price. It stands among top new meme coins for exponential returns . Official Melania Meme: The First Lady of Meme Coins $MELANIA is one of the latest political meme coins, launched in tribute to Melania Trump. Following in the footsteps of $TRUMP, which saw massive growth, this token aims to capitalize on political and cultural interest. With Melania Trump’s name attached, $MELANIA quickly gained traction in the crypto space. The token has a passionate holder base, with X (Twitter) engagement skyrocketing. Meme coins thrive on speculation, and $MELANIA has already shown wild price swings, perfect for traders looking to capitalize. However, concerns about centralized token ownership and potential rug pulls make it essential to conduct thorough research before investing. Some investors see $MELANIA as a long-term play, while others view it as a short-term speculative opportunity. ANDY: The Meme Coin Paying Tribute to a Digital Icon Another hot meme coin making waves is ANDY ($ANDY), a tribute to a viral internet persona. Like PEPE and Wojak coins, ANDY is all about embracing meme culture, and rewarding holders who join the movement. ANDY memes are going viral, fueling organic adoption. The coin has gained traction quickly, with early investors already seeing big profits. ANDY also plans to launch exclusive NFT collections, adding another utility layer. For meme coin traders and collectors, ANDY offers a fresh take on the ever-growing sector. Conclusion: The Next Big Meme Coin Could Be One Click Away Based on research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Official Melania Meme ($MELANIA), and ANDY ($ANDY) all present unique opportunities for exponential returns. While $MELANIA rides the wave of political hype and ANDY taps into meme culture, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its adventure-driven narrative and lucrative tokenomics. With Penguinopolis nearing its final days, now is the last chance to get in at $0.000067 before the price increases. Don’t wait—join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale today and be part of the journey!

Many beginners hesitate, wondering if they’ve already missed out on the biggest gains or if the market is too complex to navigate. However, the truth is that the next wave of high-growth opportunities is already forming, and savvy investors are positioning themselves early. For those just starting, picking the right cryptos is crucial. The best beginner-friendly coins combine strong fundamentals, real-world use cases, and high-growth potential. With the right picks, even a small investment could lead to life-changing returns. As the market continues its upward trajectory, here are five promising cryptocurrencies that could skyrocket soon. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is quickly emerging as one of the most talked-about crypto projects of 2025, thanks to its revolutionary approach to online shopping. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that rely on centralized systems, Web3Bay is building a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact directly without middlemen, excessive fees, or data privacy concerns. With major online platforms facing backlash over rising costs and strict policies, the demand for blockchain-powered alternatives is growing rapidly. Web3Bay taps into this demand by offering a secure, transparent, and user-driven marketplace powered by cryptocurrency transactions. The Web3Bay presale has already surpassed $1.5 million, proving strong investor interest. The current price of 3BAY is still $0.00456, making it a high-upside opportunity for those who get in early. Analysts predict that as Web3Bay gains mainstream adoption, its price could surge, providing early buyers with significant returns. Unlike speculative meme coins, Web3Bay has a real-world use case that addresses a trillion-dollar industry. This makes it one of the best beginner-friendly cryptos to watch, as it offers both high-growth potential and a practical application. 2. Solana (SOL) – The Fastest Blockchain for Smart Contracts Solana has positioned itself as one of the leading blockchain networks for high-speed transactions and decentralized applications. Its key advantage over competitors like Ethereum is its extremely low fees and fast processing times, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike. The growing adoption of DeFi projects, NFTs, and gaming applications on Solana’s network has fueled demand, and many analysts believe its price will continue to climb. While Solana is no longer in the under-$1 category, its growth potential remains strong, especially for beginners looking for an established yet high-upside crypto. The network continues to expand, with major partnerships and increasing institutional interest. As the next bull run gains momentum, Solana could once again prove to be a top performer. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – The Meme Coin with Long-Term Potential While meme coins often carry a high level of speculation, Shiba Inu has managed to evolve beyond its meme status. Originally created as a Dogecoin competitor, SHIB has since built a growing ecosystem, including its own decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), NFT marketplace, and upcoming blockchain developments. The Shiba Inu community remains one of the largest and most active in crypto, which has helped sustain its price growth. With the potential launch of a Shiba Inu-based Layer-2 network, SHIB could see renewed investor interest and increased adoption. For beginners, Shiba Inu offers a low-cost entry point and strong community-driven momentum, making it a fun yet potentially rewarding investment option. 4. Polygon (MATIC) – Scaling Ethereum for Mass Adoption Ethereum’s high transaction fees and slow processing times have been a major hurdle for mass adoption. That’s where Polygon (MATIC) comes in, offering a Layer-2 scaling solution that improves Ethereum’s efficiency and reduces costs. Polygon has secured major partnerships with corporations, DeFi platforms, and gaming projects, making it one of the most widely used scaling networks in the space. As Ethereum continues to grow, Polygon will remain a crucial part of its ecosystem, which means its demand is likely to keep rising. For beginner investors, Polygon offers a balance between stability and growth potential, making it a great choice for those who want exposure to Ethereum’s future without the high price tag. 5. XRP – A Crypto with Institutional Backing XRP has long been known as one of the most institutionally supported cryptocurrencies, with its primary use case being cross-border payments. Despite regulatory challenges in the past, XRP continues to see strong adoption from financial institutions looking for efficient and low-cost remittance solutions. The potential approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the near future could bring billions of dollars in institutional investment, which may push prices significantly higher. XRP’s strong network effect and real-world use case make it a great long-term hold for beginners who want exposure to the crypto payments industry. Final Thoughts – Start Your Crypto Journey the Right Way The crypto market offers endless opportunities, but for beginners, selecting the right coins is crucial. Web3Bay stands out as the most exciting opportunity for early-stage growth, with its decentralized e-commerce vision attracting increasing investor attention. Solana and Polygon offer strong blockchain infrastructure plays, while Shiba Inu and XRP present alternative options for those looking to capitalize on market trends and mainstream adoption. As crypto continues to disrupt traditional industries and gain global recognition, now is the perfect time for new investors to start building their portfolios before the next market surge. The key is to identify projects with strong use cases and long-term viability, and the five cryptos listed above provide some of the best starting points for a successful crypto journey.

While established cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the market, emerging high-growth altcoins offer the greatest potential for exponential gains. From the numerous projects vying for the position, one crypto, RCO Finance (RCOF) , stands out as a strong contender. This altcoin has integrated AI, offering cutting-edge investment tools and real-world asset integration. Analysts predict it could surge from $0.1 to $1 in just 3 weeks, making it one of the most promising crypto investments of the year. The Top Crypto to Buy: Why RCOF Is a Better Bet Than Other Altcoins in 2025 Crypto markets are entering a bullish phase, creating the perfect conditions for undervalued tokens to explode in value. For growth-oriented investors looking for the next big opportunity, here’s why RCOF is emerging as a top contender for the top crypto to buy in 2025. Despite still being in its presale phase, this altcoin has attracted immense crypto whale and institutional investor interest. They are accumulating this token at an increasing rate, recognizing its disruptive potential. Its low price, $0.1, has attracted a surge of interest from early adopters looking for the next top crypto to buy. This low price is an ideal entry point that allows investors to accumulate more tokens for a lot less, setting them up for massive gains as the crypto surges to $1. Unlike purely speculative altcoins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu , which rely on hype to drive growth, RCOF offers real-world utility. The project leverages AI-driven trading tools to enhance market analysis, automated investment strategies, and portfolio optimization, making it the top crypto to buy. Key Features Driving RCO Finance (RCOF) Rapid Rise from $0.10 to $1 What makes RCO Finance the top crypto to buy in 2025? Its unique blend of AI-driven automation, real-world asset integration, and decentralized financial solutions separates it from the competition. RCOF has integrated AI, helping simplify the complexities of crypto trading and navigating financial markets. This integration allows the altcoin to provide advanced trading tools that provide users with a holistic view of the market and generate data-driven insights that inform personalized strategies, mitigate risks, and maximize potential returns through intelligent automation. The star of this AI toolkit is the robo-advisor , a tool that personalizes its support, allowing even users with no prior experience to build profitable portfolios by simplifying complex investment decisions. If you want quick gains and are open to taking on more risk, it can list high-reward but higher-risk assets that can help you achieve your goals faster. If you are more conservative, it can list mid-to low-risk assets you can invest in for steady long-term gains. What’s great about the robo-advisor is you can create a hybrid strategy and get the best of both worlds. This tool offers actionable insights based on real-time market data. These insights help eliminate guesswork and emotional biases, ensuring you make smarter investment choices. It can identify emerging trends and patterns, such as pinpointing undervalued assets or potential breakout opportunities. Imagine getting alerts about Raydium (RAY) at $1.6 in October, creating a good buying opportunity before it climbed to $8.65, a 440% jump. With advanced tools like the robo-advisor, you can capitalize on such opportunities. RCOF offers users something more than crypto trading. It has integrated real-world assets like bonds, shares, real estate commodities and more to increase investment options on its platform. This inclusion makes diversification a lot easier, democratizes access to high-value assets and allows for fractional ownership. To guarantee a secure, safe and reliable investing environment, SolidProof has rigorously audited RCOF’s smart contracts and codebase. This certification showcases RCOF’s adherence to high industry standards and reassures investors of the platform’s integrity. Many platforms require users to fulfill lengthy KYC (Know Your Customer) verification; however, RCOF employs a non-KYC policy, meaning users can participate without going through these hurdles. This model helps break down geographical barriers and enables users from anywhere in the world to participate. It also maintains user privacy, attracting investors who value online anonymity. The recently released beta platform is giving you the chance to access RCOF core features such as the robo-advisor. Over 10k users have already joined, transforming their investment experience with superior insights, diverse asset access and personalized support. Since this is just a beta version, you can expect more enhancements as the official launch approaches. If you want to experience the RCOF difference for yourself, join the beta platform here .

This massive sell-off has raised concerns among investors, prompting analysts to explore the underlying causes of this dramatic decline. Bitcoin And Ethereum Plummet According to insights from the Kobelsi Letter, a global commentator on capital markets, the frequency of “flash crashes” in the crypto sector has surged since January. These rapid price declines can occur without major bearish news, leaving investors puzzled about the sudden volatility. The recent downturn began with Bitcoin (BTC), which initially fell below $95,000. However, a sharp drop from $95,000 to $90,000 within just 30 minutes early in the morning served as a wake-up call for traders. Ethereum (ETH) has fared even worse, experiencing a staggering 37% drop over 60 hours on February 2nd, despite trade war headlines that had already been priced into the market. Related Reading: Why Ethereum Is A Must-Watch: Expert Analysis Highlights 4 Strong Bullish Indicators One of the critical factors contributing to this crypto volatility, according to the analysts, is the drastic shift in liquidity and short positioning in Ethereum. In a single week, short positions surged by 40%, and since November 2024, they have skyrocketed by 500%. This unprecedented level of shorting by Wall Street hedge funds has created a precarious situation for Ethereum, which is now valued at approximately $300 billion. As institutional investors increasingly short Ethereum, many have turned their attention to Bitcoin, creating a stark contrast in market dynamics. While retail interest in Bitcoin has waned, driven partly by a surge in memecoins, institutional capital continues to flow into Bitcoin, exacerbating the volatility in altcoins like Solana. Retail Vs Institutional Investors Amid Crypto Volatility Kobelsi further highlights that the current market environment is characterized by a polarization between retail and institutional investors. As liquidity decreases, price movements become increasingly erratic. This has resulted in significant “air pockets,” where sentiment can shift dramatically, leading to rapid price changes. Recent sentiment analysis reveals that the crypto market is experiencing its lowest levels of enthusiasm for 2024. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which previously indicated a state of greed, has now dropped to a fear level of 29%. Such shifts in sentiment often precede flash crashes, as traders react to the changing landscape. Related Reading: XRP Price Continuation After Crash Below $2.4? New Targets Emerge Adding to the complexity of the situation, public figures like Eric Trump have been vocal about their views on the largest crypto assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump has suggested that these price dips present buying opportunities, a perspective that may influence retail investors’ behavior. Furthermore, companies like MicroStrategy have also impacted the crypto market dynamics. Despite a 45% drop in its stock since its November 20th peak, MicroStrategy continues to accumulate Bitcoin through convertible note offerings, reinforcing its commitment to the crypto and potentially influencing market sentiment. So far, Ethereum has managed to regain the $2,500 level after falling below $2,300 on Tuesday, recording losses of 7% in the 24-hour time frame.

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face hurdles near $2,400 and $2,450. Ethereum is facing an increase in selling below the $2,450 zone. The price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,390 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,400 and $2,500. Ethereum Price Extends Losses Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,550 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace below the $2,500 and $2,450 support levels to move further in a bearish zone. The price declined over 5% and even traded below the $2,320 support zone. A low was formed at $2,251 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,519 swing high to the $2,251 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,390 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,380 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,519 swing high to the $2,251 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,420 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,450. A clear move above the $2,450 resistance might send the price toward the $2,500 resistance. An upside break above the $2,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,550 resistance zone or even $2,620 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,315 level. The first major support sits near the $2,250 zone. A clear move below the $2,250 support might push the price toward the $2,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,050.

Speaking at his first cabinet meeting on Feb. 26, U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his intention to put a 25% tariff on European Union goods, as reported by The Guardian. The cryptocurrency industry has been significantly impacted by this announcement. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is currently down 4% in the last 24 hours, trading at $84,600 levels at press time. The broader crypto market has also suffered, with total market cap shrinking 4% following President Trump’s remarks, according to CoinGecko. CoinGlass data also shows that total liquidations have surpassed $765 million in the past 24 hours, adding to the $1.5 billion wiped out on Feb. 25. According to SoSoValue data , the market decline has coincided with the biggest one-day withdrawal from Bitcoin ETFs since their inception, with $937.78 million leaving on Feb. 25. This further solidifies the change in institutional investors’ sentiment, bringing the total outflows for the last week to almost $1.5 billion.

After Trump’s election victory and hopes of a more favorable regulatory environment, there was a period of optimistic momentum, followed by the current sell-offs. Hopes for rapid implementation of pro-crypto policies have declined as the administration seems to be prioritizing aggressive trade policies. Security concerns have also shaken investor sentiment. The market’s liquidity has been depleted by the collapse of the Solana memecoin boom, and concerns over centralized exchange vulnerabilities have been ignited by the unresolved $1.4 billion Bybit hack . Although some analysts see the correction as a healthy reset, others caution that a decline below $80,000 would lead to yet another round of liquidations, which might send Bitcoin toward $70,000. Traders continue to exercise caution as macroeconomic uncertainty rises, anticipating possible regulatory changes that would re-establish trust in the digital asset market.

According to a notice shared by Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, the SEC informed their legal team on Monday that the investigation has concluded and, based on the information available, the agency will not recommend any enforcement action at this time. This decision comes 699 days after the initiation of the investigation and 277 days after the SEC had issued a Wells Notice, signaling the potential for an enforcement action. While this decision provides relief for Gemini, it is important to note that the SEC’s notice does not exonerate the company. The agency clarified that its conclusion is not final, and the possibility remains that further action could be taken in the future. The investigation had centered around Gemini’s “Earn” program, which the SEC had alleged involved the offering of unregistered securities through a partnership with crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital. A Long Battle with the SEC In his statement, Cameron Winklevoss took to social media to reflect on the lengthy battle with the SEC and its impact on Gemini and the broader crypto ecosystem. He opened u[ about the immense legal costs incurred, amounting to tens of millions of dollars, as well as the broader economic losses resulting from the uncertainty caused by the SEC’s regulatory approach. He lamented that while the SEC’s actions may have been framed as a protective measure, the agency’s conduct had significant negative consequences on American innovation, causing crypto talent to seek opportunities in other sectors. However, he wrote, “So where do we go from here? It’s wholly unacceptable for an agency like the SEC to bully, harass, and attack a lawful industry and then decide one day to simply say we’re good and walk away. Unless there is a cost and price to be paid for this behavior, it will happen again.” A Changing Regulatory Landscape This development follows the SEC’s recent withdrawal of lawsuits against other major players in the crypto industry, including Coinbase, and the closure of investigations into OpenSea, Robinhood, and Uniswap. This move raises the possibility that the SEC may take similar actions with other high-profile cases, including the ongoing legal battle involving Ripple Labs.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-27 03:46:42

Bitcoin also dropped below $84,000, adding to the pressure on cryptocurrencies. Several factors, including market trends and economic developments, have contributed to Dogecoin’s price movement. Dogecoin Price Plummets, Is A Recovery Near? Dogecoin’s price has fallen to around $0.20, with analysts suggesting that it is following a familiar cycle seen in previous years. Historically, Dogecoin has gone through corrections before rebounding. Crypto analyst Bithereum noted that Dogecoin price was moving within a falling wedge pattern, which indicated that a drop to $0.20197 was likely. This level has been tested, aligning with historical trends where Dogecoin price experiences pullbacks before rallying. Despite the drop, analysts believe Dogecoin could reverse to the upside, potentially reaching $0.45 soon. DOGE/USD price chart (Source: TradingView) Another factor contributing to the DOGE price decline is the decrease in network activity. According to market data, new address creation on the Dogecoin network has significantly dropped from 1.29 million in November to just 30,815. A decline in new addresses suggests lower investor participation, which can weaken buying pressure and lead to price declines. Donald Trump 25% European Union Impact on DOGE Price Dogecoin price recent drop also comes amid broader economic concerns. A major factor influencing the market is U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on the European Union. “We have made a decision, and we’ll be announcing it very soon. It’ll be 25 per cent,” Trump said during a cabinet meeting, as reported by the Financial Times. His comments raised concerns about potential trade tensions between the U.S. and the EU, which affected global markets, including cryptocurrencies. Following the announcement, Bitcoin price fell below $84,000 , dragging the broader crypto market down. Dogecoin saw a decline of over 6%, as traders reacted to economic uncertainty. Some analysts believe that fear surrounding economic policies led to increased selling pressure across digital assets. Concurrently, continued DOGE selling pressure , particularly from large investors, could lead Dogecoin to retest lower levels before stabilizing. Dogecoin Price May Be Ready for a Rebound, Top Analyst Despite the price drop, technical indicators suggest that Dogecoin price may be approaching a reversal. According to crypto analyst Ali (@ali_charts), the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the daily chart. This indicator is often used to identify potential trend reversals, suggesting that Dogecoin could soon experience upward momentum. Trader Tardigrade, another analyst, pointed out that DOGE price has been following a similar pattern to its 2017-2018 bull run. If the trend continues, Dogecoin could see a strong rally, potentially moving toward the $1.70 level. Additionally, Master Kenobi noted that Dogecoin is holding above a critical trend line that has historically acted as support. He also mentioned that Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at its lowest level since March 2023, which could indicate that the selling pressure is easing and a recovery may follow. Consequently, crypto analysts have identified key price levels that could determine Dogecoin price next move. If Dogecoin price maintains its support around $0.20, a potential rebound could push it toward targets of $0.30998, $0.37154, and $0.45918 in the coming weeks.

It’s now aiming for the $3 mark after hitting a high of $2.98. The price has already climbed 176% from $0.63, and many believe a new all-time high (ATH) could be coming soon. Binance Listing Could Be Next This price surge has caught the attention of many in the crypto world, and analysts believe Pi Coin could soon be listed on Binance. With Pi’s 24-hour trading volume now ranking 5th among major cryptocurrencies, it’s clear that interest in Pi is growing fast. Crypto analyst Kim Wong thinks Pi’s price could hit $3.8 next, and that a new ATH might be just around the corner. What Makes Pi Coin Stand Out? According to Wong, Pi Network is seen as one of the most innovative projects, with the potential to become the world’s digital currency, beating out many other cryptocurrencies. Pi Network has over 100 million app downloads, with 65 million active users and 19 million verified members. Pi Coin is already listed on five popular centralized exchanges (CEXs) and is trading at an all-time high. The coin’s market cap has placed it among the top 10 cryptos (excluding stablecoins), and it’s been trending since its recent listing on February 20, 2025. This success is putting pressure on exchanges like Binance and Coinbase to add Pi Coin. Wong stressed that unlike many other cryptos, Pi Coin is not just another meme coin. While its popularity is growing quickly, it’s backed by real use cases and a strong network. The meme market could help push Pi’s price even higher, especially if more major exchanges list the coin.

Buy Or Sell Dogecoin Now? According to the chart, Dogecoin is currently trading in the $0.21–$0.22 range, hovering just above the wedge’s lower boundary. This trendline extends from the coin’s mid‐December levels—when Dogecoin first began its downward trajectory—through its successive lower lows, culminating near the apex in early March. Meanwhile, the upper boundary of the wedge connects a series of descending peaks from the coin’s local highs, including one in mid-January, sloping downward into the same apex region. A ‘falling wedge’ is typically viewed by technical traders as a potential bullish reversal pattern, particularly when accompanied by decreasing volume during the consolidation phase. The idea is that as sellers become exhausted, buyers may begin stepping in near the wedge’s support line, driving price momentum upward once the resistance line is broken. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Falls Below This Level, A Freefall To $0.06 Is Possible: Analyst In the chart Satoshi Flipper shared, a dashed arrow projects a possible bullish move if Dogecoin can decisively break above the wedge’s top boundary. While no guarantees exist in crypto markets, this hypothetical trajectory arcs from current price levels around $0.21 to as high as the $0.50 region by late-April. The chart also shows a notable horizontal support zone below the market, hovering around $0.10–$0.15, which dates back to Dogecoin’s earlier base before its large run‐up. Meanwhile, sentiment among other crypto analysts on X appears divided. Carlos Garcia Tapia (@CAGThe3rd) cautions that he sees “h patterns everywhere” and suggests a potential retracement before the next leg down: “Sad to say, this is all cooked, bois. DOGE 14 cents :(“ In response to another user who was unfamiliar with the “h pattern,” Tapia reiterated his view of a likely downward move. “Pretty much a retracement before the next leg down,” he stated. “This contrasts with the more optimistic stance from Suzzy | DeFi (@SuzzyDefi), who highlighted a strong wick off the $0.19–$0.20 support zone: Related Reading: Dogecoin Warning: One Level Could Trigger A Surge, Says Analyst “Took a glance at DOGE, and I just spotted a strong wick off the $0.19 – $0.20 support, giving me serious bullish vibes!

The price is now consolidating losses and remains at risk of more losses. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.350 level. The price is now trading below $2.320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.250 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down unless there is a close above the $2.3350 resistance zone. XRP Price Fails To Recover XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.50 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.35 and $2.250 support levels. The price even dipped below the $2.20 support to enter a bearish zone. A low was formed at $2.0639 and the price attempted a recovery wave. There was a spike above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.604 swing high to the $2.206 low. However, the bears remained active at $2.350. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.250 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.250 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.3250 level. The next resistance is $2.40 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.604 swing high to the $2.206 low. A clear move above the $2.40 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance or even $2.5650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.620. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.250 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

Toncoin (TON) has made waves by powering Telegram’s digital economy, reinforcing its strength as an integrated asset. Meanwhile, Arbitrum (ARB) is leading the charge in Ethereum’s scalability, solving network congestion issues and reducing gas fees. But the real standout? Qubetics ($TICS), an advanced blockchain project that is transforming privacy, security, and decentralized connectivity. With over 490 million tokens sold and $14.1 million raised in its presale, Qubetics is setting a new benchmark for blockchain innovation. Qubetics ($TICS): Decentralized VPN for Ultimate Privacy In today’s digital world, privacy is everything. Traditional VPN services often require users to trust centralized entities with their data, creating security risks. Qubetics is solving this problem with its decentralized VPN (dVPN), ensuring users retain complete control over their online activity. Imagine a journalist in a country with strict censorship laws. A traditional VPN might be monitored or blocked, leaving them exposed. But with Qubetics’ dVPN, they can securely access the internet without fear of surveillance or data leaks. For businesses handling sensitive data, professionals working remotely, or individuals seeking true privacy, Qubetics’ dVPN offers a groundbreaking solution. The crypto presale is currently in its 23rd stage, with 490 million tokens sold to over 21,400 holders, raising more than $14.1 million. Early buyers can purchase $TICS tokens at $0.0888 each before prices increase in later stages. Analysts Predict a Massive ROI for Early Buyers $TICS at $0.25 at presale end would mean an 181% ROI. At $1 after the presale, that jumps to a 1026% ROI. As the ecosystem expands, $TICS at $10 post-presale could deliver an 11,160% ROI. If adoption reaches projected levels, $TICS could hit $15 after its mainnet launch, reflecting a staggering 16,791% ROI. With a focus on security, privacy, and decentralized solutions, Qubetics is leading the next generation of blockchain innovation. Toncoin (TON): Fueling Telegram’s Digital Economy If you’ve ever used Telegram, chances are you’ve come across Toncoin. Unlike many cryptos that struggle with real-world adoption, TON is seamlessly integrated into Telegram, one of the world’s largest messaging platforms with over 800 million active users. Telegram’s financial strength is largely backed by Toncoin, with its digital assets reaching $1.3 billion in the first half of 2024. This means TON isn’t just another speculative asset—it’s a crucial component of Telegram’s digital infrastructure. Sending Toncoin is as easy as sending a text message, making it a game-changer for peer-to-peer payments, in-app purchases, and dApps. Whether it’s businesses accepting payments, users tipping content creators, or developers building decentralized applications, TON is setting new standards for crypto usability. Arbitrum (ARB): Scaling Ethereum for Mass Adoption Ethereum has long been plagued by high gas fees and network congestion. Arbitrum solves this problem by using optimistic rollups, bundling multiple transactions together and settling them on Ethereum’s mainnet. This significantly reduces costs and speeds up transaction times. For DeFi enthusiasts, Arbitrum is a must-have, allowing projects to run more efficiently while minimizing gas fees. As more developers migrate to Arbitrum for its cost savings and scalability, the network is becoming a dominant force in the Ethereum ecosystem. Many Ethereum-based DeFi projects are already integrating Arbitrum, making it one of the most critical scalability solutions today. ARB is a top contender among crypto assets with its continued adoption and the expansion of Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem. Final Thoughts Finding the top crypto coins to buy now requires looking at real-world applications, adoption, and utility. Qubetics ($TICS) is leading the way with its decentralized VPN, ensuring privacy and security for users worldwide. Meanwhile, Toncoin (TON) is fueling the financial backbone of Telegram, offering seamless digital transactions for millions. Lastly, Arbitrum (ARB) is reshaping Ethereum’s future, making it more accessible and cost-effective. For those looking to enter the market at the right time, these three cryptos offer some of the most compelling opportunities today.

However, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss has strongly criticized the agency, accusing it of causing financial and operational harm to the crypto industry. US SEC Ends Gemini Investigation Without Charges On Monday, the US SEC informed Gemini’s legal team that it had closed its probe into the cryptocurrency exchange. The investigation lasted 699 days, and the agency had previously issued a Wells Notice to Gemini 277 days ago. Despite the SEC’s decision to drop the case, Winklevoss expressed frustration, arguing that the prolonged scrutiny harmed the company and the broader industry. “This comes 699 days after the start of their investigation and 277 days after they sent us a Wells Notice,” Winklevoss said in a post on X. “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation.” The US SEC has not provided a public statement on the decision to end its investigation.

Simultaneously, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP prices also mimicked a downtrend, losing 3%-7%. Primarily, major-league cryptocurrencies reflect a bearish movement as U.S. President Donald Trump rattled global markets with new tariffs for the EU (European Union). Crypto Prices Today: Here’s Why BTC & Major-League Altcoins Dipped According to a recent CoinGape report, Donald Trump is set on imposing a 25% import tariff on the EU , further fueling global trade war fires. Following the new import tariffs on Canada and Mexico (set to commence next week), this macro development has further urged a cautious investor sentiment across global markets. In turn, the cryptocurrency sector today witnessed BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL lose alarming values. Even the crypto market lost 5% since yesterday, as indicated by the market cap reaching $2.79 trillion. Further, even the total market volume dipped by 19% to $153.54 billion. Liquidations in the past 24 hours totaled over $700 million, per Coinglass data , rationalizing the broader market waning action. BTC Price Touches $82K Low As of press time, BTC price pulled back nearly 4% and closed in at $85,230. Besides, the flagship coin bottomed at the $82K level in the past 24 hours. Notably, Bitcoin’s falling action mirrors $460.86 million liquidations recorded over the past day, per Coinglass data. Nevertheless, BTC’s market dominance was up 0.34% to 60.38%, signaling altcoins faced more volatility. ETH Price Loses 7% ETH price witnessed a downfall of nearly 7% in the past 24 hours, exchanging hands at $2,319. The second-largest crypto by market cap hit a low and peak of $2,255.05 and $2,503.42 in the past 24 hours. Notably, this waning action aligns with Ethereum recording over $126 million worth of liquidations over the past day. Further, ETH’s market dominance slipped by 10% today. XRP Price Pulls Back XRP price plunged over 5% in the past 24 hours and is currently sitting at $2.18. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $2.15 and $2.32 intraday. Ripple’s coin saw liquidations worth $12.51 million in the past 24 hours. Further, the coin faces pressure amid whale selling, as CoinGape reported Ripple whales offloaded 370 million coins recently. SOL Price Dips 4% SOL price lost 4% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $137. The coin’s intraday low and high were $130.69 and $144.39, respectively. Solana recorded liquidations worth $27.75 million in the past 24 hours. Meme Crypto Prices Today Dogecoin (DOGE) price fell by nearly 2.5% in the past 24 hours, closing in at $0.2045. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) continued trading near the previous day’s levels, at $0.00001436 and $0.000008373, respectively. However, TRUMP coin gained by 1.5%, reaching $13.25. Top Gainer Crypto Prices Today However, it’s worth pointing out that some coins have defied the broader market volatility: Kaito (KAITO) Price: $2.44 24-Hour Gains: +40% Story (IP) Price: $6.63 24-Hour Gains: +20% Optimism (OP) Price: $1.20 24-Hour Gains: +11% Top Loser Crypto Prices Today Bitget Token (BGB) Price: $3.94 24-Hour Loss: -10% Kaspa (KAS) Price: $0.08588 24-Hour Loss: -7% Ronin (RON) Price: $0.982 24-Hour Loss: -6% Traders and investors watchers continue to stay apprehensive over the market’s future performance, primarily due to the U.S. tariffs saga. Global markets are facing the heat as trade tensions rise amid new macro developments. In turn, even the crypto market sees heightened whale selling at the moment, further accompanied by liquidity setbacks that are presenting prices with volatility.

Especially, sectors like meme coins and AI appear to have taken a hit in 2025. Market Trends Reverse According to recent findings by Delphi Digital, the most severe declines were observed in AI-related sectors, with AI Frameworks suffering the largest drop at 84.05%, followed by Agents at 70.27%. Next up was meme coins, a sector that often sees extreme volatility and speculative trading, which recorded an average loss of 51.74%, while Gaming Infrastructure fell 51.54%, reflecting broader challenges in the blockchain gaming industry. The Modular sector, which focuses on blockchain scalability and development, also saw a considerable decline of 47.48%. The results defy earlier market expectations, as traders were largely optimistic that AI-related projects and meme coins would take the lead in the crypto space by 2025. In fact, a Binance survey conducted in December found that almost 45% of respondents predicted that these sectors would emerge as major forces in the coming year. Meme Coins Struggle to Recover While several top cryptocurrencies have erased their post-2024 US Presidential Election gains, meme coins have been hit the hardest. Their market capitalization has returned to November 2024 levels, undoing the surge seen during the winter “meme coin season.” The OG Dogecoin (DOGE), for one, rallied to nearly $0.50 after Trump’s victory but has since dropped back to $0.2. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and FLOKI (FLOKI) have all suffered similar declines, with WIF experiencing the steepest drop – falling 86% from $4.20 to $0.55. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes the crypto market is currently experiencing the decline of the meme coin boom. In a recent tweet , he pointed to several key factors contributing to this downturn, including the involvement of Melania, Libra, and the Lazarus Group in using meme coins to launder stolen Ethereum. Hougan suggests that these developments have severely damaged investor confidence in the sector, predicting that meme coins will collapse entirely within the next six months.

Analyst Weighs In",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunge-below-89000-are-we-nearing-a-bottom-analyst-weighs-in/,"Bitcoin’s downward trajectory continues, with its price slipping below $89,000, marking an 8.5% loss over the past week. This extended decline has raised concerns among investors about whether the bottom is finally in. Recent market behavior suggests that significant capitulation is taking place, which some analysts believe could indicate a turning point. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Ongoing Dip: Here’s What Analysts Are Saying Massive Bitcoin Sell-Off: Is The Bottom In? A key observation has emerged from a CryptoQuant analyst known as caueconomy, who recently highlighted what he describes as the “largest Bitcoin capitulation” event of 2025. In a post titled “The biggest Bitcoin capitulation since August 2024 – bottom is in?,” caueconomy noted that more than 79,000 BTCs were sold at a loss within a single day, amounting to roughly $1.7 billion. This sell-off, according to caueconomy, is reminiscent of the capitulation event in August 2024, when Japan’s interest rate hikes triggered widespread deleveraging across global markets. Caueconomy’s analysis points to a critical juncture for Bitcoin. He observed that the previous capitulation event in August 2024 marked a short-term bottom, as the market stabilized and eventually rallied to $100,000 by December. While he acknowledges that it’s impossible to guarantee the current price won’t drop further, the scale of this capitulation presents a potential opportunity for long-term investors. The analyst’s insights offer a mixed picture: although the market may face continued pressure, the extent of recent selling activity could indicate that many “weak hands” have been shaken out. This process, while painful in the short term, often sets the stage for a more solid price foundation, enabling a recovery down the line.

In another analysis shared on CryptoQuant’s platform, an analyst known as Nino highlighted several bearish indicators that have surfaced in recent weeks. Negative funding rates on various derivatives exchanges, combined with a negative Coinbase Premium, suggest a continued dominance of short positions and heightened selling pressure in the spot market. Related Reading: Market Signals Point To Caution: Bitcoin’s 3-Day Chart Shows Potential Sell Alert Nino explained that when funding rates are negative, futures prices are trading below spot prices, reflecting an increase in short interest. Simultaneously, a negative Coinbase Premium indicates that selling on Coinbase has been substantial enough to push its spot price below that of other exchanges. The CryptoQuant analyst added: These figures together highlight a strong bearish sentiment among market participants, with short-selling pressure outpacing that of long positions in this recent downturn.

North Korean hackers have stolen a staggering $1.5 billion from ByBit , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, according to the FBI’s official statement . This marks one of the biggest crypto hacks in history, nearly doubling what North Korea stole in digital assets last year. Calling this heist a “ TraderTraitor ” FBI has requested all blockchain service providers, Defi services, exchange bridges to block any transaction in this name as they are constantly trying to convert these stolen assets into fiat currencies. Though they were successful in creating some of the funds into Bitcoin. How the Hack Happened and Where’s the fund? ByBit, which serves over 60 million users and ranks as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed the attack last Friday. The attack happened when the Safe dev’s device was compromised, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into the front-end and alter transaction parameters. The exchange said an attacker gained control of an Ether cold wallet and transferred its holdings to an unknown address. CEO Ben Zhou assured users that all other wallets remained secure, withdrawals continued as normal, and client funds were unaffected. The company is now working with forensic experts to track the stolen funds. The attack reportedly took place in minutes, with hackers making off with an amount nearly equivalent to North Korea’s annual GDP. By the weekend, about $160 million of the stolen assets had already been funneled through accounts linked to North Korean operatives, according to blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs . The firm noted that this single hack nearly doubled the total amount stolen by North Korea from crypto platforms last year. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bybit Launches ‘War’ Against North Korean Hacking Group Lazarus Following $1.46 Billion Theft , North Korea’s Growing Cyber Crimes North Korea has a long history of stealing crypto to fund its regime.

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $632 resistance. BNB price is moving higher above the $610 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $630 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $618 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $595 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Upside Break After forming a base above the $590 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $600 and $610 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $612 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $632 swing high to the $5995 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $615 and $618 levels. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $618 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $620 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $618 level. The next resistance sits near the $622 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $632 swing high to the $5995 low. A clear move above the $622 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $632. A close above the $632 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $665 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $622 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $602 level. The next major support is near the $600 level. The main support sits at $595. If there is a downside break below the $595 support, the price could drop toward the $588 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $600 and $595. Major Resistance Levels – $622 and $632.",BNB|Binance Coin|BNB Price|bnbbtc|BNBUSD|bnbusdt,EN,0,0,TRADING|BNB|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-27 05:08:13

Ethereum and Solana continue their downward movements, while XRP is breaking below a key support level. Crypto usually performs well during bullish times, but currently, the market is facing significant sell pressure. With the stock market dropping and Bitcoin ETFs facing large outflows, the overall sentiment is bearish. As the crypto market faces these challenges, attention turns to how these developments will impact the broader market. XRP is facing a tough time as it breaks below an important area of support. Despite previous fluctuations, the price has now dipped below the critical support zone between $2.25 and $2.30, which signals potential further downside movement. Although there was no confirmation of a daily close below this level yet, the cryptocurrency is dangerously close to confirming this break. Key Price Levels and Support Zones If XRP confirms a daily close below $2.25, the next major support is expected to range between $1.95 and $2.05. Recent data indicates a minor bounce near the $2.05 level, suggesting it may act as a key support area moving forward. On the other hand, resistance remains strong between $2.65 and $2.80, signaling that XRP will face significant challenges to regain upward momentum. Technical Analysis Indicates Bearish Sentiment The technical indicators are not favorable for XRP, as the price continues to form lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the asset is exhibiting a bearish divergence, which suggests that the downward pressure might continue. In the current market environment, XRP’s price action remains largely influenced by broader market trends, including the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-27 05:13:44

Bitcoin’s performance mirrors stock market trends. Gareth Soloway predicts Bitcoin may see further decline, with support around $73,000–$75,000. Bitcoin’s recent dip below $87,000 has raised questions about its future trajectory. After breaching $100,000 a few months ago, Bitcoin is now stuck in a period of sideways trading. However, Bitcoin isn’t the only crypto asset affected by selling pressure; altcoins are also seeing prices fall. Wider market concerns about consumer confidence and inflation are putting pressure on both the stock and cryptocurrency markets. Tariff Threats Add to Crypto Market Uncertainty The overall market mood is further complicated by concerns about new tariffs the U.S. government is planning, specifically targeting Canada and Mexico. While the market had grown somewhat used to tariff threats before, it now appears that these measures will proceed, adding additional pressure to an already fragile market.

The small percentage of XRP released from escrow each month has minimal impact on overall daily volume, especially as the circulating supply increases and escrow decreases. Even when XRP’s circulating supply nears 99%, the theory remains baseless.

Following a sudden halt on rial purchases, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) imposed limits on cryptocurrency prices and required real-time access to customer data. Critics argue these measures push people toward underground activities, while regulators aim to control the market and reduce currency depreciation. The government’s approach, seen as unbalanced, could further alienate the public and hinder transparency.

The Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows a strong uptrend with minimal selling pressure, while the Bollinger Bands Trend (BBTrend) dropped sharply to -11, suggesting the uptrend may be overextended. Despite this, Pi could test higher resistance levels at $3.5 or $4 in the near term, though a pullback remains possible. February 27, 2025 05:38:37 UTC Pi Coin Price Surges 293% Post-Launch Pi Coin has experienced an impressive 293% surge since its launch, outpacing major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. The surge follows the launch of Pi Network’s Open Mainnet on February 20, which allowed users to transfer Pi Coin outside the network for the first time. Pi Coin is now listed on prominent exchanges like OKX, Bitget, and CoinDCX. Factors driving the surge include increased exchange listings, a strong community of over 60 million users, and limited token supply. Despite a brief price drop below $1 post-launch, Pi Coin is currently priced at $2.95, with analysts predicting it could exceed $500 by 2030 if it gains real-world usage.

Hopes for a crypto-friendly Trump administration have faded, with little regulatory progress beyond speculative memecoin launches. Meanwhile, institutional investors are retreating amid security breaches and market instability. With memecoin mania collapsing and security vulnerabilities exposed, the industry faces a critical test: can it mature into a legitimate asset class, or will its speculative nature continue to undermine its long-term credibility? In the ever-changing world of financial markets, cryptocurrencies have been hailed as both a revolutionary force and a speculative bubble. Just a few months ago, optimism was at an all-time high. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had gained regulatory approval, institutional investors were showing greater interest, and political shifts - especially with Donald Trump’s reelection - hinted at a more crypto-friendly environment (we published a piece on it, linked here ). The narrative of crypto becoming a mainstream asset class gained traction, with proponents arguing that digital currencies could provide an alternative financial system immune to the volatility of traditional markets. Yet, in just a few months, that optimism appears to have crumbled. More than $800 billion has been wiped from the market in recent weeks, investor confidence has nosedived, and the very political forces expected to support crypto instead appear to have left it in limbo. Liquidations have mounted as leveraged traders are forced to exit positions, while record ETF outflows signal that investor sentiment may be souring. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), once hailed as digital gold, has seen its price plummet rapidly, while altcoins have fared even worse. The excitement that once surrounded decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain-based applications has seemingly dissipated, leaving behind a sector that once again finds itself struggling to prove its long-term value. With all these challenges, the key question now is not simply whether crypto will bounce back in the short term, but whether it can establish itself as a resilient financial asset class? Can it weather this storm and emerge stronger, or is this downturn a sign of deeper structural issues that could limit its future growth? A Crisis of Expectations The current crisis stems as much from misaligned expectations as from tangible losses. Bitcoin, seen by its ardent proponents as an uncorrelated hedge against monetary instability, has instead moved in lockstep with broader risk assets. In the aftermath of a euphoric run-up, the sector finds itself trapped in a vicious cycle of liquidity drains, regulatory uncertainty, and security breaches - factors that have cast doubt on its fundamental promises. The numbers are indeed sobering. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has fallen by a quarter, retreating to $2.78 trillion. Bitcoin itself, the flagship cryptocurrency and generally regarded as the most resilient, has shed 20% in a month, dropping below $85,000. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), long touted as the bedrock of the decentralized finance revolution, has fallen by 31%, while Solana ( SOL-USD ), a favorite among memecoin traders and enthusiast, has plunged by over 42%. This does not appear to be merely a cyclical downturn; it is a recalibration of the sector’s narrative. Comparing crypto’s performance to traditional markets further highlights its struggles. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the largest and most liquid digital assets, has dropped more than 22% year-to-date, underperforming the S&P 500, which has shown relative resilience despite broader market turmoil. While equity markets have absorbed macroeconomic shocks with measured declines, the volatility in crypto has amplified its downward trajectory, leading investors to question whether it remains a viable long-term asset class. The Politics of Crypto: Trump’s Unmet Promises Much of the sector’s optimism was tied to political developments - particularly Donald Trump’s election victory and his decidedly favorable stance toward the crypto sector. Many crypto investors, buoyed by his attendance at crypto-centric conferences and his shift in support of deregulatory rhetoric, anticipated a wave of legislative changes that would normalize digital assets within mainstream finance. Some even speculated that a Trump-led government might consider holding Bitcoin on the U.S. balance sheet, as Trump floated the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve a few times while on the campaign trail, or granting crypto-friendly banks greater freedom. Reality has been far less accommodating, at least so far. Instead of a robust regulatory embrace, the Trump administration has delivered little more than headline-grabbing stunts - most notably the launch of a Trump-branded memecoin, which collapsed by 83% in value within weeks. The failure to implement substantive policy changes has left the sector in a state of disappointment. Rather than legitimizing digital assets, Trump’s involvement in the memecoin frenzy may have only reinforced crypto’s image as a speculative Wild West in the public imagination. Adding to the malaise, Trump's trade policies - including a slew of tariffs - have heightened market volatility, prompting many investors to seek safer assets. Instead of serving as an alternative to fiat instability, as its proponents have long claimed, crypto has once again been treated like other high-risk assets and sold off accordingly, mirroring its behavior in past crises. The Structural Cracks: Liquidations, Hacks, and Institutional Retreat Beyond politics, the sector appears to be reeling from its own internal dysfunctions. Two multibillion-dollar liquidations in February wiped out leveraged positions, triggering cascading sell-offs. Meanwhile, the largest-ever crypto hack - a $1.5 billion heist from the Bybit exchange - has reignited concerns over security vulnerabilities. Far from achieving the impenetrability once promised by blockchain enthusiasts, centralized exchanges remain highly susceptible to cyberattacks. Institutional investors, once hailed as crypto’s saviors, also appear to be retreating. Bitcoin ETFs have seen six consecutive days of outflows, with a record $1 billion exiting in a single day. The enthusiasm that accompanied the regulatory approval of crypto ETFs in early 2024 has evaporated as investors come to terms with the reality that Bitcoin, despite its institutional packaging in an ETF wrapper, remains volatile and largely speculative. End of the Memecoin Era? One particularly striking feature of the latest downturn is the implosion of the memecoin frenzy. What began as a niche segment of the market - one that many saw as catering to internet culture - has now become emblematic of crypto excess. Political figures, from Argentina’s President Javier Milei to US First Lady Melania Trump, have dabbled in memecoin launches, often to disastrous effect. The bubble, once fueled by social media hype and the promise of astronomical returns, has burst - leaving a trail of disillusioned retail investors. This collapse underscores a deeper issue: crypto’s reliance on speculation rather than fundamentals. For years, proponents have argued that digital assets are ushering in a decentralized financial revolution and have even touted crypto as a legitimate store of value - a more robust alternative to fiat currency. Yet, time and again, the industry has demonstrated that, for many participants, it remains little more than a high-stakes casino. Despite the turmoil, it is too soon to write crypto’s obituary. Market cycles are nothing new, and digital assets have a history of rebounding from apparent death spirals. However, the industry now faces a critical inflection point. Regulatory clarity is urgently needed. Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission maintained an adversarial stance toward crypto. A structured, transparent regulatory framework could provide the foundation for long-term stability, but whether that materializes remains uncertain. Trump’s pick for SEC chair, Paul Atkins, is seen by many as a crypto-friendly regulator, raising hopes for a more accommodating approach. At the same time, institutional investors require stronger assurances regarding security risks - something that can only be addressed through a combination of regulatory oversight and technological innovation. However, meaningful progress in that area may be difficult to achieve, as the Trump administration appears focused on widespread budget and spending cuts. The newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) - ironically named after the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin - appears to be engaged in efforts to aggressively slash government spending, potentially restricting or even greatly diminishing the role of key regulatory bodies. More fundamentally, crypto must evolve beyond its speculative identity. The decentralized finance ((DEFI)) ecosystem has made strides, but it remains plagued by inefficiencies and security flaws. If blockchain technology is to fulfill its transformative potential, it must demonstrate real-world utility beyond price speculation. A Reckoning, Not a Requiem Crypto has weathered existential crises before. The collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014, the ICO bust of 2018, and the 2022 FTX scandal each seemed to signal the sector’s demise - yet each time, it adapted and rebounded. However, this reckoning is arguably the most consequential. Unlike previous crises, when crypto remained a niche market, it is now a mainstream asset class, accounting for nearly 5% of total U.S. market capitalization. The industry is no longer a scrappy upstart but a trillion-dollar sector facing the demands of institutional legitimacy. Its future will depend on how well it navigates its contradictions. If crypto is to be taken seriously, it must move beyond speculative excesses. The coming months will determine whether this downturn is a painful but necessary correction - or the start of a prolonged erosion of its credibility and influence.

Market analysts believe that now is not the right time for investors to panic sell their BTC as extreme fear conditions usually create upward price actions. Bitcoin In Extreme Fear Condition Amid Panic Selling With today’s fall under $83,000, BTC has extended its weekly losses to more than 12.66% with a large number of investors facing conditions of panic selling. The Bitcoin fear and greed index has dropped to 10, even lower than the FTX collapse in November 2022. Source: Alternative.me With today’s fall, Bitcoin price is currently testing its 200-day moving average (DMA) with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falling in oversold territory. Analysts suggest this creates an ideal setup for BTC to regain momentum and stage a potential rebound. Source: Tony Edward As of press time, the BTC price is trading 3.8% down at $85,318 with its daily trading volumes crashing 17% to $68 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the BTC futures open interest has dropped by 6.3% to $53.6 billion while the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $460 million, of which $390.88M is in long liquidation. Bitcoin deposits to exchanges surged to $1.3 billion yesterday, signaling rising market anxiety. The significant inflow reflects a wave of traders looking to offload their positions, potentially driven by fears of further price declines or heightened volatility. BTC Is On Sale Says Robert Kiyosaki Veteran Investor Robert Kiyosaki said that the current Bitcoin price crash presents a buying opportunity for investors. Kiyosaki emphasized his confidence in BTC despite its volatility, blaming systemic issues in the global monetary system for broader economic instability. While reinforcing his belief in the asset class, Kiyosaki said that BTC is “money with integrity”. He criticized the U.S. monetary system and its mounting debt, highlighting the risks posed by unsustainable obligations such as Medicare, Social Security, and a $36 trillion federal debt. “When Bitcoin crashes, I smile and buy more,” he added, positioning BTC, alongside gold and silver, as a hedge against what he called “fake money” and the failures of traditional financial systems. Trade War Concerns Drag Bitcoin Down Soon after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on the European Union, the S&P 500 wiped out $500 billion from the market in a short moment. Bitcoin has extended its decline, falling below $83,000 for the first time in 15 weeks as trade war fears weigh on investor sentiment. As a result, fear among investors has dropped even below that of FTX collapse. The cryptocurrency is now down 25% from its January 20th peak. However, market experts continue to remain bullish about it. CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju stated: “If you’re panic selling now, you’re probably a noob. A 30% correction in a Bitcoin bull cycle is common—it dropped 53% in 2021 and still recovered to an ATH. Buying when prices rise and selling when they fall is the worst investment strategy. Invest with a clear plan”.

Real Reason Behind the $770B Crypto Liquidation,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-price-is-down-today-wiped-out-500-in-billion/,"The post Why Bitcoin Price is Down Today? Real Reason Behind the $770B Crypto Liquidation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto markets are in deep red, with over $500 billion wiped out in just a week as the market cap plunges to $2.8 trillion . Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, has crashed to a 4-month low of $82,300, dropping nearly 15% in a week. The sudden crash has triggered massive liquidations, wiping out $770 billion in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 20, showing extreme fear in the market. So, what’s behind Bitcoin’s price drop? Bitcoin (BTC) losses amid NVIDIA rally One of the main reasons for Bitcoin’s decline is the surge in AI stocks, particularly NVIDIA. The chipmaker reported an impressive $39.3 billion revenue in Q4, showing a 12% increase from the previous quarter and a massive 78% rise year-over-year. This strong performance caused NVIDIA’s stock to rally by 4%, adding over $125 billion to its market cap. As investors rushed to invest in high-growth AI stocks, Bitcoin lost momentum, showing a shift in investor confidence from digital assets to AI-related investments. Bitcoin ETFs Outflow Continues Another major factor affecting Bitcoin’s price is the ongoing outflow from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to data from Farside , Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows of $2.43 billion between February 24 and February 26. This marks seven consecutive trading sessions of outflows, showing no signs of stopping. Leading the outflows are major financial institutions like Fidelity, which has increased selling pressure in the market. $5 Billion In Options Expiring On Feb 28 Bitcoin is also facing additional pressure due to the upcoming expiration of $5 billion worth of options contracts on February 28. A significant portion of these contracts is set at higher strike prices, making them likely to expire without profit. Data from Deribit suggests that around 78% of these expiring options, worth $3.9 billion, will not be profitable. Meanwhile, $1.3 billion in Bitcoin has been moved to exchanges, which could lead to more selling. Bitcoin Falls To $85,000 As of now, Bitcoin is trading at around $85,534, reflecting a 4% drop in the past 24 hours. The key support level to watch is $83,000, as losing this level could push Bitcoin further down to $80,313. On the other hand, if Bitcoin manages to hold this support, it could see a recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen to 25.92, indicating extreme oversold. Historically, when the RSI drops below 30, Bitcoin tends to see a short-term price bounce.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-27 05:50:26

Pi Network’s ( PI ) surge coincides with a huge increase in 24-hour trading volume, which has surpassed $3.2 billion, according to data from the crypto.news price tracker. The token is currently sitting at $2.95 after earlier trading as low as $1.65 in the same 24-hour period. The spike contradicts the ongoing decline in the broader cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin having fallen below $85,000. On the technical side, PI is showing a neutral to slightly bullish bias. The 5-minute chart shows price action fluctuating around the 9-EMA, which is acting as both support and resistance. The RSI (14) at 55.60 suggests neutral momentum, with neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Pi Network chart. Source: crypto.news Key levels to watch include $3.00 as resistance and $2.90 as support. Holding above the 9-EMA could push PI toward $2.95–$3.00, while a drop below $2.90 may shift momentum to bearish.

The official X account of Pump.fun was compromised on Feb. 26, leading to the promotion of a fake governance token, while forensic investigations into the recent Bybit exploit revealed that North Korea’s Lazarus Group was behind the $1.4 billion hack—the largest in crypto history. Pump.fun X Account Hacked to Promote Fake ”PUMP” Token: Latest in a Wave of Crypto Scams The official X account of Pump.fun, a prominent launchpad for meme coins, was compromised on Feb. 26, 2025, leading to the promotion of a fraudulent governance token called “PUMP” and other deceptive cryptocurrencies. This breach is part of an ongoing trend of social media hacks targeting the crypto community, further highlighting the growing cybersecurity crisis in the industry. Shortly after the account was taken over, well-known blockchain investigator ZackXBT issued a warning to the crypto community, urging users to avoid engaging with any links shared by the hacked Pump.fun account. According to ZackXBT’s on-chain analysis, this incident appears to be directly linked to the February 2025 hack of the Jupiter DAO account and the DogWifCoin X account breach in November 2024. The investigator also emphasized that these breaches were not due to any fault of the teams behind these projects but rather part of a larger pattern of targeted social engineering attacks on high-profile crypto entities. The attackers used the compromised Pump.fun account to post a message promoting a fraudulent ”governance token”, promising rewards for early adopters in an attempt to lure in unsuspecting users. The Pump.fun team has since acknowledged the breach and is actively working to regain control of the account. In a statement shared via their official Telegram channel, the team reassured users that they were not behind the promotion of the fake token and warned against interacting with any posts related to ”PUMP.” This latest security incident adds to a growing list of social media hacks that have exploited major crypto platforms and figures to push scam tokens. It comes shortly after the record-breaking $1.4 billion Bybit hack, the largest single crypto hack in history, which has amplified concerns over the security of Web3 platforms and social media-integrated crypto marketing. The Pump.fun hack is just one of several incidents where bad actors have seized control of influential accounts to promote fraudulent tokens. Recent high-profile cases include: Argentine President Javier Milei’s promotion of the LIBRA token in a now-deleted X post on Feb. 14, 2025. The token was initially marketed as a project to inject liquidity into startups and small businesses in Argentina. However, Milei later distanced himself from the project, leading to a $107-million rug pull. The fallout has been described as an international scandal. The Bermuda Premier David Burt’s X account was hacked on the same day to promote a fraudulent token called “Bermuda National Coin”. Following the posts, multiple fake ”Bermuda National Coin” meme coins were created on Pump.fun, exploiting the situation. Premier Burt called out Elon Musk and the X team, questioning how the scammer managed to obtain a gray checkmark verification, which is typically reserved for government officials. The growing trend of high-profile figures and crypto platforms falling victim to social media-driven crypto scams has raised alarms among industry experts. Venture capitalist Nic Carter weighed in on the issue, arguing that the meme coin market may be reaching its breaking point. These developments are reigniting discussions about the lack of robust security measures on social media platforms, as well as the ease with which hackers can impersonate reputable figures to manipulate crypto markets. The Future of Crypto Cybersecurity: Industry at a Crossroads The recent hacks shed light on a critical need for better security in the crypto industry, particularly in the intersection of social media and decentralized finance (DeFi). With billions of dollars at stake and an increasing number of fraudulent projects appearing, users and platforms alike must prioritize cybersecurity measures. Security experts recommend the following precautions for crypto firms and investors: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all accounts. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or engaging with posts promoting new tokens from compromised accounts. Verify official announcements through multiple trusted sources before making investment decisions. Report suspected scams to social media platforms and blockchain security firms. As the Pump.fun team works to restore its X account and clean up the damage caused by the hack, this incident serves as another stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist in the crypto ecosystem. With cyberattacks becoming increasingly sophisticated, the battle between security and exploitation continues, leaving crypto investors and projects at constant risk. Forensic Investigations Reveal Lazarus Group Behind $1.4 Billion Bybit Hack In related news, a series of forensic investigations into the largest crypto hack in history has confirmed that North Korea’s Lazarus Group was behind the $1.4 billion exploit of Bybit. The attack, which took place on Feb. 21, 2025, was facilitated by compromised SafeWallet credentials, allowing hackers to infiltrate the exchange’s infrastructure and execute a devastating security breach. On Feb. 26, 2025, Bybit released an official statement confirming the findings of forensic cybersecurity firms Sygnia and Verichains. Their reports concluded that the attack was enabled by stolen credentials belonging to a Safe developer, which granted unauthorized access to SafeWallet’s infrastructure. The attack was initiated through malicious JavaScript code injected into SafeWallet’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. This manipulated the signing process, deceiving security protocols into approving fraudulent transactions. Following the attack, the SafeWallet team worked swiftly to mitigate further risks by: Rebuilding and reconfiguring all infrastructure Rotating all security credentials Implementing additional security measures to close the attack vector Despite the scale of the breach, both forensic experts and SafeWallet developers confirmed that Bybit’s core infrastructure remained uncompromised. The Bybit exploit surpassed all previous crypto breaches, eclipsing the Ronin Network attack ($625M) in 2022 and the Poly Network heist ($610M) in 2021. The stolen funds primarily consisted of liquid-staked Ether (stETH), valued at approximately $2,314 per token at the time of the attack. According to Cyvers data, the Bybit hack accounted for more than 60% of all stolen crypto funds in 2024, making it the most significant security incident in the industry’s history. Despite the severity of the breach, Bybit acted swiftly to replenish user assets, ensuring that operations continued without major disruptions. The exchange secured funds through a combination of loans, asset purchases, and large holder deposits to cover the lost assets. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that the exchange borrowed 40,000 ETH from Bitget to meet withdrawal demands immediately after the attack. The loan has since been fully repaid, allowing Bybit to restore 100% full backing of client assets. The aftermath of the Bybit hack had immediate consequences for the broader cryptocurrency market. The exploit triggered a sharp decline in the price of Ether, with panic selling intensifying volatility across major digital assets. The incident has also sparked renewed concerns over crypto security, particularly regarding custodial risks and third-party infrastructure vulnerabilities. Industry analysts warn that exchanges must reinforce security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future. North Korea’s Lazarus Group: The Cybercrime Giant The attack on Bybit is the latest in a string of high-profile crypto hacks linked to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-backed hacking collective known for its sophisticated cyber warfare tactics. According to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic, Lazarus Group has been responsible for billions of dollars in crypto thefts over the past five years, using stolen funds to finance North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Lazarus has previously been tied to: The $625M Ronin Bridge hack (March 2022) The $100M Harmony Bridge hack (June 2022) The $41M Stake.com hack (September 2023) The $55M CoinEx hack (September 2023) Bybit’s exploit now ranks as the largest heist orchestrated by the Lazarus Group, raising concerns about the group’s evolving cyber capabilities and the persistent threat to the cryptocurrency industry. As the Bybit incident shows the vulnerabilities within third-party wallet providers, security experts are calling for stronger measures to prevent similar attacks, including: Mandatory multi-signature authentication for high-value transactions Enhanced security audits for wallet infrastructure Decentralized security frameworks to reduce reliance on centralized access points Real-time threat monitoring and AI-based anomaly detection systems The Bybit hack serves as a wake-up call for exchanges, investors, and the broader crypto ecosystem. With state-sponsored hacking groups targeting high-value platforms, the industry must adapt to fortify its defenses and prevent further billion-dollar breaches.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ASIA|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-27 06:00:00

By offering decentralized borrowing and opportunities for passive income, it distinguishes itself from purely speculative projects. Currently priced at just $0.015 during its presale, early participants have a chance to lock in tokens before the platform’s anticipated surge. Analysts predict significant gains for MUTM by 2025, positioning it as a top contender in the expanding DeFi sector. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) In a market saturated with hype-driven tokens, Mutuum Finance stands out with its clear financial focus. Through its decentralized borrowing and lending system, users can supply assets to earn yields and borrow funds without needing to sell their crypto. This tangible utility sets it apart, fueling speculation that MUTM could generate returns exceeding 100x by 2025. Two key elements drive the project’s growth: well-structured tokenomics and ecosystem sustainability. Thanks to a buy-and-distribute feature, platform fees are periodically directed toward buying MUTM from the market, producing consistent buy pressure. Purchased tokens are then shared with liquidity providers and stakers, incentivizing ongoing commitment and dampening sell-offs. As overall adoption expands, this positive cycle becomes stronger, elevating demand. Mutuum Finance also employs both P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, broadening its potential reach. While overcollateralized loans via P2C allow liquidity providers to earn competitive APYs, P2P lending enables direct negotiations between borrowers and lenders for assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB). This flexible lending system increases appeal for both institutional players and everyday crypto users. Presale Highlights and Growth Trajectory Mutuum Finance’s presale success further evidences the project’s promise. Over $1.5 million has already been raised in a short period, with around 3,000 holders securing tokens at $0.015. Even before hitting exchanges, investors anticipate a 400% profit based on the planned launch price of $0.06. Analysts project that MUTM could top $0.60 as adoption and exchange listings gain momentum, suggesting potential 100x returns. The presale price itself provides an attractive entry point for significant upside. An investor purchasing 200,000 tokens for $3,000 at the current $0.015 rate could see that stake rise to $12,000 at launch—when MUTM reaches $0.06—and balloon to $120,000 if the token surpasses $0.60 as expected. Another factor encouraging confidence is Mutuum Finance’s intention to conduct a smart contract audit by a reputable security firm, reducing risk and adding credibility to the project. Additionally, a beta version of the platform is set to debut alongside the token’s exchange listing, driving immediate utility and enhancing market trust. Investors also have a chance to benefit from the project’s $100,000 giveaway for early adopters who share Mutuum Finance’s long-term outlook. This initiative aims to expand community involvement while rewarding those who join the project’s initial stages. Details and eligibility requirements are available on the official website. With its rigorous approach to DeFi lending, disciplined growth model, and a roadmap designed for sustainable demand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart from the market’s many speculative offerings. As DeFi evolves, projects providing true utility are poised to flourish, and Mutuum Finance positions itself as a leading name in the space—potentially yielding 100x gains by 2025.

This would mean continued choppy price action before a potential breakout. The timing coincides with Bitcoin’s 852-day cycle and the apex of a symmetrical triangle that XRP is forming, which could influence its next major move. $XRP wave 4 of 3 could end up being as long as the wave 2 of 3.. which means it remains choppy until late March coincidentally lining up with $BTC 852 day cycle as well as the apex of the symmetrical triangle that $XRP is forming yes, i still believe in one more upside impulse… pic.twitter.com/3TMTPKsAtd — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) February 25, 2025 In early January, a well-respected crypto analyst predicted that XRP could hit $13 to $15 if it can cross $4 before March 10 . If these patterns hold, XRP may see another upward impulse between March and April, potentially hitting these targets. The symmetrical triangle also adds to the bullish sentiment, as it often precedes a breakout. If the structure holds, the apex of this triangle could coincide with the projected late March timeframe, reinforcing the possibility of an upward move. Market Sentiment and Broader Crypto Trends Market sentiment surrounding XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market remains weak, with Charting Guy stating that conditions are oversold. Many altcoins, including XRP, have seen price suppression amid ongoing uncertainty in Bitcoin dominance. Despite the choppy price action, another upward impulse move is expected between March and April. Historically, XRP has performed better when Bitcoin dominance weakens , and a decline following this uncertainty could create an opportunity for XRP and other altcoins to outperform. However, Charting Guy noted that XRP could trade within the $2-$3 range until August, resembling the 2017 market cycle, but does not consider it the most likely scenario. Instead, technical patterns support the idea of an earlier breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Levels and Price Targets For XRP to confirm a bullish breakout, it must maintain momentum above key resistance levels. The completion of wave five could see XRP targeting the $5 range, provided that market conditions align favorably. If the correction persists longer than expected, traders should watch the $2-$3 range as a critical accumulation zone. The asset recently experienced a notable decline caused by pressure from the broader market but has entered a recovery phase. The asset has climbed more than 7.4% over the past 24 hours and is trading at $2.3. Reclaiming this level is a crucial milestone, as analysts have termed it crucial for preserving long-term momentum. The overall trajectory of the cryptocurrency market could also influence XRP’s movement, as increased downward pressure from the broader market could slow its recovery. Over the next few weeks, the asset’s performance will be crucial in determining its long-term trajectory. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Senator Cynthia Lummis recently led the first meeting of the Senate Subcommittee on Digital Assets, which is a major step toward creating rules for cryptocurrencies. The subcommittee was formed to help create a set of rules that will support innovation while also protecting consumers. “I’m excited that we can finally begin this important work on digital asset regulations,” Senator Lummis said at the meeting. “We’ve come a long way from when people were just starting to understand Bitcoin and stablecoins. Now, we’re ready to make progress. We’re in the early stages of bitcoin and digital assets. If we are going to pass any legislation, we’ll need bipartisan support. Today’s hearing was the first step.” Although this meeting was a big step, it showed that lawmakers are still moving slowly when it comes to passing important laws. The proposed rules include the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act , which focuses on market structure, and the Genius Act for stablecoins. These laws aim to keep the U.S. dollar competitive in the digital world while making payments faster and cheaper. Lummis said, “Many members of the Senate are still trying to wrap their heads around ‘what is a Bitcoin;’ ‘what is a digital asset,’ ‘what is a stablecoin. I hope we can get the legislation to President Trump for his signature this year.” (SIC) However, lawmakers are currently focusing on stablecoins rather than broader rules for the whole market, which shows they are taking a careful approach. The Genius Act is expected to protect the U.S. banking system and create equal rules for stablecoin regulations at both the state and federal levels. This slower pace of action is in contrast to the earlier promises made by newly appointed “Crypto Czar” David Sacks, who had said he would push for crypto reforms within the first 100 days of President Trump’s second term. But the meeting showed that lawmakers are proceeding at a slower pace. Despite these delays, there is still hope that progress will be made. Senator Lummis said she was confident that rules for stablecoins could be ready soon, which could lead to more legislation in the future.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-27 06:04:09

The city, already a global financial hub, is now setting its sights on becoming a leader in the burgeoning world of virtual assets. During a recent press conference, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po dropped some exciting news: Hong Kong is committed to building a sustainable virtual asset ecosystem . Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto in Hong Kong and beyond. Why is Hong Kong Focusing on a Sustainable Virtual Asset Ecosystem? You might be wondering, why is Hong Kong so keen on this virtual asset ecosystem buzz? Well, it’s not just about hopping on the latest tech trend. It’s a strategic move to solidify Hong Kong’s position as a forward-thinking, innovative financial center. Think about it: Economic Growth: A thriving virtual asset ecosystem can attract new businesses, investments, and talent to Hong Kong, boosting the local economy. Global Leadership: By taking a proactive and regulated approach, Hong Kong aims to lead the way in responsible cryptocurrency regulation and Web3 development, setting an example for other regions. Technological Advancement: Embracing virtual assets fosters innovation in blockchain technology and related fields, pushing Hong Kong to the forefront of technological advancement. Financial Innovation: Integrating virtual assets into the financial system opens doors to new financial products and services, making Hong Kong a more dynamic and competitive financial hub. Hong Kong’s Journey So Far in the Virtual Asset Space Hong Kong isn’t new to the virtual asset ecosystem . Paul Chan reminded us that the city has been laying the groundwork for years. Remember their first policy statement on virtual assets? That was a significant step, introducing: Exchange Regulations: Setting up a framework to regulate virtual asset exchanges, ensuring investor protection and market integrity. ETF Approvals: Giving the green light to virtual asset exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it easier for traditional investors to access the crypto market. These weren’t just empty gestures. Hong Kong walked the talk, gradually implementing these policies. And guess what? It paid off! Hong Kong became a hotspot, even hosting one of the world’s largest Web3 conferences. This shows Hong Kong’s commitment is not just lip service; it’s about concrete action. What’s Next for Hong Kong’s Sustainable Virtual Asset Ecosystem? So, what does “ sustainable virtual asset ecosystem ” actually mean in practical terms? According to Paul Chan, the focus now is on reducing uncertainty and implementing measures to build a truly sustainable market . This likely involves: Refining Regulations: Continuously improving and clarifying cryptocurrency regulation to provide clear guidelines for businesses and investors. Investor Education: Promoting financial literacy and educating the public about the risks and opportunities associated with virtual assets. Industry Collaboration: Working closely with the virtual asset industry to foster innovation while ensuring compliance and responsible growth. Talent Development: Investing in education and training programs to build a skilled workforce capable of driving the virtual asset ecosystem forward. It’s about creating a balanced environment – one that encourages innovation and growth while safeguarding investors and maintaining financial stability. This is no easy feat, but Hong Kong seems determined to get it right. Challenges and Opportunities in Building a Sustainable Virtual Asset Market Let’s be real, building a sustainable virtual asset market isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. There are challenges to overcome: Challenges Opportunities Volatility: The crypto market is known for its price swings. Managing volatility and protecting investors from extreme fluctuations is crucial. Innovation Hub: Hong Kong can become a global hub for Web3 innovation, attracting cutting-edge projects and companies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, there’s still regulatory gray areas globally. Hong Kong needs to navigate this complex landscape effectively. First-Mover Advantage: By establishing clear and progressive regulations, Hong Kong can attract businesses seeking regulatory clarity, gaining a first-mover advantage. Security Risks: Cybersecurity threats and scams are prevalent in the crypto space. Robust security measures are essential to build trust. Fintech Leadership: Success in the virtual asset ecosystem can solidify Hong Kong’s position as a leading fintech hub in Asia and globally. Public Perception: Negative perceptions around crypto still exist. Education and transparency are key to fostering broader public acceptance. Economic Diversification: The virtual asset ecosystem offers a new avenue for economic diversification, reducing reliance on traditional sectors. Despite the hurdles, the opportunities are immense. Hong Kong’s proactive approach signals a strong belief in the future of virtual assets and their potential to transform the financial landscape. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you’re a crypto enthusiast, investor, or business owner, Hong Kong’s move towards a sustainable virtual asset ecosystem has implications for you: For Investors: Keep an eye on Hong Kong’s regulatory developments. Clearer regulations can lead to a more stable and mature market, potentially attracting more institutional investment. For Businesses: Hong Kong is becoming an increasingly attractive location for Web3 and virtual asset companies. Consider exploring opportunities to establish or expand your operations there. For the Crypto Community: Hong Kong’s approach could serve as a model for other jurisdictions seeking to regulate virtual assets responsibly. This could pave the way for wider adoption and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Hong Kong’s Bold Leap into the Future of Finance Hong Kong’s commitment to building a sustainable virtual asset ecosystem is more than just a policy statement; it’s a declaration of intent. It’s a bold move to embrace the future of finance, positioning itself as a global leader in the Web3 revolution.

Fear and Greed Index Shows Extreme Panic Selling,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-market-is-down-today-fear-and-greed-index-shows-extreme-panic-selling/,"The post Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? Fear and Greed Index Shows Extreme Panic Selling appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin plunged under $83,000, marking a 25% drop from its January peak, with the Fear and Greed Index sinking to 10—lower than during the FTX collapse . The official index website noted that extreme fear often signals excessive investor worry, which could present a buying opportunity for those looking to enter the market. Panic selling intensified as $1.3 billion worth of BTC was deposited into exchanges yesterday, signaling heightened anxiety among traders. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has dropped 17% to $68 billion, while futures open interest has fallen by 6.3% to $53.6 billion. February has historically favored Bitcoin—will it bounce before the month ends? This cycle is different and many analysts see this as a buying opportunity let’s see what it means for investors. Analysts Say Panic Selling is a Mistake Despite the massive sell-off, market veterans urge investors to remain calm. Corrections of 30% or more are common in Bitcoin bull cycles, and BTC is now testing its 200-day moving average with its RSI in oversold territory—often a sign of a potential rebound. CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju reminded traders that BTC dropped 53% in 2021 before surging to an all-time high, warning that buying when prices rise and selling when they fall is the worst investment strategy. Echoing the similar sentiment, Crypto analyst, MackAttackXRP, reminded investors that fear is the best time to buy and greed is the best time to sell. He advised buying when prices are down (red) and selling when they rise (green). .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : When Will Crypto Go Back Up? Is the 2025 Bull Run Over? , Robert Kiyosaki Calls BTC “Money with Integrity” Veteran investor Robert Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin’s crash as a buying opportunity. He blamed systemic issues in the global financial system, citing America’s mounting debt, Social Security liabilities, and unsustainable spending. He remains bullish on Bitcoin, gold, and silver as hedges against what he calls “ fake money .” “ When Bitcoin crashes, I smile and buy more ,” he said, reinforcing his long-term confidence in BTC . Trade War Fears Add to the Sell-Off Bitcoin’s downfall came after Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President announcement of a 25% tariff on the EU triggered a $500 billion wipeout in the S&P 500, dragging BTC down further. Investors are now even more fearful than during the FTX collapse, fueling extreme volatility. Despite the panic, analysts believe Bitcoin’s pullback is part of its natural bull cycle. History shows that deep corrections often precede strong rallies, making this a crucial moment for patient investors. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40899688,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134748,1740641618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Exciting Opportunities: Binance Opens USDC Deposits and Withdrawals on Sui,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-usdc-sui-integration/,"Get ready for a game-changer in the crypto world! Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped some exciting news. They’ve officially enabled deposits and withdrawals for USD Coin (USDC) on the Sui network. This move marks a significant step forward for both Binance users and the burgeoning Sui ecosystem. If you’ve been waiting to seamlessly move your USDC between Binance and the Sui blockchain, your wait is finally over! Let’s dive into what this integration means for you and the broader crypto landscape. What Makes Binance Sui Support for USDC Significant? This isn’t just another routine update; the integration of USDC on the Sui network through Binance carries substantial weight. Here’s why it’s making waves: Enhanced Accessibility: Binance is a crypto giant, and by enabling Binance Sui support for USDC, they’re making this stablecoin far more accessible to their massive user base. This means millions of users can now directly interact with USDC on Sui without complex bridging procedures. Boosting Sui Network Adoption: For the Sui network, this integration is a major win. Having a widely recognized and trusted stablecoin like USDC readily available on their platform can attract more users, developers, and projects to the Sui ecosystem. It provides a crucial on-ramp for liquidity and expands the utility of the Sui blockchain. Streamlined User Experience: Say goodbye to complicated cross-chain swaps or intermediary steps. Sui USDC deposits withdrawals on Binance simplify the process of moving USDC to and from the Sui network. This ease of use is crucial for both experienced crypto users and newcomers alike. Lower Transaction Costs: The Sui network is known for its high throughput and low transaction fees. By utilizing Sui for USDC transactions, users can potentially benefit from significantly reduced costs compared to other networks. Expanding DeFi Opportunities on Sui: With USDC now readily available on Sui through Binance, it paves the way for a richer Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Sui. Expect to see more DeFi protocols, lending platforms, and trading opportunities emerge, leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Sui network. Navigating USDC Deposits and Withdrawals on Sui via Binance So, how do you actually use this new feature? The process is designed to be straightforward, reflecting Binance’s commitment to user-friendliness. Here’s a quick guide: Depositing USDC to Binance from Sui: Ensure you have USDC in your wallet on the Sui network. Log in to your Binance account and navigate to your wallet. Select “Deposit” and choose USDC as the cryptocurrency. From the network options, select “Sui”. Binance will provide you with a Sui deposit address. Copy this address and use it as the recipient address when sending USDC from your Sui wallet. Confirm the transaction and wait for it to be processed on the Sui network and Binance. Withdrawing USDC from Binance to Sui: Ensure you have a wallet address on the Sui network. Log in to your Binance account and navigate to your wallet. Select “Withdraw” and choose USDC as the cryptocurrency. Enter your Sui wallet address as the recipient address. From the network options, select “Sui”. Specify the amount of USDC you wish to withdraw. Review the transaction details and confirm the withdrawal. The USDC will be sent to your Sui wallet address. Important Note: Always double-check the network selection (Sui) when depositing or withdrawing USDC to ensure you are using the correct network. Sending funds to the wrong network can result in loss of funds. Boosting Crypto Stablecoin Adoption through Sui Integration The availability of crypto stablecoin adoption is crucial for the continued growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency space. Stablecoins like USDC play a vital role in: Providing Stability: In the volatile world of crypto, stablecoins offer a haven of stability, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. This makes them ideal for hedging against market fluctuations and preserving value. Facilitating Transactions: Stablecoins are excellent for everyday transactions within the crypto ecosystem. Their price stability makes them predictable and reliable for payments, remittances, and trading. Enabling DeFi Growth: DeFi protocols heavily rely on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and providing liquidity. Increased stablecoin availability fuels the expansion of DeFi. Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto: Stablecoins act as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, making it easier for institutions and individuals to interact with digital assets. By integrating USDC on Sui, Binance is contributing to the broader adoption of stablecoins and fostering a more robust and versatile crypto ecosystem. This move empowers users with more options and reinforces the utility of both USDC and the Sui network. Potential Challenges and Considerations with Sui USDC Integration While the Binance Sui support for USDC is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Network Congestion: Although Sui is designed for high throughput, increased activity due to USDC integration could potentially lead to temporary network congestion, especially during peak times. Users should be mindful of network conditions and potential delays. Security Risks: As with any crypto transaction, security remains paramount. Users must ensure they are using secure wallets, practicing good security hygiene (like strong passwords and avoiding phishing attempts), and being cautious when interacting with new platforms or DeFi protocols on Sui. User Education: While the process is simplified, some users, especially those new to crypto or the Sui network, might require education on how to properly deposit and withdraw USDC using the Sui network on Binance. Binance and the Sui community can play a role in providing clear and accessible educational resources. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is constantly evolving. Both Binance and Circle (the issuer of USDC) must remain compliant with relevant regulations in different jurisdictions. Users should also stay informed about the regulatory environment in their region. Actionable Insights for Users and the Crypto Community What can you do with this exciting development? Here are some actionable insights: Explore Sui DeFi: If you’re interested in DeFi, now is a great time to explore the emerging DeFi ecosystem on Sui. With USDC readily available, you can participate in lending, borrowing, staking, and other DeFi activities on the Sui network. Take Advantage of Lower Fees: Consider using the Sui network for your USDC transactions to potentially benefit from lower transaction fees compared to networks like Ethereum. This can be particularly advantageous for frequent traders or users making smaller transactions. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with developments in the Sui ecosystem and the evolving features and functionalities of USDC Sui network integration . Follow Binance and Sui official channels for announcements and updates. Provide Feedback: If you use the new USDC on Sui feature on Binance, provide feedback to both Binance and the Sui community. Your input can help improve the user experience and shape future developments. Conclusion: A Powerful Leap for Sui and Binance Binance enabling deposits and withdrawals for USDC on the Sui network is more than just a simple listing. It’s a strategic move that unlocks exciting opportunities for users, strengthens the Sui ecosystem, and contributes to the broader adoption of stablecoins. This integration streamlines user experience, potentially lowers transaction costs, and opens doors to a vibrant DeFi future on Sui. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, collaborations like this are essential for driving innovation and making crypto more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

40899735,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134747,1740641727,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Google Gemini: The Essential Guide to Revolutionary AI Models,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-ai-models-guide/,"In the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence, Google is making significant strides with Google Gemini , their suite of generative AI models designed to reshape how we interact with technology. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding the advancements in AI like Google Gemini is crucial as these technologies are increasingly intertwined, influencing everything from market analysis to decentralized applications. This guide breaks down everything you need to know about Google Gemini , from its various models to its applications and how it competes with other AI powerhouses like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. What Exactly is Google Gemini and Why Should You Care? Google Gemini is Google’s next-generation family of generative AI models, born from the combined expertise of Google’s AI research divisions, DeepMind and Google Research. Unlike previous models limited to text, Google Gemini is designed to be natively multimodal, meaning it can process and understand text, audio, images, and video. This capability opens up a new realm of possibilities for AI applications. For the crypto-savvy, imagine AI tools that can analyze market trends from diverse data sources – news articles, social media sentiment from images and videos, and financial reports – all at once, providing a more holistic and insightful market overview. Google Gemini comes in several versions, each tailored for different needs: Gemini Ultra : The most powerful, designed for complex tasks. Gemini Pro : A balanced, large model, now in its flagship version, Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental. Gemini Flash : Optimized for speed, with versions like Flash-Lite and Flash Thinking Experimental. Gemini Nano : Compact models (Nano-1 and Nano-2) for on-device processing, even offline. This multimodal approach and range of models set Google Gemini apart from earlier models like Google’s LaMDA, which was text-only. However, it’s worth noting the ethical considerations around training these models on vast datasets, often without explicit consent – a point of concern relevant to the discussions around data privacy and usage in the blockchain world as well. Google offers an AI indemnification policy for some Google Cloud users, but commercial users should still proceed cautiously. Decoding Gemini Apps vs. Gemini Models: What’s the Real Difference? It’s easy to get confused between Gemini apps and Gemini models . Think of it this way: Gemini models are the engines, and Gemini apps are the user-friendly interfaces that let you interact with these engines. The apps, formerly known as Bard, are essentially clients that connect to the Gemini models , similar to how ChatGPT and Claude apps work. These apps are your gateway to leveraging Google’s generative AI. You can access Gemini in various ways: Web : Directly through the Gemini website. Android : The Gemini app replaces Google Assistant, offering screen overlay capabilities for context-aware queries. iOS : Accessed via the Google and Google Search apps. These apps are versatile, accepting text, voice commands, and images (soon videos and PDFs too), and can generate images in response. Conversations seamlessly sync across web and mobile if you’re logged into the same Google Account, ensuring a consistent AI experience wherever you are. Unlocking Premium AI: Exploring Gemini Advanced and its Power Beyond the standard Gemini apps , Gemini Advanced represents a significant leap in AI capability. Accessible through the Google One AI Premium Plan ($20/month), Gemini Advanced unlocks enhanced features within Google Workspace apps like Gmail, Docs, and more. This plan is not just about accessing AI; it’s about integrating powerful AI tools into your daily workflow. Gemini Advanced benefits include: Access to more sophisticated Gemini models : Leveraging Google’s most advanced AI for superior performance. Priority access to new features : Staying ahead with the latest AI capabilities. Code execution : Run and edit Python code directly within Gemini, invaluable for developers. Larger context window : Remember and reason across approximately 750,000 words (1,500 pages), compared to the standard app’s 24,000 words. Deep Research feature : Generates comprehensive research briefs by creating a multi-step research plan and scouring the web for detailed reports. Memory feature : Uses past conversations to provide context for current interactions, making the AI more personalized. Increased usage for NotebookLM : Enhanced PDF-to-podcast conversion. Experimental Gemini 2.0 Pro access : Optimized for complex coding and math problems. Trip planning in Google Search : Creates custom, dynamic travel itineraries. For businesses, Gemini offers corporate plans like Gemini Business and Gemini Enterprise , integrating AI into Google Workspace with features like meeting note-taking, translation, and document management. These plans start from $6 per user per month for Business, with Enterprise offering more extensive features at a custom price point. Gemini’s Deep Integration Across Google Services: A New AI Ecosystem Google Gemini isn’t confined to standalone apps; it’s becoming deeply integrated across Google’s ecosystem, enhancing numerous services you might already use: Gmail & Docs : Side panels for email drafting, summarization, content refinement, and brainstorming. Slides & Sheets : Generates slides, custom images, and organizes data with tables and formulas. Maps : Summarizes reviews for places, recommends itineraries for city explorations. Drive : Summarizes files and folders, provides project overviews. Meet : Translates captions in real-time. Chrome : AI writing tool for content creation and rewriting, contextually aware of webpages. Database & Cloud Security Tools : Enhancements in database products, cloud security, and app development platforms like Firebase and Project IDX. Google Photos & YouTube : Natural language search in Photos, video idea brainstorming on YouTube. NotebookLM : AI-powered note-taking assistant. Code Assist (formerly Duet AI for Developers) : AI-powered coding assistance. Security Products : Gemini in Threat Intelligence for analyzing malicious code and threat hunting. This pervasive integration signals Google’s vision of AI as a ubiquitous tool, seamlessly woven into the fabric of our digital lives. Gems and Extensions: Customization and Connectivity with Gemini Further expanding Gemini’s capabilities are Gems and Extensions. Gemini Advanced users can create custom chatbots called ‘Gems’ tailored to specific tasks. These Gems can be defined through natural language descriptions, like creating a ‘running coach’ Gem for personalized fitness plans. Gems can be shared or kept private and will eventually integrate with Google services like Calendar, Tasks, and YouTube Music for enhanced task automation. Gemini extensions enable the Gemini apps to connect with Google services like Drive, Gmail, and YouTube. This allows for queries like ‘Summarize my last three emails?’ and will soon include integrations with Calendar, Keep, Tasks, YouTube Music, and Android Utilities for device control. These integrations make Gemini a more connected and contextually aware AI assistant. Gemini Live: Engaging in In-Depth Voice Conversations Gemini Live offers an interactive voice chat experience within the Gemini apps and Pixel Buds Pro 2. This feature allows for natural, interruptible conversations with Gemini , adapting to your speech patterns in real-time. Future updates promise visual understanding, enabling Gemini to respond to its surroundings via your smartphone’s camera. Gemini Live is also designed as a virtual coach for tasks like interview preparation and public speaking practice, though early reviews suggest it’s still in its early stages of development. Imagen 3: Generating High-Quality Images with Gemini Gemini users can generate images using Google’s Imagen 3 model, the successor to Imagen 2. Imagen 3 is touted to better understand text prompts, producing more detailed and creative images with fewer artifacts and errors. It also excels in rendering text within images.

For Nest devices, Gemini will enhance Google Assistant’s conversational abilities, offering AI descriptions for Nest camera footage and natural language video search. Nest Aware subscribers will soon preview Gemini -powered features, making smart homes more intuitive and responsive. What Can Gemini Models Actually Do? Capabilities and Potential The multimodal nature of Gemini models allows them to perform diverse tasks, from speech transcription to real-time image and video captioning. Google emphasizes these capabilities, but past launches, like the initial Bard release, have faced criticism for over-promising and under-delivering. Concerns around biases and hallucinations in generative AI also persist across the industry, including with Gemini . Despite these caveats, the potential of Gemini is vast. Here’s a look at what each tier offers: Gemini Ultra: Power for Complex Tasks Gemini Ultra is designed for demanding tasks like physics problem-solving, mistake detection in worksheets, and identifying relevant scientific papers. While currently less visible in product offerings and API pricing, Gemini Ultra remains a powerful model, available via Vertex AI and AI Studio. It supports native image generation, a more integrated process than in models like ChatGPT, though this feature isn’t yet fully productized. Gemini Pro: Balancing Performance and Efficiency Gemini Pro , particularly the latest Gemini 2.0 Pro , excels in coding performance and handling complex prompts. As an experimental version, it may have occasional issues but outperforms its predecessor, Gemini 1.5 Pro, in coding, reasoning, math, and accuracy benchmarks. It boasts a large context window, handling up to 1.4 million words of input. Gemini 1.5 Pro still powers Google’s Deep Research feature. Gemini 2.0 Pro includes code execution to refine generated code iteratively. Developers can customize Gemini Pro via fine-tuning and connect it to external APIs for specific actions, leveraging AI Studio templates and Vertex AI Agent Builder to create custom AI agents. Gemini Flash: Speed and Efficiency for Agentic Applications Gemini Flash is designed for speed and efficiency, ideal for ‘agentic’ applications. It natively generates text, images, and audio, and can use tools like Google Search and external APIs. Gemini 2.0 Flash outperforms previous generations in speed and even some larger models in certain benchmarks. A ‘thinking’ version adds reasoning capabilities, working through problems before answering. Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite offers similar performance to Gemini 1.5 Flash but is smaller and faster. Gemini Flash is well-suited for summarization, chat apps, captioning, and data extraction. Developers can use context caching to store and quickly access large datasets, enhancing performance at an additional cost. Gemini Nano: On-Device AI Power Gemini Nano is designed for on-device processing on devices like Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Samsung Galaxy S24, powering features like Summarize in Recorder and Smart Reply in Gboard. The Recorder app provides Gemini-powered summaries offline, ensuring privacy. In Gboard, Gemini Nano enables Smart Reply and Magic Compose in Google Messages for contextual message suggestions and style variations. Future Android versions will use Gemini Nano for scam call alerts, tailored weather reports, and accessibility features like aural object descriptions via TalkBack. Understanding Gemini Model Costs: Is it Affordable? Gemini 1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash, and 2.0 Flash-Lite are accessible via Google’s Gemini API with free options, though these have usage limits and lack features like context caching. Paid usage is on a pay-as-you-go basis. Pricing varies by model and input/output tokens (units of data, roughly 700,000 words per million tokens). For example, Gemini 1.5 Pro starts at $1.25 per 1 million input tokens, while Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite is priced at 7.5 cents per million input tokens. Gemini 2.0 Pro pricing and Gemini Nano access are still to be fully announced. Project Astra: The Future of Real-Time Multimodal AI Project Astra represents Google DeepMind’s vision for real-time, multimodal AI agents. Demos showcase simultaneous live video and audio processing. An app version is being tested, and Google envisions integrating Project Astra into smart glasses for augmented reality applications. While still a project and not a product, Project Astra previews Google’s future AI ambitions. Gemini on iPhone? The Potential Apple Partnership Gemini might be coming to iPhones.

CEO: Legislation Key to Stablecoin Launch Moynihan emphasized that the move is contingent on regulatory approval, signaling that the bank is poised to enter the digital asset space once legal clarity is established. He said, “It’s pretty clear that there’s going to be a stablecoin, which is going to be fully dollar-backed. If they make that legal, we will go into that business.” The CEO hinted at the possibility of offering dollar-backed tokens tied to customer deposit accounts but did not elaborate on any specific product plans. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, have long been a topic of regulatory debate. Despite the dominance of private issuers such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), policymakers have hesitated to fully embrace them. Stablecoin Regulation Gains Momentum However, regulatory progress under the Trump administration may facilitate their integration into traditional banking. Several bills aiming to regulate stablecoins are currently under consideration, including the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2024, and the GENIUS stablecoin bill. In February 2025, Rep. Maxine Waters, a ranking member of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, urged bipartisan support for stablecoin regulation, favoring the bill drafted by former committee chairman Patrick McHenry in 2024. Senator Bill Hagerty’s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2024 builds upon McHenry’s bill by allowing stablecoin issuers with under $10 billion in market capitalization to be regulated at the state level rather than federally. This provision aims to ease entry barriers for smaller players while maintaining oversight for larger issuers. Banks Poised to Enter Stablecoin Market Regulators have increasingly acknowledged the role stablecoins can play in financial markets. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller voiced support for allowing banks to issue stablecoins, describing them as a potential game-changer for cross-border payments. At a February 12 conference, Waller claimed, “I am seeing a lot of new, private sector entrants looking to find ways to support the use of stablecoins for retail payments.” With their near-instant settlement capabilities and lower transaction costs, stablecoins are seen as a viable solution for remittances and international commerce. If banks like BoA enter the stablecoin market, it could signal a significant shift in mainstream financial institutions’ approach to digital assets, providing customers with a seamless bridge between traditional banking and blockchain technology.

40900111,https://zycrypto.com/?p=102874,1740641885,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,135 Solana Mega Whales Dump Holdings Amid Looming $2 Billion Token Unlock,https://zycrypto.com/135-solana-mega-whales-dump-holdings-amid-looming-2-billion-token-unlock/,"Solana (SOL) has continued to face selling pressure since reaching an all-time high of $295 in January, extending its decline this week. While broader market weakness, exacerbated by Bitcoin’s 11% drop in the past 24 hours, has fueled the pullback, additional factors like the recent meme coin frenzy and pump-and-dump schemes have further damaged Solana ‘s reputation. However, currently, the most pressing concern seems to be the imminent token unlock by FTX, which has raised fears of a major selloff as a large influx of SOL enters the market. On Tuesday, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a notable shift among large holders, tweeting that, “ 135 whales holding over 10,000 SOL have sold or redistributed their holdings in the past month.” This mass exit comes ahead of Solana’s largest-ever token unlock, set for March 1. This unlock will release 11.2 million SOL (worth nearly $2 billion), primarily from FTX’s bankruptcy estate. Messari data shows that over 97% of Solana tokens are unlocked. In February 2025, 9 million SOL entered circulation, marking a peak ahead of March. Future unlocks in April and July are relatively minor, making the upcoming FTX unlock the key event to watch. Analysts at XBT Research have cautioned that at $172 per SOL, the 11.2 million SOL unlock is valued at approximately $2.03 billion, representing 2.4% of the circulating supply. “Past unlocks showed holding behavior, but selling pressure could push prices down in the short term,” they tweeted . Furthermore, with major venture capital firms such as Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital, and Figure holding billions in unrealized gains, speculation is mounting that they may also liquidate part of their holdings. Just recently, Market maker Wintermute withdrew $38.2 million worth of SOL from Binance, further fueling concerns about potential sell-offs ahead of the unlock. Adding to the bearish outlook, meme coin scandals have further eroded confidence in the Solana network. The recent LIBRA token debacle, which involved allegations of insider trading and fraudulent schemes, has shaken investor trust. This uncertainty has already translated into capital outflows, with Solana’s MEME index posting a monthly decline of around -6%, according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode. Meanwhile, Solana’s network activity has plunged, with active addresses dropping 60%, from an all-time high of 18.5 million in October to just 7.3 million today, according to Glassnode. Despite concerns that the upcoming unlock could trigger a selloff, some traders view it as a buy-the-dip opportunity. “ SOL sentiment is the worst it has been in over a year since first reclaiming the $100 level,” analyst Miles Deutscher told his 600,000 X followers. However, he suggested a potential turnaround, stating, “After being a top performer for so long, it’s finally having its capitulation moment. I think we’re getting close now…” At press time, SOL was trading at $141, up 0.53% over the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-27 07:38:05

Forget the flashy launch events; this phone speaks for itself. While it might not scream ‘innovation’ from the rooftops, the iPhone 16e is a calculated move by Apple to deliver reliability and affordability, especially appealing in today’s economic climate. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy users who value both performance and value, let’s dive deep into what makes this budget-friendly iPhone tick and if it’s the smart choice for you. Decoding the Design: Is the iPhone 16e a Throwback or a Modern Marvel? At first glance, the iPhone 16e might seem like a familiar face. Borrowing design cues from the iPhone 13 and 14, it sports the classic notch, a comfortable size, and the handy Action button from the iPhone 15. However, don’t mistake familiarity for outdatedness. This design choice is a strategic move by Apple to keep costs down without sacrificing the premium feel. While it lacks the cutting-edge Camera Control of the iPhone 16 and the sleek Dynamic Island, the 16e presents itself as a ‘modern’ take on a proven form factor. It’s not trying to reinvent the wheel, but rather refine it for a broader audience. For users upgrading from older iPhones or switching from Android, the 16e offers a seamless transition into the Apple ecosystem without a jarring design overhaul. The Power Within: A18 Chip and Future-Proofing Your Investment Here’s where the iPhone 16e truly shines: under the hood, it packs the same powerful A18 chip found in the flagship iPhone 16. This is a game-changer for a phone in this price range. Why is this significant? Firstly, it makes the iPhone 16e the most affordable entry point to Apple’s top-tier silicon. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it ensures future-proofing. Apple’s commitment to supporting its chips means the A18 will enjoy software updates and feature enhancements for years to come, longer than the A16 chip in the iPhone 15. This future-proofing extends to Apple Intelligence , Apple’s ambitious generative AI platform. Previously limited to the iPhone 16 line and high-end iPhone 15 models, Apple Intelligence is now accessible on the iPhone 16e , unlocking a new realm of smart features for a wider user base. Key Specs Comparison: iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16 To better understand where the iPhone 16e fits, let’s compare its specifications with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16: Feature iPhone 16e iPhone 15 iPhone 16 Chip A18 A16 A18 Apple Intelligence Yes No (Limited) Yes Starting Price $599 $699 $799 Display 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR (Notch, 1200 nits) 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR (Dynamic Island, 2000 nits) 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR (Dynamic Island, 2000 nits) RAM 8GB 6GB 8GB Rear Camera Single 48MP (“2-in-1” System) Dual 48MP Main + 12MP Ultrawide Dual 48MP Main + 12MP Ultrawide MagSafe No Yes Yes Battery Life (Stated) 26 hours 20 hours 22 hours C1 Modem: An Unsung Hero for Battery Life While modems might not be the most glamorous component, the custom C1 modem in the iPhone 16e deserves a shout-out.

The C1 modem is not only power-efficient, contributing to the iPhone 16e’s exceptional battery life (longer than both the 15 and 16), but it’s also more compact. This space-saving design allowed Apple to incorporate a larger battery, further extending the phone’s usage time. For users constantly on the go, especially in the fast-paced crypto world, reliable battery life is invaluable, and the iPhone 16e delivers. Apple Intelligence on a Budget: Is it Worth it? Apple Intelligence is the headline feature Apple is betting on, and it’s now available on the iPhone 16e . Currently, it offers features like text rewriting, summaries, and generative image creation through Image Playground. While the current iteration of Apple Intelligence might seem basic to some, it’s crucial to remember that this is just the beginning. Apple is heavily investing in generative AI, and Apple Intelligence is poised to become a central part of the iPhone experience in the coming years. Having the A18 chip and 8GB of RAM in the iPhone 16e ensures you’re ready to take advantage of these future AI advancements. Visual Intelligence, Apple’s answer to Google Lens, is also present, adding another layer of smart functionality. Current Apple Intelligence Features: Text Rewrite: Refine your writing for clarity and tone. Summaries: Get quick digests of articles and documents. Generative Imagery (Image Playground): Create fun, AI-generated images. Visual Intelligence: Identify objects and text in your photos. Camera Compromises: Single Lens, Smart Photography To reach the $599 price point, some compromises were necessary, and the camera system is one area where the iPhone 16e differs significantly from its pricier siblings. Instead of a dual-camera setup, the iPhone 16e features a single 48-megapixel sensor. However, Apple cleverly markets this as a “2-in-1” camera system, leveraging computational photography to create a pseudo-telephoto effect. This “integrated telephoto” provides a zoomed-in, 12-megapixel version of your image without drastic quality loss. While you lose the versatility of a dedicated telephoto or ultrawide lens, the iPhone 16e still captures impressive photos for a single-sensor phone, representing a notable upgrade from previous iPhone SE models. For casual users and social media enthusiasts, the camera performance will likely be more than sufficient. However, photography enthusiasts might miss the flexibility of a multi-lens system. The Price Point Power Play: iPhone 16e and Market Dynamics The real star of the iPhone 16e show isn’t a groundbreaking feature, but the price. At $599, it’s $200 cheaper than the iPhone 16 and $100 less than the iPhone 15. This price reduction is strategically aimed at bolstering Apple’s presence in key markets like China and India, where price sensitivity is high and competition from domestic Android manufacturers is fierce. While a $100-$200 price difference might seem modest in developed markets, it’s significant in developing economies. The iPhone 16e aims to bridge the gap between affordability and the premium iPhone experience. However, the competitive landscape remains challenging, with older iPhone models like the 14 and 15 still available, and Android alternatives offering compelling value propositions. Making the Smart Choice: Is the iPhone 16e for You? Choosing the right iPhone in Apple’s current lineup requires careful consideration of your needs and priorities. The iPhone 16e is not a ‘budget’ phone in the traditional sense, but rather an ‘entry-level’ iPhone that prioritizes key features while making strategic compromises. If you crave the absolute latest and greatest, the iPhone 16 is still the top dog. If Apple Intelligence isn’t a major draw for you right now, the iPhone 15 remains a solid option. However, if you seek a balance of performance, future-proofing with Apple Intelligence , and affordability, the iPhone 16e emerges as a compelling choice. You sacrifice features like MagSafe, Dynamic Island, Camera Control, and a dual-camera system, but gain access to the powerful A18 chip and a longer-lasting battery at a significantly lower price. For many users, especially those mindful of their budget, the iPhone 16e strikes a sweet spot, delivering the core iPhone experience with smart compromises.

However, Cardano (ADA) price fortunately moved in investors’ favor in the past 24 hours. Ergo, let’s check other top cryptos, which have the potential to replicate a similar performance going forward. 3 Cryptos Investors Should Keep An Eye On! SUI Apart from Cardano price, SUI is among the handful of cryptos that managed a double-digit price uptick. To be precise, the SUI price today increased by more than 10%, making it trade at $2.95 with a market capitalization of over $9.1 billion. In fact, Coinglass’ data revealed that SUI’s long/short ratio increased in the 4-hour timeframe. This clearly suggested that there are more long positions in the market than short positions, which indicated a continued price rise in the coming days. If that happens, then SUI might target $3.5 next. Source: Coinglass Aureal One (DLUME) While Aureal One ‘s (DLUME) core fundamentals are different from Cardano price, it is still a good buy for those looking for a crypto with a strong infrastructure and reachable long-term goals. Currently available at a discount price of $0.0013, the Aureal One (DLUME) tokens present a good presale opportunity that could bestow upwards of a 300% gain even before the listing day arrives. With the creation of the world’s first metaverse blockchain, the ambitious project may be able to capitalize on the momentum of metaverse cryptocurrencies, which are expected to make a resurgence as soon as the market begins to show signs of stability. Thanks to its gaming qualities, it may chart upwards by more than four times upon listing, and the fact that Aureal One appears to be taking a game-first approach opens the door for gaming influencers to come and promote the project. Hedera (HBAR) Like Cardano price, Hedera (HBAR) price also turned bullish in the last 24 hours as its value pumped by over 2% during that period. At the time of writing, HBAR price is at $0.20 with a market capitalization of over $8.4 billion, making it the 18th largest crypto. The better news is that while HBAR price surged, its open intesterst also spiked. Whenever that happens, it indicates that the chances of the ongoing price trend continuing are high. This sets the stage for HBAR touching $0.3 i the short term, if the bulls manage to maintain their dominance in the market. Source: Santiment Final Words Cardano’s (ADA) price surge has sparked optimism in the crypto market. Alongside ADA, cryptos like SUI, Aureal One (DLUME), and Hedera (HBAR) show strong potential for gains. With ADA currently trading at $0.65, investors should closely monitor these promising assets for similar upward momentum in the coming days.

John Reed Stark, who previously served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement, suggested on X that the SEC is on track to drop its appeal in the XRP lawsuit, adding Ripple to a growing list of firms that have escaped the regulator’s scrutiny for now. SEC Softening Crypto Stance The SEC is rolling back its hostile crypto enforcement campaign that defined the Gary Gensler era. During Gensler’s reign, the SEC has issued Wells Notices to multiple firms, including online brokerage Robinhood, Uniswap Labs, and NFT marketplace OpenSea. The former SEC chairman’s actions stifled innovation and drove talent away from the sector by refusing to formulate rules before it brought an enforcement action. But in a dramatic turn of events, the SEC recently closed its case against leading crypto exchange Coinbase, the exchange was accused of operating as an unregistered securities broker. Similarly, the regulator has since dropped its probe into Gemini, Uniswap Labs, Robinhood Crypto, and OpenSea. Earlier this month, a federal judge granted a joint request by the SEC and the crypto giant Binance to pause proceedings for 60 days . And more recently, the SEC and controversial Tron founder Justin Sun are looking into potentially resolving their lawsuit, according to a Wednesday joint motion. Stark suggested that, with the top securities watchdog having dropped a slew of probes recently, the dismissal of the ongoing Ripple appeal is next. In his opinion, these shifts mark a notable regulatory realignment after years of what many characterized as “regulation by enforcement” under the previous Gensler leadership. https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1894717997467484384 These developments align with President Trump’s stated ambition to position the United States as the world’s crypto capital, nominating and appointing crypto-friendly public servants to his government. Gensler departed the same day that the president started his second presidential term. Pro-Crypto Mark Uyeda was appointed to temporarily lead the SEC after the anti-crypto former chair’s exit. Trump has nominated former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to run the SEC on a long-term basis. However, it is unclear when Atkins’ appointment will be confirmed by the Senate.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|XRP|UNI|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-27 07:42:09

TADA, the innovative blockchain-based ride-hailing app, is making waves as it announces its ambitious expansion into the U.S. market. Starting with Denver, Colorado, this move promises to bring a fresh, transparent, and potentially more rewarding experience for both riders and drivers. But what exactly does a blockchain-powered ride-hailing app mean for you, and why is this expansion a game-changer in the world of cryptocurrency and mobility? Unveiling TADA: The Blockchain Ride-Hailing Revolution TADA isn’t just another ride-hailing app; it’s a brainchild of MVL (Mass Vehicle Ledger), a blockchain mobility platform aiming to build a transparent and efficient ecosystem for the transportation industry. Founded by Kay Woo, TADA has already established a presence in Southeast Asia, and now, it’s setting its sights on the competitive U.S. market. The core difference lies in its foundation: blockchain technology . But how does this technology actually transform the ride-hailing experience? Let’s break down the key aspects of TADA and its blockchain underpinnings: Transparency and Trust: Blockchain’s decentralized and immutable nature brings a new level of transparency to the ride-hailing industry. Transactions, fare calculations, and even driver-rider interactions can be recorded on the blockchain, fostering greater trust and accountability. Fairer Ecosystem: Traditional ride-hailing platforms often face criticism regarding commission structures and driver earnings. TADA aims to address this by potentially offering a fairer revenue split for drivers, leveraging blockchain to streamline payments and reduce intermediary fees. Data Privacy and Security: In an era of increasing data privacy concerns, blockchain can offer enhanced security and control over user data. TADA’s use of blockchain may empower users with more ownership and transparency regarding their personal information. Community-Driven Growth: Some blockchain-based platforms explore tokenomics and reward systems to incentivize participation and loyalty from both riders and drivers. While specific details of TADA’s tokenomics in the US are yet to be fully revealed, the potential for community-driven growth is a significant differentiator. Why Denver? TADA’s Strategic Entry into the US Market Choosing Denver, Colorado, as the launchpad for its US market expansion is a strategic move by TADA. Denver presents a unique blend of factors that make it an attractive starting point: Tech-Savvy Population: Denver boasts a growing tech industry and a population that is generally receptive to new technologies and innovations, including blockchain and cryptocurrency. This early adopter mindset can be crucial for the initial success of TADA. Competitive Ride-Hailing Landscape: While Denver is served by major ride-hailing players, it’s not as saturated as markets like New York or San Francisco. This provides TADA with an opportunity to establish a foothold and differentiate itself. Regulatory Environment: Colorado has shown a relatively progressive stance towards blockchain and cryptocurrency, which could be beneficial for TADA’s operations and growth. Growing City: Denver is experiencing significant population growth and economic development, leading to increased demand for transportation services. By starting in Denver, TADA can test its model, gather user feedback, and refine its operations before expanding to larger, more competitive US cities. This measured approach reduces risk and allows for strategic adaptation to the nuances of the American market. The Allure of Blockchain in Ride-Hailing: What are the Benefits? Why should riders and drivers be excited about a blockchain ride-hailing app like TADA? The integration of blockchain technology promises a range of potential advantages that could reshape the ride-hailing experience: Benefit Description Impact on Riders Impact on Drivers Lower Fees & Fares Reduced intermediary fees due to blockchain’s efficiency can translate to lower fares for riders and higher earnings for drivers. Potentially cheaper rides compared to traditional platforms. Potential for higher take-home pay per ride. Increased Transparency Blockchain records provide verifiable data on transactions, fare calculations, and commissions, fostering trust. Greater clarity on fare breakdowns and platform charges. Clearer understanding of commission structures and earnings. Faster Payments Blockchain can enable faster and more efficient payment processing for drivers. Payment processes remain largely unchanged for riders. Quicker access to earnings after completing rides. Data Security & Privacy Blockchain’s security features can enhance the protection of user data and potentially offer greater control over personal information. Increased confidence in data privacy and security. Enhanced security for personal and financial information. Community Incentives Tokenomics and reward systems can incentivize loyalty and participation, potentially creating a more engaged community. Potential for rewards and benefits through platform tokens. Opportunities to earn platform tokens and participate in the ecosystem. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges for TADA in the US Market While TADA’s cryptocurrency -powered ride-hailing concept is exciting, entering the US market is not without its hurdles. Several challenges await TADA as it embarks on this expansion journey: Competition: The US ride-hailing market is dominated by giants like Uber and Lyft, who have established brand recognition, vast networks, and significant resources. TADA will need to effectively differentiate itself and build a compelling value proposition to attract riders and drivers. Regulatory Landscape: Ride-hailing regulations vary across different US states and cities. TADA will need to navigate this complex regulatory environment and ensure compliance in each location it operates. Furthermore, regulations surrounding cryptocurrency and blockchain are still evolving, which could present additional complexities. User Adoption: Educating users about the benefits of blockchain in ride-hailing and convincing them to switch from established platforms will be crucial. Overcoming user inertia and building trust in a new brand will require effective marketing and user experience. Driver Acquisition: Attracting and retaining drivers is essential for any ride-hailing platform. TADA will need to offer competitive incentives and a positive driver experience to build a reliable driver network in Denver and beyond. Scalability and Infrastructure: Ensuring the platform can handle the demands of a growing user base and maintain smooth operations as it expands across the US is a critical technical challenge. Actionable Insights: What to Expect from TADA’s US Debut For those in Denver and the broader US market, TADA’s arrival presents an interesting development in the ride-hailing space. Here’s what you can anticipate: Potential for Competitive Pricing: TADA’s blockchain-based model could lead to more competitive fares, potentially benefiting riders’ wallets. Keep an eye out for introductory offers and pricing strategies as they launch. Focus on Driver Empowerment: Drivers might find TADA an attractive alternative if it delivers on its promise of fairer commissions and faster payments. This could lead to a more motivated and satisfied driver pool. Innovation in Mobility: TADA’s expansion could spur further innovation in the ride-hailing industry, pushing established players to explore blockchain and other technologies to enhance their services. Learning and Adaptation: The initial phase in Denver will be crucial for TADA to learn about the US market, adapt its platform, and refine its strategies for future expansion. User feedback and market response will shape its trajectory. Conclusion: Is Blockchain Ride-Hailing the Future? TADA’s blockchain ride-hailing app venturing into the US market marks a significant moment in the intersection of cryptocurrency and the transportation industry. While challenges undoubtedly lie ahead, the potential benefits of transparency, fairer ecosystems, and enhanced data security are compelling. Denver will serve as the testing ground for this innovative approach, and its success or failures will offer valuable insights into the future of blockchain applications in mobility. Whether TADA will disrupt the ride-hailing giants remains to be seen, but its bold move is sure to inject fresh competition and innovation into the market, ultimately benefiting both riders and drivers.

40900104,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134739,1740642355,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Shocking Bitcoin Panic Selling Exposes Investor Inexperience, Warns CryptoQuant CEO",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-panic-selling-investor-inexperience/,"Is the recent Bitcoin dip making your hands tremble over the ‘sell’ button? You’re not alone. The crypto market can be a rollercoaster, and when Bitcoin (BTC) takes a tumble, it’s easy to feel the urge to jump ship. However, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has a stark message for those engaging in Bitcoin panic selling : it’s a sign of inexperience, and it could be costing you dearly. Decoding Bitcoin Panic Selling: Why It Signals Investor Inexperience Ki Young Ju recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his insights on the recent market behavior. His core observation? The wave of Bitcoin panic selling witnessed during the recent 30% correction isn’t a healthy market reaction; it’s a telltale sign of novice investors making emotional decisions rather than strategic moves. He points to historical data to back up his claim. Remember the 2021 crash? Bitcoin plummeted by a significant 53%. Many likely sold then in fear, only to watch Bitcoin not just recover, but surge to new all-time highs. This historical precedent underscores a crucial lesson: short-term volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and reacting impulsively can be detrimental. Here’s a breakdown of why Bitcoin panic selling is often linked to inexperience: Lack of Long-Term Perspective: New investors often focus on short-term price fluctuations, reacting to immediate losses without considering the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the crypto market. Emotional Decision Making: Fear and greed are powerful emotions in investing. Inexperienced investors are more prone to letting these emotions dictate their actions, leading to panic selling when prices drop. Absence of a Defined Strategy: Without a clear investment plan, it’s easy to get swayed by market noise and react impulsively to price dips. Limited Understanding of Market Cycles: Experienced crypto investors understand that market corrections are a natural part of the cycle. They often see dips as buying opportunities rather than reasons to sell. The Perils of Buying High and Selling Low: A Recipe for Disaster in the Crypto Market Ki Young Ju didn’t just highlight the problem; he pinpointed the root cause of financial losses for many crypto newcomers. He bluntly stated that “buying when everyone is euphoric and selling when everyone is in despair is the worst investment strategy.” This seemingly simple statement is packed with wisdom. It’s human nature to get caught up in the hype and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during price surges. Conversely, during market downturns, fear takes over, leading to panic selling. This buy-high-sell-low cycle is a surefire way to deplete your investment capital, not grow it. It’s especially dangerous in the volatile crypto market correction environment. Consider this table to understand the emotional investing trap: Market Sentiment Typical Inexperienced Investor Action Strategic Investor Action Euphoria (Price Surge) Buy impulsively due to FOMO Exercise caution, assess valuation Fear (Price Drop) Panic sell to cut losses Hold, or strategically buy more Navigating Crypto Market Correction: The Power of a Plan So, what’s the antidote to Bitcoin panic selling and the buy-high-sell-low trap? According to Ki Young Ju, it’s having a clear, well-defined investment plan. This isn’t just generic financial advice; it’s particularly crucial in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. A plan provides a roadmap, guiding your decisions even when emotions run high. It helps you differentiate between temporary market noise and fundamental shifts in the asset’s long-term prospects. What should a robust crypto investment plan include? Define Your Investment Goals: Are you investing for short-term gains, long-term wealth accumulation, or something else? Your goals will dictate your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Risk Management Strategy: Determine how much capital you’re willing to risk and implement strategies like diversification and stop-loss orders (use with caution and understanding). Due Diligence and Research: Understand the assets you’re investing in. Don’t just follow hype; research the technology, team, and use cases. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider DCA, especially for volatile assets like Bitcoin. Invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, to smooth out entry points. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of your investments rather than reacting to short-term price swings. Regular Review and Adjustment: Your plan isn’t set in stone. Periodically review and adjust it based on market changes and your evolving financial situation. CryptoQuant CEO’s Wisdom: Actionable Insights for Every Crypto Investor Ki Young Ju’s statement isn’t just a critique of Bitcoin panic selling ; it’s a valuable lesson for anyone navigating the crypto space. His experience and data-driven approach provide actionable insights that can significantly improve your investment outcomes. Here are key takeaways from CryptoQuant CEO’s message: Embrace Market Volatility: Understand that price corrections are a normal part of the crypto market cycle. Don’t panic sell during dips. Develop a Strategic Plan: Create a comprehensive investment plan that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Resist Emotional Investing: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed. Stick to your plan. Learn from Market History: Study past market cycles to gain perspective and understand that corrections are often followed by recoveries and new highs. Focus on Long-Term Value: Invest in projects with strong fundamentals and long-term potential, rather than chasing short-term hype. Conclusion: From Panic to Plan – Mastering the Crypto Market In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin panic selling episode serves as a stark reminder of the importance of investor education and strategic planning in the crypto market. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s insights highlight that reacting emotionally to market downturns is a hallmark of inexperience and a recipe for financial setbacks. By adopting a long-term perspective, developing a robust investment plan, and resisting the urge to panic sell, you can navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence and potentially achieve more favorable investment outcomes. Remember, in the world of crypto, patience and strategy often trump impulsive reactions.

The latest burn metrics signaled that over 30 million tokens were sacked from the asset’s circulating supply, resulting in a 1300% uptick. Meanwhile, with a top crypto market analyst further highlighting the chances of a potential 450% pump in SHIB price amid the burn rate surge, market sentiments have shifted to bullish. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyshots 1300%: What This Means? As per data from the official tracker Shibburn on X , Shiba Inu burn rate spiked 1306% on February 27. This colossal upswing comes against the backdrop of 30.15 million tokens ditched from the crypto’s circulating supply in a day. Source: Shibburn official site For context, the meme coin’s burn mechanism focuses on sending tokens to a null address. This phenomenon makes their retrieval impossible, thereby killing the supply and bolstering tokenomics. How Many Tokens Burned To Date? As an upshot, market watchers reflect substantial optimism surrounding SHIB price prospects, given a whopping 410.744 trillion coins have burned to date. The circulating supply as of press time totaled 584.32 trillion tokens. It’s also noteworthy that 257.65 million tokens were burned this month (February), per Shiba burn statistics. As a response, traders and investors reflect considerable bullishness surrounding the meme coin’s price despite the ongoing crypto market blues . Source: Shiba Burn Tracker site Can Shiba Inu Price Hit $0.000081? As of press time, Shiba Inu’s value today witnessed a 3% jump and exchanged hands at $0.00001469. The coin hit an intraday bottom and peak of $0.00001377 and $0.0000147, respectively. Intriguingly, the Shiba Inu burn rate surge appears to be aiding the meme coin in outperforming BTC and ETH amid broader market volatility, as also spotlighted by community member SHIB KNIGHT on X. While Bitcoin & Ethereum witnessed alarming dips amid Donald Trump’s new EU tariffs, the Ethereum-based meme token jumped. Source: SHIB KNIGHT, X Further, renowned market analyst Javon Marks also took to X, citing bullish historical trends that indicate gains ahead. The analyst reveals that SHIB price continues to hold its breakout, which took place in late 2022/early 2023. “With this price breakout holding, the target for Shib continues to be at the $0.000081 point, which is currently over 450% away,” the analyst concluded. Overall, market watchers remain highly bullish surrounding the meme coin’s long term prospects, given the abovementioned market statistics.

One such victim is this crypto trader/whale, facing an unrealized loss of $17.5M on leverage position in various cryptocurrencies. However, that is not all, as the struggling Bitcoin (BTC) performance is putting it at higher risk, where if the price drops to $74k, the trader’s loss will exceed $25M. Crypto Trader Portfolio in Jeopardy, Loses $17.5M in Crypto Market Crash According to the on-chain analytic platform Lookononchain X post , the crypto trader faces an unrealized loss of $17.5M, consisting of multiple leverage positions on various cryptocurrencies. This includes the millions of losses on BTC, SOL, HYPE, ONDO, HBAR, SUI, and TRUMP tokens. In this, the largest loss is on the BTC and SOL amid the crypto market crash . The trader went for a $23.69M position on Bitcoin, with an entry price of $102,079.2, with a 10x leverage. In the case of Solana, the trade went for a $6.15M position, 20x leverage at the entry of $235.18, facing massive declines due to exposure to leverage positions in unfavorable scenarios. With a few more such positions, the trader bears a staggering $17.5M in unrealized losses, which could worsen with a further price crash. Crypto Trader To Lose $25M If Bitcoin Price Crashed to $74K Amid the crypto market’s downturn, Bitcoin has been affected severely, trading at $86k after a 3% drop in the last 24 hours and 11% over the week. More importantly, the BTC price crashed to $82k earlier, bringing fearful sentiments among investors. If the downtrend continues and the Bitcoin price crashes to 74k, this crypto whale could lose $25M as it is dangerously close to massive liquidation with a margin usage at 80.92%. As the trader’s perp equity is the total balance, the loss would come to $25M ($17.5M + $7.4M). However, if the BTC’s value remained maintained at the current level or increased, this cascading liquidation would not occur. Instead, if the price increased, the trader would make millions in profit. What’s Next For this Crypto Whale? The current market situation shows high volatility, with investors’ sentiments indicating a bear’s dominance. This crypto investor’s fate entirely depends on Bitcoin’s next move. A crash would result in a massive $25M loss. Some Bitcoin price predictions show signs of a further crash to $70k, increasing the possibility of liquidation. However, things could take a different turn, as some analysts believe the price will rebound above $100k. For now, it is uncertain whether the whale will face further liquidation or profits. Bottom Line The aforementioned crypto trader and its massive liquidation loss reveal the risk of excessive leverage. In this crypto market, unpredictability can divert everything from millions in losses to millions in profits or vice versa. The trader could lose $25M altogether if the BTC price dropped to $74K. However, in contrast if the price increases, the crypto whale could earn millions in losses.

It just flipped a key level following an insane gain overnight. QNT’s retracement remains bearish in the short term, but the crypto landscape is slowly changing to the upside since it mounted support above the $84 level. The bulls are now stepping back in action as the demand level has risen in the last 24 hours. This latest surge was triggered by a bounce off the $72.7 level earlier this month, and from the look of things, the trend will likely go in favour of the bulls soon following a trend reversal formation on the daily chart. While several altcoins are still struggling to bounce back from their recent lows, it just signalled bullish with a strong surge above the key $100 level. The price is now approaching $110 at the time of writing. If the price stays well above the mentioned key level for the rest of this week, we can anticipate a big price movement in the coming week. And if that happens, we may see trading back above the $150 level that broke in December. This should trigger a strong bullish bias. But right now, the bulls are in control on a daily scale. QNT’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview There’s a close resistance level at $110. If the price flips through it, we can expect further buying to the $124 resistance. Above it lies the $147 level and $171.7 in case of more increases. Aside from the recently flipped $96.2 level, which is now considered as support, there’s also support at the $84 level. A drop there could slide the price back to $72.7.

At one point, the price even reached as high as $3, marking a new all-time high. Some experts believe that the price could touch $4 in the near future. However, certain technical indicators suggest that the possibility of a sharp correction in the Pi market cannot be completely ruled out. Let’s examine the scenario deeper! Pi Network’s Price Surge & Market Performance At the start of February 20, the PI price was around $0.1008. On the first day of the launch , the PI market witnessed an impressive single-day growth of 765.87%. On the same day, the market touched a peak of $2.208. On the second day, probably due to the aggressive profit-taking action by the early investors of Pi Network, the market experienced a small correction of 17.55%. Although between February 22 and 25, the market recorded a growth of 121.94%, it failed to break above the Feb 20 ATH during the period. Yesterday, with a strong single-day growth of 76.01%, the market broke above the Feb 20 peak, and it marked a new ATH of $3. DMI Indicator Signals a Strong Bullish Trend The Directional Movement Index indicator on the four-hour chart of Pi Network shows that the ADX value of the market stands at 59, +DI at 36.88 and -DI at 5.92. The indicator suggests that the market is currently supported by a very strong uptrend. DMI is a technical indicator used in crypto trading to measure trend strength and direction. It consists of three primary components: Average Directional Index (which measures the strength of a trend), Positive Directional Index (which shows buying pressure) and Negative Directional Index (which shows selling pressure). BBTrends Signals Possible Correction Ahead The BBTrend reading on the two-day chart of Pi Network remains at -9.1491. Notably, at one point on February 24, it was above 50. What this indicator actually measures is the price movement of an asset relative to Bollinger Bands . The sharp drop, which usually happens when the price is overextended, suggests that the Pi network could experience a severe correction or consolidation in the near future. The Bollinger Band indicator on the two-day chart of PI shows that the upper band of the asset remains at $3.1846, the baseline at $2.1894 and the lower at $1.1936. Currently, the PI price stands at $2.5799. Key Price Levels: What to Watch Next in Pi Network? Experts predict that if the PI market continues its strong upward momentum and breaks above the $3.5 psychological barrier, it could reach a new peak of $4. However, experts warn that if the BBTrend technical signal materialises into the PI market price action, it could push the price of PI to a low of $1.7. Experts also add that if the market experiences strong downward pressure, the PI price could even slip to a low of $0.79.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-27 07:54:55

NPEX, Dusk, and Cordial Systems: Pioneering Blockchain-Powered Trading NPEX, a licensed stock exchange operating a multilateral trading facility (MTF) in the Netherlands, is integrating with the Dusk blockchain to facilitate the issuance, trading, and tokenization of regulated financial instruments. This integration enables both primary and secondary market trading, unlocking new efficiencies and liquidity. Mark van der Plas, NPEX CEO shared “Working with Cordial Systems is great for all of us. Partners like Cordial make it possible for us to integrate DLTs, provide classic assets on-chain, and drive innovation in a highly regulated sector”. To facilitate seamless post-trade processes, NPEX will leverage Cordial Systems’ Cordial Treasury, a self-hosted wallet technology that enables financial institutions to maintain full control over their technology stack. By avoiding reliance on black-box SaaS solutions, NPEX ensures regulatory compliance and operational security. Additionally, Cordial’s rapid blockchain integration capabilities enabled a smooth connection with the approved Dusk Layer 1 blockchain. Cordial Systems: A Proven Leader in Tokenization Cordial Systems is an established participant in the tokenization ecosystem, working alongside Figure Markets and its parent company, Figure.com, which has originated $20 billion in private credit on-chain. For NPEX, Cordial Treasury was a strategic choice, providing seamless deployment and comprehensive on-premise functionality. Cordial Systems’ CEO, Nicolas Stalder, said “Regulated financial institutions require full control over their digital asset custody, and NPEX’s adoption of Cordial Treasury showcases how a self-hosted, on-premise digital asset custody solution can seamlessly support blockchain-powered market infrastructure. We’re excited to support this milestone in bringing tokenized financial instruments to European markets.” This partnership also benefits Cordial’s existing client base, who now gain access to hold and transfer assets on the Dusk network. Dusk Unveils Decentralized Institution-Grade Custody Dusk is proud to announce the launch of Dusk Vault, the first digital asset custody service with multiple licensed financial institutions, including European banks, centralized crypto exchanges, and NPEX as a traditional exchange, participating as infrastructure partners and clients. This new service will provide unparalleled security, compliance, and decentralization, ensuring seamless institutional onboarding. Emanuele Francioni, Dusk CEO added ""We are thrilled to join forces with Cordial Systems. A blockchain-powered financial system requires partners of the highest caliber, and through their custody solution we are able to serve clients, drive innovation, and bridge the gap between traditional finance and DLTs”. Expanding its capabilities, Dusk will also introduce custody for all digital assets, covering both cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities and commodities. This innovation will significantly simplify the onboarding of Dusk assets onto both crypto-native and regulated exchanges, including the DUSK token itself and Zedger. A New Era for On-Chain Finance On-chain financing continues to expand in 2025, driven by the increasing adoption of tokenized money market funds and stablecoins. As financial institutions integrate blockchain technology, NPEX, Cordial Systems, and Dusk are positioned to support the growth of regulated digital asset markets.

40900572,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=703365,1740643234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40900572.jpeg,Bitcoin Faces Critical Test as Retail Demand Hits Resistance Levels,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-faces-critical-test-as-retail-demand-hits-resistance-levels/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading just below $88,000, a significant drop from its all-time high of $109,000 earlier this year. Over the past month, the leading cryptocurrency has faced a steady decline, slipping nearly 15% and showing limited signs of a rebound. While this bearish trend has many investors concerned, one CryptoQuant analyst, BilalHuseynov, recently shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s current state using the Retail Investor Demand (RID) indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Levels Return to Neutral Zone—What Next? Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand at a Crossroads BilalHuseynov’s analysis focused on Retail Investor Demand (RID). This metric, which gauges retail interest and activity in Bitcoin, can often provide insight into potential price movements. According to the analyst, retail investor demand recently faced resistance near the neutral zone of around 0%. Back in mid-February, the RID indicator attempted to cross this threshold but fell short, resulting in Bitcoin’s decline to the current $88,000 level. However, despite this setback, there are positive signs. The analyst noted that the RID is beginning to pick up again, a pattern reminiscent of June 2021 when Bitcoin saw a swift recovery after a similar dip. However, for the metric to truly signal a positive turn, it would need to rise above the 0% neutral zone, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. BilalHuseynov further elaborates on how the RID metric can guide long-term analysis. He identifies three key levels: • Negative (-15%): A strong indicator to watch for buying opportunities. • Neutral (0%): A sign that the market might be preparing for movements in either direction. • Positive (15%): Suggests that Bitcoin’s price has entered a “premium area,” often seen during bull markets. The analyst gave an example, highlighting that in October 2024, a surge above the 0% neutral zone coincided with Bitcoin reaching its all-time high. Conversely, a dip back to 0% in late 2024 marked the onset of a bearish phase. Currently, the RID sits at a critical juncture, and a shift in retail demand could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months. Short-Term Indicators Point to Potential Rebound Opportunities Meanwhile, other analysts are identifying short-term buying opportunities based on different metrics. Yonsei Dent, another CryptoQuant analyst, pointed to the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for Bitcoin’s short-term holders (STH). This metric, which measures whether short-term holders are selling at a profit or a loss, has recently dropped to levels that historically have indicated oversold conditions. According to Dent, applying Bollinger Bands to the STH-SOPR helps pinpoint extreme deviations, and the current data shows a pattern similar to previous market bottoms. Dent noted that each significant downside deviation in STH-SOPR has been followed by a short-term rebound ranging from +8% to as much as +42%, even during bear market conditions.

The BitMEX founder says on the social media platform X that it’s currently time to “chill out, retrace and wait.” “If Trump can’t pass his budget which spends more and hikes debt ceiling, resume capitulation to levels pre the election day victory: $75,000 to $70,000. This is test of how strong Trump’s hold is on the Republican party.” Source: Arthur Hayes/X Hayes also suggests that a lot of the hedge funds that bought BlackRock’s iShares (IBIT) spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could sell soon if BTC’s price keeps dropping. “Bitcoin goblin town incoming: Lots of IBIT holders are hedge funds that went long ETF short CME future to earn a yield greater than where they fund, short-term US treasuries. If that basis drops as BTC falls, then these funds will sell IBIT and buy back CME futures. These funds are in profit, and given basis is close to UST yields they will unwind during US hours and realize their profit. $70,000 I see you mofo!” Source: Arthur Hayes/X BTC is trading at $84,498 at time of writing.

While the market looks a bit green today as altcoins recover, it has posted huge gains, making it the top gain in the last 24 hours. Following the recent trend shift, MKR had an impressive run last week, breaking above the $1k level after facing a lot of hurdles. The market became highly volatile and later closed well around $1.6k after a rejection. This led to a pullback, and the price dropped to $1,337. Volatility enhanced again and the price increased, but the $1.7k level posed a threat today, suppressing further bullish rally. It paused buying a bit and retraced to where it’s priced at $1,688. Looking at the market structure, this recovery looks like a bullish V-shaped pattern on the daily chart but as we can see, it is yet to complete at the $2,400 level, where it lost momentum two months ago. So far, MKR has seen significant growth from its recent low following a back-to-back gain in the past two weeks. A full recovery to the top should complete the V-shaped pattern before exploding massively to a new high. Maker’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the price sits above $1.6k, the immediate resistance level for a test is $1,894. If this resistance flips, the next important level to keep in mind is $2k before reclaiming the $2,400 resistance. In case of a drop, the nearest support level to watch for a test is $1,337. Right below this level lies $1,204. If they fail to provide a bounce, it may navigate the $1,035 level for support.

Bitcoin price lost 16% over the last 30 days while declining 11% in a week. Besides, it bleed nearly 20% from its recent ATH of $109,114.88.

A flurry of market pundits also sees this latest Bitcoin price plunge as a healthy correction, which might attract more investors to enter at a lower price. For context, in a recent X post, renowned market expert Michael van de Poppe said that BTC must hold the $87K mark for a strong recovery. However, he also noted that failing to hold this level could trigger a massive selloff which might drive the BTC price to $70K. Despite that, Poppe noted that the Bitcoin price correction is “great” for the investors to buy at a “25% discount from the recent high.” Source: Michael van de Poppe, X Bitcoin Price To $70K Imminent? It’s difficult to precisely predict how low can Bitcoin price go if the bears continue to dominate. However, as per the market trends and experts’ comments, it appears that BTC might find its next support at nearly $70,000. Having said that, it is very likely that the crypto might slip to the level ahead. Meanwhile, echoing a similar sentiment to Michael van de Poppe, another expert Ali Martinez recently said that BTC below the $93,198 mark will find its support at $70,440. Considering that, it seems that Bitcoin price might slip to the 70 territory if the investors continue to stay in the sideline. Source: Ali Martinez, X Simultaneously, a recent BTC price prediction also hints at a correction to $70K by the year-end. So, investors might trade cautiously amid the volatile market scenario. But what if the flagship crypto starts recovering? BTC Recovery Possible? Here Are The Price Levels To Watch Then Despite the recent market downturn, experts remain optimistic about Bitcoin price’s long-term prospects. Analyst Rekt Capital notes that Bitcoin is closing in on filling the CME Gap created between $78,000 and $80,700 in November 2024. Additionally, a new CME Gap has formed between $92,700 and $94,000, which could lead to a relief rally and a potential revisit of the $93,500 price point. Source: Rekt Capital, X Other experts, like Rose Premium Signals, predict even more ambitious targets for BTC price, with a potential long-term price of $130,000. With Bitcoin having filled nearly every CME Gap since mid-March 2024, a price recovery may be on the horizon. As the market watches for signs of a turnaround, investors remain hopeful that Bitcoin will regain its upward momentum.

With the upcoming launch of sBTC Cap-2, Stacks will increase its capacity to support 3,000 BTC — a significant stretch for the ecosystem as it pushes to create a seamless bridge between Bitcoin and the world of decentralized finance, or DeFi. When you consider the exciting features that the live sBTC Cap-2 access will enable as part of the user experience in the Stacks ecosystem, the launch seems likely to boost the bridge-building operation. Opening Deposits for sBTC Cap-2 sBTC Cap-2’s launch is set to significantly increase Bitcoin liquidity. On top of the initial reserves of $BTC, we are now providing an additional 2,000 $BTC for sBTC users. Starting at 10 AM ET, these will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, with a minimum requirement of 0.01 $BTC to participate in this event. Users of Stacks can then use the asset sBTC, which is 1:1 pegged to Bitcoin, to participate in decentralized finance on that layer 2 ecosystem. This means, in effect, that while using sBTC for DeFi systems on Stacks, users have access to a Bitcoin-holding asset. The crucial thing is that launching sBTC Cap-2 will give Bitcoin holders a way to dip their toes into the decentralized finance world while still enjoying the protection and hashing power that comes from holding Bitcoin. Withdrawals of sBTC are expected to start in March 2025, which means you’re free to go fishing in the DeFi sea for roughly a year and a half and still have time to come back and get your sBTC before the supply that’s not locked up runs out. sBTC: A 1:1 Bitcoin-Backed Asset for DeFi sBTC is a breakthrough in combining Bitcoin’s unrivaled security with the opportunities provided by decentralized finance protocols. As a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset, sBTC enables an easy, secure way for users to engage with DeFi in the Stacks ecosystem. Right now, the total annualized yield on sBTC is around 5%. And that’s income paid out as Bitcoin. If you’re a Stacks user, then you’re likely earning passive income through the DeFi protocol that we call the Stacks ecosystem. What distinguishes sBTC from other Bitcoin-derived assets is its unique incorporation of Bitcoin’s native hash power. This guarantees, in a manner altogether different from how other assets tethered to Bitcoin accomplish the same end, that sBTC is not only secure but also reliable. This is to say that, as with Bitcoin itself, users can interact with sBTC in decentralized, trustless fashion—that is, without needing to place trust in any other entity. When it comes to sBTC, all the relevant entities are decentralized and should be considered trustworthy. DeFi Protocols and Opportunities on Stacks Users and developers have noticed that Stacks has now set its sights on DeFi. With the launch of sBTC Cap-2, Stacks is offering users the chance to connect with some of the most exciting DeFi projects around. Users can now engage with almost every DeFi protocol on our platform. You can lend, borrow, and stake with the sBTC; and do you know what? You can earn way more than in those “old, boring, yield-less” buckets that TradFi calls financial products. Several leading DeFi protocols on Stacks have already incorporated sBTC, giving users a diverse array of choices for putting their Bitcoin-secured assets to work. Some of the principal protocols that back sBTC are: – ZestProtocol: A decentralized yield generation and liquidity platform. – Bitflow Finance: A DeFi protocol offering easy access to liquidity and yield opportunities. – VelarBTC: A DeFi protocol dedicated to decentralized lending and liquidity markets backed by Bitcoin. – Arkadiko Finance: A lending and borrowing platform in the Stacks ecosystem. – ALEXLabBTC: A protocol for staking and managing Bitcoin-backed assets. @Stacks is set to launch sBTC Cap-2, increasing its capacity by 2,000 $BTC to a total of 3,000 $BTC . Deposits, with a minimum of 0.01 $BTC , will open at 10 AM ET on a first-come, first-served basis, while withdrawals are anticipated in March 2025. sBTC is a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed… pic.twitter.com/Fi51N13EMp — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) February 25, 2025 Each of these eight entities is an accelerator of a new kind of tokenomics—that is, a kind of economics revolving around blockchain tokens. Only a few of the numerous opportunities that exist for users wanting to unleash the full potential of their Bitcoin holdings are represented by these platforms. Stacks has hinted at some additional announcements coming soon, with more decentralized finance protocols set to join the ecosystem and continue to push the possibilities for Bitcoin users in the DeFi space. A Decentralized Future for Bitcoin Liquidity While sBTC Cap-2 represents a major advance in integrating Bitcoin into DeFi, the Stacks team has truly ambitious plans for the future. One of the most thrilling aspects of this development is the expectation that the platform will shift to a fully decentralized sBTC system in 2025. This move is likely to solidly place Stacks as a key player in the DeFi world and offer users an unparalleled experience in moving between Bitcoin and DeFi—securely and with no apparent loss of decentralization. The Stacks platform is dealing with one of Bitcoin’s most significant problems—the asset’s minimal interoperability with the decentralized finance (DeFi) world—by doing two things: “First, we’re increasing the capacity of sBTC. Second, we’re expanding the range of DeFi applications on Stacks.” These steps should allow Bitcoin holders to finally access the target state they want to reach with their asset—something the Stacks team is calling “DeFi for Bitcoin.” Conclusion: The Future of Bitcoin and DeFi sBTC Cap-2 is a groundbreaking step for Bitcoin in decentralized finance. By increasing the capacity for Bitcoin-backed assets and opening up new opportunities in DeFi (decentralized finance), Stacks is creating a path for Bitcoin to be adopted more widely in the DeFi space. Along with a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset, a 5% annual yield, and the ability to participate in a growing ecosystem of DeFi protocols, sBTC offers a compelling reason for Bitcoin holders to explore Stacks and engage with DeFi in a secure and innovative way. As Stacks keeps moving forward and growing, the project occupies a vital position in closing the gap between Bitcoin and DeFi. Its launch of sBTC Cap-2 gives users a chance to experience the liquidity of Bitcoin on Stacks. Even better, the project has plans to launch a completely decentralized sBTC system. All this adds up to a solid new opportunity for Bitcoin holders to explore a potential income stream in a decentralized finance project that keeps making progress.

The two ETFs, Volatility Shares 2x Solana ETF (SOLT) and Solana ETF (SOLZ) , are now listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). This means that they are eligible for clearing and settlement through DTCC’s infrastructure, streamlining the trading process and offering more security. Earlier this month, Coinbase introduced CFTC-regulated Solana futures contracts, addressing the lack of a regulated futures market for Solana. This move helped open the door for the approval of Solana futures ETFs, strengthening the case for regulated crypto futures . In December 2024, Volatility Shares filed with the SEC, requesting approval for three Solana-focused ETFs . One of these was the -1x Solana ETF, which would give inverse exposure to Solana futures contracts. However, at that time, there were no Solana futures contracts on CFTC-regulated exchanges, making it unclear how these ETFs could be launched. The approval and listing of Solana futures ETFs on DTCC now show that institutional investors are showing increasing interest in crypto products. However, it’s important to note that the DTCC listing doesn’t mean the US SEC has officially approved the ETFs yet. Coinbase's actions earlier in the month were pivotal in creating a regulated Solana futures market. Before Coinbase’s move, there were concerns about the lack of a clear regulatory framework for Solana futures, which had delayed the introduction of ETFs based on Solana futures. Coinbase Derivatives LLC’s launch of Solana futures contracts resolved this issue, providing investors with a regulated and secure way to trade Solana futures. It also increased the likelihood that Solana ETFs would gain regulatory approval in the future. Some market analysts had speculated about the possibility of Solana and XRP futures launching on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). A leaked website seemed to confirm this, suggesting a launch date of February 10. However, the CME quickly dismissed this as an error and clarified that no decision had been made. Still, the introduction of regulated Solana futures contracts by Coinbase is seen as a step in the right direction for institutional investors. It bridges the gap between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies, giving investors more confidence in the stability and legitimacy of Solana futures. The launch of Solana futures ETFs and the appearance of regulated futures contracts might eventually lead to the approval of a spot Solana ETF . Several asset management firms, such as VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, have already filed for spot Solana ETFs , and their progress will be closely watched. The SEC's decision on these filings will be a critical moment in the ongoing battle for approval of more cryptocurrency ETFs. Despite these advancements in the regulatory space, Solana’s price dropped slightly, reflecting the market’s ongoing volatility. Factors such as regulatory uncertainty and broader economic trends continue to influence the price of Solana and other cryptocurrencies. The volatility in the market remains a concern, but the steps taken by Coinbase and Volatility Shares highlight the increasing integration of crypto assets into traditional financial systems.",,EN,0,0,SOL|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-27 08:10:54
40900938,https://crypto.news/?p=14340968,1740643877,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40900938.jpeg,US lawmakers move to overturn controversial IRS defi broker rule,https://crypto.news/us-lawmakers-move-to-overturn-controversial-irs-defi-broker-rule/,"A controversial tax rule proposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, requiring decentralized finance brokers to report crypto transactions, could be overturned as lawmakers have pushed to repeal it. On Feb. 26, U.S. House Representatives advanced a resolution to scrap the rule, with the House Ways and Means Committee voting 26-16 in favor of the repeal. The resolution now moves to the full House for a vote. If it passes, the Senate will then decide its fate. A successful Senate vote would send the measure to President Donald Trump, who can either sign it into law or veto it. However, if it is not overturned, the rule will take effect on January 1, 2027. The “DeFi broker rule,” proposed by the IRS in August 2023 and officially finalized in January 2024, would require certain DeFi operators—including front-end service providers for decentralized exchanges—to collect and report user transaction data, including gross proceeds from crypto sales. According to the IRS, it would “level the taxpayer playing field” by applying the same standards as traditional finance institutions. However, industry leaders see it differently. Critics like Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith argue the rule is unworkable for DeFi, where platforms often operate without centralized control and do not collect user data by design. Commenting on the development, Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, welcomed the decision to repeal the rule, arguing that the rule represents an “unlawful and unconstitutional overreach” that undermines the financial privacy of Americans and stifles innovation in decentralized finance. DeFi advocates have previously raised concerns about privacy implications. Some fear platforms like Uniswap could be required to collect user identities, contradicting the fundamental ethos of decentralized finance. Others, like Consensys attorney Bill Hughes, see it as a last-minute attempt by the previous administration to clamp down on crypto before leaving office. You might also like: DeFi proponents to fight US IRS tax code A day after the IRS finalized the rule on December 27, Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, called it “unconstitutional” and warned that it could push crypto innovation offshore. Texas Blockchain Council President Lee Bratcher echoed this concern, saying compliance is “practically impossible” for many in the decentralized space. The Blockchain Association, DeFi Education Fund, and Texas Blockchain Council have already sued the IRS , claiming the rule would force DeFi developers to comply with regulations they simply can’t implement. Despite the controversy, the IRS remains firm. In a joint statement with the Treasury, the agency dismissed arguments that DeFi should be exempt, saying, “Persons with technology expertise that operate trades or businesses relating to financial services should comply with the same rules as any other person operating financial services businesses.” Read more: SEC drops appeal against ruling that blocked controversial crypto broker-dealer rule",News|Cryptocurrency|IRS|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|UNI,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-27 08:11:17
40900991,https://nulltx.com/?p=145920,1740643976,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Bybit Exploiter Continues Systematic Fund Laundering Operations, Beosin Monitoring Efforts Ramp Up",https://nulltx.com/bybit-exploiter-continues-systematic-fund-laundering-operations-beosin-monitoring-efforts-ramp-up/,"Beosin Trace monitoring issued a recent update revealing that the Bybit exploiter—responsible for a huge security breach and lots of stolen assets—hasn’t stopped its operations. If anything, it’s still persistently and systematically pouring stolen on-chain assets into various laundering channels. And despite all the tracking and containment efforts, the value of those assets keeps on increasing—pretty steadily, in fact. As of today, the total we know stolen and involving the Bybit exploiter has shot up to over 400,000 ETH. That is a huge sum. If you’re wondering how various channels doing by various laundering methods have managed to do that, we’ve got an answer for you—coming up next. A Breakdown of the Laundering Activities As reported by Beosin Trace, the Bybit exploiter has taken part in a grand total of 11,578 on-chain transactions. Each of these has seen to the transferring of sums greater than 1 ETH, making this particular operation all the more visible across the blockchain network. Incidentally, these activities—part of what is likely a money-laundering operation—have served to move the exploitable funds into different addresses and across a variety of platforms. That has certainly made it easier for the exploiter to serve up the original assets on a platter of the great obscurity of blockchain transactions. The laundering operation mainly takes place on the Ethereum blockchain, with the stolen funds passing through a number of decentralized and centralized platforms. This manner of moving the funds hints at the possibility that sophisticated tools and techniques are being used to conceal the true nature of the transactions. Meanwhile, as more funds are laundered, the operation’s scale has grown, making things even harder for the good guys to track and freeze the stolen assets. Beosin’s KYT (Know Your Transaction) service has been indispensable in pinpointing and labeling the dubious addresses linked to the laundering undertakings. So far, Beosin has done the important work of risk tagging 4,972 blacklisted addresses on the Ethereum chain. We should emphasize that tagging these addresses is a big deal because these funds under tag are now kept under continuous watch. That watch is simply an elbow bump away from Beosin giving those shady operations the side eye in proximity to any address still using Ethereum for anything other than legitimate purposes. According to Beosin Trace monitoring, #Bybit Exploiter is still conducting systematic fund laundering operations. Here are some details: — Beosin Alert (@BeosinAlert) February 26, 2025 Monitoring the Dormant Addresses The operation’s most concerning aspect is the presence of 160 dormant addresses, each holding over 1 ETH. These addresses, which have not been active for a long time, now stand for a large part of the stolen funds. Because these addresses are so dormant, it is difficult to identify them as part of the laundering operation. However, Beosin Trace, the tracing company for this operation, continues to monitor these addresses. Beosin is also attempting to determine the next steps of the operation by analyzing the potential future movements of the funds. Ongoing monitoring efforts at Beosin Trace keep an eye on around 368,507 ETH connected to the addresses that have been flagged. This encompasses all the addresses, both active and dormant, that are identified with the Bybit exploiter. Beosin’s intention here seems to be to trace the illicit funds to their next destination and cut them off from potential uses like exchanges and other illegal activities, all in a bid to prevent any further unlawful use of the assets. The Role of Beosin’s KYT System Beosin’s KYT system has emerged as a necessary tool in the fight against crypto crime, offering real-time transaction monitoring and risk tagging of suspicious addresses. The KYT system allows Beosin to identify suspicious behavior in the crypto space at an early stage and take necessary and appropriate actions to prevent the further laundering of stolen funds. By tagging these addresses, Beosin creates an incredible database of shady addresses, which is invaluable in helping investigators and authorities track and recover stolen assets. In addition, the tagging process allows Beosin to offer exhaustive reports to exchanges, regulators, and law enforcement agencies so that they can act quickly. These reports enable a deep collaboration between Beosin and its many stakeholders, and that deep collaboration helps ensure that money flowing through the crypto ecosystem is clean and that everyone involved is playing by the rules. Ongoing Efforts to Freeze Stolen Funds Even though the laundering operation is on a large scale, attempts to freeze the stolen assets are ramping up. Beosin Trace continues to do the hard work of monitoring and tagging addresses associated with the exploiter’s activities. But the operation’s size and complexity mean that this is not a short-term effort. So is the vigilance of the broader crypto community. We must maintain a close watch on the situation as it shifts and new criminal tactics are developed to misdirect attention and obscure activities. Beosin Trace has not yet disclosed the identities of the people responsible for the Bybit exploit. However, the organization’s scale suggests that the operation was carried out by a well-organized and professional group of individuals—perhaps working as a team and possibly located in a specific geography—who are good at hiding and who trained for a long time to get good at what they do. And the group appears to be good at what it does. Conclusion: A Growing Challenge for Crypto Security Bybit exploiter’s operation highlights a situation that’s getting worse for the industry. Fund laundering is not new; what’s happening here is what’s happening with most stolen crypto in the wild. We simply have no way to monitor what’s going on because the crypto industry is largely unregulated and what’s happening in that space is very opaque. That’s a problem for us, a problem for the industry, and a problem for national security. While Beosin Trace watches where the money goes, the Make-A-Wish Foundation does something similar. It does not have the kinds of powers that Beosin does, tracing on-chain to ensure that funds really do go where they’re supposed to. But it is sort of a collaborative association of very smart folks in law enforcement who do know how to track money. Not every wish is granted; in fact, Beosin’s KYT team might be more successful in tracking down bad guys. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The attack, which was traced back to a compromised developer machine, involved a disguised malicious transaction that allowed unauthorized access to the platform. Safe Wallet clarified in a statement that its smart contracts were not affected by the breach. ""External security researchers did not find any vulnerabilities in the Safe smart contracts or the source code of the frontend and services,"" the statement said. Following the hack, Safe Wallet worked quickly to restore its services on the Ethereum ( ETH ) mainnet in stages, claiming to have rebuilt its infrastructure entirely while rotating all credentials to prevent future exploits. Despite these efforts, Safe Wallet's explanation has not been well-received by the wider crypto community. Many, including well-known industry figures, have criticized the company for being vague and insufficient in its response. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, voiced his concerns, saying he had more questions than answers after reading Safe Wallet's update. He questioned how the hacker gained access to Bybit's system, how they bypassed Ledger verification steps, and why they targeted Bybit's address specifically. CZ also wondered about the security of the compromised developer machine and how the code was deployed to Bybit’s production environment. Another analyst emphasized the need for stronger security measures in crypto management. Although the smart contracts remained intact, the frontend of the system was tampered with, allowing the hackers to manipulate transactions. The analyst referred to the attack as a classic supply chain attack , warning that services relying on user interaction, such as APIs and front-end systems, could be vulnerable. In response to the breach, Safe Wallet has taken additional security steps and urged users to be cautious when signing transactions. The company has also launched an initiative to improve the verifiability of transactions across the ecosystem. A full post-mortem report on the hack is expected to be released once the investigation is complete. The hack has also raised concerns beyond Safe Wallet’s infrastructure. The FBI has confirmed that the Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking organization, was responsible for the attack. The FBI's public announcement identified the operation as ""TraderTraitor"" and revealed that the hackers had stolen 40,000 ETH from Bybit's cold wallet. The stolen assets were quickly converted to Bitcoin and dispersed across numerous addresses on various blockchains, with the expectation that they would eventually be laundered and converted to fiat currency. The FBI has taken action by listing Ethereum addresses associated with the Lazarus Group and urging service providers, including exchanges, DeFi platforms, and blockchain analytics firms, to block transactions connected to these addresses. The agency also warned that the stolen assets could be spread across thousands of addresses, making it difficult to trace them. This breach has raised serious concerns within the crypto industry regarding the security of its infrastructure and the handling of high-value assets. While Safe Wallet continues to restore its services and improve its security measures, the hack serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that still exist in the cryptocurrency space. As the investigation continues, all eyes are on the FBI’s efforts to track down the stolen funds and prevent further laundering activities. The impact of this breach is expected to have long-lasting effects on the confidence of users and investors in the security of crypto platforms.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-27 08:13:34

Should We Buy Fear? What Do Historical Data and Analysts Say?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/extreme-fear-dominates-bitcoin-and-altcoins-should-we-buy-fear-what-do-historical-data-and-analysts-say/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen to levels not seen since November in the last 24 hours. While the BTC price has fallen to $83,000, the situation is no different for altcoins. Altcoins continue to be far from their peaks, while the index measuring overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market has fallen to its lowest level in more than two years. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key index that tracks Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sentiment, has reached even lower levels than the FTX crash. What is the Fear and Greed Index? Extreme fear can be a buying opportunity as it indicates that people are very anxious and the price has bottomed out. Excessive greed could mean that there is a correction in the market. This data, which analyzes the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market, is displayed on a simple scale from 0 to 100. Zero represents “extreme fear” while 100 represents “extreme greed.” Market analysts say investors should not panic sell, saying now is not the time to sell because conditions of extreme fear often underlie upward price movements. Analysts said that Bitcoin has been testing its 200-day moving average (DMA) in the recent decline, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, which is often used to predict ups and downs, has fallen into oversold territory. Analysts note that this data reflects a favorable environment for BTC to gain bullish momentum and experience a potential recovery. When looking at historical data, it is seen that those who bought fear were the winners during periods when fear fluctuated between 10-20 points. At this point, will investors who generally act with the principle of “Buy fear, sell greed” be right again? Time will tell. Don't Panic Sell! Collective Shift founder Ben Simpson said that the current market conditions present a buying opportunity for crypto investors, noting that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen to extreme fear levels. Stating that panic selling should not be done in Bitcoin and altcoins, Simpson explained the simple strategy that investors should follow. “The simple strategy employed over the last few years has been to buy in times of extreme fear and sell in times of Greed. If you did that, you've outperformed the market and probably most investors.” Simpson explained that the negative sentiment in cryptocurrencies is due to the failure to meet high expectations for the inauguration of US President Donald Trump: “There's not much to be hopeful or excited about right now. Everyone was counting on Donald Trump to make big moves for Bitcoin and crypto, but he's busy with other things right now.” Wait for March! Swyftx chief analyst Pav Hundal noted that the extreme sense of fear in the market is temporary and said investors should be patient. “The next few weeks may be challenging for Bitcoin and altcoins, but global liquidity levels are increasing every week. “Historically, this is a leading indicator for Bitcoin's recovery and rise. March is expected to be a pivotal month.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Extreme Fear Dominates Bitcoin and Altcoins! Should We Buy Fear?

In the overall DEX landscape, XRPL’s native DEX is leading the charge, accounting for an astounding 99% of the total DEX trading volume in this segment. This trend prompted us to take a closer look at not only what is going on with XRP and the XRPL but also to assess the extent to which trading on the XRPL DEX leads to volume that is truly decentralized tokens vs. volume that may be “washed.” The XRPL DEX Surge The DEX on the XRP Ledger has become a real powerhouse, achieving an impressive trading volume in recent weeks. Data reveals that the week ending February 9 saw the highest weekly volume to date, with combined DEX volume across both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger approaching $35 million. This recent surge in activity is reflective of a broader trend within the cryptocurrency market, where decentralized exchanges are becoming more common due to their perceived virtues of security, transparency, and user control. Despite still being in the lead on token supply, Ethereum seems to have lost some traction to the XRPL DEX in terms of trading activity. With the token supply of Ethereum dwarfing that of the XRPL, it’s remarkable to see the XRPL DEX pulling in so many traders. These traders are lured by the DEX’s unique selling proposition: Compared to the Ethereum DEX, the XRPL DEX is less expensive and quicker. At present, the total DEX trading volume on both Ethereum and the XRPL has exceeded $120 million, demonstrating impressive growth in this sector. This is an early indication that decentralized exchanges may become a larger, more stable part of the crypto ecosystem — as long, of course, as they avoid the regulatory scrutiny that has sometimes afflicted their centralized cousins. For now, traders appear to be moving to both Ethereum and the XRPL for more secure trading on these increasingly decentralized platforms. Although more $RLUSD supply exists on Ethereum, XRPL’s native decentralized exchange (DEX) accounts for 99% of DEX-based trading volume. The highest weekly volume so far occurred during the week ending Feb. 9, with combined DEX volume on Ethereum and XRPL approaching $35M.… pic.twitter.com/Wj4ye7ZKvP — Spencer Noon (@spencernoon) February 25, 2025 Whale Activity and Market Movements Although the success of the XRPL DEX has received much praise, significant recent movements in the broader market merit attention. Large holders of cryptocurrency, known as whales, have been particularly active. In the last 96 hours alone, they’ve sold over 370 million XRP. To say this has the potential to affect not just the price but also the supply dynamics of the asset is putting it mildly. The selling has activity has raised raised eyebrows among some in the market, because it could put pressure on the price of XRP, especially if other big holders mimic the moves of this apparent whale. The sales come at a time when the overall cryptocurrency market is seeing increased volatility, and such big moves are often interpreted as precursors to price drops. The fact that such a significant portion of the XRP supply has been resold in a short amount of time also shows a change in sentiment among big holders of the cryptocurrency. Even so, whale sales don’t appear to be seriously impeding what looks to be a pretty popular platform. Trading on the DEX built into the XRP Ledger just keeps getting better. And it seems that DEX trading on the XRP Ledger might just keep getting better, too. Whales have sold over 370 million $XRP in the last 96 hours! pic.twitter.com/1g6FEI3yRG — Ali (@ali_charts) February 25, 2025 Ethereum’s Struggle to Maintain DEX Dominance Although Ethereum remains the primary source for decentralized tokens, it seems evident that the blockchain enjoys growing competition from other networks, such as XRPL. Ethereum’s share of the DEX trading market has been consistently pressured by the emergence of alternative blockchains that offer superior transaction speeds and lower fees. The fact that 99% of the DEX trading volume is now being handled on XRPL, despite Ethereum having the larger supply of $RLUSD, suggests that users are increasingly favoring these upstart blockchains for their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, rather than sticking with the relatively familiar environment of the Ethereum blockchain. User preference may be shifting to other blockchain ecosystems for several reasons, including Ethereum’s current iterative scalability problems, high gas fees, and plodding transaction speeds. Meanwhile, Ethereum is in the midst of its transition to a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Some users have taken this opportunity to investigate other decentralized exchanges built on alternative blockchain ecosystems, such as XRPL, which offer far lower costs and much quicker settlement times for users looking to trade. Moreover, the ongoing progress of DEX platforms on networks such as XRPL has fueled the upsurge in trading volumes we’ve seen of late. Today, DEXs are usually seen as earning their keep because of a combination of three factors—lower fees, faster speeds, and the burgeoning adoption of DeFi applications. This means that they’re doing quite well, in contrast to the DEXs we used to know. Looking Ahead: Will XRPL Maintain its DEX Dominance? The XRPL’s DEX dominance is a subject of considerable interest among crypto fans and market analysts. The recent surge in trading volumes, though, speaks to the nascent XRPL DEX ecosystem trying to emerge as a reliable decentralized trading platform. A question moving forward into this year is whether Ethereum will continue to hold sway over decentralized trading, given its sustained pump into DeFi infrastructure, or if this emerging ecosystem will start to reorder the crypto trading landscape. Will the ascent of alternative blockchains such as XRPL mean the end of Ethereum’s supremacy in the decentralized exchange (DEX) sector, or will upcoming updates enable Ethereum to return to the top? This remains a partially unanswered question, with some in the industry expressing confidence in Ethereum’s ability to maintain its edge. But, the outcome, at least in part, will certainly depend on how well each of these networks develops DEX infrastructure and scales. At this point, the XRPL is still a big player in the DEX market, and the growing activity on its platform suggests that it’s becoming more popular with traders. Whales continue to make impressive moves, and $XRP’s role in decentralized finance is being set in stone, so we have to look towards the future. And the future of the XRP Ledger’s DEX? With volatility and unpredictability still dominating the market, we have to say it looks pretty darn good. Conclusion: The Shift Toward Decentralized Exchanges To conclude, DEX on the XRPL is a decentralized trading powerhouse. The DEX has 99% market share in DEX trading volume and is the DEX of choice for trading tokens on the XRPL. The DEX’s performance has usurped that of DEXes on Ethereum, a not-so-secret stronghold of decentralized trading. The whale activity on the DEX isn’t apparently how colossal DEX trading volume has become in such a short span of time. As the number of traders moving to decentralized exchanges in search of lower fees, faster transactions, and more control keeps growing, XRPL is working hard to give them what they want. At the same time—sorry, Ethereum!—XRPL has pulled off some unexpected moves lately and remains, at this moment, the decentralized exchange market leader. Still, how long can it hold off the competition? Until the DEX challenge is resolved, the future of decentralized finance remains broadly undefined.

Speculation around a potential Binance listing fuels the rally, with over 86% of voters supporting the token’s inclusion on the exchange. The Rally Goes on Contrary to the severe crash of the cryptocurrency market witnessed in the past few days, Pi Network’s native token continues to chart additional gains. Several hours ago, PI’s price hit a new all-time high of almost $3. Currently, it trades at around $2.50, which represents a whopping 35% increase on a daily scale. PI Price, Source: CoinMarketCap According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the asset’s market capitalization has surged past $18 billion. The crypto data aggregator, though, made a disclaimer that it has not verified the figure. It noted that the project had self-reported the capitalization, claiming that the circulating supply stands at over 6.6 billion tokens. Meanwhile, a market cap of over $18 billion (if the number is accurate) would place PI as the 11th-biggest cryptocurrency, trailing behind TRON (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Perhaps the most likely factor triggering the pump is the increased speculation that Binance is about to embrace the asset. The world’s largest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see PI available for trading on its platform. The results will become official today (February 27), with over 86% of the voters clicking the “yes” option so far . A potential Binance listing would increase the token’s liquidity and accessibility, possibly creating additional upward pressure on the valuation. It is worth mentioning that some of the leading crypto exchanges have already allowed trading services with PI. Some examples are Bitget, OKX, and MEXC. Conversely, Bybit preferred to stay aside . Its CEO – Ben Zhou – recently described Pi Network as a scam , assuring that his entity will not list the asset. The Next Potential Targets Pi Network has a huge community that is particularly active on X. Many members noted the asset’s recent price surge , envisioning a further jump to uncharted territory in the near future. One person, using the X moniker Pi Blockchain, suggested that the next wave could send the price to $4 or even $40. Prior to the launch of the Open Network (which occurred on February 20), some predicted that the token’s valuation could reach a staggering $314.159 – a number symbolically linked to π (Pi) ≈ 3.14159. It is worth mentioning that such a figure would require PI’s market cap to skyrocket above $2 trillion (assuming the circulating supply is around 6.6 billion coins). The current capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency market is less than $3 trillion, making the forecast highly implausible.

40903503,https://nulltx.com/?p=145968,1740648333,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Meme Coin Mania: Panshibi (SHIBI) Stealing the Spotlight from Solana (SOL) as Presale Nears Completion,https://nulltx.com/meme-coin-mania-panshibi-shibi-stealing-the-spotlight-from-solana-sol-as-presale-nears-completion/,"In the fast-moving realm of meme coins and fresh blockchain innovations, Panshibi (SHIBI) has emerged as a panda-themed token that’s grabbing attention. At the same time, the Solana cryptocurrency introduces new tools for large-scale crypto adoption. Projects spanning finance, AI and gaming are scouting meme coin tokens for their upside, prompting many “meme mania” watchers to balance meme coin branding with tangible utility. As Panshibi pushes its presale above $1.16 million, some Solana holders are pivoting to this lighthearted contender. Solana Crypto: Gasless Smart Wallets and Expanding Use Cases Recent Solana cryptocurrency developments focus on “Smart Wallets,” offering frictionless usage by cutting out seed phrases, private keys and gas fees. Priced near $140.02 , Solana’s token (SOL) stumbled in February but might regain momentum if these gasless wallets spark broader app adoption. Backed by Crossmint and Squads Protocol, Solana’s new wallet model allows developers to integrate wallet features with only ten lines of code. This approach merges speed and user-friendliness, helping AI-driven agents, gaming studios and DeFi platforms onboard millions of users more smoothly. Multiple keys can control one wallet address, letting businesses automate transactions while giving individuals the choice to manage assets through non-custodial wallets like Phantom. Enterprises also find Solana’s security appealing, combining multi-party computation (MPC) with social logins to create flexible custody. By eliminating gas fees, Solana aims to shrink the learning curve that often deters new crypto users. If these solutions succeed, analysts say the Solana cryptocurrency can bridge mainstream finance and digital assets, potentially reversing SOL’s recent dips. Large token unlocks remain a concern, but strong development, stable user growth and proven solutions might steady the chain’s future prospects. As stablecoins like USDC flood the network, user-friendly tools are essential for converting passing interest into actual adoption. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Meme Contender on the Rise While Solana Crypto refines its tech infrastructure, Panshibi captures meme coin enthusiasts with meme coin branding and robust tokenomics. Priced at $0.005, the token’s presale soared beyond $1.16 million, reflecting keen interest in structured meme plays. Liquidity is locked for ten years, while team tokens remain locked for two, which diminishes the risk of sudden drops commonly plaguing meme coin tokens. Paired with an AI-based “social-fi” system, Panshibi sets up community quests, staking and other incentives to hold user interest long after launch day. Early adopters note that meme coin cycles can reappear swiftly, meaning $SHIBI might ride the next mania wave if it continues to deliver on security and engagement. Investors turning from SOL’s short-term volatility to Panshibi’s meme coin promise highlight the dynamic nature of crypto markets. A fun brand can secure quick capital, but Panshibi’s success will hinge on whether it can differentiate from other dog- or frog-themed rivals. With an audit completing the token’s safety net, the project looks better prepared than many ephemeral meme coins. Suppose Solana’s user expansion proves slow or overshadowed by token unlock concerns. In that case, Panshibi may pull restless capital, especially from those hunting big returns in meme coin tokens that balance fun with structure. Conclusion In an industry often fueled by surprises, Solana Crypto is making strides with “gasless” Smart Wallets to expand beyond the typical crypto user base. Meanwhile, Panshibi (SHIBI) caters to meme coin collectors seeking meme coin potential blended with serious security. As Solana weathers the worries of token unlocks and tries to court mainstream businesses, Panshibi leaps forward with a $1.16 million presale that marries humour and stability in a way many meme coin tokens don’t. Whichever path draws more market attention, the crypto space continues to evolve with each new technology milestone and playful new contender.

Investor confidence was shaken by macroeconomic uncertainties, including trade tariff threats from Donald Trump. Bitcoin investment products also saw $3 billion in outflows over seven days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miner MARA reported a strong Q4 2024, posting $214.4 million in revenue and growing its Bitcoin holdings to 44,893 BTC. Crypto Market Sentiment Reaches Extreme Fear The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which is a sentiment tracker in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market, dropped to its lowest level in over two years after Bitcoin plummeted below $90,000. On Feb. 26, the index slipped further into the “Extreme Fear” zone by reaching a score of 10, which is its lowest point since June of 2022. At that time, the collapse of major crypto players like Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Terraform Labs, and Celsius triggered a wave of market panic. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) Bitcoin’s recent drop led to renewed concerns among investors. While no major collapses happened in the crypto space in recent days, many analysts attribute the sentiment decline to broader macroeconomic uncertainty. The downturn followed statements from US President Donald Trump, who reaffirmed his plans to impose a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico. He later extended these measures to include the European Union, which only added to investor concerns. Bitcoin’s price action over the past 30 days (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin’s price fell by close to 16%. As a result, the crypto king was trading hands at around $86,304 at press time. This decline is similar to past market crashes, particularly in mid-2022, when the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin led to $60 billion being liquidated from the crypto market. The fallout extended to 3AC, which failed to meet margin calls, ultimately leading to its liquidation by the end of June. Celsius followed soon after by filing for bankruptcy in mid-July. Despite the ongoing uncertainty, some analysts believe the current conditions may present an opportunity for investors. Ben Simpson , founder of Collective Shift, suggested that historical trends favor buying during periods of extreme fear and selling when the market turns greedy. He pointed out that sentiment has been dampened by unmet expectations regarding Trump’s potential pro-crypto stance, as the president is still occupied with other matters. Pav Hundal , lead analyst at Swyftx, acknowledged that the market is currently an unforgiving environment, which has been eroding investor confidence. However, he noticed that global liquidity levels have been steadily rising, which is a trend that historically preceded positive price action for Bitcoin. For now analysts expect that the coming weeks will be crucial for the market’s direction. Crypto Funds Bleed Billions Investors also recently rapidly withdrew funds from crypto investment products, led by a huge $420 million outflow from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. This was the largest single-day exit for the fund. This recent withdrawal is part of a severe seven-day streak, and almost $3 billion exited Bitcoin products overall during this period. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) The $420 million withdrawn from BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust on Feb. 26 happened during the current market turmoil, with cryptocurrency investment products experiencing big outflows totaling nearly $3 billion over the past seven trading days. This streak was accentuated by a particularly sharp sell-off on Feb. 24, when combined outflows across major crypto products surpassed $1.1 billion. Other leading asset managers also saw major exits from their funds, with investors withdrawing sums ranging from $10 million to $60 million from funds managed by Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin, WisdomTree, and Grayscale. Among these, Ark 21Shares and Grayscale witnessed some of the largest investor retreats due to the fears surrounding crypto market instability. The cumulative effect of investor pullbacks saw the crypto market cap shrink by an additional 5.6% on the day, falling to approximately $2.9 trillion. At press time, the crypto market cap was even lower at $2.86 trillion. Analysts point to heightened macroeconomic uncertainty as a critical factor behind the sudden bearish sentiment. Despite these turbulent market conditions, crypto market analyst Ki Young Ju said on social media that investors should avoid impulsive selling during downturns, and called panic selling a ”novice” mistake. He pointed out that corrections of up to 30% are common in Bitcoin bull cycles, and recalled a 53% decline in 2021 from which Bitcoin eventually recovered to achieve new all-time highs. Interestingly, the predictions from some market observers have become increasingly bearish due to the ongoing ETF withdrawals. Analyst and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently projected that Bitcoin could dip even more, targeting the $70,000 price level amid continued outflows from spot ETFs. Meanwhile, traders specifically singled out the $74,000 support area as a critical price zone, especially after renewed threats from US President Donald Trump regarding more trade tariffs. Bitcoin Miner MARA Posts Strong Q4 Despite the market turmoil, MARA Holdings is still performing well in Bitcoin mining. In its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings report , the company revealed plans to capitalize on the “second wave” of AI to position itself as a foundational infrastructure provider for AI and high-performance computing applications. MARA plans to follow a strategy similar to Cisco during the internet boom, by providing essential infrastructure rather than rushing into AI adoption as some competitors did. The firm believes that the greatest opportunities arise not in the initial wave but in the second, when strategic positioning can yield major advantages. While the first wave of AI centered around training large language models in data centers, MARA expects the second wave to focus on inference, where AI models operate independently, making real-time decisions. The company envisions this process looking similar to traditional cloud computing and is positioning itself to supply the necessary infrastructure. (Source: MARA ) MARA reported a record-breaking $214.4 million in fourth-quarter revenue, which was about 16.5% higher than market expectations. The company also achieved a net income of $528.3 million, which was a 248% year-over-year increase, while adjusted EBITDA surged by 207% to $794.4 million. In addition to its financial performance, MARA increased its Bitcoin holdings. The firm mined 2,492 Bitcoin during the quarter, retaining all of it under a newly adopted treasury policy. It also acquired 14,574 BTC through cash and proceeds from zero-coupon convertible senior note offerings, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 44,893 BTC by the end of 2024. This figure means that MARA is the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder , behind only MicroStrategy. The company also prioritized expanding its mining operations by increasing its energized hashrate to 53.2 exahashes per second, a 115% increase from the previous year. A lot of this growth was driven by securing 300% more energy capacity and expanding to seven new mining facilities. Additionally, MARA launched 25-megawatt micro data centers in Texas and North Dakota to reduce its dependence on grid power and enhance operational efficiency.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-27 09:26:07

Solana’s price has slipped below $140 , unsettling investors as fresh uncertainty grips the market. Raising fears of intensified sell pressure is a staggering 11.2 million SOL token unlock tied to the FTX collapse is scheduled for March 1. Also, a $1.4 billion Bybit hack on February 21 has further rattled confidence, sparking concerns over liquidity and security in the general crypto market. Some analysts now warn that SOL could dip toward $100 if selling accelerates. With Solana price predictions looking very worrisome, many investors are rethinking their positions. While some remain hopeful for a Solana rebound, others are exploring new opportunities. The growing interest in alternative tokens and presales suggests that traders are on the lookout for projects with high upside potential, especially in sectors gaining strong community traction. Among the rising names, Panshibi has started to catch attention, particularly in Asia, where meme coins are seeing a surge in interest. As uncertainty lingers in established assets, investors are increasingly considering emerging projects with momentum on their side.

XRP Has Seen A New TD Sequential Signal Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the TD Sequential for the biweekly XRP price. The “TD Sequential” refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for finding probable locations of reversal in any asset’s chart. The indicator involves two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these, the setup, candles of the same color are counted up to nine (note that they don’t have to be one after the other). Once these nine candles are in, the setup is said to be complete and the asset could be assumed to have arrived at a potential turnaround. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown kicks off. In this second phase, candles are once again counted up, except this time the count goes on until thirteen. Following these candles, the price reaches another likely point of reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales The Primary Sellers During Price Crash, Analytics Firm Reveals XRP has recently formed a TD Sequential reversal signal in its two-week chart. Here is the chart shared by Martinez, that shows this pattern forming for the asset: As is visible in the above graph, XRP has formed this TD Sequential signal with green candles, meaning the cryptocurrency could have just witnessed a reversal to the downside. In the chart, the analyst has also highlighted the previous signals that the asset has seen in this indicator during the last couple of years. “The TD Sequential indicator has been highly accurate in predicting XRP price direction since 2022,” notes Martinez. It appears that the pattern may be holding for the cryptocurrency this time as well, as its price has been going down since the signal in the TD Sequential has emerged. In an X post from yesterday, the analyst discussed about how the coin was looking to break under an Ascending Channel. The “Ascending Channel” is a TA pattern that forms when an asset’s price observes overall consolidation toward the upside inside a channel between two parallel trendlines that are slopped upward. Generally, breaks that happen below the lower trendline of an Ascending Channel lead to a bearish outcome for the asset. When sharing the chart yesterday, Martinez had said the coin was targeting $1.65. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed For $72,000?

In a letter sent on Wednesday to the U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan, attorneys representing Sun and the SEC requested a pause in the case, proposing to provide a status update 60 days following the stay, as originally reported by Reuters . The case , filed in March 2023, accuses Sun and his companies of illegally distributing Tronix ( TRX ) and BitTorrent ( BTT ) and artificially inflating TRX trading volume. Specifically, the SEC accused Sun of selling TRX and BTT tokens as investments without proper registration through unregistered “bounty programs.” These programs encouraged interested parties to promote the tokens on social media and chat groups, and create BitTorrent accounts in exchange for receiving TRX and BTT. The SEC also claimed that Sun and his companies conducted monthly giveaways of BTT to U.S. investors who already held TRX in their wallets or on certain exchanges. Additionally, the SEC accused Sun of wash trading, creating the illusion of active trading and liquidity in the markets for these tokens. Specifically, from April 2018 to Feb. 2019, Sun allegedly instructed his employees to carry out over 600,000 wash trades of TRX using two trading accounts he controlled. These trades involved manipulating the market with daily wash trades of between 4.5 million and 7.4 million TRX. To execute this scheme, Sun allegedly supplied a large quantity of TRX. Additionally, he was accused of selling TRX in the secondary market, which resulted in $31 million in proceeds. Finally, Sun also hired several high-profile celebrities to promote these tokens without disclosing their compensation. The SEC has also charged eight celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan, Akon, and Austin Mahone, for unlawfully promoting TRX and/or BTT without revealing that they were paid for these endorsements and the specific amounts they received. You might also like: SEC sues Tron founder Justin Sun, his three companies, celebrities for securities violations Prior to this, Justin Sun was in another legal spotlight when the blockchain protocol Chain considered taking legal action against him. This was sparked by Sun’s allegations that the company was involved in Onyxcoin ( XCN ) market manipulation—an accusation that seems particularly ironic in light of the Sun’s charges filed by the SEC. Sun made these allegations in a post on Jan. 24, claiming that Chain was using high leverage and contracts that could harm exchange users. He suggested that crypto exchanges should be cautious and indicated he would report Chain’s supposed illegal activities to the SEC and DOJ. In response, Chain rejected Sun’s accusations, stating that it does not engage in trading its XCN and pointing out that the XCN token is managed by OnyxDAO. Following this, Sun reiterated his accusations, this time directing attention to OnyxDAO and urging regulatory bodies to investigate.

While some analysts see a chance for XRP to hit $8.7 through a bull flag setup, a leap to $500 seems far beyond any near-term trend. Amid these lofty forecasts, a different project Remittix (RTX) is drawing attention as the “XRP 2.0” thanks to its frictionless cross-border payment system. Below, we break down the claims of a $500 XRP, the real challenges that come with such a valuation and why Remittix might be the more practical powerhouse in payments. XRP’s $500 Aspirations: Bull Flag or Major Hurdles? XRP moving up to $500 Source: Coinmarketcap XRP trades near $2.27, buoyed by an ongoing XRPL upgrade introducing native programmability. Developers can now add “Smart Features” to token transfers, escrows and automated market makers (AMMs). Ripple’s also rolling out an EVM sidechain to attract Ethereum devs, bridging fees back to XRP. These moves hint at expanded utility for institutions and DeFi users alike. Renowned trader Peter Brandt recently highlighted a bull flag pattern that could push XRP’s price to roughly $8.7 a sizable 357.9% gain . But a jump to $500 is on a far different scale. That kind of valuation, requiring a market cap in the tens of trillions, would mean XRP becomes the backbone of finance worldwide. It would demand huge institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and widespread acceptance of XRP as the go-to for cross-border liquidity. While not outright impossible, such a shift in the near future remains more of a long-term dream scenario than a realistic short-term forecast. Remittix (RTX): The New “XRP 2.0” for Cross-Border Payments While lofty XRP forecasts have stirred debate, Remittix has quietly emerged as a contender for real-world payment solutions, often dubbed “XRP 2.0” by those who see a simpler more direct approach. With its PayFi protocol, RTX can convert crypto to local fiat on the fly and deposit it into the recipient’s bank account within roughly 24 hours. That means a freelancer in Brazil could invoice a client in Germany, accept stablecoins and quickly see local currency arrive with no messy wire fees or days-long delays. Currently priced at $0.0671, Remittix has raised more than $12.9 million in its presale and sold over 504 million tokens, illustrating robust market interest. Unlike purely speculative tokens, Remittix solves a global pain point: sending money across borders remains slow, expensive and complicated. By focusing on user-friendly solutions, RTX is earning trust from both institutional and casual backers eager for a real impact in daily finance. Why $500 Remains Speculative Achieving a $500 price for XRP would demand a market capitalization that surpasses the GDP of many major nations, far beyond what current crypto markets can realistically support. Although XRP has attracted new attention particularly with its latest network enhancements it continues to face legal challenges in various jurisdictions, hindering full-scale institutional adoption until regulatory paths become clearer. Even with ongoing developments on the XRPL, alternative solutions such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) may compete for dominance in cross-border finance. Most analysts see around $8.7 as feasible in a prolonged bull run. However, reaching $500 would likely require a completely restructured global financial system that fully integrates XRP as a universal settlement layer, a leap that remains more theoretical than immediately achievable. Conclusion: XRP’s Reach vs. Remittix’s Now Though talk of a $500 XRP captures headlines, it remains more of a long-term daydream tied to sweeping global finance overhauls. In contrast, Remittix is tackling cross-border payments head-on with a near-seamless user experience. This difference may be why some call it “XRP 2.0” suggesting RTX can surpass the older token’s success through simpler, more accessible solutions. At $0.0671 and backed by $12.9 million+ in presale funds, Remittix already shows strong momentum. For investors seeking real-world utility rather than moonshot price calls, RTX might be the more practical bet, poised to reshape payments without needing trillions in market cap or government-level transformation.

Despite that, renowned market pundit CasiTrades has spared speculations with recent hints towards a possible crash to $1.7 ahead. XRP Price Slips 4%: More Decline On The Horizon? XRP price has declined nearly 4% today and traded near the $2.2 zone, while its one-day trading volume also plummeted 29% to $6.86 billion. Besides, the Relative Strength Index of the token also neared an oversold condition, reflecting the massive selling pressure in the market. XRP Price Chart Notably, the decline also suggests that large investors or Ripple whales are losing confidence in the asset. For context, the Ripple whales have dumped over 370 million coins recently, which has further added pressure to the already gloomy market sentiment. Furthermore, CoinGlass data also highlighted a similar trend of declining Futures Open Interest of the asset by about 2%. So, what lies ahead? Is the crypto poised to lose the $2 support ahead? Let’s see the possibilities and the key levels to watch ahead. Ripple (XRP) Price To Dip Below $2? In a recent X post, top crypto expert CasiTrades issued a warning that XRP’s ongoing correction may be nearing its final stages, with a potential price crash to the $1.97 area. However, a user countered with a more bearish prediction, suggesting a possible drop to $1.75, citing a Head and Shoulders pattern. CasiTrades acknowledged the possibility but noted that their “subwave analysis” does not project a drop that low. The expert emphasized that higher timeframes are showing bullish divergence, indicating that this correction could be the final low before a reversal. Meanwhile, the prediction comes as Bitcoin tests its .382 Fib support, which aligns with XRP’s cycle nearing completion. If Bitcoin finds support and starts a relief rally, XRP is expected to follow. However, the potential for a steeper drop to $1.75 cannot be ruled out, leaving investors on high alert. Besides, this also resonates with a prior projection, where the experts have warned over a potential Ripple price correction to $1.6 . Source: CasiTrades, X Key Levels To Watch Ahead Echoing a similar sentiment, another expert EGRAG CRYPTO said that XRP price needs to hold above the $2.35 support to re-enter the bull run cycle. If the crypto holds this support, it could potentially target the $3 mark next. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X However, the expert also warned that closing below $2.2 could worsen the risk of a further dip for Ripple’s native asset. In his analysis, he also highlighted the $1.7 mark if the Bears continue to dominate. But what if XRP price reclaims the $3 mark ahead? What Investors Should Focus on If Bull Cycle Returns? EGRAG CRYPTO noted that if the crypto holds strong above the $2.35 mark, it could potentially hit the $3.4 mark ahead. On the other hand, another market pundit Dark Defender said that as the RSI is nearing the oversold area, a bullish momentum might be generated in the market. Considering that, he suggested that the first wave will push the XRP price to $3. Once this target is achieved, the crypto will potentially target the $5 and $8 marks next. Source: Dark Defender, X The analyst also highlighted $1.88 and $1.91 as key support levels for the token. Simultaneously, he noted that $2.44, $2.99, and $5.85 will act as key resistance levels for the asset in the near future.

According to data from crypto.news, Kaito ( KAITO ) surged to an intraday high of $2.52, bringing its market cap from $440 million to over $600 million at press time. Its price rally occurred in a high-volume trading environment, with daily trading volume doubling over the past day, reaching over $1.97 billion. KAITO’s rally followed a jump in demand among its derivative traders. CoinGlass data shows a nearly 66% increase in open interest in the KAITO futures market, hitting an all-time high of $192 million. At the same time, its weighted funding rate is bouncing back from negative territory, suggesting traders are turning more optimistic, possibly eyeing profit opportunities. The AI-based altcoin also gained traction after AI chip giant Nvidia posted bullish Q4 results, with its revenue up 12% from last quarter and 78% year-over-year. AI-related cryptos typically tend to ride Nvidia’s hype . Alongside KAITO, MyShell (SHELL) jumped 27%, and CARV (CARV) soared 68%.

An unidentified whale wallet has bought back $1.39 million worth of KAITO, according to data from Arkham. The same whale sold over 110,000 airdropped KAITO tokens last week. Whale activity is often seen as a bullish signal by retail investors, which likely added fuel to today’s rally. KAITO price analysis Multiple technical indicators have flagged bullish signals.

Setting an industry standard, adjusted EBITDA, a profitability metric that does not include non-operational expenses like taxes and interest, rose 207% to $794.4 million. MARA mined 2,492 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in Q4, a 25% increase in total blocks won year-over-year, even though the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event cut block rewards in half. The company managed to capitalize on the spike in the price of Bitcoin, adding $119.9 million in earnings despite experiencing revenue reduction from lower output. MARA has become the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after its holdings increased 197% to 44,893 BTC, currently worth over $4.6 billion.

Tokyo-listed firm Metaplanet is issuing 2 billion JPY (around $13.6 million) in bonds to EVO FUND, with the funds aimed at purchasing more Bitcoin ( BTC ) as part of the firm’s ongoing strategy to increase its holdings in digital assets. In a Feb. 27 regulatory filing , Metaplanet said the bonds carry no interest and will be redeemed at face value on Aug. 26. However, the bondholder, EVO FUND, has the option to request early redemption at any time. Early redemption can be made for all or part of the outstanding bonds, provided the request is made at least one business day in advance, the document reads. The funds required for the redemption of the bonds will come from the proceeds of the 13th to 17th Series of Stock Acquisition Rights, which Metaplanet expects to exercise. If the funds from these exercises reach a multiple of 50 million JPY, part of the bonds may be redeemed early.

Around 390,000 traders faced losses, with long positions making up 90% of the liquidations. One major loss occurred on Justin Sun’s exchange, HTX, where a single trader lost $39.62 million. As BTC dropped to $86,000, its lowest since November, analysts debated whether this was a temporary dip or a sign of a bigger downturn. The drop is due to increased ETF outflows, investor worries about Trump’s EU Tariff threat, and the major Bybit crypto hack which scattered the rally hopes. Why Is Bitcoin Dropping? Bitcoin just recorded its biggest three-day price drop since the FTX collapse in 2022 , plunging 12.6% between Monday and Wednesday. Bitcoin’s recent decline is largely tied to external factors. Analysts point to the weakening demand from institutional investors and the tightening of fiat liquidity, making it harder for new money to flow into the crypto space. The lack of immediate progress on crypto-related policies, particularly in the U.S., has also disappointed investors. Adding to the pressure, the Nasdaq index has been struggling, dragging down risk assets like Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto is Macro Now, warned that rising inflation expectations and potential tariff hikes from the Trump administration are further dampening market sentiment. The lowest it can Go With Bitcoin breaking below its long-standing range of $90,000 to $110,000, analysts predict further downside. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, suggests that BTC could dip as low as $72,000–$74,000 before finding support. Another key level to watch is $82,000, identified as a demand zone based on short-term holder data. Historically, Bitcoin doesn’t stay below this price for long during bull markets, but in bear cycles, it tends to linger. Willy Woo highlights that Bitcoin’s drop to $82K was driven by its correlation with stocks, not major investor activity. He sees $75K as a key target but notes BTC is oversold, making a rebound likely. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Iran Cracks Down on Crypto as Rial Hits Record Low , Can Bitcoin Bounce Back? Despite the bearish sentiment, some believe Bitcoin could soon find its footing . Analysts highlight that Bitcoin’s dual nature as both a risk asset and a store of value could attract fresh buyers. If BTC stabilizes around $82,000, a rebound may follow. Regulatory developments could also play a crucial role in shaping the market’s direction. A recent U.S. Senate hearing on digital asset regulations raised hopes for clearer guidelines, which could encourage institutional investment and provide a much-needed confidence boost. Matt Mena from 21 Shares believes that if the U.S. provides definitive guidance on stablecoins and digital assets, it could trigger a new wave of institutional capital inflows. So if you are panicking about BTC dropping, remember historically such drops are part of BTC’s price cycle before a major pump. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, the Bybit hack stopped its ascent and pushed it south to $96,000 during the weekend. Trump’s tariffs and other controversial economic measures, as well as the growing concerns about rising inflation, pushed investors away from BTC and the ETFs, with massive outflows for several consecutive days now. The primary cryptocurrency dropped to $94,000 on Monday, but the real pain was observed on Tuesday, with a slump to $86,000, and on Wednesday, with another decline to $82,100 (on Bitstamp). The latter became the new three-month low. Although BTC has recovered some ground since then and now sits above $86,000, it’s still 3% down on the day. Its market cap has dropped to $1.7 trillion, and its dominance over the alts has decreased to 57.5% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView ETH Down, LTC Up Ethereum continues to dig new lows and dropped toward $2,200 yesterday. It now sits above $2,350, but it is still down by 5% since this time yesterday. XRP, BNB, DOGE, ADA, TRX, XLM, SUI, and TON are also in the red from the larger-cap alts. In contrast, AVAX and LTC have marked gains of over 3% within the same timeframe. APT has stolen the show after recent speculations about an ETF tracking its performance and has soared by 7% to over $6.1. The total crypto market cap, though, has shed another $70 billion since yesterday’s peak and is down to $2.970 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Since then, Bitcoin is up 21%, while MSTR is mostly flat, validating the trade idea. That said, MSTR's NAV premium has now shrunk significantly, and the company's recent convertible issuance shows an insatiable appetite for zero cost convertible bonds. Thus, it's time to close the trade and move on to greener pastures. In October of last year, we highlighted a trade idea that got a LOT of flak at the time - going long Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and short Strategy ( MSTR )(formerly MicroStrategy ), the leveraged bitcoin holding company. In an article titled "" MicroStrategy Is Tapped Out, Short Shares And Buy Bitcoin Instead "", we discussed the idea and explained that MSTR's borrowing capacity was reaching an upper limit, which meant that investors shouldn't pay up for the stock. With a significant premium to NAV, we didn't see the value in acquiring shares simply for CEO Michael Saylor's active treasury management strategy. At the time, MSTR was on a blisteringly hot run, and so our idea was met with a considerable amount of skepticism here on Seeking Alpha. Despite that, if you fast forward to today, the performance of MSTR since our 'Strong Sell' rating is basically flat. In contrast, Bitcoin is up more than 21%, which has led to a nice gain on the spread in less than half a year: Seeking Alpha Now, 4-5 months on, the picture has changed considerably. MSTR has continued to issue debt and buy bitcoin, striking deals for convertibles paying 0% coupon rates, showing just how much investor demand there is for long term 'call options' on MSTR's stock. At the same time, MSTR's NAV premium has shrunk considerably, which has significantly reduced the attractiveness of trying to squeeze more gains out of the trade idea. Altogether, it seems as though the time has come to call it a day with a 21% total net gain, start to finish, in this position. Today , we'll examine MSTR's current financial position, explore the stock's balance sheet dynamics, and explain why we think now is the right time to exit the 'long Bitcoin, short MSTR' trade. Sound good? Let's dive in. MSTR's Financials As always, let's begin with a quick look into MSTR's financials. Before getting into the numbers, however, it's probably worth laying out MSTR's treasury management strategy for those who are new to the stock (if there are any of those left). Assume that you could go back to 2013, and that you had $100,000 in your bank account in that year. What would you do with it? If you were smart, you'd invest it into Bitcoin, which was trading around $100 bucks per coin. This gets you out of a 'losing' currency and into a 'winning' currency. Monetarily, a $100k purchase in 2013 gets you 1,000 Bitcoins. In today's day and age, that would be worth roughly $85 million. Inflation adjusted, that's still $63 million in 2013 dollars. Not bad. If you held the cash in your account and didn't touch it, then you'd be down more than 37% in terms of buying power for key U.S. goods and services, as measured by the CPI: TradingView The lesson here is simple - USDs tend to lose value over time, and with a fixed supply and increasing utility, Bitcoins - so far - have mostly gained value over time. But what if you wanted to make the most amount of money that you could? If you were placed back in 2013, then you'd actually borrow as much USD as you could get your hands on to buy Bitcoin. The borrowed funds would cost you less to pay back in the future, and those funds would also grow into a much larger balance over time. This is how to make the 'most' from this dynamic, and it's exactly what Saylor has done with MSTR's treasury. On the asset side, most of MSTR's assets are invested into Bitcoins, which totaled 499,096 at last count. In today's USD terms, these are worth roughly $48.7 billion. With a cost basis of ~$33 billion and an average price of $66k, the strategy has worked out well so far, netting gains for the company. But to maximize earnings, MSTR has also issued convertible debt to get 'short' exposure to USD while boosting Bitcoin holdings even further. In essence, this is why the stock is so volatile - the huge BTC position that's partially purchased with borrowed money, and the inherent 'short' position in USD via convertible bonds: Saylorcharts.com The whole balance sheet is basically one big leveraged bet on BTC-USD prices moving higher. Let's quickly map out the value exchanges here because they're not immediately obvious. First , let's look at the convertible bondholders. Institutional investors who buy convertible bonds essentially give cash to MSTR. From there, MSTR invests that cash into Bitcoin. Recently, MSTR issued $2 billion in bonds for this purpose. In this case, investors aren't getting interest payments, they're getting a payout diagram similar to OTM call options. This essentially equates to MSTR getting cash now, investing it, and then potentially needing to pay out shares or cash in the future: If Bitcoin has increased in price, shares are issued and everyone is happy (minus some dilution). If Bitcoin has remained mostly flat or gone up in price, but not up to the conversion price, then MSTR has basically gotten a free loan to hold Bitcoin exposure long, and USD exposure short, over that period of time. The spread here could be significant enough to realize profits to MSTR shareholders. Finally, if Bitcoin goes down in price, then MSTR needs to sell more Bitcoin than they bought to pay back the loan. Again, bondholders essentially get long-dated call options on Bitcoin, even though they're paying through the nose for it. For stockholders, you'll likely suffer some dilution. However, given the exposure to both sides of BTC-USD, you get exposure to MSTR's underlying balance sheet positioning. Over the long run, this has proven to be a winning strategy. The risk here materializes if Bitcoin goes down in price precipitously and stays there. In this event, then MSTR may need to sell more Bitcoin than they bought to pay back the loan, which would lead to falling Bitcoin holdings and realized losses. Taken together, essentially, Saylor is betting that Bitcoin won't go down and remain down for a period of ~5 years or more on a rolling basis, based on where he's issuing convertible debt. If that happens, then shareholders might be in trouble, if the company begins realizing losses to pay back the leverage. This seems unlikely given the relatively conservative leverage profile, but this is how the whole MSTR machine operates. MSTR's Valuation Now - this is all good to know, but how does it relate to getting out of the short MSTR, long Bitcoin trade? Here's why. In the past, there were basically two reasons we thought the trade looked enticing: Borrowing capacity is capped out The NAV premium was getting extended Now that both of these conditions have relaxed, it's worth explaining why a pair trade no longer makes as much sense. First, the debt. In our initial article, we mentioned that MSTR's borrowing capacity was likely capped out, given that the legacy company cashflows were barely covering interest costs. However, since then, MSTR has issued $5 billion more in 0% coupon convertible bonds, with $3 billion in December and $2 billion recently . This is in addition to continued share dilution. We can't comment on how that bet will work out for bond buyers, but the core idea remains that there's considerable investor interest in buying MSTR bonds, even if they aren't interest paying. This means that MSTR can leverage as much as they would like in the coming years, and that they're no longer fundamentally constrained by underlying business cash flows. This means that the momentum the stock saw up to that point, and the leveraged Bitcoin exposure, can very well continue on into the future. The company may not have to sell off Bitcoins at a loss. Secondly, and more importantly, the NAV gap between MSTR's market cap and the underlying treasury assets has shrunk considerably, which was the core of where this long Bitcoin short MSTR trade would have made money. When we issued the trade idea, MSTR was trading at roughly 2.7 - 3.1x NAV, depending on whether you include the normal share count or the diluted share count: mstr-tracker.com Either way, it was an incredible premium for the stock. Now, with the ratio coming back in much closer to 1x, we'd argue that the 'juice' in this mean reversion spread trade has largely been squeezed. It just doesn't look as attractive now, with less 'upside' to 'Fair Value'. Plus, there's also the risk that the stock could come become permanently valued at a premium to book, which further shrinks the profit window. Summary All told, we think the time has come to call it quits on our earlier pair trade call, given how the market has changed over the last few months. We'll take the short-term, 21% win. Now, it's time to issue the ratings adjustments to get 'back to flat'. Hence, our upgrade of MSTR to a 'Hold' rating.

Shiba Inu’s price has tumbled from $0.000033 in November to $0.000016, hinting at further declines. At the same time, the Tron stagnation persists, with TRX hovering around $0.24 as the community anticipates a pivotal moment amid obstacles and regulatory scrutiny. Conversely, BlockDAG’s trajectory is on the rise, with over 16,000 miners purchased, generating over $6.5 million in revenue. This underscores the network’s appeal as a cost-effective and efficient mining solution. Miners, from novices to experts, are snapping up BlockDAG’s leading models in anticipation of the mainnet debut, eager to commence mining and increase their profits immediately. Shiba Inu Price Drop Indicates More Losses Ahead The recent Shiba Inu price drop is stark, with the asset declining from $0.000033 in November to about $0.000016 currently. This fall was preceded by a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating further drops are likely. Additionally, the Shiba Inu price drop has pushed the asset below a critical support point at $0.00001856, its lowest in December. Coupled with a “death cross” occurrence, where the 200-day and 50-day moving averages converge, it’s a strong predictor of additional downward trends, with the asset possibly reaching as low as $0.00001170. Tron Stagnation Presses On: Future Prospects for TRX? Tron (TRX) has remained around $0.24 for some time, leaving the community impatient as the asset struggles to surpass barriers. Despite active network usage, the persistent Tron stagnation is weakening confidence. Furthermore, analysts foresee a slight price reduction in February 2025, projecting a possible range of $0.23 to $0.24. While TRX navigates regulatory hurdles and updates, the continued Tron stagnation compels many to reconsider their strategies. BlockDAG’s Mining Frenzy: 16K+ Units Snapped Up! BlockDAG’s mining gear is flying off the shelves, with more than 16,000 units sold so far. This network provides a variety of mining choices, opening up an easy route to passive income. The network’s X1 Miner App is a mobile solution that lets users mine up to 20 BDAG per day, ideal for users at any skill level. For those aiming for bigger rewards, the X10 hardware miner connects with the app via Bluetooth to ramp up daily hauls to as much as 200 BDAG. The BlockDAG X30 allows for mining up to 600 BDAG daily, keeping its size compact and noise low, suited for many settings. The BlockDAG X100 escalates mining to a professional tier, pulling in up to 2,000 BDAG each day with advanced features for connectivity and cooling. With energy-saving and affordable options, BlockDAG’s tech significantly cuts mining expenses, boosting miners’ profits while reducing costs. Sales from these miners have poured over $6.5 million into the network’s impressive $198.6 million presale! With its robust presale success, experts foresee BDAG, now at $0.0248 in batch 27, soaring to $1 this year. Forward-thinking miners are already hoarding their preferred models, prepping to expand their BDAG reserves as soon as the mainnet goes live. Meanwhile, those eager to start earning can begin mining with the X1 and X10, as accumulating more BDAG coins means potentially higher returns. The Bottom Line The Shiba Inu price drop looks set to deepen, with further declines expected from technical patterns and crucial support failures. Likewise, Tron’s stagnation seems set to persist, its current inertia coupled with regulatory hurdles dampening enthusiasm. However, there’s a silver lining: BlockDAG’s X Series rigs are quickly becoming the top crypto miners out there, presenting lucrative opportunities for early birds. Currently, BDAG is priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, with projections of reaching $1 by 2025. Consequently, miners are rapidly acquiring BlockDAG’s rigs, eager to profit once the mainnet is operational. At the same time, crypto beginners are already amassing a significant BDAG collection using the X1 Miner App. For those looking at hefty gains in 2025, starting BDAG mining ahead of the curve could be a strategic play!

Traders are selling Solana at the same pace they did during the FTX collapse in 2022, raising speculation over whether the altcoin faces further downside or a price recovery lies ahead. Let’s explore what this oversold situation means for SOL price. Solana price today trades at $141 with a marginal increase of 1%. SOL is experiencing volatile swings with the price fluctuating between $130 and $142 in 24 hours. Solana Price Hits Extreme Oversold Levels After Crashing 40% The intense selling pressure caused by bearish trends across the broader crypto market has pushed Solana into extremely oversold territory. According to analyst Gnarleyquinn, Solana’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to levels usually seen during capitulation events. After the recent drop in Solana price, the RSI has tanked 40% to levels previously seen when the FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy. SOL also witnessed two other capitulation events in 2023 that forced the RSI to drop to these extreme levels. Solana RSI Usually, whenever the RSI drops to these record lows, it may precede a reversal to the upside. Analyst Raoul Pal outlined this potential rebound by pointing out that Solana price has breached the lower boundary of the logarithmic regression channel. This drop suggests the likelihood of a reversal. Looking at the past trends, whenever SOL reaches this level, it bounces back to the center of the midline, suggesting that a mean reversion is likely to happen. Solana Log Regression Channel If sellers are exhausted and buyers step in now to buy SOL at the current price, it may precede a bullish Solana price forecast . But how far can SOL rally? What’s Next For SOL – Recovery or Crash? Solana price has dropped to the lowest level since October 2024, as SOL bears take control . The price has also been consistently making lower lows, suggesting that the downward momentum is growing stronger. SOL has formed support at $134 and it is successfully defending this price level. If the downtrend continues and the extreme crowd bearishness pushes SOL below this support, a drop to $120 remains likely. Technical indicators also show that despite oversold conditions, SOL may be poised for another downtrend. The Average Directional Index is rising, suggesting the current downtrend is strong. The red Awesome Oscillator bars are also increasing in their length, indicating that the bearish momentum is accelerating. For the trend to reverse to the upside, SOL needs to flip resistance at $177, which will set the stage for a rally past $200. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Because of this bearish outlook, SOL price may not be poised for a recovery in the near term. A bullish reversal will only happen if greed replaces the current sentiment of fear in the market.

Interestingly, it has received the Binance HODLer airdrop listing, pumping the MyShell token price by 45% moments after the announcement. As the token kicks off in the market with hype, investors are eyeing the $1 milestone. Let’s discuss the listing details and SHELL’s further price action. MyShell Token Price Hit ATH on Binance HODLer Airdrop Listing The Binance team announced the SHELL listing just a few hours ago, and moments after that, the MyShell token price began to pump. Within a few hours, the token surged from $0.47 to an ATH of $0.6816 after a 45% surge. Additionally, it reached a market capitalization of $184.2M and a trading volume of $100.9M at its peak. According to the Binance listing announcement , the SHELL token will be listed for trading on February 27, 2025, at 13:00 UTC. This marks MyShell token as the 10th program on the Binance HOLDler airdrop. The exchange has announced the listing with trading pairs like BTC, USDT, USDC, BNB, FDUSD, and TRY. More importantly, BNB holders who subscribed to the Simple Earn (Flexible and Locked) or On-Chain Yield products between February 14 and February 18, 2025, could access the HODLer SHELL airdrop. 25M SHELL tokens, or 2.5% of the total supply, are allocated to this most awaited crypto airdrop , and another 25M are scheduled for distribution after six months of listing. These events could have a significant impact on the SHELL price. Will MyShell Token Price Hit $1? The SHELL price has consolidated slightly from the prime and currently trades at $0.6126. Despite the drop, it is 30% up today and 46% over the week. Considering its performance and investor demand, some experts believe in its potential to attain $1. SHELL is trending due to its status as an AI token in the current market. Additionally, the ongoing exchange listings would boost investor confidence with increased visibility and credibility. Meanwhile, the hype is building, around 27% of the token’s supply (270 M) is in circulation. Experts believe that it will likely grow with developments in the AI and Web3 sectors. More importantly, investor sentiments would play the most significant role in the MyShell price rally to $1. The token might achieve this target if its bullish momentum continues and market trends favor its growth. However, as it is already experiencing consolidation and the Binance HODLer airdrop will release millions of tokens, it might experience increased volatility. More importantly, investors’ selling sentiments could crash the price. Investors must carefully analyze all the possibilities and trade accordingly. What’s In There For You? The Binance HODLer airdrop listing has positioned the MyShell token for investors’ attention, and its price surged 45% right after the announcement. With SHELL’s involvement in the AI and Web3 industries, its token price is anticipated to witness significant rallies. However, that entirely depends on crypto market trends, investors, sentiments, etc. At the same time, the token possesses high volatility due to its recent launch and airdrop distribution. Investors must not jump into trading under FOMO and must do further research before doing so.

Two SOL ETFs Added to DTCC List! – What Does It Mean?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/solana-etf-approval-coming-two-sol-etfs-added-to-dtcc-list-what-does-it-mean/,"While the SEC already has ETF applications for altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC) before it, the SEC has agreed to consider EF applications for some altcoins. Among these is Solana, while fund manager Volatility Shares has registered two Solana futures ETFs with the US-based Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the tickers SOLZ and SOLT. This was the first Solana-based product to be included on DTCC's funding list. A DTCC listing is generally considered a positive signal for an ETF considering a listing. However, a DTCC listing is independent of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scrutiny and does not mean or guarantee listing. DTCC plays a very important role in the American ETF market. When an ETF is added to the DTCC list, it means that an intermediary bank has requested a DTCC designation for that ETF fund and DTCC may execute this transaction at an unspecified future date following SEC approval. But Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the listing is a strong sign that future ETFs could be coming for Solana. The timing of this development is critical, analysts said, adding that Solana remains vulnerable to downside risks. If regulatory clarity emerges and broader market sentiment improves, these ETFs could have a path to approval, providing an alternative investment avenue for SOL, potentially increasing institutional participation and stabilizing SOL's price, analysts say. *This is not investment advice.

40907495,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134922,1740655864,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding Mint Tokenomics: Unveiling the Explosive Potential of MINT Token,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/decoding-mint-tokenomics-mint-token/,"Excitement is brewing in the crypto sphere as Mint, the highly anticipated Ethereum layer-2 network, pulls back the curtain on the tokenomics of its native token, MINT. For those eager to understand the mechanics driving new crypto projects and investment opportunities, understanding tokenomics is paramount. Mint’s recent announcement via X (formerly Twitter) provides a crucial glimpse into the distribution and utility of MINT, setting the stage for its launch and future within the Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s dive deep into the specifics and explore what this means for the Mint network and its community. What are Mint Tokenomics and Why Should You Care? Tokenomics, a portmanteau of “token” and “economics,” essentially refers to the economics of a cryptocurrency token. It encompasses all aspects that influence the token’s supply, demand, distribution, and utility. Understanding Mint tokenomics is crucial because it provides insights into the long-term sustainability, value accrual, and governance of the Mint network. For potential users and investors, tokenomics can be a key indicator of a project’s viability and potential for growth. A well-designed tokenomic model can incentivize participation, reward early adopters, and ensure the network’s healthy development. Conversely, poorly designed tokenomics can lead to inflation, lack of engagement, and ultimately, project failure. So, paying close attention to the details is not just recommended, it’s essential for anyone looking to engage with the Mint ecosystem. MINT Token Distribution: A Closer Look Mint has laid out a clear distribution plan for its native MINT token , with a total initial supply capped at 1 billion tokens. This fixed supply is a common feature in many cryptocurrencies, aiming to create scarcity and potentially drive value over time. The distribution strategy is designed to balance the interests of various stakeholders, including the community, early contributors, the core team, and the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Let’s break down the allocation: MintDAO (50%): A significant half of the total supply is allocated to the MintDAO. This highlights Mint’s commitment to decentralization and community governance. The DAO will likely play a crucial role in future network upgrades, treasury management, and strategic decision-making. This substantial allocation empowers the community to shape the future direction of the Mint ecosystem. Early Contributors (20%): Recognizing the efforts of those who contributed to the project in its early stages, 20% of the MINT tokens are earmarked for early contributors. These individuals likely played a vital role in the development, testing, and initial promotion of the Mint network. Rewarding early contributors is a common practice in crypto projects to acknowledge their crucial early support and incentivize continued engagement. MintCore Team (18%): The MintCore team, responsible for building and maintaining the network, receives 18% of the token supply. This allocation is intended to incentivize the team’s ongoing work, development efforts, and long-term commitment to the Mint project. It’s typical for core teams to receive a portion of the token supply to align their incentives with the project’s success. Community Airdrop (12%): A noteworthy 12% of the MINT tokens are dedicated to a community crypto airdrop . Airdrops are a popular method in the crypto world to distribute tokens to a wider audience, increase awareness, and reward early community members. This airdrop signals Mint’s intention to foster a broad and engaged community right from the outset. Details regarding eligibility and distribution mechanisms for this airdrop are highly anticipated by the crypto community. To visualize this distribution, here’s a table summarizing the allocation: Allocation Percentage Amount (out of 1 Billion) Purpose MintDAO 50% 500 Million Decentralized Governance, Community Empowerment Early Contributors 20% 200 Million Reward Early Support and Contribution MintCore Team 18% 180 Million Incentivize Development and Long-Term Commitment Community Airdrop 12% 120 Million Community Growth, Awareness, Early Adoption Total 100% 1 Billion Why Choose an Ethereum Layer-2 Network Like Mint? Mint operates as an Ethereum layer-2 network. But what does this mean, and why is it significant? Ethereum, while being the leading blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps), faces challenges with scalability and transaction fees, especially during periods of high network activity. Layer-2 solutions are designed to address these limitations by processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain (layer-1) while still inheriting Ethereum’s security and decentralization. Here are some key benefits of Ethereum layer-2 networks like Mint: Scalability: Layer-2 networks can handle a significantly higher volume of transactions compared to the Ethereum mainnet, leading to faster transaction speeds and reduced congestion. Lower Transaction Fees: By processing transactions off-chain, layer-2 solutions dramatically reduce gas fees, making decentralized applications more accessible and affordable for users. Ethereum Security: Most layer-2 solutions are designed to leverage Ethereum’s robust security infrastructure, ensuring a high level of security for users and their assets. Improved User Experience: Faster transactions and lower fees contribute to a smoother and more user-friendly experience for interacting with dApps built on layer-2 networks. Mint, as an Ethereum layer-2, aims to provide these advantages, potentially attracting developers and users looking for a more scalable and cost-effective environment for their decentralized applications. The unveiling of Mint tokenomics is a crucial step in solidifying its position within the competitive layer-2 landscape. The Role of MintDAO in Governance The allocation of 50% of the MINT token supply to the MintDAO underscores the project’s strong emphasis on decentralized governance. DAOs are becoming increasingly important in the crypto space, representing a shift towards community-driven decision-making. The MintDAO will likely empower MINT token holders to participate in key governance processes, potentially including: Protocol Upgrades: Voting on proposals for network improvements, feature additions, and protocol modifications. Treasury Management: Deciding how the DAO’s treasury funds are allocated, potentially for ecosystem development, grants, or marketing initiatives. Strategic Direction: Influencing the overall strategic direction of the Mint network through proposals and voting. Parameter Adjustments: Potentially adjusting network parameters, such as transaction fees or inflation rates (if applicable in the future). The significant allocation to the MintDAO suggests that Mint aims to be a truly community-governed project, fostering a sense of ownership and shared responsibility among MINT token holders. This decentralized approach can be a major draw for users who value transparency and community involvement in the projects they support. What’s Next for Mint and the MINT Token? The unveiling of the tokenomics is a significant milestone for Mint. Looking ahead, several key aspects will be crucial to observe: Airdrop Details: The crypto community is eagerly awaiting further details about the community airdrop. Information regarding eligibility criteria, distribution dates, and claiming mechanisms will be highly anticipated. Token Utility: Beyond governance, the utility of the MINT token within the Mint ecosystem will be a key factor in its value and adoption. Will it be used for transaction fees, staking, or accessing specific features within the network? Clear utility will be essential. Ecosystem Development: The growth of the Mint ecosystem, including the number of dApps built on the network and the overall user adoption, will be critical for the long-term success of both Mint and the MINT token. Competition in Layer-2: The Ethereum layer-2 space is becoming increasingly competitive. Mint will need to differentiate itself and demonstrate its unique value proposition to attract users and developers amidst strong competition. Conclusion: A Promising Start for Mint Mint’s unveiling of its Mint tokenomics provides a comprehensive overview of the MINT token’s distribution and lays the groundwork for a decentralized and community-driven Ethereum layer-2 network. The allocation strategy, with a strong emphasis on the MintDAO and a community crypto airdrop , signals a commitment to decentralization and broad participation. As Mint progresses towards its launch and ecosystem development, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how these tokenomics translate into real-world adoption and network growth. The initial signs are promising, suggesting Mint is poised to become a significant player in the evolving Ethereum layer-2 landscape. The explosive potential of the MINT token and the Mint network hinges on successful execution and continued community engagement.

The provided chart suggests that ETH could mirror past capitulation events from April and August, potentially bottoming out below $1,000. If history repeats itself, such a steep decline might be followed by a strong rebound, but only if macroeconomic conditions align favorably. Not to forget that the Federal Reserve’s stance on quantitative easing (QE) is a critical factor influencing ETH’s outlook. Currently, no signs indicate that the Fed is ready to inject liquidity into markets, which could worsen the downward trend. If this tight monetary policy continues, Ethereum could fall below $1,500 and can go toward $1,200 or even sub-$1,000 before stabilizing. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Down Today?

According to a forensic report by security firm Sygnia, the perpetrators exploited a flaw in Safe{Wallet}’s system, enabling unauthorized access to the wallet. This breach resulted in the transfer of approximately 401,000 Ethereum to an unidentified address, marking one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts to date. Immediate Response and Assurance In the wake of the attack, Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, sought to reassure users by stating, “Bybit is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered; all of clients’ assets are 1 to 1 backed; we can cover the loss.” This statement emphasizes the company’s financial resilience and commitment to safeguarding user assets. Despite the breach, Bybit has processed over 580,000 withdrawal requests since the incident, indicating operational continuity and user trust. Ongoing Investigations and Security Enhancements Bybit is actively collaborating with blockchain forensic experts to trace the stolen funds and has launched a recovery bounty program. This initiative offers up to 10% of the recovered amount to ethical hackers who assist in retrieving the stolen cryptocurrency. Additionally, the company is conducting a comprehensive review of its security protocols, particularly those related to third-party integrations like Safe{Wallet}, to prevent future incidents. Broader Implications for the Crypto Industry This breach highlights the vulnerabilities that can exist within third-party services and the cascading effects they can have on associated platforms. It serves as a stark reminder for cryptocurrency exchanges and users alike to prioritize security, conduct regular audits, and exercise caution when integrating external services. The incident also adds to the growing list of significant cryptocurrency thefts, with over $2.2 billion stolen from crypto platforms in 2024 alone, emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures across the industry.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-27 11:32:00

The Starknet network, a leading zk-rollup scaling solution for Ethereum, has just dropped a major update on its testnet. Version 0.13.4 is now live, packed with features designed to significantly boost performance, reduce costs, and improve the developer experience. This release marks a crucial step forward for Starknet as it prepares to enhance its Mainnet capabilities. Let’s dive into what makes this testnet release so significant and what it means for the future of Ethereum scaling. What’s New in Starknet v0.13.4 Testnet Release? Starknet v0.13.4 isn’t just a minor update; it’s a powerhouse of enhancements focused on making the network faster, cheaper, and more developer-friendly. Let’s break down the key features that are now available on the testnet release : Cairo-Native: Unleashing Smart Contract Efficiency Precise Fee Calculation with Layer-2 Gas Pricing Stateful Compression: Lowering Storage Costs Developer Experience Enhancements Each of these features plays a vital role in optimizing Starknet’s performance and usability. Let’s explore each one in detail. Cairo-Native: Supercharging Smart Contract Processing One of the most anticipated features in this release is Cairo-Native. Cairo is Starknet’s programming language, and Cairo-Native represents a significant leap in its execution efficiency. Essentially, Cairo-Native allows for more direct and faster processing of smart contracts on Starknet. Why is this a big deal? Increased Speed: By optimizing the execution environment, Cairo-Native dramatically speeds up smart contract processing. Transactions will be confirmed faster, leading to a smoother user experience. Reduced Latency: Faster processing translates to lower latency. This is crucial for applications that require quick interactions, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and high-frequency gaming. Enhanced Scalability: With more efficient processing, Starknet can handle a higher volume of transactions, further solidifying its position as a leading zk-rollup solution. Imagine decentralized applications (dApps) on Starknet running with the responsiveness of centralized applications. Cairo-Native is a key component in making this vision a reality. Precise Fee Calculation: Introducing Layer-2 Gas Pricing Gas fees are a constant topic in the crypto world, especially on Ethereum. Starknet v0.13.4 introduces a more refined approach to fee calculation with layer-2 gas pricing. This means fees on Starknet will be more predictable and accurately reflect the actual computational cost of transactions within the Ethereum layer-2 environment. What are the benefits of layer-2 gas pricing? Predictable Fees: Users will have a clearer understanding of transaction costs before submitting them. This predictability is essential for user confidence and budgeting within dApps. Fair Pricing: Fees will be more closely aligned with the resources consumed by each transaction on Starknet, ensuring a fairer system for all users. Optimized Cost Efficiency: By accurately reflecting computational costs, layer-2 gas pricing contributes to the overall cost efficiency of using Starknet, making it a more attractive option for developers and users seeking to minimize transaction expenses compared to mainnet Ethereum. This enhanced fee mechanism is a significant step towards making Starknet even more user-friendly and cost-effective for everyday transactions and complex dApp interactions. Stateful Compression: Minimizing Storage Footprint and Costs Storage costs are a significant factor in blockchain operations. Starknet v0.13.4 introduces stateful compression, a clever technique to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on the network. By compressing state data, Starknet can lower its storage footprint and, consequently, reduce operational costs. How does stateful compression help? Reduced Infrastructure Costs: Less storage space required means lower infrastructure expenses for node operators and the network as a whole. These savings can potentially be passed on to users in the long run. Improved Network Efficiency: Smaller state size can lead to faster data retrieval and processing, contributing to overall network efficiency. Scalability Enhancement: By managing state data more effectively, stateful compression supports the long-term scalability of the Starknet network, allowing it to grow and handle increasing amounts of data and activity as an Ethereum layer-2 solution. Stateful compression is a behind-the-scenes optimization that has tangible benefits for the entire Starknet ecosystem, contributing to its sustainability and scalability. Enhanced Developer Experience: Making Building on Starknet Easier A thriving ecosystem relies on a positive developer experience. Starknet v0.13.4 includes several enhancements specifically aimed at making life easier for developers building on the platform. While specific details of these enhancements were not explicitly listed in the announcement, improvements in developer tools, documentation, and debugging capabilities are typically part of such updates. Why focus on developer experience? Faster Development Cycles: Improved tools and documentation shorten development time, allowing developers to bring their dApps to market quicker. Lower Barrier to Entry: Easier-to-use tools and clearer documentation make Starknet more accessible to a wider range of developers, fostering innovation and growth within the ecosystem. Higher Quality dApps: A better developer experience often translates to higher quality, more robust, and user-friendly decentralized applications being built on Starknet. Investing in developer experience is crucial for the long-term success of any blockchain platform, and Starknet’s commitment to this is evident in this update. Road to Mainnet: What to Expect Next? The release of v0.13.4 on the testnet release is a significant milestone, and the Starknet team has indicated that the Mainnet launch is expected between March 17 and 24. This timeline suggests a relatively swift transition, indicating confidence in the stability and performance of the new version after testnet release feedback and iterations. Key Takeaways for the Mainnet Launch: Anticipated Timeline: Keep an eye out for announcements between March 17 and 24 for the official Mainnet launch of v0.13.4. Potential Impact on STRK: Successful Mainnet launch and adoption of these enhanced features could positively impact the perception and value of Starknet’s native token, STRK. Ecosystem Growth: The improved performance and developer experience are expected to attract more developers and users to the Starknet ecosystem, leading to further growth and innovation. Conclusion: A Powerful Upgrade for Starknet and Ethereum Scaling Starknet v0.13.4 is a substantial upgrade that underscores Starknet’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of zk-rollup technology and Ethereum layer-2 scaling. With features like Cairo-Native, precise fee calculation, and stateful compression, this release promises to deliver significant improvements in performance, cost-efficiency, and developer experience. As Starknet prepares for its Mainnet launch, the crypto community is watching with anticipation, eager to see the real-world impact of these powerful enhancements on the network and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This update not only boosts Starknet’s capabilities but also contributes to the overall advancement of blockchain scalability solutions, paving the way for a more efficient and accessible decentralized future.

The agency confirmed that North Korea’s infamous hacking unit, commonly referred to as the Lazarus Group, orchestrated the massive theft. In a public service announcement on Feb. 26, the FBI identified the operation under its internal codename “TraderTraitor,” a designation previously used in an April 2022 statement to describe cyberattacks linked to the North Korean state-sponsored group . The agency noted that the stolen funds are rapidly being converted into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through decentralized platforms, making them harder to trace. “It is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually converted to fiat currency,” the FBI warned, stressing that exchanges and blockchain firms must act swiftly to prevent further laundering. Millions Already Laundered in Bybit Hack Blockchain investigators tracking the stolen assets have revealed that the Bybit hackers have already laundered more than 135,000 Ether since the Feb. 21 breach. Most of these funds were in liquid-staked Ether tokens, according to crypto analyst EmberCN. Despite the rapid movement of funds, a significant portion of the loot remains untouched. Roughly 363,900 Ether, valued at around $825 million, has not been moved since the initial theft, raising concerns over when and how the hackers plan to cash out. Crypto forensics firm Chainalysis reported that the attackers have been using a combination of decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and anonymous swap services to convert portions of the stolen Ether into Bitcoin and stablecoins like Dai (DAI). These methods allow them to sidestep Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, complicating law enforcement efforts. Over 11,000 Wallets Flagged as Suspicious The FBI has shared a list of 51 Ethereum addresses suspected of being controlled by the hackers, instructing crypto service providers to block transactions from these wallets. Meanwhile, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has flagged an even larger network of 11,084 wallets potentially tied to the Bybit exploit . Authorities have urged anyone with relevant information to report it to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center. With the stolen funds still largely within reach, the crypto industry now faces a crucial test in its fight against cybercrime.

KAITO Price Bullish As It Secures Coinbase Listing KAITO price rallies as its perpetual listing on one of the top crypto exchanges substantially uplifts the asset’s market sentiment. Via an official X post on February 27, the Coinbase International Exchange revealed that the KAITO-PERP market is now in full trading mode. In turn, the token’s price rallied amid heightened money influx due to investors capitalizing on emerging market opportunities. For context, Coinbase’s colossal user base is poised to partake in ‘limit, market, stop, and stop-limit’ orders starting today. These enhanced trade offerings bullishly impact asset prices, as seen via past chronicles. Binance previously unveiled enhanced trade offerings for KAITO , urging a bullish impact on its price. The crypto exchange unveiled new spot trade offerings and bots services on February 24, following which the token witnessed gains worth 75% to date. While this broader price surge may be attributable to a stockpile of factors encompassing the project’s recent airdrop, it’s noteworthy that new listings on crypto exchange giants usually uplift market sentiments. What’s More In The Coinbase Announcement? Simultaneously, it’s also worth mentioning that Coinbase also launched perp listings for two other tokens on the same day. The listing announcement revealed that perp contracts for Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) and B3 (B3) are also in full trading mode starting today. With VIRTUAL-PERP and B3-PERP markets now live, investor sentiments surrounding these tokens have also reflected optimism. VIRTUAL price witnessed a 3% uptick amid its perp listing, resting at $1.13. B3 price shot up by 7% amid its new listing, closing in at $0.006416. How Is KAITO Price Holding? As of press time, KAITO price surged nearly 33% and exchanged hands at $2.77. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $1.97 and $2.92 in the past 24 hours. Notably, the traders also appear to have reacted positively to the listing announcement, as signaled by a 183.45% increase in the intraday trading volume to $2.06 billion. Overall, market watchers are optimistic about the token amid recent advancements. Intriguingly, KAITO price prediction by CoinGape revealed that the token is forming a bullish engulfing pattern in the weekly technical chart. This suggests that the coin is witnessing strong momentum in favor of buyers. In light of the abovementioned developments, market watchers expect a retest of the coin’s ATH of $3, with potential gains ahead.

The announcement follows the company’s fourth-quarter 2024 earnings report , which disclosed a net loss of $265.5 million. On February 26, Core Scientific published its Q4 and full-year financial results for 2024, attributing the significant loss primarily to a $224.7 million “non-cash mark-to-market adjustment” related to warrants and contingent value right liabilities. The company clarified that the loss did not reflect actual cash outflows but was an accounting adjustment due to the sharp increase in its stock price over the past year. Major Expansion Amid Financial Losses Despite its financial struggles, Core Scientific is moving forward with an ambitious data center expansion project in Texas. The company expects the initiative to generate $1.2 billion in contracted revenue, reinforcing its strategic shift toward application-specific data centers designed for high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, including AI. Core Scientific noted that the partnership with CoreWeave could ultimately lead to over $10 billion in cumulative revenue opportunities. “We are thrilled to deepen our relationship with CoreWeave as we continue developing large-scale HPC projects that power advanced AI and other low-latency workloads,” CEO Adam Sullivan said. As part of the expansion, Core Scientific is increasing its capacity in Denton, Texas, aiming to build “one of the largest GPU supercomputers in North America.” Today, Core Scientific and @CoreWeave announced a $1.2 billion expansion at Core Scientific's Denton, Texas site. -Core Scientific and CoreWeave announce 70-megawatt (MW) expansion at the Denton, TX site -Expands to ~ 590 MW of contracted HPC infrastructure across 6 sites… pic.twitter.com/8Mz0mlcKa6 — Core Scientific (@Core_Scientific) February 26, 2025 Following the announcement, Core Scientific’s stock price surged by 12.29% in after-hours trading, rising from $10 to $11.25, according to Google Finance data . The move highlights a growing trend among Bitcoin mining firms diversifying into AI and high-performance computing. Companies like Hive Digital, Hut 8, and Iris Energy have already pivoted part of their operations toward AI hosting, according to asset manager VanEck. Similarly, Bitcoin miner TeraWulf recently sold its stake in a mining facility for $92 million to focus on AI infrastructure. US Dominates Bitcoin Mining with Over 40% of Global Hashrate At the close of 2024, the United States solidified its position as a leader in Bitcoin mining, accounting for over 40% of the global hashrate — the total computing power securing the Bitcoin network. U.S.-based mining pools Foundry USA and MARA Pool played a significant role, collectively mining more than 38.5% of all Bitcoin blocks. Foundry USA increased its hashrate from 157 exahashes per second (EH/s) at the beginning of the year to approximately 280 EH/s by December. The growth cemented Foundry USA’s position as the largest mining pool globally, with control over 36.5% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate. As reported, Jack Dorsey’s Block has also announced plans to ramp up investments in its Bitcoin mining initiative and self-custody Bitcoin wallet. At the time, the company said it would reallocate resources from its canceled “Web5” project, TBD, and cut investments in the music-streaming service, Tidal, to support this move.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana’s speed, low fees, and expanding ecosystem position it as a strong contender for blockchain dominance in 2025. Table of Contents What gives Solana an edge? Challenges and market positioning How BeerBear compares to Solana’s growth strategy Investor considerations and future outlook Conclusion Solana has established itself as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchain networks, offering high-speed transactions and low fees. As the cryptocurrency market looks ahead, Solana’s scalability and expanding ecosystem are positioning it as a strong contender in the next phase of blockchain growth. With increasing institutional adoption, decentralized applications (dApps), and developer engagement, analysts are considering whether Solana could outperform other leading cryptocurrencies in the coming year. What gives Solana an edge? Solana’s primary advantage lies in its unique proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism, which allows it to process transactions at lightning speed. Unlike Ethereum, which has faced congestion and high gas fees, Solana is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second with minimal costs. This efficiency has attracted developers and projects looking for scalable blockchain solutions, leading to a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, gaming projects, and NFT marketplaces on the Solana network. Another factor contributing to Solana’s growth is its expanding ecosystem. The blockchain has gained traction as a hub for NFT activity, with platforms like Magic Eden driving strong trading volumes. Additionally, projects within the DeFi space, such as Serum and Raydium, continue to enhance Solana’s reputation as a high-performance network for decentralized exchanges and liquidity providers. Challenges and market positioning Despite its rapid growth, Solana has faced some network stability concerns. Past outages have raised questions about the blockchain’s reliability, prompting ongoing efforts to improve its infrastructure . Developers are actively working on upgrades to enhance network resilience and prevent future disruptions, ensuring that Solana remains a viable alternative to Ethereum and other competitors. Competition within the smart contract space remains intense, with Ethereum implementing layer-2 scaling solutions and networks like Avalanche and Cardano vying for market share. However, Solana’s combination of speed, affordability, and growing adoption gives it a competitive advantage as the industry moves forward. You might also like: SOL, ETH, BeerBear: Trending altcoins positioned for significant gains How BeerBear compares to Solana’s growth strategy While Solana focuses on speed and scalability, emerging projects like BeerBear take a different approach by integrating blockchain gaming and decentralized incentives. Unlike Solana, which caters to developers and institutional users, BeerBear is designed for community-driven participation through its play-to-earn gaming model. BeerBear’s structured presale model, starting at $0.0004 and increasing to $0.0020, ensures a transparent growth strategy. The “Bar Brawl” game within the ecosystem enhances engagement by allowing users to earn in-game tokens and NFTs. While Solana aims to optimize blockchain performance, BeerBear provides a more interactive and reward-driven experience, attracting users looking for an engaging crypto environment. Investor considerations and future outlook Investors tracking Solana’s progress are evaluating key factors such as network improvements, developer adoption, and continued institutional interest. With ongoing updates to its blockchain infrastructure, Solana is expected to enhance its reliability while maintaining its position as a preferred network for dApps and DeFi platforms. At the same time, newer projects like BeerBear highlight the potential for blockchain-based gaming and user engagement. While Solana emphasizes transaction speed and network performance, BeerBear’s approach to play-to-earn gaming offers a different perspective on crypto utility. Conclusion Solana’s high-speed transactions and expanding ecosystem make it a strong candidate in 2025. As the blockchain space evolves, its continued development and adoption will play a key role in its market trajectory. Meanwhile, projects like BeerBear illustrate how different approaches to blockchain utility, whether through gaming incentives or decentralized finance, can shape the future of digital assets. Whether through high-performance networks like Solana or interactive ecosystems like BeerBear, the cryptocurrency market continues to offer diverse opportunities for investors and developers alike.

Over $400 million from Bybit ‘s $1.46 billion incident was laundered in just days, with analysts at blockchain forensic firm TRM Labs now raising serious concerns that North Korea may have expanded its laundering operations. In a Feb. 27 blog post , the analysts pointed out that Bybit’s attackers moved nearly half a billion in less than a week, using intermediary wallets, crypto swaps, decentralized exchanges, and cross-chain bridges to hide the trail. “This rapid laundering suggests that North Korea has either expanded its money laundering infrastructure or that underground financial networks, particularly in China, have enhanced their capacity to absorb and process illicit funds.” TRM Labs You might also like: ‘Blind signing is an issue, but not the prime suspect’ expert says on Bybit $1.4b saga The analysts note that North Korean hackers typically use crypto mixers to hide stolen funds before cashing out. But the scale of the Bybit incident has forced them to adopt new methods. Instead of mixers, they are now using multiple wallets and decentralized platforms to obscure the money trail. Initially, some stolen Ethereum was sent through BNB Chain and Solana . Now, most of it has been sent to the Bitcoin network. Despite the quick laundering, much of the Bitcoin remains untouched, suggesting the attackers are preparing for large-scale liquidation through OTC networks, the analysts suggest.

Total2 making higher lows Source: TradingView The Total2 chart tracks the combined market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC. It can be seen how the market cap fell through the horizontal levels that lined up with the top of the bull flag, which was a really bearish event. However, a series of higher lows are being made, even if at the same time a series of lower highs are being recorded. The local downtrend is evident, and in order to start breaking this, a higher high beyond $1.29 trillion will need to be achieved. A top forming for Bitcoin dominance? Source: TradingView The Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) displays the inability of dominance to hold above the 61.6% resistance. A topping pattern could be playing out, and it might be expected that dominance falls to the bottom of the channel at around 59%. Also, the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing a potential crossover of the indicator lines. If the crossover does take place, this will push dominance down, perhaps even as far as horizontal support at 57%. A bounce coming for $ETH Source: TradingView Among all the altcoins, as far as size of market cap goes, there is nothing the size of Ethereum. Therefore, for an altcoin rally, $ETH must also go up. The weekly chart shows how $ETH is managing to stay above the major horizontal support band, which stretches from $2,150 to $2,350. This also lines up with the bull market trendline support. If this structure fails, there is a much higher likelihood of an entry into a bear market. That said, it’s holding. Also, at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is bottoming.

Its primary role will be to develop legislation, oversee policy implementation, and collaborate with other countries to create standardized frameworks for cryptocurrency regulation. Pakistan’s Attitude Towards Crypto Changes Pakistan’s Finance Ministry had until last year opposed cryptocurrency regulation, citing financial stability concerns. However, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb recently signaled a more open-minded approach, stressing the need for a well-regulated digital asset framework. Aurangzeb’s exchange comes after a meeting with a foreign delegation reportedly including President Donald Trump’s digital asset advisors. The discussions focused on global crypto regulations and potential policy frameworks that could bring Pakistan in line with other crypto-friendly countries. Countries around the world are increasingly looking to the United States for regulatory guidance as the Trump administration has pushed for more favorable crypto policies since the former president’s re-election.

A closer look at on-chain metrics show that some crypto whales still hold tokens that have crashed this year, a sign that they expect their prices to recover. This article explores some of these whale-supported-altcoins that may help you turn $500 to $500k. 3 Altcoins that Crypto Whales Have Not Sold Whales are crypto investors who hold substantial tokens and are often seen as highlight experienced smart money professionals. There are higher chances that crypto tokens whose whales have not sold their tokens will bounce back faster. Some of these tokens to consider are SPX6900 (SPX), Pepe (PEPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Murad , a popular crypto analyst, found these altcoins. Crypto Whales Have Not Sold These Altcoin SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 is an Ethereum and Solana meme coin that argues that it will beat the S&P 500 index because 6,900 is a bigger number than the S&P 500 index. It is one of the top coins with a large accumulation of whales. 23% of the SPX coin whales have never sold a coin. More data shows that the most SPX profit leaders are still holding most of their tokens. As shown below, the most profitable SPX trader has made $10 million and has only realized a $28,734 profit. He still holds 95% of his total tokens. Similarly, the other most profitable SPX traders have continued to hold the token even as its price crashed. This whale activity is a sign that the SPX6900 token price will likely bounce back. SPX Whales are Stil Holding Pepe Coin Pepe coin is another altcoin whose many crypto whales have never sold their tokens. These whales continue to hold the coin even after it has crashed by double digits this year. 17% of these whales still have the token in their portfolios. Pepe coin has a higher chance of bouncing back, as a recent report showed that Pepe whales were on a buying spree . A technical analysis published on Wednesday showed that the Pepe price could surge by 245% after forming a falling wedge pattern and a bullish divergence. It has also become a cheap coin, with its MVRV-Z score moving to the opportunity zone. Pepe Coin Price Has Formed a Falling Wedge Pattern Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin is a top altcoin that top crypto whales are yet to sell their tokens even after falling by 88% and moving near its all-time low. 11.1% of the Fartcoin whales have never sold a single coin since its inception in 2024. This means that these whales rode the FARTCOIN price surge from $0.01423 in October last year to $2.73 and its crash to $0.01423. That is a sign that they expect the price to potentially soar by 772% to its all-time high. Other Altcoins Whales Have Not Sold There are a few more coins whose whales have never dumped a token, meaning that they may bounce back in the next crypto bull run.

The 2024 Bitcoin halving event drastically increased MARA's total cost per BTC, highlighting the inherent volatility and challenges in the Bitcoin mining industry. Despite MARA's efforts in efficiency and vertical integration, the company remains heavily reliant on BTC's exponential price rise and favorable external conditions. Given the structural risks in Bitcoin mining, including rising costs and regulatory uncertainties, I recommend a ""sell"" rating for MARA. MARA Holdings ( MARA ) specializes in cryptocurrency mining, with a focus on Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company generates revenue primarily through mining Bitcoin. This is accomplished by MARA’s “mining rigs” (computers) that are designed to solve the mathematical puzzles required for Bitcoin mining. The company houses the mining rigs in “data centers” in locations such as Ohio and Texas. These centers provide the power and cooling systems necessary to keep equipment running efficiently. Mining Bitcoin is expensive and energy-intensive , which is why MARA is also focused on vertically integrating into renewable energy (e.g., excess natural gas and wind farms ). To break it down, MARA is predominately dependent on 1) its ability to efficiently mint Bitcoins, 2) the value of Bitcoin, and 3) the availability of unmined Bitcoins. Let’s address each point more in detail below. 1) Ability to Efficiently Mint Bitcoins Data compiled from MARA press releases (Author) MARA’s profitability is dependent on how efficiently it can mine Bitcoin. This involves minimizing the costs associated with electricity, equipment, and operations. MARA aims to maximize (increase) its “hash rate,” or computational power. During January 2025 , MARA mined 750 Bitcoins, averaging 24.2 BTC per day, with a hash rate at 53.2 EH/second. Notably, this represented a 13% M/M decline in BTC production, lending to MARA’s stock declining by nearly 8% following the update. The company attributed the decline to “fluctuations in network difficulty and intermittent curtailment.” In Q3 , MARA mined 2,070 Bitcoins, or 22.5 per day (down 2% Q/Q). Their cost of revenues for “mining and hosting” were $97.527 million the same quarter. This implies that it cost MARA $47,114 per BTC (total, including “direct energy”). In Q2 , MARA mined 2,058 Bitcoins ( $45,620 per BTC ). In Q1 , MARA mined 2,811 Bitcoins ( $32,092 per BTC ). The drastic change between Q1 and Q2 in total cost per BTC was primarily the result of the Bitcoin halving event that occurred in April 2024. This event reduced block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This results in miners receiving fewer Bitcoins for the same amount of computational work. The halving event is a fundamental design of Bitcoin. It aims to combat inflation and control supply. Halving events occur every 4 years until the total supply of Bitcoin (~21 million) is reached. The market responded to the 2024 halving event by ""one-thirding"" MARA’s stock. It recovered soon thereafter, but has since fallen below April lows. Seeking Alpha In Q4 , MARA mined 2,492 Bitcoins ( $52,335 per BTC ). MARA highlights the “direct energy cost per Bitcoin” as a key performance indicator. For Q4, this figure was $28,801, which is below industry average, but not the best. However, I am more interested in ""total cost per Bitcoin"" as energy costs alone do not capture the full picture (e.g., mining, hosting, infrastructure, and maintenance, security, etc.). 2) Exposure to Bitcoin’s Market Value Thanks to BTC increase in value from October 1 ($60,858) to December 31 ($93,460), MARA reported an operating income of $341.027 million in Q4 ($442.918 million “change in fair value of digital assets”). MARA YTD, however, BTC has declined 10% and, yesterday, “ crossed below its 200-day EMA .” Seeking Alpha So, it goes without saying that MARA’s financial performance is highly levered to the price to BTC, which is inherently unpredictable. What is Bitcoin? It’s important to define it as objectively as possible. To put it simply, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables global peer-to-peer transactions. It operates on a public ledger (“blockchain”). Where is Bitcoin’s price heading in the future? Well, no one knows. Many speculate that increased institutional adoption and favorable regulatory developments could boost its value. There are also some risks. For instance, in 2021, China banned all cryptocurrency transactions due to its “ ties to fraud, money laundering, and excessive energy use. ” Bitcoin’s value fell 8% immediately following the ban. Bitcoin remains banned in China to this day, among other countries. In the past, we have seen security breaches in major cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., FTX). Macroeconomic uncertainties (e.g., inflation, tariffs, geopolitical tension) also steer investors away from volatile assets like Bitcoin. Just last week, a Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange, Bybit, revealed it was the victim of a hack that stole $1.5 billion worth of digital currency. In the U.S., President Donald Trump, who was a very vocal supporter of Bitcoin during his campaign trail (e.g., “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve”), has since become quiet . Recently, some have speculated that quantum computing , while still in nascent stages, could serve as a threat to Bitcoin if the digital currency fails to evolve from its “ traditional cryptographic methods ,” leaving ""trillions"" of dollars at risk in the event of a successful ""quantum hack."" To summarize, Bitcoin is still a fragile currency that relies on good macroeconomic conditions to thrive. At the end of 2023, MARA held just over 15,000 BTC. As of the last update, its BTC holdings (including loaned and collateralized) increased to 44,893. In addition to mining, MARA also buys Bitcoin. In Q4, MARA purchased 15,574 BTC. For the full year, MARA acquired “22,065 Bitcoin at an average price of $87,205.” This implies minimal hedging of Bitcoin price risk. This is quite risky. MARA has sold BTC in the past to fund its operations (e.g., 2023 ), but prefers to hold and is intentionally “long BTC.” So, MARA’s exposure to Bitcoin has two major implications. For starters, its mining revenues fluctuate with the BTC price. Second, its large balance sheet holdings (using ""fair value accounting"") amplify net income volatility. 3) Availability of Unmined Bitcoins Recall that Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins. Most coins have already been mined , with just ~1.1 million BTC remaining. The remaining 5% will be gradually mined, by many players, over the next 100+ years due to halving events. It’s a double-edged sword. Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity is expected to increase its value over time. However, this also means that there is a declining flow of new Bitcoins to earn for mining companies like MARA. It also means that it is an imperative for BTC to rise. It must rise, bigly and continuously, to be worth mining. In addition to all of this, Bitcoin’s network difficulty (a measure of how hard it is to mine a block) is always increasing . Mining companies must outpace the network to increase its share of newly mined BTC. So far, MARA has done a solid job outpacing the network and increasing its share. MARA Financial Health As of December 31, MARA had a combined unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and BTC of $4.575 billion. The vast majority of this is investment in Bitcoin. At the time of writing, MARA has not yet provided much detail on their balance sheet. Going off their 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, MARA had only $59.789 million in total current liabilities. They owed $618.683 million in long-term “notes payable.” Total stockholders’ equity was $2.856 billion. MARA's financial health is well, and their balance sheet can weather short-term hardships should they arise. MARA Stock: Balanced Take & Investment Recommendation Author I am cautious on MARA (“ sell ” and “market underperform”) because for it to achieve long-term success in Bitcoin mining, several external factors, entirely outside of their control , must align perfectly. Due to halving events every four years, BTC must appreciate significantly to compensate for the 50% drops in mining rewards. And I’m not talking about “stabilizing” or narrowly outperforming the S&P 500. We are talking massive and consistent price appreciation. Second, global energy prices must stay low. Electricity is MARA’s largest cost. If global energy prices rise (e.g., due to wars, trade wars, inflation, supply chain disruptions, etc.), mining costs could outpace BTC price gains. Third, the regulatory environment must be favorable (e.g., no major taxes, bans, energy restrictions). This, too, is a double-edged sword. The more Bitcoin is adopted by the mainstream, the more pressure there will be to regulate it. In fact, it has been argued that some degree of regulation is required for Bitcoin to become mainstream. Fourth, institutional adoption needs to steadily increase to improve liquidity and demand. This will help keep BTC prices appreciating. In addition to these external factors, MARA needs to execute perfectly by investing in advanced mining hardware, optimizing energy consumption, and outpacing the network and its competitors. In summation, bitcoin mining is a tough, high-cost business with diminishing returns due to halving events and rising competition. MARA is heavily leveraged on BTC’s price rising exponentially. Even if stagnates, or increases only marginally, over the next four years, the company could face long-term unprofitability. Finally, regulatory and energy risks are very real, and, in my view, MARA lacks a diversified revenue base to protect them from prolonged bear markets. Critically, MARA’s tiny $13.8 million R&D investment in 2024 implies a heavy reliance on existing mining technology rather than developing proprietary advancements. It signals short-term thinking in an industry that demands continuous innovation to stay profitable post-halving events. Recall that BTC was Risks to Thesis There are several risks to my “sell” recommendation. Although Bitcoin’s mining difficulty climbs at a relentless pace, MARA was able to scale its own hash rate by 100%+ in 12 months to maintain, and even grow, share. Although Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, MARA has been focused on efficiency and vertical integration to control its energy costs. Its direct energy cost of $28.8k per Bitcoin is on the low end of industry production costs. Although MARA is dependent on regulatory developments, the regulatory landscape, at least in the U.S., appears to be improving and the Trump administration, at least in words, is crypto-friendly. Institutions are increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. Continued adoption is likely to increase Bitcoin’s price and liquidity. While MARA’s R&D investments appear low, they are still innovating (e.g., Anduro , Slipstream ). Final Words I will end the article by acknowledging that MARA is doing a great job executing in the Bitcoin mining industry. So, my caution is not so much with MARA, but the nature of Bitcoin mining as a business model. In other words, the structural risks of the industry, like rising costs, halving-driven revenue cuts, energy dependence, and Bitcoin price volatility, in my opinion, makes Bitcoin mining inherently fragile and unsustainable in the long term, regardless of execution.",BTC|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-27 11:58:19

Analysts suggest bulls could dominate if key resistance levels break. As some call for a $71K bottom for Bitcoin, XRP could breach the $2 mark. The price action of XRP has caught market attention after a significant sell-off was met with strong buyer support at a historically relevant level. Analyst Javon Marks highlighted that sellers faced rejection at a key level last seen in 2017-2018. Despite the initial decline, buyers stepped in aggressively, pushing the price back above $2.3. This indicates bulls could be preparing to take control in spite of recent market fluctuations. XRP Price Faces Resistance at $2.50, Drops to $2.06 However, after attempting to break the $2.50 resistance, XRP faced renewed selling pressure. The price fell below $2.35 and $2.25, reaching a low of $2.06 before recovering. XRP now trades at $2.23, a 2.4% drop in the past day. To give some perspective, the $2.06 low XRP touched on Tuesday was not its lowest point this month. On February 3, XRP dipped to $1.7 during the massive bearish pressure at the time.

Investors who once saw BTC as unstoppable are now questioning its short-term direction. With volatility increasing and liquidations piling up, some are looking elsewhere for the next big opportunity. Could Bitcoin lose its dominance, or is this just a temporary setback before another surge? Amid Bitcoin’s battle, a new player is making waves. JetBolt (JBOLT) continues rising, selling nearly 335 million tokens since launch. Its groundbreaking zero-gas technology and AI-driven insights are attracting attention from both whales and developers. Why is BTC crashing and can it get back to $100K as JetBolt’s presale soars to new heights? Read on to find out. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can BTC Recover from Crash? Bitcoin is struggling to bounce back, stuck below the $90,000 mark as sellers keep the pressure on. Even with a brief spike in trading volume, the mood remains bearish. Since January, Bitcoin has tried—and failed—multiple times to break key resistance levels. Concerns over U.S. interest rate policies, geopolitical tensions, and the strengthening dollar have also weighed on investor sentiment. To make matters worse, the liquidation of $337 million in long positions recently is shaking investor confidence.. But not everyone is giving up. A slight uptick in BTC ’s funding rate suggests that some traders still believe a comeback is possible. BTC dipped below $90,000 this week, chart from CoinGecko. Uncertainty is driving the volatility, with global events and shifting economic policies adding to the chaos. If Bitcoin drops below $81,000, it could spiral down to $77,000 or even $70,000. But if it manages a solid rebound, we might see a push toward $89,000 soon. Some experts remain hopeful, predicting a climb past $125,000 by late March. For now, though, Bitcoin’s fate is in the hands of market forces, and traders can do little but wait and watch. JetBolt’s Rising Momentum: Nearly 335 Million Presale Tokens Sold As Bitcoin tries to climb back to $90,000, a rising altcoin is catching whale attention. JetBolt (JBOLT) has already sold nearly 335 million tokens since launch, positioning itself as an exciting new player in the crypto space. With its unique features and strong market entry, whales and developers are taking notice of its capabilities. JetBolt’s standout innovation is its zero-gas technology . Built on the Skale Network, JetBolt removes gas fees entirely, making it an attractive choice for developers working on dApps, Web3 applications, and blockchain gaming. This cost-efficient approach could reshape the way projects are built and scaled. Transaction speed is another key advantage. JetBolt processes payments near-instantly, providing a smooth blockchain experience. In addition to this, JetBolt’s next-gen Web3 wallet enhances usability with biometric logins, facial recognition, and self-custodial security, making it appealing to both new and experienced users. Beyond transactions, JetBolt integrates an AI-powered tool delivering blockchain news and insights based on market sentiments. JetBolt also adds an interactive twist to staking. With its Proof of Attendance and Worth (PAW) protocol, users can earn extra rewards for daily logins, staking, and social engagement. The presale makes the deal even sweeter, offering up to 25% bonus tokens for early adopters through Alpha Box bundles. With a soaring momentum and whale interest, JetBolt is adding an exciting narrative to the crypto landscape. Conclusion: Can BTC Bounce Back as JetBolt Continues Rising? Bitcoin’s struggle to reclaim $90,000 raises questions about its short-term strength, but history suggests the crypto giant isn’t out of the game yet. While bearish pressure and liquidation events keep traders on edge, long-term projections still hint at a potential recovery past $100,000. However, the uncertainty surrounding economic policies and investor sentiment makes the path forward anything but predictable. Meanwhile, JetBolt is on a roll, gaining traction with its innovative zero-gas technology and AI-driven market insights. With strong presale numbers and growing interest from developers and whales, JetBolt is proving that new projects can thrive even in a volatile market. Whether Bitcoin rebounds or JetBolt steals the spotlight, the crypto space is entering a phase of rapid evolution—one where dominance is constantly up for grabs.

The price has been trying hard to break above the resistance that has been held for over a couple of years. Although multiple attempts have failed lately, the upcoming price action is expected to not only clear these levels but elevate the levels not seen since December 2021. One of the major reasons behind the surge is the speculation around the spot LTC ETF, which received an acknowledgement from the SEC. With this, the LTC price chart appears to be one of the most bullish charts, as the token is outperforming the other tokens against the USDT and also displaying immense strength against Bitcoin. The LTC/BTC pair has just ignited a parabolic recovery phase, which is expected to gain momentum soon. The LTC/BTC pair has been displaying immense strength as it trades within a rising parallel channel and the recent upswing has pushed the pair above average levels. Meanwhile, the MACD, which has flipped to bearish, has quickly turned bullish, being within the positive range. Besides, the OBV remains incremental, suggesting a constant inflow of liquidity within the token. Therefore, this suggests Litecoin is gaining strength against Bitcoin, which is a clear indication of the beginning of a strong bullish trend. What’s Next for the Litecoin (LTC) Price Rally? During the recent sell-off, the LTC price dropped to $106 but with strong backing by the bulls, the price rebounded and surged by over 15%. Besides, the volume has spiked above $2 billion with a significant rise of nearly 50% hinting towards a constant rise in the ascending trend. Therefore, the Litecoin price is expected to remain consolidated for a while, followed by a massive breakout beyond $150. As seen in the above chart, the LTC price is stuck within an ascending triangle while the resistance zone is between $136 and $140, which has always pushed the levels lower. Meanwhile, the MACD has triggered a bullish crossover while the OBV also triggered a bullish reversal, hinting towards a rise in the bullish momentum. Therefore, the Litecoin price is expected to test the resistance in the next few days. If the price fails to clear the zone, then it may remain consolidated within the pattern until it reaches the apex. Otherwise, a breakout may elevate the levels to the interim resistance at $144. With this, a rise beyond $150 may be imminent and if the bulls manage to surpass $154, the bulls are expected to take over the rally and push the price towards the ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|LTC|BTC|ETH|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-27 12:06:51

Analysts Share Insights,https://cryptopotato.com/is-dogecoin-doge-ready-for-a-comeback-analysts-share-insights/,"TL;DR Bullish signals suggest a Dogecoin revival, with a breakout above $0.29124 potentially pushing the price to $0.50-$0.60. However, concerns arise as DOGE’s network activity and futures trading volume plummet, with warnings of a potential crash to $0.06 if the valuation drops below $0.19. Can the Bulls Retake Control? The past few days have been devastating for the cryptocurrency market, with the prices of numerous leading digital assets crashing by double digits. One of the worst affected was Dogecoin (DOGE), whose valuation is down almost 20% on a weekly scale and currently trades at roughly $0.21. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Some analysts , though, believe the bearish trend might soon be over. The popular X user Ali Martinez claimed that the meme coin appears ready for a rebound as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal on the daily chart. Rose Premium Signals also outlined a bullish forecast. The industry participant assumed that DOGE approaches “a key reversal zone,” claiming that a breakout above $0.29124 could confirm a rally toward new peaks. The X user thinks the long-term targets sit at around $0.50-$0.60, with the potential for further upside. “If momentum continues, Dogecoin could reclaim its meme coin throne and push toward higher levels,” they concluded. The Bearish Scenario Contrary to his optimistic prediction, Martinez recently presented some worrying data involving the biggest meme coin in terms of market capitalization. He estimated that Dogecoin’s network activity has dwindled in the past few months, with new addresses dropping from almost 1.3 million in November 2024 to just 30,815 as of today (February 27). Additionally, DOGE’s total futures trading volume has tumbled from $58.2 billion in November last year to just $992 million on February 26. These developments typically signal reduced user engagement, which could be interpreted as bad news from investors and hamper interest in the meme coin. Earlier this week, Martinez saw a probability of a DOGE price crash to as low as $0.06. He believes this could happen if the price plunges below $0.19. As mentioned above, the valuation plummeted substantially in the past few days but did not go below the depicted mark. The post Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Ready for a Comeback?

Do you ""buy when there is blood in the streets""? Or perhaps ""don't catch a falling knife.""? Which applies in today's market, the day after the largest cryptocurrency posted its steepest three-day decline since the collapse of FTX in 2022? The drop left BTC 25% below January's all-time high, despite the advent of President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration. It's no surprise the largest hack in crypto history has shaken investor sentiment. Add to that the memecoin frenzy , which pulled liquidity out of the broader market. That said, in previous cycles so-called bull-market corrections have sent bitcoin tumbling as much as 35%. Given that BTC hasn't had a meaningful pullback since the yen carry trade unwind last August, the current situation is almost normal. CoinDesk research showed that bitcoin was trading in an extremely tight range for a meaningful period, and a break in the channel was inevitable. On-chain data tells us that bitcoin recently bounced off its 200-day-moving average or roughly $81,800. While short-term holders are selling — panic sales, perhaps? — at the highest level since August, because they have held BTC for 155 days or less they are usually seen as a signal of some form of capitulation in the market. BlackRock's IBIT saw record outflows on Wednesday. However, it's not all bad news. A huge expansion deal was made for Core Scientific (CORZ), while MARA Holdings (MARA) reported strong earnings, with both stocks more than 10% before the open.

The platform hit a peak in October 2024, creating over 36,000 tokens in a day and generating a record $3 billion market cap for its ecosystem, but activity has since plummeted, with daily token launches dropping more than 60%. Data from Dune Analytics shows Pump.fun's token graduation rate remains low at around 1%-2%, with many tokens failing to sustain value post-launch, contributing to the downturn. The decline comes as Solana's SOL has dropped more than 40% since the start of the year. Derivatives Positioning Open interest in perceptual futures tied to APT, one of the best-performing coins of the past 24 hours, has increased, but funding rates and the cumulative volume delta are negative. That's a sign of traders hedging downside risks. SOL and LTC have also seen increases in open interest, but with positive funding rates. BTC and ETH options on Deribit now indicate downside concerns extending until the end of March, while later expirations continue to show a preference for call options. Block flows on Paradigm have been mixed, with puts and OTM call spreads lifted. The SOL March 7 expiry put option at the $120 strike was purchased.

33767162,[object Object],1740658549,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,A Fresh Meme Coin Setup Arises Amid US Lawmakers Repealing New Crypto Rule,https://bitcoinist.com/us-lawmakers-repeal-new-crypto-rule/,"As one door closes, a better one opens. With US lawmakers repealing the controversial ‘DeFi broker rule,’ the crypto space is seeing a shift toward greater clarity. Seizing the moment, Meme Index is preparing to launch a revamped meme coin ecosystem tailored for new investors. This innovative setup will simplify entry into the meme coin market while enhancing security, accessibility, and transparency. The rule, rumored to take effect in 2027, was initially designed to require brokers to report new crypto transactions and taxpayers to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). But the House Ways and Means Committee voted on passing it yesterday. Lower Taxes on the Horizon for New Crypto Buyers The repeal of the DeFi broker rule is a major win for new crypto investors who feared higher tax burdens—scaled based on income—and potential roadblocks to digital asset innovation. The rule would have also created massive bureaucratic hurdles, overwhelming the IRS with paperwork while forcing US brokers to navigate complex reporting requirements for data they don’t typically collect. By removing this regulatory overreach, the decision clears the way for a more streamlined and innovation-friendly crypto environment. As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve with fewer hurdles, Meme Index is preparing to bring more favorable structures to the bustling crypto realm by soon launching the world’s first decentralized meme coin indexes. New Crypto Project to Bring Favorable Structure to Meme Coin Arena Meme Index is dubbed as being one of the best presales in 2025 owing to the soon launching of four blockchain-based meme coin indexes with contrasting risk profiles. Look at the Meme Titan Index, for instance. It highlights the top eight meme coins that are low risk, whereas the Meme Frenzy Index features the most volatile coins that have the potential to offer the most outstanding returns if successful. The Meme Index baskets will spotlight meme coins with varying risk tolerances, offering significant advantages for traders. Instead of sifting through the vast crypto landscape (which is now home to over 11.98 million cryptocurrencies ) investors can quickly find options that align with their goals. This streamlined approach saves time, reduces research hassle, and makes meme coin investing more accessible. They might even want to spread their risk across different meme tokens, so if one underperforms (or, even worse, fails), they’ll have other investments to offset their losses. But there’s a slight catch: To access the meme coin baskets once they go live, users must hold $MEMEX, the project’s native token. After buying $MEMEX (currently at just $0.0166218), holders can vote on index updates and token inclusions and stake their tokens at a tremendous 588% APY. Considering the $MEMEX has already raised $3.8M, and its value is anticipated to reach $0.074 before 2026 kicks off, now presents a good time to purchase this new crypto. $MEMEX Could Be the Next New Crypto to 100x The repeal of the DeFi broker rules is a significant advancement in the crypto market, particularly for new crypto buyers who no longer have to fear higher taxes and such regulatory challenges. As the DeFi world progresses, new crypto projects like Meme Index are getting ready to provide investors with structured yet favorable investment propositions. Consequently, $MEMEX could be the next meme coin to 100x – but only time will tell. We’re not financial investors, nor are we fortune tellers, so be sure to always do your homework and don’t invest more than your piggy bank allows.",Altcoin News|Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-27 12:15:49

On February 25, BTC saw a sharp 7% decline, down to $87,000 — a price point last seen in November of 2024. Prices subsequently dropped to $85,810 a day later, following record exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) outflows to the tune of $940 million . At press time, BTC was trading at a price of $86,310 — having marked an 11.39% drop on the weekly chart that has brought year-to-date (YTD) losses up to 8.12%. BTC price 1-week chart. Source: Finbold As severe as the drop has been, renowned cryptocurrency analyst and MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe has expressed confidence that the local bottom will likely end up being somewhere in the $83,000 to $87,000 range, as Finbold reported. The recent uptick in price (with notably stronger volume present) certainly seems to support that theory. Kiyosaki, a longtime crypto bull, seems to agree — as the author recently took to social media platform X to explain why he actually considers the recent dip a positive development. Robert Kiyosaki urged investors to trade ‘fake money’ for Bitcoin and silver The primary cause of Bitcoin’s recent crash has nothing to do with the cryptocurrency itself, at least per Robert Kiyosaki’s February 27 X post . Instead, the financial educator pinned the blame on the United States monetary system, citing the nation’s high level of debt. BITCOIN CRASHING Bitcoin is on SALE I AM BUYING WHY: The problem is not BITCOIN THE PROBLEM is our Monetary System and our criminal bankers. America’s bankrupt. Our debt including social programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, including our $36 trillion debt is… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 27, 2025 Readers should note, however, that while the $36 trillion mentioned by the author represents an official figure from the federal government, the $230 trillion referred to by Kiyosaki includes unfunded liabilities — think Medicare or Social Security spending. In simple terms, the larger figure presents decades of future obligations as debt, which can be a bit misleading, to put it mildly. Lastly, Robert Kiyosaki predicted that a collapse of the bond market would lead to both resurgent inflation and a crash of the U.S. dollar, and once again reiterated his bullishness on precious metals and Bitcoin. Speaking of precious metals, the finance guru recently made another bold prediction. Per some of his unnamed sources, when silver is due for a strong move to the upside once gold prices reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $3,000 per troy ounce. The author noted that silver is roughly $50 below its ATH and that prices could increase from roughly $32 to as much as $70 per ounce. SOMETHING MOVING UNDER SILVER MARKET…. When gold goes through $3,000 a new all time high…my sources say SILVER will take off. Silver is the best investment at the best price. Silver is still about 50% below its all time high. I believe silver at $32.00 an ounce will within… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 26, 2025 As optimistic as that price target is — and Kiyosaki does have a long history of making ambitious claims, both bullish and bearish, a similar forecast was recently made by mineral exploration company Dolly Varden Silver chief executive officer (CEO) Shawn Khunkhun.

On Feb. 28, Bybit announced that it had received an in-principle approval from the SCA of the UAE to establish itself as a Virtual Asset Platform Operator in the country, dated Feb. 18. This milestone moves Bybit closer to being fully licensed to offer its digital asset services to both individual and institutional clients in the UAE. The in-principle approval comes in spite of Bybit’s recent hack of its multisig cold wallet, resulting in a loss of $1.5 billion. In a statement to Khaleej Times on Saturday, VARA said that the incident is “a highly evolving matter that we will continue to closely track until it stabilises”. Bybit’s licensing in UAE follows its existing regulatory approvals in the Middle East. The exchange is also actively securing regulatory approvals worldwide, expanding its presence in key markets such as India, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey.

Bybit’s in-principle licensing is just one of a series of approvals for crypto platforms and digital assets to operate in the UAE. On Feb. 24, the Dubai Financial Services Authority approved Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ) and EURC as the first officially recognized stablecoins under Dubai’s new token regime. Earlier, in April 2024, Crypto.com’s Dubai-based entity, CRO DAX Middle East FZE, received full operational approval from the Dubai VARA, licensing the company to offer services such as spot trading and staking brokerage to both institutional and retail clients within the UAE. Additionally, VARA is set to introduce new rules requiring crypto businesses within the UAE to disclose the identities of crypto whales, aiming to protect investors by revealing whether a cryptocurrency is highly concentrated in the hands of a few entities, whether the project’s team or VCs. VARA is also considering new risk disclosure requirements to ensure investors fully understand the assets they’re purchasing.

Despite the panic, experts suggest this could be a prime moment to buy. Sentiment Crashes as BTC Price Falls The index, which measures market sentiment, fell from 49 last week, considered neutral, to 10 today , signifying extreme fear. According to Alternative.me, which publishes the metric, extreme fear is often an indication that investors are overly concerned about the goings-on in the market, which could present a buying opportunity. However, analysts remain divided; while some have referenced historical data showing extreme fear often precedes rebounds, others, like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, have cautioned that Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could drop to as low as $70,000 before stabilizing. The ongoing turmoil has seen the value of BTC tumble from nearly $99,000 last week to under $84,000 , a three-month low. While it’s trading at just under $86,000 at the time of this writing, the asset’s recent poor form dragged the wider crypto market into the red, erasing months of gains, with altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB equally bleeding and pushing traders into panic mode. The downturn saw the sector’s overall value dip below $3 trillion, shedding at least $200 billion in just one day. Liquidations have also surged, with more than $1 billion in leveraged positions wiped out over the same period. Presently, crypto’s market cap is at $2.95 trillion, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, BTC’s dominance has risen to 57.6%, suggesting a shift away from riskier altcoins. What’s Driving the Fear? Experts have pointed to factors like escalating tensions between the United States and some of its key trade partners, including Canada, Mexico, and China, as a key contributor to the downturn. The impasse was a result of U.S. President Donald Trump announcing new tariffs on goods sourced from the three countries. In addition, the President has threatened to impose a 25% tax on imports from the European Union (EU), claiming the bloc was created to “screw” the United States. Furthermore, the country’s spot Bitcoin ETF sector has seen massive outflows, with a record $938 million withdrawn in a single day. This apparent lack of institutional confidence has further fueled the sell-off.

The analysis highlights critical support and resistance areas, and possible price action scenarios based on recent market activity. #XRP – 4 Hours TF Update: 1⃣ We need to close above $2.35 to re-enter the Bull Channel for bullish momentum! 2⃣ Avoid closing below $2.20 to minimize the risk of hitting lower targets. 3⃣ The broken Ascending Triangle suggests a measured move around $2.00. We might test… pic.twitter.com/mbWVnYwpLi — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 26, 2025 Key Takeaways from EGRAG Crypto’s Analysis Reclaiming the Bull Channel ($2.35 Resistance) – According to EGRAG Crypto, XRP must close above $2.35 to regain bullish momentum and re-enter the bull channel. This level represents a significant resistance zone and a successful breakout above it could signal a continuation of the upward trend. If XRP achieves a sustained close above this level, it may open the door to higher targets. Critical Support at $2.20 – The $2.20 level is an essential support level that XRP needs to hold. A decisive close below this mark increases the risk of further downside, possibly leading to a retest of lower price levels. EGRAG Crypto warns that a break below this level could extend the correction and bring XRP closer to the $2.00 area. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Broken Ascending Triangle and Potential Retest of $2.00 – EGRAG Crypto notes that a previously formed ascending triangle has been broken, suggesting a measured move toward $2.00. This means that XRP could potentially revisit this lower price range, though wicking and temporary dips may occur before any decisive movement. A bounce from this level could help stabilize price action before attempting a recovery. Long-Term Outlook Remains Bullish – Despite the short-term volatility, EGRAG Crypto reiterates that the broader outlook for XRP remains positive, expectating of double-digit prices in the long run. While immediate price fluctuations may create uncertainty, the overall sentiment suggests optimism regarding XRP’s future trajectory. Market Manipulation Concerns An X user, CnchFitz, responded to EGRAG Crypto’s analysis, expressing skepticism about the reliability of technical analysis in the current crypto market environment. The user pointed out that market movements are often influenced by large institutional players, making traditional chart patterns less effective. They also emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity, real-world utility, and mass adoption as key factors in XRP’s future price action. This perspective highlights a broader debate within the crypto community—whether technical analysis alone can accurately predict price movements in a market often subject to external influences. While EGRAG Crypto’s chart-based approach provides a structured framework for short-term price expectations, some traders remain cautious due to market manipulation concerns.

40909158,https://timestabloid.com/?p=58732,1740658871,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,A New Bridge Is Connecting Cardano and XRP Ecosystems,https://timestabloid.com/a-new-bridge-is-connecting-cardano-and-xrp-ecosystems/,"The blockchain industry continues to make significant strides toward achieving seamless interoperability, the latest development in this regard is the introduction of a new bridge connecting the Cardano (ADA) and XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystems. This bridge, facilitated by Wanchain, is a decentralized, non-custodial solution designed to enable smooth and secure cross-chain transfers between these two major blockchain networks. This advancement is not just a technical milestone but a strategic move that expands liquidity, fosters DeFi adoption, and enhances utility for both ecosystems. The Cardano and XRP communities, historically separate in their technological and market positioning, now have the opportunity to interact in unprecedented ways. How the Bridge Works The new Cardano-XRP bridge allows users to transfer XRP onto the Cardano network and ADA onto the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . The bridge operates without central control ensuring that users retain control over their assets without needing to trust a third party. Wanchain, which has been at the forefront of cross-chain interoperability, uses a secure multi-party computation (MPC) mechanism and distributed key generation to ensure the safe movement of assets across different blockchains. This guarantees that wrapped versions of XRP and ADA can seamlessly interact with applications on the opposite chain while preserving their underlying value. This integration is expected to enhance interoperability, improve liquidity, and open up new DeFi opportunities on both networks, making it a landmark innovation in the blockchain space. Impact on the XRP Ecosystem The integration of a bridge between Cardano and XRPL brings several advantages for XRP holders and the XRP Ledger as a whole: Expanded Utility for XRP: Historically, XRP has primarily been used for fast and cost-efficient payments. However, with this new bridge, XRP can now be deployed into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, unlocking staking, lending, borrowing, and yield farming opportunities previously unavailable to XRP holders. Increased Demand and Liquidity : As XRP enters Cardano’s DeFi space, more users and investors may seek to acquire and utilize XRP in decentralized applications (dApps), increasing demand and overall liquidity for the asset. This could strengthen XRP’s position in the market and enhance its overall trading activity. Strengthened Cross-Chain Presence: This bridge enables XRP to operate seamlessly within Cardano’s blockchain, enhancing its utility and adaptability. As a result, XRP’s role in the multi-chain ecosystem is elevated, extending its potential uses beyond traditional payments and remittances. Impact on the Cardano (ADA) Ecosystem For Cardano, the introduction of this bridge brings significant enhancements in terms of liquidity, adoption, and ecosystem expansion: Increased Liquidity for Cardano’s DeFi Sector: One of the key challenges for any DeFi ecosystem is liquidity. By allowing XRP, a highly liquid asset, to flow into Cardano’s network, this bridge injects more capital into ADA-based DeFi platforms, strengthening their functionality and appeal. Greater Exposure to XRP’s Large User Base: The XRP community is one of the largest and most active in the cryptocurrency space. With this bridge, XRP users are now incentivized to explore Cardano’s ecosystem, leading to greater adoption of Cardano’s native smart contracts, DeFi applications, and dApps. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strengthening Cardano’s Position in Interoperability: Cardano has been making strides to become more interoperable with other blockchains, and this bridge aligns with that vision. By connecting with XRPL, Cardano enhances its status as a network that can easily connect with other blockchain infrastructures, reinforcing its long-term scalability goals. Broader Implications for the Crypto Space The significance of the Cardano-XRP bridge extends beyond these two ecosystems. It represents a step toward a more interconnected blockchain environment, where users are not limited to the functionalities of a single network but can freely move assets across chains. This development demonstrates the growing importance of interoperability in the blockchain industry. It ensures that cryptocurrencies are not isolated but rather part of a cohesive, multi-chain future. Furthermore, by leveraging Wanchain’s decentralized, non-custodial approach, the bridge sets a precedent for future interoperability solutions, prioritizing security and user control over assets. Launching a bridge connecting Cardano (ADA) and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a landmark achievement in blockchain interoperability. By facilitating the movement of XRP onto Cardano and ADA onto XRPL, this bridge expands liquidity, increases DeFi adoption, and fosters deeper collaboration between two of the most prominent blockchain networks. The bridge enhances utility, increases demand, and strengthens XRP’s presence in DeFi. It unlocks greater liquidity, broader adoption, and a stronger foothold in multi-chain integration for Cardano. As blockchain technology advances, cross-chain bridges like this will be crucial in creating a truly decentralized and interconnected financial system. The Cardano-XRP bridge is not just a technical upgrade but a significant step toward a more unified and collaborative crypto ecosystem.

While the last decline wiped out billions of dollars from the cryptocurrency market, a whale defied the decline but now risks being liquidated and losing millions of dollars. According to Lookonchain’s post, the mega whale, one of the victims of the recent crash, opened a long position in Bitcoin and six altcoins but is facing an unrealized loss of $17.5 million. Accordingly, this whale opened long positions in Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), HYPE, ONDO, HBAR, SUI and TRUMP at rates ranging from 3x to 20x. But as the decline deepens, this whale now faces $17.5 million in unrealized losses. However, the whale’s risk does not end there. According to the data, if Bitcoin continues to fall and the price drops to $74,000, the whale could lose a total of $25 million. Because, according to Lookonchain’s post, the whale’s perp equity is the total balance, so the loss risks reaching $25 million ($17.5 million + $7.4 million). However, if the BTC price increases, liquidation will not occur and the whale will be able to cover his losses and make millions of dollars in profits. As the market drops, the whale has lost $17.5M from going long on $BTC , $SOL , $HYPE , $ONDO , $HBAR , $SUI and $TRUMP . When $BTC drops to $74,571, he will be liquidated. https://t.co/2N8f8TIYcx pic.twitter.com/ezjcXDFsP5 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 27, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

40909221,https://crypto.news/?p=14340127,1740659041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40909221.jpeg,"After years of groundwork, Bitcoin DeFi is ready to soar | Opinion",https://crypto.news/after-years-of-work-bitcoin-defi-is-ready-to-soar/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. 2025 is the year when Bitcoin ( BTC ) will reach its turning point. Historically regarded as a “store of value,” its role in decentralized finance has been minimal, capturing only close to 0.3% of its market cap compared to Ethereum ( ETH ) dominant position. Ethereum’s programmability has made it the natural home for DeFi, but Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap and unmatched security present an untapped opportunity ripe for investment and success. You might also like: Bitcoin DeFi shouldn’t just be possible—it needs to be easy | Opinion Key advancements, including BitVM, a proposed system that allows complex computations and smart contracts to be executed on the Bitcoin blockchain, and Bitcoin staking protocols like Babylon, are now reshaping this narrative. These innovations can unlock Bitcoin’s dormant capital and create financial solutions that attract both retail and institutional investors. With venture capital flowing into Bitcoin DeFi projects and forecasts predicting a $47 billion Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem, 2025 is poised to be the year Bitcoin asserts its position in the DeFi space. Bitcoin’s emerging opportunity Ethereum currently dominates DeFi due to its smart contract capabilities and dynamic ecosystem, capturing over half of the total value locked in crypto. Bitcoin, in comparison, has had a limited role in DeFi as it’s been constrained by its lack of programmability and slow block times. Recent advancements aim to change that, though, and developers are positioning Bitcoin as more than an asset. Merging Bitcoin’s liquidity with Ethereum’s programmability could create a hybrid DeFi model that combines Bitcoin’s security and dormant capital with Ethereum’s thriving ecosystem and drive for innovation. By leveraging proposals like BitVM and trustless bridges, hybrid blockchains could expand DeFi’s reach, unlocking new use cases and driving broader adoption across retail and institutional users. Bringing scalability to Bitcoin Developers have explored several approaches to bring programmability and DeFi capabilities to Bitcoin, each addressing specific challenges. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) enables interaction with Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, but it is heavily centralized. To convert Bitcoin into WBTC or redeem WBTC for Bitcoin, users must go through an authorized merchant and comply with know your customer and anti-money laundering regulations. Users must also trust the custodian to manage and safeguard the Bitcoin reserves. This is where BitVM comes in to offer a breakthrough, with two main objectives being enabling true Bitcoin rollups and trust-minimised Bitcoin bridges. BitVM introduces the ability to execute programs on Bitcoin without requiring protocol changes In practice, this means BitVM allows Bitcoin to support complex decentralized applications and financial operations, such as lending or token swaps. By bridging BTC to a Bitcoin-secured layer-2 in a trust-minimized way, we are able to dramatically increase utility while preserving core principles of security and decentralization. BitVM positions Bitcoin as more than a store of value. It paves the way for Bitcoin to play a central role in DeFi, combining utility and trust to meet the demands of an evolving financial landscape. The opportunity for retail and institutional investors Before 2025, Bitcoin’s role in DeFi has been slowly gaining traction and platforms like Babylon are already facilitating billions in staking deposits. A large pool of Bitcoin holders are eager to put their assets to work, earning yields through BTC staking. Until now, limited technology and infrastructure, along with a lack of trust-minimized solutions, have been significant barriers. However, this surge in activity highlights growing confidence among investors in Bitcoin’s potential to unlock new financial opportunities in 2025. Bitcoin’s unmatched $2 trillion market cap, robust security, and global trust mean it is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap for retail and institutional investors who have previously avoided DeFi due to concerns about regulation or risk.
