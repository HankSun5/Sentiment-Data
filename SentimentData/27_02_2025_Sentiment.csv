ZachXBT also warned Pump.fun followers that the hackers were promoting scam tokens through false announcements on the page. The hackers posted their first tweet about one hour ago promoting a fake pump.fun governance token dubbed $PUMP. The post stated, ‘Introducing $PUMP, the OFFICIAL Pump.fun GOVERNANCE token, where DEMOCRACY has never been this degen.’ The hackers added that they would be rewarding the ‘OG DEGENS.’ The post has since then been deleted. pumpdotfun account is hacked ⚠️ $PUMP is heavily bundled and will dump pic.twitter.com/7wOy7lhka5 — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) February 26, 2025 The hackers have posted 3 more tweets in the past hour, with one promising that the token would not be a bundle and would be launched via Pump.fun. Another tweet asked the memecoin launchpad’s followers whether to launch a legit token called hackeddotfun. The hackers further encouraged users to pump the coin to $100 million. The last tweet stated that the hackers were ‘here to save crypto,’ promoting another token called $HACKED. The hackers alleged that none of the token’s supply would be owned and not bundled. The tweets notably included CAs for followers to engage with. ZackXBT still encouraged users not to interact with any of the CAs or links posted. The 3 posts have also been deleted since. The Solana memecoin launcher has still not commented on the situation, and it is unclear whether the platform is aware of the hack. A Pump.fun staff member has still reportedly acknowledged the hack, informing followers that the platform was investigating the situation. ZackXBT connects the hack to Jupiter DAO and DogWifCoin hacks ZachXBT mentioned in another Telegram post that Pump.fun X account hack could be connected to the Jupiter DAO X account hack this February and DogWifCoin’s hack in November last year. The investigator still insisted that the hacks were possibly not the fault of the teams. ZachXBT further speculated that the threats could be connected to X social engineering employees with fraudulent documents or emails. The investigator also suggested that the exploitation of an X panel could be another probable cause of the compromised accounts. Jupiter Exchange’s X account suffered a hack on February 6, prompting the team to announce the incident on the official Jupiter DAO page. The team warned users not to engage with any of the links, CAs, or information shared on the exchange’s X account. The incident was not the first the platform experienced over the past few months, leading users to discuss whether to boycott the exchange. Hackers had exploited the JUP token airdrop account about one year ago, costing users approximately $1 million. DogWifCoin’s X account suffered a hack on November 15 last year, where hackers attempted to scam the memecoin’s followers through phishing links. The project still reported that the hackers did not manage to steal any funds from users. Pump.fun hack comes a few days after Bybit’s incident Bybit Hack Forensics Report As promised, here are the preliminary reports of the hack conducted by @sygnia_labs and @Verichains Screenshotted the conclusion and here is the link to the full report: https://t.co/3hcqkXLN5U pic.twitter.com/tlZK2B3jIW — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 26, 2025 The recent Pump.fun X account hack comes only a few days after one of the top exchanges, Bybit, experienced a cyber-attack. The Bybit hack was tied to the North Korean cybercrime organization Lazarus Group, leading to about $1.4 billion in losses. The exchange’s attack was one of the largest hacks recorded in crypto history, standing above the Ronin Network cyber-attack 3 years ago, which cost users about $625 million. The hackers swiped $400,000 ETH from one of the exchange’s cold wallets. The attack happened during a routine transfer from the exchange’s hot wallet despite the transaction undergoing multiple checks, including a sign-off from Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhao. Chainalysis reportedly confirmed that the attack was tied to social engineering, with the hackers taking advantage of the cold wallet signers through phishing attacks. The exchange immediately executed security protocols to manage the situation. The exchange’s deposits and withdrawals went back to normal on Saturday after Bybit handled the backlog of over 500,000 withdrawal requests. Bybit also announced that the exchange worked to return its ETH reserves back to 1:1. Lookonchain data also revealed that the platform’s reserves were back to 100% by February 24 through loans, ETH purchases, and whale deposits. Bybit’s CEO announced further steps to ensure the capture of the Lazarus Group through the Lazarus Bounty Program. Zhao outlined that the bounty site, the first the crypto industry ever had, would employ complete transparency. The exchange has employed a team to ensure the website remains up-to-date. Bybit hackers use Pump.fun to launder stolen funds Thanks to @caLilyLiu and the @pumpdotfun team for taking swift action to block and remove a Solana-based token whose creator may be affiliated with hacker groups, ensuring the security of the ecosystem. This is a great example of proactive security in action — Bybit (@Bybit_Official) February 23, 2025 The Bybit hackers attempted to use Pump.fun to launder the stolen funds through scam memecoins. The attempt came after the hackers split the stolen funds across multiple wallets, for which several exchanges were on the lookout. ZachXBT revealed that the cyber-criminals received $1.08 million in USDC in one wallet before bridging the funds to Solana. The hackers shifted the funds through a complex web of money laundering schemes, passing them through BSC wallets before sending them back to Solana. The group later created scam memecoins to guise transactions as memecoin trades, including through the QinShihuang token. The hackers managed to trade $26 million through the token before the Solana memecoin launcher blocked it. Pump.fun has blocked several other memecoins tied to the Bybit hackers. Bybit applauded the efforts of the Memecoin launcher to prevent money laundering in the ecosystem. The exchange tweeted that Pump.fun’s efforts showed proactive steps to ensure user safety and prevent fraudulent behavior. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s foray into the digital asset world. It turns out, like many public figures and savvy investors, Trump too has dipped his toes into the crypto waters. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence has peeled back the curtain, revealing that a crypto wallet linked to Donald Trump currently holds a substantial portfolio of digital currencies. But the ride hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. Let’s delve into the fascinating details of Trump crypto wallet and the rollercoaster of value it has experienced. Donald Trump Crypto Wallet: A Peek into the Holdings Thanks to the transparent nature of blockchain technology and the investigative prowess of firms like Arkham Intelligence, we can get a glimpse into the crypto holdings of public figures. In the case of Donald Trump, it appears he possesses a crypto wallet that, as of recent data, contains approximately $1.6 million worth of crypto assets . This revelation sparks numerous questions: What types of cryptocurrencies are held in the wallet? How has the value of these holdings changed over time? What does this mean for Trump’s stance on the crypto industry? Let’s break down what we know so far. The $1.6 Million Portfolio: A Snapshot According to Arkham Intelligence’s data, the Trump crypto wallet holds a diverse range of digital currencies. The most significant portion of this portfolio is comprised of a token called TROG. As of the latest valuation, TROG alone accounts for a whopping $877,000 within the wallet. While the specifics of other crypto assets in the wallet haven’t been detailed in this initial report, the presence of TROG as the dominant holding is noteworthy and warrants further exploration. From $10 Million to $1.6 Million: The Value Rollercoaster The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and even high-profile figures like Donald Trump aren’t immune to its swings. Just a little over a month ago, on January 10th, the estimated value of the Donald Trump crypto wallet stood at an impressive $10 million. However, in a relatively short span of just 48 days, the wallet’s value has experienced a significant downturn, plummeting by $8.4 million to reach the current $1.6 million mark. This dramatic decrease highlights the inherent risks and fluctuations associated with investing in crypto assets . Here’s a quick look at the value fluctuation: Date Estimated Value Change January 10th $10 Million – February 27th (Approx.) $1.6 Million -$8.4 Million TROG Token: The Major Player in Trump’s Crypto Portfolio The dominance of TROG within the Trump crypto wallet raises eyebrows and prompts questions about this particular cryptocurrency. With a valuation of $877,000, TROG constitutes a significant chunk of the portfolio. Understanding TROG becomes crucial to understanding the overall dynamics of Trump’s crypto holdings. Is TROG a meme coin? Is it associated with any specific project or community? Further investigation into TROG is needed to decipher its role and potential impact on the wallet’s performance. While Arkham Intelligence’s data reveals the presence and value of TROG, more details are needed to fully understand: The origins and purpose of the TROG token. The market capitalization and trading volume of TROG. The potential risks and rewards associated with holding a significant amount of TROG. Celebrity Crypto Holdings: A Growing Trend? Donald Trump isn’t the only public figure venturing into the world of digital currencies.

Diversifying crypto holdings across different types of coins and projects can help mitigate risk. Volatility is Inherent: The dramatic value drop in Trump’s wallet underscores the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Investors should be prepared for price swings and invest responsibly.

40883494,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134624,1740612455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Whales’ Shocking 6,813 BTC Dump Sends Market Reeling",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whales-btc-dump/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The usually calm waters of the Bitcoin market are looking choppy. Why? Because Bitcoin whales , those colossal holders of vast amounts of BTC, have just executed a significant sell-off, sending ripples across the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just any ordinary transaction; it’s a hefty 6,813 BTC dump, the largest we’ve witnessed since July. Let’s dive deep into what this means for the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market . Why Are Bitcoin Whales Dumping BTC Now? The million-dollar question, or rather, the multi-billion dollar question, is: why now? Whale activity is often seen as a bellwether for market sentiment, and a large BTC dump like this can signal various things. Here are a few potential reasons: Profit Taking: After periods of price appreciation, even Bitcoin whales might decide to lock in profits. If they bought Bitcoin at lower prices, selling now could represent a substantial return. Market Correction Anticipation: Whales, with their vast resources and analytical capabilities, might foresee a potential market correction. Dumping a significant portion of their holdings could be a preemptive move to avoid larger losses if prices decline. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large investors often rebalance their portfolios to manage risk and optimize returns. This BTC dump could be part of a broader strategy to shift funds into other assets, whether within or outside the crypto space. External Economic Factors: Macroeconomic events, regulatory changes, or geopolitical uncertainties can influence whale behavior. These external pressures might be driving some whales to reduce their Bitcoin exposure. Decoding Whale Activity: What Does a 6,813 BTC Dump Mean? Santiment, a renowned on-chain analytics platform, highlighted this significant BTC dump , noting its correlation with Bitcoin price movements. According to their report on X, wallets holding 10+ BTC – categorized as whales and sharks – are key indicators of market direction. A decrease of 6,813 BTC from these wallets is not just a blip; it’s a substantial outflow that can impact market dynamics. Metric Data Platform Santiment Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Type Whales and Sharks (10+ BTC holdings) BTC Dump Amount 6,813 BTC Period Since last week Significance Largest decline since July Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Crypto Market Historically, significant whale activity , especially large sell-offs, has often been associated with increased market volatility and potential price drops. Here’s how this BTC dump could affect the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market : Short-Term Price Pressure: An immediate effect could be downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . A large sell order increases supply in the market, which, if demand remains constant, can lead to price depreciation. Market Sentiment Shift: Whale moves can significantly influence market sentiment. When large holders sell, it can create fear and uncertainty among other investors, potentially triggering further sell-offs and amplifying price declines across the crypto market . Volatility Spike: Expect increased volatility in the short term. The market might react sharply to this news, leading to wider price swings as traders and algorithms adjust to the changing supply dynamics. Altcoin Impact: Bitcoin’s price movements often cascade into the altcoin market. If Bitcoin experiences a significant dip due to this BTC dump , altcoins are likely to follow suit, potentially leading to a broader market correction. Navigating the Whale-Infused Crypto Market: Actionable Insights So, what should you do amidst this whale activity ? While predicting the market with certainty is impossible, here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment and follow reputable crypto news sources. Understanding whale activity and market sentiment is crucial. Manage Risk: In times of increased volatility, prudent risk management is paramount. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocation, setting stop-loss orders, or reducing leverage if you are engaged in trading. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and corrections are a natural part of its cycle. If you have a long-term investment horizon, short-term fluctuations caused by BTC dumps might present buying opportunities. Diversification: Diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can help mitigate risks associated with specific asset volatility. Consider exploring other promising cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Crypto Volatility The recent BTC dump by Bitcoin whales serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the crypto market . While it has introduced a degree of uncertainty, it also underscores the importance of staying informed, managing risk effectively, and maintaining a balanced perspective. Whale activity is just one of many factors influencing Bitcoin price , and the market’s long-term trajectory will depend on a multitude of evolving dynamics. As always, navigate these waters with caution, knowledge, and a strategic approach to thrive in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

The nation’s official press agency published a video on its YouTube page showing the Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at a press event at the construction site, laying the first foundation stone on what will one day become Pacific Airport (official name). However, bitcoiners have been dismayed to discover that the 40-minute event contained no mention of Bitcoin City – the BTC “haven” it is supposed to serve. Bitcoin City Airport – Bukele Lays Foundation Stone Bukele first announced plans to build Bitcoin City in November 2021, claiming it would become a tax-free haven for international Bitcoiners. In 2022, the President unveiled further plans to build the airport, designed by the Mexican architect Fernando Romero. However, the original airport plans date back to 2018, predating both the Bitcoin City plan and the nation’s adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender (September 2021). The Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Mexican architect Fernando Romero discuss plans to build “Bitcoin City Airport,” officially known as Pacific Airport, in 2022. Critics have slammed Bukele’s plans for the airport and Bitcoin City, claiming work had failed to begin on both projects, years after they were first announced. Bukele spoke at the event, claiming that in “phase one” of its operation, the airport would have two gates. He said the airport’s initial capacity would be 300,000 passengers per year, claiming that builders would complete “phase one” of construction by 2027. However, the government plans to expand the airport in two further “phases.” The second phase will see the number of gates increased to 10, with the final phase seeing an expansion to 18. In its final form, this will allow the airport to serve 5 million passengers per year. Bukele said that the “initial investment” cost of the project was $320 million. The President added: “This airport is not just a runway. It is a gateway for development, tourism, investment, and economic growth. In the 10 years, we expect it to generate 50,000 jobs and a per annum GDP growth rate of 1.5%.” El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at a press event for the Pacific Airport building project. (Source: Secretaría de Prensa El Salvador/YouTube/Screenshot) New Jobs Bukele added that the project would also create 10,000 “direct and indirect jobs” in its first phase. And he claimed the project would have an immediate impact on the economy. He said it would generate $300 million in revenue in its first year of operation. #AeropuertoDelPacífico | El Gobierno del Presidente @nayibbukele construirá el Aeropuerto del Pacífico en tres fases. Aquí detallamos en qué consiste cada una de ellas. #SecretaríaDePrensa pic.twitter.com/c1tmIaAht7 — Secretaría de Prensa de la Presidencia (@SecPrensaSV) February 26, 2025 However, talk of Bitcoin was conspicuously absent at the event, as was mention of the Bitcoin City project. Observers claim that whereas the government once bundled the two projects together, officials are no longer doing so. The Spanish-language media outlet Criptonoticias wrote: “[The government says that this] aeronautical project, originally announced in 2018, will be operational within two years. The event marks a concrete step towards its realization. On the other hand, the vision of Bitcoin City – presented to great fanfare in 2021 – remains shrouded in uncertainty. To date, no clear deadlines or tangible progress have been outlined for the city, which was supposedly designed for bitcoiners.” Boost for La Unión The government will build the airport in the La Unión area, near the Conchagua Volcano. The volcano, per the government’s plans, is to be the focal point of Bitcoin City. At its peak, according to the original design, will be a thermal plant that powers Bitcoin mining rigs . In late 2021, Bukele promised that Bitcoin City would not require residents to “ever” pay income tax. He also said there would be no property tax or local taxes in the city, with VAT the sole levy for residents. However, Bukele appears to have lost none of his enthusiasm for Bitcoin. Earlier this week, the country’s National Bitcoin Office paid around $94,050 per coin to buy BTC 7 for the state’s reserves .

You’re not alone. Investors are digesting a mixed bag of signals as major U.S. stock market indexes concluded trading on a varied note. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broader S&P 500 managed to eke out gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average faced headwinds, closing in the red. Let’s dive into what this intriguing market behavior means for your portfolio and the broader economic landscape. Decoding the Day’s Stock Market Performance The closing bell painted a picture of nuanced performance across the primary U.S. stock market benchmarks. Here’s a quick snapshot: S&P 500: Climbed slightly by +0.02% Nasdaq Composite: Posted a moderate gain of +0.26% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Declined by -0.43% This ‘mixed’ closing suggests a market grappling with diverse forces, where certain sectors or types of stocks are experiencing positive momentum while others are under pressure. But what exactly does this mean for you as an investor? S&P 500: A Razor-Thin Gain in the Stock Market The S&P 500 index, often seen as a barometer of the overall U.S. stock market health, barely nudged into positive territory with a marginal 0.02% increase. This near-flat performance indicates a state of equilibrium, where buying and selling pressures were almost perfectly balanced across the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Is this a sign of market stability, or just a pause before the next big move? Investors are keenly watching for signals that could tip the scales. Nasdaq: Tech Sector Drives Modest Gains Outperforming its counterparts, the Nasdaq Composite Index registered a 0.26% gain. This positive performance was largely propelled by the technology sector, which continues to be a significant driver of market momentum. Are tech stocks leading the charge once again? The Nasdaq’s positive close suggests that investor confidence remains robust in growth-oriented tech companies, even amidst broader market uncertainties. This could be attributed to ongoing innovation, strong earnings in specific tech segments, or simply the sector’s perceived resilience in a fluctuating economic environment. Dow Jones: Industrial Downturn Weighs on the Index In contrast to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a notable decline of 0.43%. This downturn in the Dow, which is heavily weighted towards industrial and more traditional ‘blue-chip’ companies, could indicate weakness in these sectors. Several factors might be at play, including concerns about industrial demand, rising input costs, or sector-specific headwinds. The divergence between the Nasdaq and Dow highlights the sectoral variations within the broader stock market and underscores the importance of portfolio diversification. Critical Market Analysis: Decoding the Mixed Signals What are we to make of this mixed market performance? Here’s a breakdown of potential interpretations and actionable insights: Uncertainty Prevails: A mixed market often reflects underlying uncertainty in the economic outlook. Investors may be hesitant to commit strongly in either direction, leading to choppy trading sessions and varied index performance. Sector Rotation: The divergence between the Nasdaq and Dow could signal a sector rotation. Investors might be shifting away from traditional industrial stocks towards growth sectors like technology, or vice versa, depending on their economic outlook and risk appetite. Economic Data Dependency: Market movements are increasingly sensitive to economic data releases. Upcoming inflation reports, jobs numbers, and GDP figures could significantly sway investor sentiment and market direction. Geopolitical Factors: Global events and geopolitical developments continue to play a crucial role. Uncertainties related to international relations, trade policies, and global economic conditions can contribute to market volatility and mixed performance. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: In a mixed market, staying updated on market news, economic data, and geopolitical events is more crucial than ever. Knowledge is your best tool to navigate uncertainty. Diversify Your Portfolio: The sectoral differences highlighted today reinforce the importance of diversification. A well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk and potentially capitalize on opportunities across different market segments. Exercise Caution: Mixed signals suggest a need for caution. Avoid impulsive decisions and consider a more measured approach to investing, especially in volatile periods. Review Your Strategy: Regularly review your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, especially in light of evolving market conditions. Conclusion: Navigating the Cautious Stock Market Landscape Today’s mixed closing across major U.S. stock market indexes underscores a landscape characterized by caution and selective optimism. While the Nasdaq demonstrated tech sector strength and the S&P 500 held its ground, the Dow’s decline serves as a reminder of the varied pressures at play. For investors, this environment necessitates vigilance, informed decision-making, and a strategic approach to portfolio management.

I'm Ben Schiller, managing editor at CoinDesk. In this issue: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade Goes Live Avalanche Visa card launched Ethereum Foundation executive director leaving Hackers using GitHub to steal bitcoin Network News PECTRA GOES LIVE ON TESTNET: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live on the Holesky testnet Feb. 24 but failed to finalize in the expected time. The Pectra hard fork combines together 11 major upgrades , or ""Ethereum improvement proposals"" (EIPs), into one package. At the heart of this is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user-experience of crypto wallets. The proposal, which was scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in just 22 minutes , will allow wallets to have some smart contract capabilities, as part of a broader strategy to bring account abstraction to Ethereum — a concept that makes the usability of wallets a lot less clunky. Another key proposal, EIP-7251, will allow validators to increase the maximum amount they can stake from 32 to 2,048 ETH. The proposal is supposed to ease some of the technicalities that validators who stake ETH face today: Those that stake more than their 32 ETH have to spread that across multiple validators, making the process a bit of a nuisance. By lifting the maximum stake limit and combining those validators, it could speed up the process of setting up new nodes. Holesky is the first of two testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. The next test is supposed to occur on the Sepolia testnet on Mar. 5. But according to Christine Kim, a Vice President of Research at Galaxy, developers could delay it depending on the scale of today's issue. After Pectra goes live on both testnets, developers will ink in a final date to activate the upgrade on mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . MIYAGUCHI LEAVES ETHEREUM FOUNDATION ROLE: Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi is leaving her position to transition to a new role as president at the organization. The news comes as the nonprofit goes through a leadership shake-up and as Ethereum has become less popular for new builders in recent months, with some even blaming Miyaguchi’s leadership as for why the blockchain’s token price is lagging behind other cryptocurrencies. “This new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships, and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly,” Miyaguchi wrote in a blog post published Feb. 25. The Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that supports the development of the Ethereum blockchain. Founded in 2014, Miyaguchi joined in 2018 and has been the executive director ever since. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote in a post on X that “every success of the EF - the steady execution of Ethereum hard forks, client interop workshops, Devcon, Ethereum's culture and steadfast commitment to its mission and values, and more - is in part a result of Aya's stewardship.” — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . AVALANCHE VISA CARD LAUNCHES: The Avalanche Foundation, the non-profit that helps steward the development of the Avalanche blockchain, said its much-anticipated Avalanche Card, a Visa credit card that allows users to purchase items with their cryptocurrency, is live and ready to be used. The card was developed in collaboration with Rain, a blockchain-based card issuing platform. It enables users to spend their Avalanche tokens (AVAX), wrapped AVAX, and stablecoins USDT and USDC at any store that takes Visa, the foundation said in an email. While other teams have also released credit cards tied to a user's crypto holdings, the news signals the further integration between traditional financial technologies and cryptocurrency. The Avalanche Foundation said in October that it planned to introduce the card, focusing on signing up users from Latin America and the Caribbean. According to the card’s website , the credit card will be linked to users' “new self-custody wallet and unique address per asset.” “In a move to double down on mainstream adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), Avalanche remains committed to powering accessible inroads to blockchain for every type of user,” the team said. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . HACKERS USE GITHUB TO NAB BTC: The GitHub code you use to build a trendy application or patch existing bugs might just be used to steal your bitcoin (BTC) or other crypto holdings, according to a Kaspersky report. GitHub is a popular tool among developers of all types, but even more so among crypto-focused projects, where a simple application may generate millions of dollars in revenue. The report warned users of a “GitVenom” campaign that’s been active for at least two years but is steadily on the rise, involving planting malicious code in fake projects on the popular code repository platform. The attack starts with seemingly legitimate GitHub projects — like making Telegram bots for managing bitcoin wallets or tools for computer games. Each comes with a polished README file, often AI-generated, to build trust. But the code itself is a Trojan horse: For Python-based projects, attackers hide nefarious script after a bizarre string of 2,000 tabs, which decrypts and executes a malicious payload. For JavaScript, a rogue function is embedded in the main file, triggering the launch attack. Once activated, the malware pulls additional tools from a separate hacker-controlled GitHub repository. Once the system is infected, various other programs kick in to execute the exploit. How can users protect themselves? By scrutinizing any code before running it, verifying the project’s authenticity, and being suspicious of overly polished READMEs or inconsistent commit histories. Because researchers don’t expect these attacks to stop anytime soon: “We expect these attempts to continue in the future, possibly with small changes in the TTPs,” Kaspersky said. — Shaurya Malwa Read more .

More than two years ago when Elon Musk took over Twitter, there was a lot of drama both behind the scenes and publicly. While most members of the free world jubilated, having had enough of Twitter’s censorship and use as a tool for propaganda, those who worked every day to make the platform work were worried. A fork in the road The new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, was a man who had built his brand around efficiency and who had a reputation for taking decisions and letting the chips fall where they may. Of course, they had reason to worry because when Musk took charge, he asked Twitter employees in an email with the subject line “A Fork in the Road” to either dedicate themselves to an “extremely hardcore” work environment or leave the company. Photo of Elon Musk wielding the chainsaw that Argentine president, Javier Milei gave to him at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) It’s been some time since then, and four ex-Twitter workers have just prevailed in a recent series of closed-door arbitration proceedings over claims they were illegally denied severance. This win has observers predicting Musk will be visiting courtrooms a lot in the future as the billionaire is using the same formula he used to mold Twitter into an efficient platform in his new capacity as the head of DOGE. The billionaire’s cost-cutting strategies have been thrust into the national spotlight as he takes a similar approach to reduce the federal workforce. One of his latest moves has included sending more than two million federal workers an email with the same gist as his “Fork in the Road” message. It gave those who received it the option to leave but be paid through the end of September, while warning them of an impending downsizing. Musk had the email sent as he took up his new role as key adviser to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Donald Trump. The argument of the four workers The four former Twitter employees successfully argued that they didn’t respond to the email and did not resign. Still, they were terminated, which entitled them to severance promised by the company before it came under Musk’s management. After Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion and immediately downsized by more than half the staff, former employees responded by filing complaints. The early losses for Musk in arbitration could build pressure for a settlement of similar allegations by individual workers demanding compensation of anywhere from nearly $100,000 to more than $1 million. According to what Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing former employees in arbitrations, wrote in a memo, the 20 cases she’s won so far have cost the company at least twice the amount of contested severance pay because the awards have also included interest, arbitration expenses and legal fees. The memo in question came from an unidentified former Twitter employee. In response to a request for comment, Liss-Riordan refused to discuss specifics about severance awards as the company has insisted they remain confidential. She’s reportedly representing more than 2,000 former employees who want their own pound of flesh from Musk. This time around, trade unions and Democrats are at the forefront of the litigation efforts. Is Musk going too far? Even though he is still fighting litigation from what he pulled when he took over Twitter, Musk has used a similar playbook in his DOGE gig with the Trump administration. Not only did he send federal workers the “Fork in the Road” email, Musk followed it up with an ultimatum this past weekend that demanded that they justify their positions in writing or risk dismissal. And if there was any confusion about where Trump stands on the matter, it was cleared up when the president said on Tuesday that workers who did not respond to Musk’s demands could lose their jobs. This has caused some grumbling from the general public even though a majority of them have supported DOGE’s actions and the skeletons they’ve been revealing in the government’s closet. Addressing growing discontent about the brash and aggressive actions of the Musk-led agency, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is out again doing damage control and trying to reassure the public that the end will justify the means. Photo of White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on stage at CPAC with Mercedes Schlapp, Former WH Strategic Senior Advisor for President Trump. Source: Karoline Leavitt (X/Twitter) “All of President Trump’s executive actions are lawful, constitutional, and intended to deliver on the promises he made to the American people,” Leavitt said Tuesday. “Partisan elected officials and judicial activists who seek to legally obstruct President Trump’s agenda are defying the will of 77 million Americans who overwhelmingly re-elected President Trump, and their efforts will fail.” Trump has also defended Musk’s actions, highlighting them as a legitimate bid to get rid of fraud and waste in the US government. Meanwhile, those affected by those actions like the employee unions, Democrats in Congress and even some constituents in Republican-leaning districts, have been protesting against them. The recent arbitration decisions that favored the ex-employees indicate there may be legal challenges in the future in response to Musk’s handling of layoffs and severance agreements. Twitter’s former employees talk about Musk Musk’s takeover of Twitter foreshadows what comes next for US government workers, especially those who got the boot. One former senior employee at Twitter, who worked extensively under Musk before leaving the company, told CNN the billionaire’s actions align with his “algorithm that he basically touts as his … keys to success with anything.” “[B]asically, question every requirement, assume that every requirement that anybody ever gives you is dumb. Question it, eliminate it wherever possible,” they said. “I remember him directly saying, ‘If you’re not adding things back in afterwards, then you weren’t cutting hard enough to start with.’” Two former Twitter employees who spoke on the subject asked not to be named so they could speak freely about their time at the company and avoid any potential retaliation from Musk. It reportedly only took Musk hours to fire Twitter’s top executives after taking over. Within days, he had dismissed around 3,500 employees, which was about 50% of the company’s total staff. In the end, he eliminated 80% of Twitter’s workforce, demanded everyone return to the office, and often required employees to work far more than 40 hours a week. Musk’s DOGE is making similar moves throughout government; the United States Agency for International Development is about to shut down; the Office of Personnel Management was directed to prepare to eventually cut as much as 70% of its workforce; and the General Services Administration was told to present proposals to cut 50% of business expenses, according to multiple sources in the know. Photo of American president Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Twitter executive chairman and DOGE head. Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) “Elon seems to think that he’s bought the federal government now, and he’s playing out the same series of events” as he did at Twitter, said Liss-Riordan. Federal government workers now have until Thursday to decide whether they wish to remain in their roles and accept the Trump administration’s new demands through Musk, which include being “reliable, loyal, trustworthy,” or to resign and accept a buyout paying them through September. Unfortunately, if they take the deal, there is no guarantee they will get the money because it is unclear if Trump has the authority to guarantee that.

The cryptocurrency world has just been rocked by a cyberquake of epic proportions. News has broken about a cryptocurrency hack targeting Bybit, and the numbers are staggering. We’re talking a colossal $1.4 billion vanishing act – yes, you read that right, billion with a ‘B’! This isn’t just another Tuesday in crypto; this is a seismic event that’s got everyone in the digital asset space talking. Let’s dive into the details of this alarming Bybit hack and what it means for the future of crypto security. What Exactly Happened in This Massive Crypto Hack? According to a bombshell report from Unfolded, the crypto market insight platform, citing data from Coin Metrics, this crypto hack is not just big; it’s record-breaking. To put it in perspective, the reported $1.4 billion loss eclipses even the infamous Mt. Gox collapse and the more recent FTX implosion. That’s a hefty sum of digital dough, making this incident one of the largest hacking incidents in the history of cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick rundown of what we know so far: The Target: Cryptocurrency exchange platform, Bybit. The Stolen Asset: A staggering $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH). The Suspected Culprit: The notorious North Korean hacker group, Lazarus. The Source of Information: Unfolded report on X, citing Coin Metrics data. Imagine the sheer scale of this operation! $1.4 billion in ETH – that’s not loose change; that’s a treasure trove of digital gold spirited away in a single heist. This Bybit hack immediately raises some critical questions. How could such a massive breach occur? And what does this mean for the crypto security landscape moving forward? Bybit Hack vs. Crypto History: How Does This Compare? When we talk about significant losses in the crypto world, names like Mt. Gox and FTX often come to mind. These were watershed moments that shook investor confidence and prompted serious discussions about regulation and security. But how does this cryptocurrency hack stack up against these infamous events? Let’s take a comparative look: Incident Estimated Loss Key Features Bybit Hack (Reported) $1.4 Billion Ethereum stolen, suspected Lazarus Group involvement, reportedly largest crypto hack. Mt. Gox Collapse (2014) Approximately $450 Million (at the time, much higher value now) Massive Bitcoin theft, led to exchange bankruptcy, significant impact on Bitcoin’s early days. FTX Implosion (2022) Estimated $8-10 Billion (various asset types) Internal mismanagement and misuse of funds, not purely a hack, but a catastrophic loss of user funds. As you can see, while FTX involved a larger sum in total assets lost due to its complex nature of mismanagement, the Bybit hack , if confirmed at $1.4 billion from a direct hack, stands out as potentially the largest *pure* hacking incident in terms of stolen value. Mt. Gox, while impactful in its time, is dwarfed by this new figure. This comparison underscores the severity and unprecedented scale of the Bybit hack . Lazarus Group: Are They Really Behind This Crypto Heist? The name “Lazarus Group” sends shivers down the spines of cybersecurity experts and crypto enthusiasts alike. This North Korean hacking collective has been implicated in numerous high-profile cyberattacks, often with financial gain as the primary motive to fund the North Korean regime. Their alleged involvement in the Bybit hack is certainly plausible, given their track record and sophistication. Why Lazarus Group? Here’s what makes them a prime suspect: History of Crypto Theft: Lazarus Group has been linked to multiple major cryptocurrency heists over the years, demonstrating their expertise in targeting crypto exchanges and wallets. Sophisticated Techniques: They are known for using advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics, making them incredibly difficult to detect and defend against. Financial Motivation: North Korea faces significant economic sanctions, and cryptocurrency theft is believed to be a key source of revenue for the regime. Previous Attacks: They have been associated with attacks on other crypto platforms and financial institutions globally. While investigations are likely still underway to definitively confirm Lazarus Group’s involvement in this crypto hack , their profile and past activities strongly suggest they could be the masterminds behind this audacious operation. If confirmed, it highlights the ongoing threat posed by state-sponsored cybercriminals to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Crypto Security: Is Enough Being Done to Protect Digital Assets? The Bybit hack is a stark reminder that even with advancements in crypto security , vulnerabilities persist. The question isn’t just about *if* exchanges can be hacked, but *when* and *how*. This incident throws a spotlight on the continuous cat-and-mouse game between cybersecurity professionals and sophisticated hacking groups. What are some critical areas in crypto security that need urgent attention? Enhanced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Beyond basic password protection, robust MFA is crucial, including hardware keys and biometric verification. Cold Storage and Secure Key Management: A significant portion of crypto assets should be held in cold storage, offline and away from potential online threats. Secure key management practices are paramount. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Exchanges must conduct frequent and thorough security audits by reputable firms and engage in penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities proactively. Advanced Threat Detection Systems: Implementing AI-powered threat detection systems to monitor network activity and identify suspicious patterns in real-time. Employee Training and Awareness: Human error is often a weak link. Comprehensive cybersecurity training for all employees is essential to prevent phishing attacks and social engineering. Decentralization and Transparency: Exploring decentralized exchange models and enhancing transparency in security practices can build greater user trust and resilience. The Bybit hack should serve as a wake-up call for the entire crypto industry to double down on crypto security measures and continuously innovate to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Moving Forward: Actionable Insights After the Bybit Crypto Hack So, what can be learned from this devastating Bybit hack , and what actionable steps can be taken by exchanges, users, and the broader crypto community? For Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Invest Heavily in Security Infrastructure: Allocate significant resources to bolster crypto security infrastructure, employing cutting-edge technologies and expertise. Collaborate on Threat Intelligence Sharing: Share threat intelligence and best practices with other exchanges to create a stronger collective defense. Enhance User Education: Provide users with comprehensive resources and education on crypto security best practices to protect their own accounts. Improve Incident Response Plans: Develop and regularly test robust incident response plans to effectively manage and mitigate the impact of security breaches. For Cryptocurrency Users: Use Hardware Wallets: Store significant crypto holdings in hardware wallets for enhanced security. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication: Activate MFA on all exchange accounts and crypto-related services. Be Vigilant Against Phishing: Exercise caution with emails, links, and messages, and be wary of phishing attempts.

Amidst fluctuating global markets, a prominent crypto strategist is pointing towards a critical zone for Bitcoin that could set the stage for a significant price rally. Let’s dive into why the $70,000–$75,000 range is being touted as a robust foundation for Bitcoin and what this means for its future trajectory. Decoding Bitcoin Support Levels: The $70K–$75K Fortress According to Blockworks, Joel Kruger, a seasoned crypto strategist at LMAX Group, has identified a compelling Bitcoin support level between $70,000 and $75,000. This isn’t just arbitrary speculation; it’s a technical analysis-backed observation suggesting that Bitcoin has built a strong base within this price range. But what exactly makes this zone so significant? Historical Price Action: Previous price movements likely consolidated around this level, indicating buyer interest and resistance to further downward pressure. Technical Indicators: Various technical analysis tools may align to confirm this zone as a key area where buying demand outweighs selling pressure. Market Sentiment: Investor behavior and overall market confidence around Bitcoin at these levels contribute to the strength of this support. Kruger’s analysis suggests that this robust Bitcoin support level isn’t just a temporary floor; it’s a launchpad for potential upward momentum. Think of it as a solid foundation upon which Bitcoin can build its next ascent. Is a Price Rally to $110K on the Horizon? The million-dollar question – or should we say, the $110,000 question – is whether this support level can indeed propel Bitcoin to new heights. Kruger believes so, suggesting that a price rally past $110,000 is a distinct possibility. This optimistic outlook is underpinned by several factors: Factor Explanation Bitcoin as Store of Value In times of economic uncertainty and traditional market volatility, Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold or store of value becomes increasingly attractive. Portfolio Diversification Investors looking to diversify their portfolios away from traditional assets may turn to Bitcoin, especially amid concerns over global trade tensions and hawkish monetary policies. Institutional Adoption Continued institutional interest and adoption of Bitcoin further legitimize it as an asset class and drive demand. While traditional markets might be experiencing headwinds due to global economic factors, Bitcoin’s unique value proposition could act as a tailwind, fueling this potential price rally . Why Bitcoin’s Store of Value Narrative Matters Now More Than Ever In a world grappling with economic uncertainties, the narrative of Bitcoin as a ‘store of value’ gains significant traction. But what does this really mean, and why is it so crucial for Bitcoin’s price trajectory? Hedge Against Inflation: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin has a limited supply, making it a potential hedge against inflation. As traditional currencies potentially lose purchasing power, Bitcoin’s scarcity becomes increasingly appealing. Safe Haven Asset: In times of geopolitical instability or economic downturns, investors often seek safe haven assets. Bitcoin is increasingly being considered as a digital safe haven, similar to gold. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust security features offer an alternative to traditional financial systems, attracting individuals seeking greater control and security over their assets. This ‘store of value’ narrative is not just theoretical; it directly influences demand. As more investors recognize and embrace Bitcoin’s role in preserving wealth, the demand for Bitcoin increases, potentially driving up its price and contributing to the predicted price rally . Navigating Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s Role in Portfolio Diversification The current global economic landscape is marked by volatility. Trade tensions, shifts in central bank policies, and geopolitical events are creating uncertainty in traditional markets. In such an environment, portfolio diversification becomes paramount. How does Bitcoin fit into this picture? Low Correlation with Traditional Assets: Bitcoin has historically shown a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This means that Bitcoin’s price movements are often independent of traditional market fluctuations, making it an effective diversification tool. Risk Mitigation: By including Bitcoin in a portfolio, investors can potentially mitigate overall portfolio risk. When traditional assets underperform, Bitcoin may act as a counterbalance, cushioning potential losses. Enhanced Returns: While diversification aims to reduce risk, it can also enhance returns. Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can boost overall portfolio performance, especially when traditional markets are stagnant or declining. For investors seeking to navigate the choppy waters of today’s markets, Bitcoin offers a compelling option for diversification, potentially enhancing portfolio stability and returns. This increased adoption for diversification purposes further strengthens the bullish case for Bitcoin and its potential to reach the predicted price rally targets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this analysis, and how can you leverage this information? Monitor Support Levels: Keep a close eye on the $70,000–$75,000 Bitcoin support level . A sustained hold above this zone could signal further upward momentum. Stay Informed on Market Dynamics: Be aware of global economic factors, traditional market trends, and regulatory developments that could influence Bitcoin’s price. Consider Portfolio Allocation: If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and diversification benefits, consider strategically allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin, keeping risk tolerance in mind. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Always conduct thorough research and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. This analysis provides insights, but it’s not financial advice. The crypto market is dynamic and fast-paced. Staying informed, understanding key technical levels like Bitcoin support levels , and considering Bitcoin’s broader role in the financial landscape are crucial for navigating this exciting asset class. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Resilient Foundation and Future Potential In conclusion, the analysis highlighting the $70,000–$75,000 zone as a strong Bitcoin support level paints an optimistic picture for the cryptocurrency’s near future. While global market uncertainties persist, Bitcoin’s inherent strengths as a store of value and a diversification tool could very well propel it towards – and potentially beyond – the $110,000 mark. Keep watching this space; the crypto journey is far from over, and Bitcoin continues to be at the forefront of this financial revolution.

The Bitcoin market just witnessed a truly astonishing event. In a single hour, a staggering 8,826.43 Bitcoin (BTC) were withdrawn from major cryptocurrency exchanges. This significant Bitcoin withdrawal is turning heads and sparking conversations across the crypto sphere. What does this massive movement of Bitcoin mean for the future of the market? Let’s dive deep into the details. What’s Behind This Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal? According to data from CryptoQuant, a leading cryptocurrency analytics platform, a substantial amount of Bitcoin has left centralized exchanges in the last 60 minutes. Specifically, CryptoQuant reported that: Bitfinex saw an outflow of 5,425 BTC. Coinbase Advanced experienced a withdrawal of 1,118 BTC. Binance recorded 971 BTC in outflows. These are not small numbers. Such a large and rapid Bitcoin withdrawal suggests a significant shift in investor sentiment or strategy. CryptoQuant suggests that these withdrawals, particularly from exchanges that do not offer custody or OTC (Over-the-Counter) trading services, could indicate new wallet transfers. But what does that actually mean? Decoding the Exchange Outflows: New Wallets or Something More? When we talk about exchange outflows , it essentially means Bitcoin is moving off of exchanges and likely into private wallets. This is often interpreted as a bullish signal because: Reduced Selling Pressure: Bitcoin held on exchanges is readily available for selling. When large amounts are withdrawn, it reduces the immediate supply available for trade, potentially decreasing selling pressure and supporting price appreciation. Long-Term Holding: Moving Bitcoin to personal wallets often signifies a long-term holding strategy. Investors may be less inclined to sell if their Bitcoin is securely stored offline, indicating confidence in future price increases. Institutional Accumulation?: Large exchange outflows could be a sign of institutional investors accumulating Bitcoin for their treasuries or long-term investment portfolios. Institutions often prefer to hold their assets in secure, non-custodial solutions. However, it’s crucial to consider alternative explanations. While CryptoQuant suggests “new wallet transfers,” we should also ponder: OTC Deals: While mentioned as less likely by CryptoQuant for these specific exchanges, large withdrawals can sometimes be related to Over-the-Counter (OTC) deals where large blocks of Bitcoin are traded privately, and then withdrawn from exchanges. Custodial Solutions: Although CryptoQuant notes exchanges not supporting custody, it’s possible some withdrawals are related to movements to different custodial solutions, though this might be less likely to occur in such a short timeframe. Impact on the Crypto Market: Is This a Bullish Signal? The immediate impact of such significant exchange outflows on the crypto market is often perceived as positive. Why? Because it hints at reduced supply and potentially increased scarcity. Think of it like this: If demand remains constant or increases while the readily available supply on exchanges decreases, basic economics suggests prices could rise. This Bitcoin withdrawal event could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s future, signaling that large holders are choosing to store their BTC rather than trade it actively on exchanges. However, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, and no single event guarantees a specific outcome. Other factors also play a crucial role, including: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic factors, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events can all influence crypto prices. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in regulations concerning cryptocurrencies can have a significant impact on market sentiment and price action. Overall Market Sentiment: General investor mood, fear and greed levels, and media narratives can drive short-term price fluctuations. BTC Transfers: Understanding the Movement of Bitcoin Understanding BTC transfers is key to interpreting on-chain data like these exchange outflows . When we see large BTC transfers off exchanges, it’s essential to ask: Who is moving the Bitcoin? Is it retail investors, whales (large holders), institutions, or exchanges themselves rebalancing their reserves? Where is the Bitcoin going? Is it moving to known custodial wallets, cold storage, or unknown addresses? What is the likely motivation? Is it accumulation, long-term storage, participation in DeFi (Decentralized Finance), or something else entirely? Analyzing BTC transfers in conjunction with other on-chain metrics and market indicators can provide a more comprehensive picture of market dynamics. Are Institutional Investors Fueling the Bitcoin Outflow? The potential involvement of institutional investors in these exchange outflows is a hot topic. Institutions are increasingly entering the crypto space, and their investment strategies can significantly impact the market. If institutions are indeed behind these large withdrawals, it could signify: Growing Institutional Adoption: Large Bitcoin withdrawal events could be further evidence of increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Institutions typically have a longer investment horizon than retail traders. Their accumulation of Bitcoin for long-term holding could contribute to sustained price appreciation over time. Market Maturation: Increased institutional participation often signals a maturing market, bringing more stability and potentially reducing volatility in the long run (though short-term volatility can still be significant). However, definitively attributing these outflows to institutional investors requires more data and analysis. Following on-chain movements and tracking institutional announcements and filings can provide further clues. Conclusion: A Significant Event, But Context is Key The astonishing Bitcoin withdrawal of 8,826.43 BTC from exchanges in just one hour is undoubtedly a significant event. It suggests a potential shift in supply dynamics and could be interpreted as a bullish signal for the crypto market . Whether it’s driven by institutional investors , whales moving funds to new wallets, or a combination of factors, it warrants close attention. However, remember that the crypto market is complex and influenced by numerous variables. While this Bitcoin withdrawal is noteworthy, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Always consider the broader market context, macroeconomic factors, and your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions based on a single event.

40884072,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134662,1740613399,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: Justin Sun SEC Case Nears Potential Resolution – What it Means for Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/justin-sun-sec-case-settlement/,"The crypto world is buzzing with news that could potentially alter the landscape of digital asset regulation. According to a recent report from Solid Intel on X, Justin Sun, the influential founder of Tron (TRX), is reportedly exploring a settlement in his ongoing civil fraud case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This urgent development could signal a significant shift in how regulatory bodies approach cryptocurrency projects and their leaders. But what exactly does this mean for Justin Sun, Tron holders, and the broader crypto ecosystem? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. Justin Sun SEC Case: Unpacking the Allegations In March 2023, the SEC dropped a bombshell lawsuit against Justin Sun, accusing him of a range of serious violations. The charges are multifaceted and strike at the heart of regulatory concerns within the cryptocurrency space. The SEC’s accusations against the Tron Founder include: Selling Unregistered Securities: The core of the SEC’s argument revolves around the allegation that TRX tokens and BitTorrent (BTT) tokens were offered and sold as unregistered securities. Under U.S. law, securities must be registered with the SEC unless they qualify for an exemption. The SEC claims that Sun and his entities failed to register these tokens, thus violating securities laws. Fraudulent Scheme: Beyond unregistered securities, the SEC alleges that Sun engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the secondary market for TRX. This involves accusations of wash trading, where the same individual or entity acts as both the buyer and seller to create artificial trading volume and inflate the perceived demand for TRX. Market Manipulation: The SEC further contends that Sun orchestrated a manipulative scheme to artificially inflate the trading volume of TRX. This alleged manipulation was intended to create a false impression of active trading and investor interest in TRX, potentially misleading other investors. Airdrops as Unregistered Securities: Adding another layer to the complexity, the SEC also classified airdrops of TRX and BTT as unregistered securities offerings. Airdrops, typically used for marketing and distribution, are being scrutinized under the lens of securities regulations, raising significant questions for future token distribution models. These are serious accusations that have cast a shadow over Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem. The potential TRX Settlement now being explored could represent a crucial turning point in this legal battle. TRX Settlement on the Horizon: What Could Resolution Look Like? News of a potential settlement brings a glimmer of hope for a resolution to this protracted legal saga. While the specifics of any potential TRX Settlement remain undisclosed, settlements in SEC cases often involve several components: Settlement Component Potential Implications for Justin Sun & Tron Financial Penalties (Fines & Disgorgement) Substantial fines and disgorgement (returning ill-gotten gains) are common. This could impact Tron’s treasury and Sun’s personal finances. Cease-and-Desist Orders An order to halt specific activities deemed unlawful. This might involve changes to how Tron operates, particularly regarding token sales and marketing. Undertakings & Compliance Measures Agreements to implement specific compliance measures to prevent future violations. This could include enhanced reporting, oversight, or changes to governance structures. Admission of Guilt (Varying Degrees) Settlements can range from admitting no guilt to admitting certain facts or agreeing to findings without admitting or denying the allegations. The level of admission can significantly impact public perception and future legal implications. For Tron holders, a settlement could bring a sense of clarity and reduce the uncertainty surrounding TRX. However, the terms of the settlement will be crucial. Large financial penalties could indirectly impact the Tron ecosystem, while required compliance measures might alter future operations. Conversely, a settlement could be viewed positively, removing a major legal overhang and potentially boosting investor confidence in TRX. Crypto Regulation and the SEC Lawsuit: A Broader Industry Perspective The SEC Lawsuit against Justin Sun is not an isolated incident. It’s part of a broader trend of increased regulatory scrutiny on the cryptocurrency industry. The SEC has been actively asserting its jurisdiction over digital assets, particularly those it deems to be securities. This case, along with others, highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the crypto space and the need for regulatory oversight to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Key aspects of the broader Crypto Regulation landscape illustrated by this case include: Securities Classification: The SEC’s stance on classifying many cryptocurrencies as securities remains a contentious issue. The Howey Test, used to determine if an asset is an investment contract and thus a security, is being applied to digital assets, often leading to debates and legal challenges. Enforcement Actions: The SEC is increasingly using enforcement actions, like the lawsuit against Justin Sun, to signal its regulatory boundaries and deter non-compliance. These actions can have significant repercussions for crypto projects and the market as a whole. International Regulatory Coordination: Crypto regulation is not just a U.S. issue. Global coordination among regulatory bodies is becoming more important as crypto markets are inherently international. The outcome of the Justin Sun case could have ripple effects on international regulatory approaches. The Need for Clarity: Many in the crypto industry call for clearer regulatory guidelines. The ambiguity surrounding regulations can stifle innovation and create uncertainty. Cases like this underscore the urgency for more defined rules of the road for crypto businesses to operate within legal frameworks. Tron Founder’s Response and Potential Defense Strategies While Justin Sun has maintained a public profile and continued to be active in the crypto space throughout the SEC investigation, his direct legal defense strategies have been less publicly discussed. However, in similar cases, potential defense arguments often revolve around: Token Utility vs. Investment Contract: Arguing that TRX and BTT tokens primarily serve utility purposes within the Tron network and are not solely investment contracts. This challenges the SEC’s classification of these tokens as securities. Lack of Intent to Defraud: Contesting the allegations of fraud and market manipulation by arguing that any trading activity was not intentionally manipulative or fraudulent. This requires demonstrating a lack of malicious intent and potentially presenting alternative explanations for the trading patterns the SEC flagged. Due Process and Fair Notice: Raising concerns about due process and whether sufficient notice was given regarding the SEC’s evolving interpretation of securities laws in the context of cryptocurrencies. This argument often centers on the novelty of crypto assets and the lack of clear, pre-existing regulations. A settlement could indicate a strategic decision by Justin Sun to avoid a potentially lengthy and costly legal battle, regardless of the strength of his potential defenses. Settlements often represent a compromise, allowing both sides to mitigate risks and move forward. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Key Takeaways for the Industry The Justin Sun SEC Case and the potential TRX Settlement offer valuable lessons for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Legal Compliance: Crypto projects must prioritize legal compliance from the outset. This includes seeking legal counsel early, understanding securities laws, and implementing robust compliance programs. Transparency and Disclosure: Increased transparency and clear disclosures about token sales, tokenomics, and project operations are crucial for building trust with investors and regulators. Engage with Regulators: Proactive engagement with regulatory bodies can be beneficial. Open communication and a willingness to address regulatory concerns can foster a more constructive dialogue and potentially mitigate future enforcement actions. Decentralization and Governance: Projects should consider robust decentralization and governance models to reduce reliance on central figures and potentially mitigate regulatory risks associated with centralized control. Monitor Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. Staying informed about the latest regulatory developments, both in the U.S. and globally, is essential for navigating this complex environment. Conclusion: A Developing Story with Far-Reaching Implications The potential settlement in the Justin Sun SEC case is a developing story with potentially far-reaching implications for Justin Sun, Tron, and the broader cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the increasing regulatory scrutiny on digital assets and the urgent need for clarity and compliance within the crypto space. As the details of any potential TRX Settlement emerge, the crypto world will be watching closely to understand the full ramifications of this landmark case. This situation serves as a crucial reminder of the evolving regulatory landscape and the importance of navigating it proactively and responsibly.

According to Saylor, Bitcoin is an open protocol for enhancing personal freedom and expanding free markets through networks. The endorsement is particularly taking place against the backdrop of economic policies and financial independence. Saylor, a well-known supporter of Bitcoin, argues that the asset offers an environment that can replace traditional finance systems. He speaks this at a time when there is a push for digital currencies that would enhance a country’s monetary independence. Bitcoin is the best way to promote personal liberties and free markets. It offers an open protocol for prosperity that can be delivered to everyone via digital technology. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) February 26, 2025 Bezos’ controversy over editorial policy Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, recently changed the policy for the paper’s opinion section. According to the new policy, only content that promotes free markets and individual freedoms will be allowed. David Shipley, who is the editor responsible for the opinion page, tendered his resignation regarding the change. Bezos supported the policy, arguing that free markets and liberties for its people are good for the country. He also noted that the internet offers enough outlets for opposition opinions and implied that the subject is selected on purpose. Although Bezos’ decision became a subject of debate, certain industry analysts argue that he is not alone in this, as media outlet owners have always influenced their outlets’ editorial policies. Some people state that, in large measure, private ownership enables editorial freedom, though this may lead to perceptible bias. Bitcoin adoption among public companies surges At the same time, the number of operating companies that have adopted Bitcoin in their investment plans is rapidly growing. According to Cryptopolitan, the acquisition of BTC by public corporations increased to 139% in 2023. It is also important to mention that Bitcoin has not taken more than 1 % of the country’s Treasury. Bitcoin was compared to the Internet, and it remains undiscovered as far as its use in saving and payment systems is concerned. The report also explained that companies have been acquiring over 1000 BTC per day since January 2024. Also, 80% of the publicly listed firms made an investment in Bitcoin last year. Bitcoin’s price has now dipped to 83,500, the lowest level it has been at since November 2024. The cryptocurrency has dropped by $12,820 in the last three trading days, leading to over $1 billion in leveraged long liquidations, as per CoinGlass.

According to recent reports from Aggr News, this closure comes without any enforcement action, marking a potentially significant moment for Gemini and the broader landscape of crypto regulation . Are we witnessing a shift in regulatory approaches, or is this a unique case for Gemini? Let’s dive into what this means for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, and industry observer. Decoding the SEC Investigation Gemini Closure: What Happened? For those following the intricate world of digital assets, regulatory scrutiny is no stranger. The SEC’s investigation into Gemini SEC , a well-known cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, has been a point of concern and speculation. The exact details of the investigation were never fully public, adding to the uncertainty. However, the outcome is now clear: the SEC has decided to close the case without pursuing any charges or regulatory action against Gemini. This is a crucial development because: No Enforcement Action: The most immediate takeaway is that Gemini has avoided potential penalties, fines, or restrictions that could have arisen from SEC enforcement. Validation for Gemini: The closure can be interpreted as a form of implicit validation for Gemini’s operations and compliance measures, at least in the context of this particular investigation. Broader Market Sentiment: Such news can positively influence market sentiment, suggesting that not all regulatory engagements necessarily lead to negative outcomes for crypto platforms. To put this into perspective, consider the table below comparing potential outcomes of SEC investigations: Outcome Impact on Company Market Perception Enforcement Action (Fines, Restrictions) Financial penalties, operational limitations, reputational damage Negative, potential market downturn for the company and sector Investigation Closure (No Action) Avoidance of penalties, affirmation of compliance (in this instance) Positive, potential market boost for the company and sector Why is the SEC Investigation into Gemini Significant for Crypto Regulation? The SEC’s decision regarding the SEC investigation Gemini isn’t just about one exchange; it carries broader implications for the entire crypto regulation landscape. Here’s why this closure is being closely watched: Precedent Setting? While each case is unique, decisions from regulatory bodies like the SEC can set precedents or at least provide signals about their current stance. The lack of action in this instance might be interpreted by some as a less aggressive approach, although it’s crucial not to overgeneralize. Clarity (or Lack Thereof): The crypto industry has long sought clearer regulatory guidelines. While this specific closure provides relief, it doesn’t inherently offer broad clarity on SEC’s overall approach to digital asset regulation. The industry still awaits comprehensive frameworks. Investor Confidence: News like this can subtly boost investor confidence. It suggests that established players in the crypto space can navigate regulatory scrutiny and emerge without major repercussions, fostering a sense of stability. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”Gemini SEC Investigation Closure”] What Does This Mean for Gemini and Other Crypto Exchanges? For Gemini SEC , this news is undoubtedly a victory. It allows them to move forward without the shadow of an ongoing investigation, potentially strengthening their position in the competitive cryptocurrency exchange market. But what about other exchanges? Benchmarking Compliance: Other exchanges will likely scrutinize this case to understand what might have contributed to the SEC’s decision. Was it Gemini’s compliance protocols, their engagement with regulators, or other factors? It serves as an informal benchmark. Continued Vigilance: Despite this positive outcome for Gemini, no crypto exchange can afford to become complacent. Regulatory scrutiny remains a constant in the industry, and proactive compliance is paramount. Market Competition: A relieved Gemini can now focus more intently on growth and innovation, potentially intensifying competition among crypto exchanges. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Crypto Exchange Gemini and Regulations The closure of the SEC investigation Gemini is a noteworthy event, but the journey of crypto regulation is far from over.

Bybit concluded from the review that ""the credentials of a Safe developer were compromised,"" which allowed the Lazarus hacking group to gain unauthorized access to the Safe wallet and subsequently deceive Bybit staff into signing the malicious transaction. However, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that despite the wallet's infrastructure being compromised by social engineering, the hack would not have been possible had Bybit not ""blind signed"" the transaction. The term refers to a mechanism where a smart contract transaction is approved without comprehensive knowledge of its contents. Safe also issued a statement saying that ""Safe smart contracts [were] unaffected, an attack was conducted by compromising a Safe {Wallet} developer machine which affected an account operated by Bybit."" It also pointed out that a ""forensic review of external security researchers did NOT indicate any vulnerabilities in the Safe smart contracts or source code of the frontend and services."" The apparent back and forth between both companies mirrors that of WazirX and Liminal Custody, which blamed each other following a $230 million exploit last July. On-chain data analyzed by ZachXBT shows that Lazarus is attempting to launder the stolen funds, with 920 wallets currently being tainted with the ill-gotten gains. The funds, perhaps inadvertently, have been commingled with stolen funds from hacks targeting Phemex and Poloniex, linking Lazarus Group to all three.Read more: Bybit Declares ‘War on Lazarus’ as It Crowdsources Effort to Freeze Stolen Funds",Finance|Lazarus group|Hack|Bybit,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-26 23:46:39

The future of Bitcoin mining post-2028 halving is looking less like a gold rush and more like an energy crunch. Mara Holdings (MARA), previously known as Marathon Digital, has sounded the alarm, and it’s a wake-up call the crypto world needs to hear. Are you ready to navigate the turbulent waters ahead for Bitcoin miners ? The Looming Shadow of Bitcoin Halving: What’s the Fuss? For those new to the crypto game, let’s quickly break down what a Bitcoin halving is and why it’s such a big deal. In simple terms, a Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that happens roughly every four years where the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is cut in half. This is designed to control the supply of Bitcoin, making it scarcer over time, mimicking precious metals like gold. Think of it as digital gold becoming even more digitally scarce! Historically, halvings have been associated with price surges, driven by this reduced supply and increased scarcity narrative. However, Mara Holdings is pointing towards a less discussed, but equally critical consequence – the impact on energy costs for miners. While everyone’s been focused on price predictions, are we overlooking the practicalities of keeping the Bitcoin network running? Energy Costs: The Achilles’ Heel for Bitcoin Miners? Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process. Massive server farms, humming 24/7, are needed to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This requires significant electricity consumption, and for many miners, especially those relying on older, less efficient equipment, energy costs are already a major operational expense. Mara Holdings highlights a critical point: most miners are still plugged into the traditional power grid. This means they are subject to fluctuating energy prices, and as demand for electricity grows globally, these prices are unlikely to decrease. Post-halving, when mining rewards are slashed, the equation changes drastically. Miners will need to be significantly more efficient to remain profitable. Imagine running a business where your revenue is automatically cut in half every four years – you’d need a solid strategy to survive, right? Mara Holdings’ Stark Warning: Adapt or Perish Mara Holdings, a significant player in the Bitcoin mining space, isn’t just speculating; they’re sharing insights from the front lines. Their shareholder letter, as reported by CoinDesk, isn’t sugarcoating the situation. They explicitly state that many miners, especially those who fail to adapt, may not survive the rising energy costs after the 2028 halving. This isn’t just about profitability; it’s about survival in a rapidly evolving and competitive landscape. The core message from Mara Holdings is clear: differentiation and diversification are no longer optional – they are essential. Miners who simply operate as ‘price takers,’ passively accepting market conditions, will likely struggle. This calls for a proactive and strategic approach. What exactly does this proactive approach entail? Strategies for Bitcoin Mining Survival: Beyond Price Speculation So, how can Bitcoin miners navigate this impending energy cost crisis and thrive beyond the 2028 halving? Here are some key strategies to consider: Embrace Renewable Energy: This is perhaps the most crucial step. Miners need to aggressively transition towards renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power. Not only is this environmentally responsible, but it also offers a pathway to more stable and potentially cheaper energy costs in the long run. Imagine powering your mining operations with sunshine – a truly decentralized and sustainable approach! Improve Mining Efficiency: Investing in the latest generation of mining hardware is paramount. Newer ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are significantly more energy-efficient than older models. Upgrading equipment can dramatically reduce the energy consumed per Bitcoin mined, directly impacting profitability. It’s like upgrading from a gas-guzzling car to a fuel-efficient hybrid. Diversify Revenue Streams: Relying solely on Bitcoin mining rewards might become increasingly risky. Miners should explore diversifying their revenue streams. This could include: Offering hosting services for other miners. Participating in transaction fee markets. Exploring opportunities in adjacent sectors like AI and high-performance computing, which can leverage similar infrastructure. Strategic Location Selection: Location, location, location! Miners need to strategically choose locations with access to affordable energy, favorable regulatory environments, and potentially cooler climates to reduce cooling costs. Think of regions with abundant renewable energy resources or those offering incentives for green energy adoption. Hedging and Risk Management: Implementing robust hedging strategies to mitigate price volatility and energy cost fluctuations is crucial. This can involve using derivatives markets and securing long-term energy contracts. Diversification: The Crypto Mining Game Changer? Mara Holdings’ emphasis on diversification isn’t just about surviving the halving; it’s about future-proofing the crypto mining industry. The crypto landscape is rapidly evolving, and miners need to adapt to remain relevant and profitable. Diversification can take many forms, from exploring different cryptocurrencies to mine (although Bitcoin remains dominant) to venturing into related tech sectors. The core idea is to move beyond being solely reliant on Bitcoin price fluctuations and mining rewards. By diversifying, miners can create more resilient and sustainable businesses, capable of weathering market volatility and adapting to technological advancements. It’s about building a broader foundation for long-term success in the dynamic world of crypto. The Road Ahead: Navigating the Post-Halving Landscape The message from Mara Holdings is clear and compelling: the Bitcoin halving in 2028 and beyond will present significant challenges for miners, primarily driven by rising energy costs. However, these challenges are not insurmountable. By embracing innovation, prioritizing efficiency, diversifying revenue streams, and adopting sustainable practices, Bitcoin miners can not only survive but thrive in the evolving crypto ecosystem. The future of Bitcoin mining hinges on proactive adaptation and strategic foresight. Those who heed the warning and take decisive action will be best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. The energy crisis isn’t just a threat; it’s a catalyst for innovation and a push towards a more sustainable and resilient Bitcoin network.

40884318,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134677,1740613802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: Sen. Lummis Champions Landmark Crypto Regulation with FIT21 and GENIUS Act,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lummis-champions-crypto-regulation/,"In a powerful move that could redefine the future of digital assets in the United States, Senator Cynthia Lummis has stepped into the spotlight, urging immediate action on two groundbreaking pieces of legislation: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and the Stablecoin Act, also known as the GENIUS Act. For anyone invested in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, this is a pivotal moment. Let’s dive into what these bills mean and why Senator Lummis’s advocacy is making waves in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation . Why is Senator Lummis Pushing for Crypto Regulation Now? Senator Lummis, a well-known advocate for responsible innovation in the digital asset space, has consistently emphasized the need for clear and concise rules to govern the cryptocurrency market. Her recent call to action during a congressional hearing underscores the growing bipartisan consensus that the U.S. needs to establish a robust framework for crypto regulation to foster growth while protecting consumers and investors. The urgency stems from several factors: Investor Protection: The current lack of clarity leaves investors vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation. Clear regulations can provide a safety net and boost confidence in the market. Innovation and Growth: Ambiguity stifles innovation. A well-defined regulatory landscape can encourage businesses to build and innovate within the crypto space in the U.S., rather than moving overseas. Global Competitiveness: Other countries are actively developing their crypto regulations. The U.S. risks falling behind if it doesn’t establish its own framework, potentially losing out on economic opportunities. Market Stability: Unregulated markets can be volatile. Clear rules can contribute to a more stable and predictable crypto environment. Senator Lummis believes that FIT21 and the GENIUS Act are crucial steps towards achieving these goals. Let’s break down each bill to understand their individual significance. Decoding the FIT21 Act: A New Dawn for Crypto Classification? The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21 Act , is arguably the more comprehensive of the two bills. Its primary aim is to provide much-needed clarity on how cryptocurrencies should be classified under U.S. law. Currently, the debate often revolves around whether a cryptocurrency should be considered a security or a commodity. This distinction is critical because it determines which regulatory agency—the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)—has jurisdiction. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what the FIT21 Act proposes: Key Feature Description Primary Classification Classifies most cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities. Regulatory Agency Grants the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) primary regulatory authority over crypto commodities. Decentralization Focus Emphasizes the degree of decentralization of a cryptocurrency network in determining its classification. More decentralized networks are more likely to be considered commodities. Clarity for Businesses Aims to provide a clear legal framework for crypto businesses to operate within, reducing uncertainty and encouraging compliance. By classifying cryptocurrencies as commodities, the FIT21 Act seeks to recognize the unique nature of these digital assets and apply a regulatory approach that is more suited to their decentralized and transactional characteristics. This move could potentially unlock significant innovation and investment in the crypto space, as it provides a more predictable and less burdensome regulatory path compared to being classified as securities. The GENIUS Act: Taming the Wild West of Stablecoins? The Stablecoin Act, or GENIUS Act (though it’s officially known by a longer, more formal title), zeroes in on stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins have become increasingly important in the crypto ecosystem, serving as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. However, their rapid growth has also raised concerns about their stability, reserves, and potential risks to the financial system. The GENIUS Act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins. Here’s what it entails: Federal Oversight: Proposes federal oversight of stablecoin issuers, likely under a banking regulator or a newly designated agency. Reserve Requirements: Seeks to mandate that stablecoin issuers hold adequate reserves to back their stablecoins, ensuring that they can maintain their peg and meet redemption requests. Transparency and Auditing: Aims to increase transparency by requiring regular audits and public disclosure of stablecoin reserves and operations. Consumer Protection: Focuses on protecting consumers by ensuring stablecoin stability and providing recourse in case of issuer failure. The GENIUS Act is particularly timely given the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market and the potential systemic risks associated with these assets. By establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuers, the legislation aims to foster trust and stability in this critical segment of the crypto market, paving the way for broader adoption and integration with the traditional financial system. Bipartisan Support: A Ray of Hope for Crypto Legislation? One of the most encouraging aspects of the push for FIT21 and the GENIUS Act is the bipartisan support it’s garnering. As The Block reported, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are recognizing the need to advance stablecoin legislation and broader crypto regulation in the new Congress. This bipartisan momentum is crucial because it increases the likelihood of these bills moving forward and eventually becoming law. In a politically polarized environment, finding common ground on complex issues like crypto regulation is a significant achievement and signals a growing understanding of the importance of this sector. Why is bipartisan support so vital? Increased Probability of Passage: Bipartisan bills have a much higher chance of passing through both houses of Congress and being signed into law by the President. Political Stability: Bipartisan support ensures that crypto regulation is less likely to be drastically altered with changes in political power, providing long-term stability for the industry. Broader Acceptance: Bipartisan consensus can help build public trust and acceptance of crypto assets by demonstrating that regulation is not a partisan issue but a matter of national economic and technological importance. Senator Lummis’s call for action is therefore not just a voice from one side of the political spectrum but represents a growing consensus that spans party lines. This unified front significantly strengthens the prospects for meaningful crypto regulation in the U.S. What are the Potential Benefits of FIT21 and the GENIUS Act? If FIT21 and the GENIUS Act are successfully passed and implemented, the potential benefits for the crypto industry and the broader U.S. economy are substantial: Clarity and Certainty: The most immediate benefit is the clarity these bills would provide. Businesses and investors would have a much clearer understanding of the rules of the game, reducing legal and regulatory uncertainty. Attracting Investment: Clear regulations can attract significant investment into the crypto space. Institutional investors, in particular, are more likely to enter the market when there is a well-defined regulatory framework. Fostering Innovation: By providing a predictable regulatory environment, these bills can encourage innovation in crypto technologies and applications. Businesses can focus on building and growing without constant fear of regulatory crackdowns. Consumer Protection: Both bills prioritize consumer protection, whether through stablecoin reserve requirements or clearer rules for crypto exchanges and service providers. This can enhance trust and confidence in the market. Global Leadership: By establishing a comprehensive and forward-looking regulatory framework, the U.S. can reassert its leadership in financial innovation and technology, attracting crypto businesses and talent from around the world. These benefits are not just theoretical. Countries that have already implemented clear crypto regulations, like some in Europe and Asia, are seeing increased investment and innovation in their digital asset sectors. The U.S. has the potential to unlock similar growth by embracing sensible and forward-thinking crypto regulation . Challenges and the Road Ahead While the momentum behind FIT21 and the GENIUS Act is encouraging, the path to passage is not without its challenges. Here are some hurdles that need to be overcome: Regulatory Turf Wars: There may be ongoing debates and negotiations between different regulatory agencies (SEC, CFTC, banking regulators) regarding their respective roles and jurisdictions under these new laws. Lobbying and Opposition: Incumbent financial institutions and other interest groups may lobby against certain aspects of these bills, seeking to protect their existing market positions. Complexity of Implementation: Even if passed, implementing these laws will be a complex undertaking, requiring detailed rule-making and coordination among various agencies. Evolving Technology: The crypto space is rapidly evolving. Regulations need to be flexible and adaptable to keep pace with technological advancements and prevent unintended consequences. Despite these challenges, the bipartisan support and the clear need for crypto regulation provide a strong foundation for moving forward. Senator Lummis’s vocal advocacy is a crucial catalyst in pushing these important conversations and legislative efforts ahead. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto in the U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis’s urgent call for the passage of the FIT21 and GENIUS Act marks a pivotal moment in the quest for clear and effective crypto regulation in the United States. These bills represent a significant step towards establishing a framework that can foster innovation, protect consumers, and ensure market stability in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. With bipartisan support growing and the need for clarity becoming increasingly pressing, the crypto industry and its stakeholders are watching closely to see if this moment will translate into landmark legislation that shapes the future of finance. The potential is immense, and the time for action, as Senator Lummis emphasizes, is now.

His expertise is expected to aid in crafting more adaptable rules that balance innovation with accountability. Former Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) announced on Wednesday via X that he has joined venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) as a senior advisor, following the conclusion of his two-decade tenure in the U.S. Congress. Patrick McHenry Announces a16z Position “Excited to share that I’m joining @a16z as a Senior Advisor,” McHenry said . “Technology is the future of economic growth, and I’m eager to help innovators navigate the policy landscape so they can build.” Excited to share that I’m joining @a16z as a Senior Advisor! Technology is the future of economic growth, and I’m eager to help innovators navigate the policy landscape so they can build. — Patrick McHenry (@PatrickMcHenry) February 26, 2025 McHenry did not elaborate on his specific responsibilities but emphasized his commitment to removing “bureaucratic barriers for American entrepreneurs.” “For too long, D.C. has created barriers for startups and emerging companies,” McHenry continued. “It’s time to level the playing field and ensure that Little Tech—the next generation of builders—gets a fair shot.” Andreessen Horowitz’s Role in Tech and Crypto A16z, founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, has made substantial investments in the technology and blockchain sectors. The Silicon Valley-based firm was a major contributor to Fairshake, a digital asset super PAC focused on supporting crypto-friendly congressional candidates ahead of the 2024 U.S. elections. Andreessen, known for advising key figures in the tech sector such as Mark Zuckerberg, has voiced concerns about regulatory policies under the Biden administration after previously backing Democratic candidates. McHenry’s Background in Digital Asset Legislation McHenry, a key advocate for digital asset legislation during his time on Capitol Hill, briefly served as Speaker pro tempore of the House after Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s removal in late 2023. In May 2024, he spearheaded efforts to pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act through the House of Representatives, marking a rare instance of bipartisan cooperation in crypto regulation. News of McHenry’s latest venture comes just weeks after he announced a new advisory position at fintech payments organization Stripe. Crypto’s Policy Battle Moves Beyond Capitol Hill For years, McHenry fought to bring regulatory clarity to digital assets from within Congress. Now, as a senior advisor to one of crypto’s most powerful venture firms, his role shifts from lawmaker to industry advocate. This transition highlights a broader trend in the financial sector: when regulatory progress stalls in Washington, the private sector steps in to steer the conversation. A16z has already been active in political funding, backing pro-crypto candidates and advocating for industry-friendly policies. With McHenry onboard, the firm is doubling down on its efforts to influence the rules of the game. Whether this fosters constructive dialogue with regulators or deepens tensions between Washington and the crypto industry will become clear over time, but one thing is certain—policy decisions affecting digital assets are no longer confined to legislative chambers. What does McHenry’s move to a16z signify for the future of crypto regulation? His appointment signals a growing recognition that regulatory expertise is vital not only in public policy but also in shaping the private sector’s approach to technology. By bringing his legislative experience to a16z, McHenry is positioned to help craft frameworks that balance innovation with effective oversight—a trend increasingly observed as traditional regulators and private firms work more closely together. How might McHenry’s extensive background in legislative advocacy benefit a16z? McHenry’s history of advancing bipartisan crypto legislation and reducing bureaucratic barriers can provide a16z with nuanced insights into the regulatory process. His expertise is likely to inform strategic decisions that align with both industry innovation and the evolving demands of regulatory bodies, helping the firm navigate complex policy environments. Can this strategic hire influence the balance between regulatory oversight and innovation in crypto? Yes, by leveraging his deep understanding of regulatory processes, McHenry can help shape policies that encourage innovation while ensuring necessary consumer protections. His involvement at a16z may facilitate more constructive interactions between industry players and regulatory agencies, potentially leading to a more balanced and supportive framework for digital assets. What challenges might arise from transitioning from a public office role to a private advisory position? One challenge is managing the potential conflict of interest between public policy advocacy and private sector goals. Additionally, the shift requires navigating the political nuances of regulatory reform while maintaining credibility among both regulators and industry stakeholders. Ensuring transparency and objective decision-making will be key to overcoming these hurdles.

Meanwhile, Hedera (HBAR) is showing technical potential, but its movement depends on breaking key resistance levels. Amid these uncertainties, Web3Bay is gaining traction for its practical approach to decentralization. By reshaping e-commerce with blockchain-based transparency and cost efficiency, Web3Bay has already raised $1.5 million in presale funding, drawing strong interest from venture capitalists and crypto whales seeking sustainable investments. Web3Bay Presale: Why VCs & Whales Are Loading Up on Decentralized Shopping Web3Bay is attracting serious investor attention, as its presale has already surpassed $1.5 million in early fundraising. Currently in Stage 4, Web3Bay has already sold over 380 million tokens at a batch price of $0.00456, signaling strong confidence from both venture capitalists and crypto whales. One key reason for this interest is Web3Bay’s vision of redefining e-commerce through decentralization, removing intermediaries and lowering costs for buyers and sellers. As a result, institutional investors recognize its potential to disrupt traditional online marketplaces, offering greater transparency and ownership over digital assets. Consequently, the surge in presale participation reflects growing interest in blockchain-driven retail, a sector poised for major transformation. Unlike speculative memecoins, Web3Bay presents a real-world use case, positioning itself as a promising long-term investment. Thus, early adopters are securing tokens at a discount before prices increase in future stages. Looking ahead, as Web3Bay continues to gain traction, its presale momentum suggests a strong market debut, making it a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the shift toward decentralized commerce. HBAR Eyes Bullish Reversal as Double-Bottom Pattern Forms Hedera (HBAR) is showing signs of a potential trend shift since it has formed a double-bottom pattern around the $0.21 support level. Additionally, this structure, combined with bullish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicates that the ongoing downtrend may be losing strength. To confirm an upward move, HBAR must break through $0.258, aligning with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. If successful, a breakout could trigger further gains toward $0.278, an area of previous price congestion. However, failure to hold above $0.217 may lead to another drop toward $0.20 before a possible rebound. From a technical standpoint, Elliott Wave analysis suggests a five-wave impulsive structure in development, with the third wave potentially pushing HBAR past key resistance levels. At present, HBAR trades at $0.214, with intraday highs of $0.229 and lows of $0.205. A break below $0.217 would invalidate the bullish setup, signaling further consolidation before any decisive movement. Shiba Inu’s $0.01 Dream: Reality Check for 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB) has captivated the crypto community, transforming from a meme into a significant player. However, the aspiration for SHIB to reach $0.01 by 2025 faces substantial challenges. For this to happen, drastic token burns would be required to reduce its vast supply, along with the development of robust use cases beyond its meme origin and significant adoption driven by large-scale investors. At present, SHIB’s price remains far from this target, and while there’s potential for growth, expecting a surge to $0.01 appears overly optimistic. In contrast, emerging projects like Dawgz AI are gaining attention. Unlike SHIB, which heavily relies on community enthusiasm, Dawgz AI offers tangible utilities, such as automated trading bots designed to optimize profits. This shift suggests a growing investor interest in cryptocurrencies that provide real-world applications and consistent returns, moving beyond the traditional meme coin hype. Final Thoughts Investors often weigh potential against practicality, and Web3Bay stands out by offering a real-world use case rather than relying on speculation. While Shiba Inu’s ambitious price target faces steep challenges and HBAR’s movement depends on overcoming resistance levels, Web3Bay is already demonstrating strong market confidence. With over $1.5 million raised and 380 million tokens sold, its decentralized e-commerce model is attracting both institutional and retail investors. As the presale continues to gain momentum, Web3Bay presents a compelling case for those seeking a sustainable, utility-driven investment over short-term hype.

With meme coins dominating headlines, early investors are constantly looking for the next breakout project. While Dog (Bitcoin) continues to be the big dog in the crypto space, and SLERF makes waves, a new contender is stealing the spotlight— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). Arctic Pablo Coin is more than just another meme token. This project is quickly gaining traction with an innovative staking system, referral rewards, and an engaging presale journey. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin, Dog (Bitcoin), and SLERF, offering insights into what makes these meme coins so exciting. Earn While You Hold: Arctic Pablo Coin Offers 66% APY During Presale One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s standout features is its lucrative staking rewards. During the presale, investors can stake their APC tokens and earn a massive 66% APY. This provides a strong incentive to hold and boosts long-term profitability. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about passive income—it also rewards active supporters. The project offers referral incentives where users can invite others and earn rewards in return. By spreading the word, investors can grow their holdings without spending an extra dime. Arctic Pablo coin is among the Top New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential . Meme coins thrive on strong communities, and Arctic Pablo Coin is no different. The project hosts engaging community competitions where participants can win APC tokens or USD rewards. This adds a gamified element, increasing engagement and drawing in more investors. With the crypto market constantly evolving, staying ahead with innovative incentives makes all the difference. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Heats Up – Now at Penguinopolis! Unlike traditional meme coin presales , Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) follows a one-of-a-kind journey, moving from one location to another instead of fixed stages. Currently, APC has arrived at Penguinopolis, marking the 12th phase of its journey. This moment presents a golden opportunity for investors, with the current price set at $0.000067 per APC and a total of over $1.61 million already raised. With an anticipated launch price of $0.008, APC offers a massive ROI potential of 11,844.78% from its current value. An investor putting in $1,000 today would receive 14,925,370.00 APC tokens, which could skyrocket to an incredible $14,925,370.00 at launch. As Arctic Pablo Coin continues moving forward, its price will increase, making this a limited-time entry point before the next surge Dog (Bitcoin): The Undisputed King of Meme Coins Dog (Bitcoin) remains the top dog in the meme coin market, solidifying its position as a leader in the crypto space. Recently, the coin has experienced a significant surge in on-chain activity, with whale transactions and adoption rates skyrocketing. This uptick highlights growing confidence among both retail and institutional investors, who are increasingly recognizing the value of meme coins beyond their viral appeal. As more platforms and merchants integrate Dog (Bitcoin) as a payment method, its utility and relevance continue to expand. Institutional interest has also surged, with major players entering the market and driving further momentum. Dog (Bitcoin) is not just a meme—it’s a cultural phenomenon and a testament to the enduring power of community-driven projects in the crypto world. SLERF: The Rising Meme Coin Shaking Up the Crypto Space SLERF has been making waves in the crypto world with its unexpected partnerships and community-driven growth. What started as a fun meme coin has quickly evolved into a serious contender, drawing the attention of traders and investors alike. With new exchange listings, increasing adoption, and a rapidly growing user base, SLERF is proving that it has the potential to break into the mainstream. The coin’s high trading volume reflects strong market interest, and recent developments suggest that SLERF is gearing up for a major rally. As the meme coin market remains one of the most volatile yet rewarding crypto spaces, SLERF defies expectations. With its expanding ecosystem and loyal community, this meme coin is one to watch closely in the coming months. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out The meme coin sector is buzzing with opportunities, but few projects offer as much growth potential as Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . With its high APY staking rewards, lucrative referral incentives, and engaging presale journey, APC draws massive attention from investors. While Dog (Bitcoin) continues to dominate and SLERF’s rapid expansion is turning heads, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as one of the top new meme coins with the potential for massive returns. Currently, in the Penguinopolis phase, APC’s price is still at an early entry point—but not for long. The price will increase as it moves to its next destination, making now the perfect time to invest. Don’t miss out on one of the most explosive presales in the crypto space!

As the excitement surrounding memecoins wanes, prices have dropped to their lowest levels in several months. Following the historic hack of the ByBit exchange and President Trump’s controversial tariff proposals, the overall crypto market has seen a downturn, with Bitcoin falling 12% in the past week. In contrast, Solana has plummeted 22%, reaching a new five-month low. Solana Struggles As New Data Shows Dramatic Drop As reported by Fortune, the decline in Solana’s value can be attributed to its association with recent celebrity-backed memecoin scandals, particularly the LIBRA incident. This cryptocurrency surged to a nearly $5 billion market cap before crashing, following promotion from Argentine President Javier Milei, whose involvement has sparked outrage and prompted an investigation. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Overextended—Is A Market Shakeup Imminent? Zach Pandl, head of research at the crypto asset manager Grayscale, noted that this incident has highlighted the volatility and risks associated with memecoins, stating, “The current phase of memecoin trading on Solana is over.” Solana’s rise as the preferred blockchain for memecoin development was largely due to its low transaction costs, high transaction speeds, and user-friendly infrastructure. Platforms like Pump.fun facilitated the rapid creation of cryptocurrencies on Solana, leading to a peak of over 71,000 memecoins launched in a single day. However, this number has since dwindled to just 26,000, according to data from analytics firm Dune. Analysts Warn Of Potential Drop Below $100 While many memecoins lack intrinsic value and are often linked to scams, Pandl suggested that the recent memecoin frenzy had some positive impacts on the Solana ecosystem. “It onboarded users, generated revenue, and helped stress test the Solana blockchain in various ways,” he explained. “In that sense, memecoin trading is one of the many building blocks to developing the next generation of financial infrastructure.” Adding to Solana’s woes, the open interest for Solana futures has declined by 44% over the past month, dropping from an all-time high of $6.39 billion to just $3.57 billion today. This decline indicates a reduction in investor confidence and interest in leveraging Solana positions. Related Reading: Panic Sell? Bitcoin’s $86K Fall Wipes Out $1 Billion In Trades CoinGecko data also shows a similar pattern from investors, as trading volume has dropped 54% in the last 48 hours, representing only $5 billion of Solana’s total market cap of $66 billion. Currently trading at $134, analysts have identified this price point as a crucial support zone in the ongoing downtrend. According to Crypto General, if this support fails to hold, the next support level could fall below $100, representing a drop of more than 65% from Solana’s all-time highs.

The forensic report left former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao with more questions than answers, and he heavily criticized them, claiming the report was written in vague language to brush over the issues. According to Safe’s investigation report , the forensic review into the targeted attack by the Lazarus Group on Bybit concluded that this attack targeted the Bybit Safe was achieved through a compromised Safe developer machine. The hack resulted in the proposal of a disguised malicious transaction that saw the hackers draw funds from Bybit’s wallet. According to the report, the forensic audit on external security researchers did not indicate any shortcomings in the Safe smart contracts or source code of the frontend and services. The report also indicated that the Safe team conducted a thorough investigation and has now reinstated Safe on the Ethereum mainnet with a phased rollout. The Safe team has fully rebuilt, reconfigured all infrastructure, and rotated all credentials, ensuring the attack vector is fully eliminated. The Safe frontend remains operational with additional security measures in place. However, the report cautioned users to carry out extreme caution and remain vigilant when signing transactions. CZ criticizes Safe’s forensics report for not being detailed enough I usually try not to criticize other industry players, but I still do it once in a while. 😂 This update from Safe is not that great. It uses vague language to brush over the issues. I have more questions than answers after reading it. 1. What does ""compromising a Safe… https://t.co/VxywHyzqXb — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) February 26, 2025 The report has received heavy backlash from Binance founder and former CEO CZ. According to CZ, the report is not detailed enough to address all concerns and has gaping holes as to how the occurrence happened. CZ first questioned what “compromising a Safe developer machine” means. He also questioned how the hackers compromised the subject machine and wondered if it was social engineering, a virus, or something else. CZ also expressed concerns about how a developer machine gained access to an exchange account. He asked if some code got remotely deployed from the developer machine straight to the prod. CZ also expressed his concerns about how the hackers bypassed the ledger verification step at multiple signers. He questioned if the signers failed to verify properly or if they did a blind signing. Bybit also embarked on a deep forensics investigation by contracting to blockchain security firms Sygnia and Verichains. The aim of the investigations centered around the three signers’ hosts as a follow-up on the $1.4 billion hack. CZ also questioned if the $1.4 billion was the largest address managed using Safe and why the hackers didn’t target other wallets. CZ also asked what lessons other “self-custody, multi-sig” wallet providers and users can learn from the ordeal. The investigations from Sygnia concluded that the cause of the incident was a malicious code emanating from Safe’s infrastructure. The report concluded that Bybit’s infrastructure was not affected or compromised in any way during the attack. The report highlighted that the investigations will deepen further to confirm the recent findings. Preliminary conclusions from Verichains revealed that the benign JavaScript file of app.safe.global was replaced on February 19th with malicious code aimed at maiming Bybit’s Ethereum Multisig Cold Wallet. Verichains investigators also recommended that further investigations be conducted to confirm the root cause. Lazarus Group reportedly launders Bybit funds via meme coins UAE-based Bybit exchange fell victim to hackers last week, resulting in the loss of $1.5 billion. The exchange’s CEO said the funds were drawn from one of Bybit’s cold multisig wallets. According to onchain data, North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group, believed to be behind the attack, was observed to have been leveraging memecoins to launder the stolen funds. Cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT reported that Lazarus Group distributed several meme coins on Pump.fun. Binance has also been affected by malicious attacks from cyber criminals. Recently, Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur Joe Zhou reported that scammers sent him a message through the usual Binance number where he typically receives his verification codes, telling him his account was accessed from North Korea. Joe Zhou got on a call with the attackers who misled him into sending funds to a different wallet. Zhou managed to act fast and recover most of his funds before the hackers cashed out.

Neiro has surged 15.06% in the last 24 hours, gaining traction within the Ethereum community, while Floki Inu has seen a 2.24% daily increase despite its 13.93% weekly decline. These tokens are making waves, but all eyes are on BTFD Coin, whose presale has now crossed $6.20 million, drawing in bullish investors at a record pace. Meme coins have evolved beyond simple internet jokes, turning into full-fledged investment opportunities. With BTFD Coin leading the charge as the next crypto to explode , thanks to its 3650% ROI potential, a booming referral program, and an active community, traders are looking for their next high-reward bet. Will Neiro and Floki Inu continue their streak, or will BTFD’s presale momentum make it the most explosive pick? BTFD’s $6.20M Frenzy: 3650% ROI Potential Has Investors Stacking Up BTFD Coin’s presale has been unstoppable, rapidly selling over 70 billion tokens and attracting more than 11,000 investors. With Stage 14 currently live at $0.00016, early buyers are seizing the 100% bonus offer using the LAUNCH100 code—which means double the tokens for every purchase. BTFD is more than just hype—it has an entire ecosystem fueling its success. Its P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, offering players the chance to earn while gaming, while its 90% APY staking program keeps long-term holders raking in passive income. This multi-pronged approach is why analysts predict a post-listing moon price of $0.006—a staggering 3650% potential return for presale investors. Investors who act fast could secure a massive upside. A $5,000 investment at $0.00016 per BTFD token could balloon to $18,750 at $0.0006. But if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price, that same investment could skyrocket to $187,500—an opportunity too good to ignore. For those looking to stack even more tokens, BTFD’s Referral Program is a game-changer. Top 20 referrers get 10% of the total raise in BTFD tokens, making it one of the most rewarding systems in the market. Simply share a referral code, and both the referrer and referee win. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Securing BTFD tokens during presale is quick and easy. Investors need to: Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Visit the BTFD presale page , connect their wallet, and enter the LAUNCH100 code to double their tokens. Complete the purchase and get ready to ride with the bulls. With only two presale stages left, the current $0.00016 price won’t last much longer. This is the perfect dip for those looking to join the bull run before BTFD hits major exchanges.

According to a Wednesday X post from Gemini co-founder and President Cameron Winklevoss, the SEC informed Gemini on Monday that it was closing its investigation into the New York-based crypto exchange and would not be filing enforcement charges against it. But the anti-climactic resolution to the long-running investigation was unsatisfying to Winklevoss, who said in his X post that the SEC’s retreat “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.” “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation,” Winklevoss wrote. “The SEC’s behavior in aggregate towards other crypto companies and projects cost orders of magnitude more and caused unquantifiable loss in economic growth for America.” Winklevoss said that, without consequences for both the SEC and the individual staff members involved in the investigations of Gemini and other crypto companies, other federal agencies could again, in the future, “bully, harass and attack a lawful industry and then decide one day to simply say we’re good and walk away.” In his post, Winklevoss suggested that any agency that “refuses to write rules before it opens an investigation or brings an enforcement action” should be required to reimburse defendants “for 3x [their] legal costs.” Winklevoss also called for all SEC staff members involved in the probe into Gemini to be publicly fired, and their “names, roles, and the actions they participated in should be posted on the SEC website.” “It should not be acceptable to bring the full might of the U.S. government to bear against fledgling companies in a nascent industry and then hide behind a faceless agency or say you were ‘just doing your job’ or ‘following orders.’ These individuals had a choice,” Winklevoss wrote. “They could have asked to be reassigned or resigned. Nobody was forcing them to work at the SEC. Nonetheless they chose to violate their oath and the agency’s mission to ‘make a positive impact on the U.S. economy, our capital markets, and people’s lives’ and instead aided and abetted an unlawful war against a lawful industry.” The SEC’s decision to drop its probe into Gemini comes shortly after it dropped similar investigations into Uniswap Labs, Robinhood Crypto and OpenSea. Earlier Wednesday, the SEC also filed a joint motion to pause its litigation against the Tron Foundation and Justin Sun, similar to recent motions filed in its cases against Coinbase and Binance.

Extreme fear continues to grip the market as SOL fails to find strong support, with bears maintaining control since the cryptocurrency hit its all-time high back in January. Since then, Solana has retraced over 55%, leaving investors uncertain about its short-term prospects. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Down Below Key Demand – Analyst Expects A Drop To $1.65 The broader crypto market remains under pressure, with altcoins struggling to regain bullish momentum. Analysts warn that further declines could be on the horizon if SOL fails to hold key levels. Crypto expert Ali Martinez shared on-chain metrics on X, revealing that Solana’s transfer volume has plummeted dramatically. According to the data, Solana’s transfer volume has dropped from $1.99 billion in November 2024 to just $14.57 million today. This significant decline suggests a steep drop in network activity and interest, raising concerns about the current state of the Solana ecosystem. With bearish sentiment dominating the market and on-chain activity slowing, the coming days will be crucial for SOL. If bulls fail to defend key support levels, Solana could see further downside. However, a strong recovery in volume and price action could indicate renewed interest and potential for a reversal. Solana Struggles Below $150 as Bears Maintain Control Solana is facing significant selling pressure, struggling to break above the $150 mark as bears dominate price action. The broader market sell-off has taken a heavy toll on SOL, with meme coins experiencing some of the steepest declines. Solana, which previously benefited from the meme coin hype cycle, is now seeing a major pullback as speculation fades. Related Reading: Litecoin Trading Activity Increases Over The Past Month – Potential LTC ETF Draws Speculation The price action remains weak as Solana trades below key demand levels that once sustained its long-term bullish structure. Bulls have lost momentum, failing to establish a strong recovery, while bears continue to drag the entire market down. If SOL fails to hold above current demand levels, further downside could be expected in the short term. Martinez’s on-chain data highlights a troubling trend for Solana’s network activity. According to Glassnode, Solana’s transfer volume has plummeted from $1.99 billion in November 2024 to just $14.57 million today. This dramatic drop indicates a sharp decline in network usage and trading activity, further reflecting the cooling-off period in meme coin speculation. The coming days will be critical for Solana. If SOL can hold above key demand levels, a recovery phase could begin. However, continued weakness in volume and price action could lead to further declines, making it essential for bulls to reclaim momentum soon. Price Struggles At $140 Amid Selling Pressure Solana (SOL) is trading at $141 after experiencing days of intense selling pressure, struggling more than most altcoins in the current market downturn. The broader crypto market has faced extreme volatility, with many assets seeing sharp declines. However, Solana remains one of the worst-hit, failing to establish strong support or momentum for a potential rebound. If bulls can defend the $140 level, there is a chance for a short-term recovery. Holding above this crucial demand zone could provide the foundation for a push back above key resistance levels. However, sentiment remains weak, and any further downside in Bitcoin or the broader market could send SOL into deeper corrections. Related Reading: Cardano Remains In Consolidation – Expert Projects 25% Price Move If Solana fails to maintain its current support, the next critical level to watch is $130, where buyers may attempt to step in again. However, a sustained breakdown below this mark would increase the risk of further declines into lower demand zones. The coming days will be crucial for Solana’s price action, as investors wait to see whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if bears will continue to drive the price downward.

However, while Ripple’s XRP remains a major player, a new AI-powered altcoin is stealing the spotlight. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , an emerging Ethereum gem, is attracting serious investor attention with its staggering 40,780% growth potential. As its presale heats up at $0.0420 , crypto whales and smart money are pouring in millions, setting this AI wonder up for an explosive post-listing rally. Investors looking for life-changing returns are locking in their positions early, making sure they don’t miss out on what could be the best AI-driven crypto play of the year. XRP Price Action: A Historic Rally In The Making? Ripple’s XRP has been a key player in the crypto market, currently ranking among the top digital assets by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. With a price hovering around its recent highs, the XRP price at $2.690 is hinting at a significant rally reminiscent of its previous bull runs. Ripple’s ongoing legal battles with the SEC have kept market sentiment volatile, but a potential resolution could send the XRP price soaring. While Ripples’s XRP remains a dominant force, analysts suggest that WallitIQ (WLTQ) could outshine it in terms of raw percentage gains. Unlike Ripple’s XRP, which has already established itself in the market, this AI-powered altcoin is in its early stages, with a presale price of just $0.0420 . Given its AI functionalities and robust use cases, it presents an even stronger investment case. With its explosive growth trajectory of 40,780%, WallitIQ (WLTQ) could deliver astronomical gains, surpassing the XRP price rally in sheer returns.

With its high potential and real-world applications, analysts agree that this AI-powered altcoin is a must-watch, especially as the alt season approaches. Investors who get in at $0.0420 now could be positioning themselves for massive financial gains instead of waiting for the XRP price to play out its projections.

WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the next major crypto opportunity. Its cutting-edge AI features, real-world utility, and massive 40,780% growth potential make it the hottest presale in the market.

Pseudonymous trader Pentoshi tells his 858,600 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins now have less potential to print the same level of gains seen in 2017-2021 because the market has significantly expanded and the total market cap started at a much higher level this cycle. “Well some updated thoughts. I think for alts, we will never see a run like 2017-2021 again. But I also said that previous to this run. The space is just way too big now, with hundreds of millions of people, whereas there, we really did start at 0 for DeFi (decentralized finance) and in 2017 all alts combined were $13 billion. We just started at such a high floor.” He also says that the robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) sector may start dominating investor interest at the expense of alts. “I also believe the next bubble won’t even be in crypto. It’s likely going to be in robotics/AI. 50% of the global GDP is labor, a $50 trillion annual market… These fields are moving at lightning speed and likely to have the most allocations. Of course, there will be big opportunities here, a lot of that will end up back in utility too. Memecoins I think are too extractive, and while people call utility a meme, they have stood the test of time.” However, the veteran trader says there still remains the potential this cycle for the total crypto market cap to surge to around $4.4 trillion. The total crypto market cap is $2.97 trillion at time of writing, down 8.9% in the last 24 hours. “It’s just a maturing market, and for most of us. We got in pretty damn early and got to capture immense upside. It just isn’t realistic to expect the cycles of the past because eventually returns would be smoothed out. It couldn’t last forever. It takes far more now to move the capital than before. I never expected anything wild this cycle, my expectations for alts were maybe 2x the previous highs and for total [crypto market cap] to reach $4.4 trillion or so, which was a pretty conservative estimate. We may still even get there yet. But I think we need to set realistic expectations for alts in general and the market.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Markets data shows a prolonged selling spree among Bitcoin ETFs could escalate the BTC price downtrend further. Bitcoin (BTC) losses in February surpass 20% amid NVIDIA rally Bitcoin (BTC) remains under intense bearish pressure, sinking to fresh multi-month lows as macroeconomic uncertainty and aggressive capital rotation weigh on the market. BTC has now lost over 20% in February, marking its worst monthly performance since the FTX collapse in November 2022. NVIDA Price Action After Q4 Earnings Report, Feb 26 2025 While the BTC price decline has been primarily attributed to multiple macro factors, one of the biggest catalysts emerged from an unexpected source: NVIDIA’s explosive earnings report. The semiconductor giant posted $39.3 billion in Q4 revenue, marking a 12% increase quarter-over-quarter and a staggering 78% jump year-over-year. Profits also skyrocketed, with GAAP earnings per share (EPS) at $4.93, up 33% from the previous quarter, while non-GAAP EPS soared 28% to $5.16. This blockbuster performance triggered a 5% rally in NVIDIA’s stock, adding over $500 billion to its market capitalization within a single session. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Action Feb 26, 2025 As capital flooded into high-growth AI stocks, Bitcoin suffered. BTC price plunged 5% on Thursday alone, dropping from $86,680 to $82,256, highlighting a dramatic loss of investor confidence in digital assets. The sharp correction reflects mounting concerns over U.S. protectionist trade policies, geopolitical tensions, and sticky inflation, which could drive investors toward traditional equity markets rather than speculative assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs bleed $2.1 billion in six consecutive days Beyond NVIDIA’s dominance in equity markets, Bitcoin’s downtrend has been reinforced by a persistent exodus of institutional capital from BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded outflows for six straight trading sessions, wiping out $2.1 billion from the market. This trend began on February 18 and intensified after NVIDIA’s earnings, as investors reallocated funds toward high-performing tech stocks. Bitcoin ETF Flows, Feb 2025 | Source: Fairside Breakdown of Bitcoin ETF Outflows (Feb 18 – Feb 25), according to Fairside data: Feb 18: -$60.7M Feb 19: -$64.1M Feb 20: -$364.8M Feb 21: -$62.9M Feb 24: -$539.0M Feb 25: -$1.14B Total Outflows: $2.1 billion withdrawn in six days This persistent outflow suggests that institutional investors are shifting away from Bitcoin exposure in favor of equities. If NVIDIA’s rally continues and capital rotation intensifies, BTC could remain vulnerable to further downside. The absence of fresh inflows into BTC ETFs weakens Bitcoin’s support structure, raising the risk of a deeper correction below $80,000 in the short term. If macroeconomic pressures persist, BTC could struggle to reclaim its psychological support at $85,000, leaving it exposed to further losses. Bitcoin is facing a perfect storm of capital flight, macroeconomic uncertainty, and an AI-driven stock market frenzy. The $2.1 billion ETF outflow underscores investor hesitancy, with BTC’s February losses now exceeding 20%. With NVIDIA absorbing billions in liquidity, Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory hinges on whether capital outflows slow or accelerate. If AI stocks continue their ascent and BTC ETF redemptions persist, Bitcoin could be at risk of testing $80,000 sooner rather than later. BTC Price Forecast: $80K support at risk Bitcoin price forecast charts show momentum remains under severe bearish pressure, with BTC trading at $84,784 after a 20.53% decline over the past 26 days. The sell-off has intensified as BTC breaks below key support levels, with Bollinger Bands (BB) indicating extreme volatility. The price is now hovering near the lower BB at $86,736, while the upper BB sits at $102,907, highlighting the magnitude of recent downside moves. BTC Price Forecast The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to 25.92, a deeply oversold level not seen in months. Historically, RSI below 30 suggests that BTC could be due for a short-term relief rally. However, the downtrend remains strong as the RSI continues to trend lower, confirming sustained selling momentum. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim the mid-BB resistance at $94,822, bearish pressure could drive BTC toward the psychological $80,000 level, where buyers may attempt to re-enter. Despite the bearish breakdown, a potential short-term bounce remains possible if BTC stabilizes above $84,500 and RSI begins to recover. If Bitcoin closes a daily candle above $86,736, bulls may regain control and push prices toward $90,000. However, failure to hold above $84,000 could accelerate losses, exposing BTC to a steeper drop below $80,000 in the coming sessions.

Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a long-time proponent of the Bitcoin and digital asset industry, presided over the hearing with assistance from ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ). The witnesses included Tim Massad, former CFTC Chair and Research Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University; Jai Massari, Chief Legal Officer at Lightspark; Jonathan Jachym, Global Head of Policy and Government Relations at Kraken; and Lewis Cohen, Partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP. Setting the tone for the meeting, Senator Lummis stated that she intends to do her part in passing bipartisan legislation for Bitcoin and stablecoins. (This was one of the few times during the meeting that the word “Bitcoin” was mentioned. One of the only other times in the hearing it was mentioned was when Massad voiced that he’s objected to the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve .) Throughout the hearing, Massad stressed the importance of monitoring stablecoin transactions. He suggested extending the “regulatory perimeter” to address AML (Anti-Money Laundering) challenges associated with stablecoins and even proposed that smart contracts be designed in a way that mitigates the risk of bad actors using them. “Our entire [Bank Secrecy Act] framework relies on centralized intermediaries.” @timmassad calls on Congress to extend the “regulatory perimeter” and require “stablecoin issuers to aggressively monitor transactions and freeze stablecoins.” pic.twitter.com/Y5TyGRx4i1 — Nick Anthony (@EconWithNick) February 26, 2025 “[We might] program smart contracts so that transactions can’t go through unless someone has been properly vetted,” said Massad. Massad also suggested that stablecoin issuers “aggressively monitor stablecoin activity” as a means to keep an eye out for AML violations. Massari pointed out that authorities can also surveil stablecoin transactions, as these assets run on public blockchains. She also called for sensible regulation around the technology — so long as it isn’t too heavy-handed. “We have a tendency [when regulating] financial services to take the new thing and cram it into the old,” she said. What is more, she also advocated for a “common set of standards” to govern stablecoin issuers so that users can feel more confident in all stablecoins being properly backed. Jachym made efforts to shift the focus of the hearing from stablecoins to the Digital Asset Market Structure bill , claiming that it was “critical” that regulatory agencies construct clear guidelines for which digital assets are securities and which aren’t. He didn’t receive much uptake though. Massad stated that discussing stablecoins was more important than discussing the market structure bill, making the case that the market structure bill isn’t a pressing matter, as regulators can work with existing securities laws to regulate crypto markets. Jachym stressed the point that “the jurisdictional lines [around] digital assets should be simple” and said that “the lack of regulatory certainty in the U.S. has impeded growth [in the crypto industry.]” Cohen made a similar claim, stating that crypto entrepreneurs in the U.S. “feel the constant threat of litigation,” alluding to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s “ regulation-by-enforcement ” approach. He also shared that the “uncertain regulatory environment has left both consumers and users of digital assets at risk.” The only participant in the hearing who directly pushed back on the U.S. government’s desire to (over)regulate digital assets was Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH). “The government has this total and complete desire to control things,” said Senator Moreno, who went on to share that a number of recent technologies have been used for illicit purposes, not just crypto. “Why all of a sudden when we got to digital currencies did we think here in Washington, D.C. that we are going to decide the pace of innovation?” he concluded. Throughout the meeting, the subcommittee members asked the witnesses which jurisdictions around the world the U.S. should take cues from in modeling its digital asset regulatory framework. Massad made the case for Europe and the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, which the European Union just put into effect, while Jachym suggested looking to states like Wyoming, where Kraken is based, to learn from the crypto laws the state’s legislature has passed . While the Senators on the subcommittee and the witnesses present offered various perspectives on the topics discussed, a certain sentiment permeated the hearing, which was that it’s high time politicians on both sides of the aisle come together to create clear rules of the road for the crypto industry. “Bipartisan support for crypto policy is no longer a distant goal on the horizon,” said Jachym, with a certain sense of relief.

The bill was moved to the House floor by the House Ways and Means Committee through a 26-16 split, and now, the Republicans, who currently dominate the House, are in support of cryptocurrencies. The Ways and Means Committee just passed H.J.Res. 25 – a resolution that repeals an unfair and unworkable cryptocurrency rule that would hamper cryptocurrency holders and the IRS with additional, burdensome paperwork. pic.twitter.com/HRJ1yWJSZA — Ways and Means Committee (@WaysandMeansGOP) February 26, 2025 The resolution targeted an IRS regulation that was passed in December, in which DeFi projects should be classified as brokers. As per the rule, DeFi platforms are required to provide the same reportage standards as brokers involved in equities or debt securities trading. This includes the provision of Form 1099 tax documents to users. The US Treasury Department has stated that the form may assist with reducing errors and improving compliance. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) claims that the measure burdens DeFi projects unnecessarily while excluding foreign persons. According to Smith, the regulation protects international competitors by setting extremely high standards for U.S. projects only. However, some of the major crypto firms and lobbying groups, such as the Blockchain Association, have opposed the rule. Last week, they sent a letter to Congress asking the congressmen to rescind the regulation. Critics of the rule have also expressed similar opinions, stating that the rule will hamper innovation and put undue pressure on DeFi platforms. Rep. Mike Carey went further by stating that the regulation would overburden both taxpayers and the IRS. Republican Rep. Jason Smith, who is the chairman of the committee, accused the federal government of overreaching existing tax laws. Democratic lawmakers, however, have defended the rule as essential, mainly regarding tax compliance. Rep. Richard Neal defended the regulation, stating that it is against tax avoidance and that the law requires everyone to pay what is due. If this rule is repealed, revenue loss would aggregate to $3.9 billion within a decade in the United States alone. Broader crypto industry response The resolution corresponds to initiatives in the Senate, where Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) presented a similar measure in January. Cruz also expressed his disapproval of the IRS rule by arguing that blockchain technology faces risks of stagnation in the United States. However, the resolution cannot take effect without approval by both chambers of Congress and the president, which is a provision of the Congressional Review Act. If adopted, the measure will repeal the IRS rule, meaning that DeFi projects will no longer be subject to tax reporting. The IRS has recently made clear the taxation on staking rewards for cryptocurrencies by stating that they are subject to tax when received. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The Wednesday hearing, framed as the jumping-off point for further Congressional action on digital asset regulations, was the first hosted by the banking committee's new digital assets subcommittee and chaired by Wyoming Republican Cynthia Lummis , a longtime crypto proponent . ""We're on the precipice of finally creating a bipartisan legislative framework for both stablecoins and market structure,"" Lummis said in her opening statement, referring to draft legislation she introduced with New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand as a natural counterpart to the House's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. Stablecoins will be first on the committee's agenda though, she said, echoing statements made by White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks and South Carolina Republican Tim Scott, who chairs the overall Senate Banking Committee. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, one of the hearing's four witnesses, told the lawmakers to focus on stablecoin legislation for the moment and defer any market structure efforts ""for several years."" ""For four years, the crypto industry has called on the SEC and CFTC to develop rules and guidance and to stop regulating by enforcement; that is now happening,"" he said. ""The SEC has dropped enforcement cases and launched a crypto task force to tackle these issues. We should let these regulatory issue initiatives make progress before rushing to rewrite the securities law."" Existing proposals to update market structure regulations to address crypto have the potential to ""create more confusion than clarity,"" he added, particularly around defining how a digital asset might be a security, commodity or something else. These proposals could potentially undermine existing securities laws, especially if they address decentralized finance. ""That term is used to describe a lot of things that aren't decentralized,"" Massad continued. ""There are almost always some vectors of control. And even if a process is decentralized or automated, that does not mean it should be exempt from regulation."" Virginia Democrat Mark Warner asked the panelists to discuss the possibility of stablecoin users conducting know-your-customer processes, noting that an issuer may conduct KYC but that a stablecoin may be transferred between wallets without those intermediate transfers going through a KYC process. ""I want to get to a regulatory framework that works, but I have seen — echoing what others have said from the classified side — oh my gosh, a whole bunch of bad stuff,"" Warner said. ""So help me figure out, and I recognize [for] some people, the anonymity and and the disintermediation role the blockchain plays, but how do we put some minimum protections from issuer all the way back to conversion to fiat?"" Lightspark co-founder and Chief Legal Officer Jai Massari noted that even though self-custodied wallets don't conduct KYC, ""there is an immutable on-chain record of those transactions that can be monitored, not only by the issuer, but [by] third parties, including law enforcement."" While mixers and other tools can obfuscate transactions, custodial wallets still conduct KYC at the end of a chain of transfers, she noted. ""I agree that we need to continue, as the industry has done, to develop new tools to address these issues,"" said Massari.",Policy|Senate Banking Committee|Cynthia Lummis|Stablecoin legislation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-27 01:10:23

40887792,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/depin-pledge-slashes-cloud-costs-by-80-says-fluence,1740620045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/40887792.jpeg,"DePIN Pledge Slashes Cloud Costs by 80%, Says Fluence",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/depin-pledge-slashes-cloud-costs-by-80-says-fluence,"On February 26, 2025, Fluence launched the “DePIN Pledge” in Denver, promising to cut cloud computing costs by 60-80% using Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). Centralized giants like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud dominate 70% of the global cloud market, per 2024 estimates, but their prices strain Web3 projects. Fluence, backed by $14 million in funding, says DePIN can slash those bills while boosting decentralization. Here’s the data-driven story. DePIN Pledge Targets Sky-High Cloud Costs Fluence , a DePIN cloudless computing platform founded in 2017, launched the DePIN Pledge to push Web3 and crypto firms toward decentralized infrastructure. Tom Trowbridge, Fluence’s Co-Founder & CEO, said on February 26, 2025, “We expect a wide range of DePIN products and services used by projects and companies over the coming years.” The pledge, detailed in a press release, targets centralized hyperscalers charging 60-80% more than Fluence’s DePIN alternative. Fluence’s network, funded by $14 million from investors like 1KX, Multicoin, and Tiger Global, plans a $100 million hardware expansion. This could scale DePIN’s reach, cutting costs for Web3 users. Cost Savings: 60-80% Cheaper Than Legacy Clouds Centralized clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud lock in clients with high fees. Fluence claims DePIN reduces compute costs by 60-80% compared to these providers. The company verifies services, eliminating vendor lock-in. This cost cut targets Web3 projects struggling with rising compute demands, especially for AI and blockchain. Initial DePIN Pledge signatories include The DePIN Pledge launches with the collaboration of leading companies like Consensys, Polygon, Helium, Gelato, Impossible Cloud Network, IoTEX, Infura, Spheron, BlockScout, Pocket Network, Outlier Ventures, NodeOps, IO.NET , OpenMesh, NuNet, RapidNode, AnyType, iExec, Aleph Cloud, Heurist, Derad Network, and more. These firms commit to adopting DePIN, aiming for lower costs and decentralization, per the February 26, 2025, announcement. Clemens Wan, Solutions Architect and AI Evangelist at Consensys, stated on February 26, 2025, “DIN’s vision is to bring high-performance Web3 infrastructure, including RPC, via permissionless and decentralized mechanisms. We support the DePIN Pledge because Web3’s promise requires cost-effective, decentralized services.” This aligns with Infura’s mission to advance decentralized infrastructure. Jing Sun, Co-founder of IoTeX, added, “IoTeX’s mission is to enable true data ownership and decentralization. The DePIN Pledge highlights how decentralized infrastructure reduces costs while enhancing security and transparency.” Fluence’s $100M Hardware Push Fluence’s DePIN platform offers a low-cost alternative to centralized clouds. With $14 million raised and $100 million slated for hardware, Fluence scales its network. This expansion targets Web3’s growing need for compute power, driven by AI’s demand for data and processing. The DePIN Pledge creates a marketplace on DePINpledge.xyz, listing verified companies adopting decentralized infrastructure. Trowbridge noted, “The future of DePIN sees communities gaining control over systems shaping their lives.” This cost-saving approach counters centralized control, per the press release. Fluence’s DePIN Pledge launched on February 26, 2025, with clear goals: slash cloud costs, end centralized dependency, and empower communities. The 60-80% cost reduction could reshape Web3 economics. Signatories receive a manifesto and a DePIN Pledge NFT, auditable on Ethereum, symbolizing their commitment. Join at DePINpledge.xyz or follow #DePINPledge on X for updates.

Justin Sun And SEC Seek Case Pause This joint filing, submitted on Wednesday, indicates that both parties believe it is in their mutual interest to pause the case while they explore a potential resolution. They assert that such a stay would not prejudice any involved parties or non-parties, marking a collaborative approach to navigating the complexities of crypto regulation. This follows a similar request for a pause in the case against Binance and reflects a notable shift in the regulatory climate for digital assets in the United States since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Related Reading: Panic Sell? Bitcoin’s $86K Fall Wipes Out $1 Billion In Trades Under the acting chair Mark Uyeda, the SEC has recently closed investigations into several crypto entities, including Robinhood, the decentralized finance firm Uniswap, and the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea. Most significantly, Coinbase announced that the SEC agreed to drop its lawsuit against the largest digital asset exchange in the US, pending commissioner approval. SEC Favoring Trump’s Business Associates? These actions mark a significant pivot from the previous administration’s approach, which has been criticized by various crypto executives, many of whom celebrated the former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation in January. Specifically, the SEC sued Justin Sun in 2023, alleging that he collaborated with entities he controls, such as the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent Foundation, to orchestrate the offer and sale of “unregistered securities.” However, the recent decision to seek a stay in these proceedings suggests a reevaluation of the agency’s priorities, particularly concerning figures like Justin Sun. Related Reading: Strategy (MSTR) Crashes 55%—Is A $44 Billion Bitcoin Liquidation Possible? Corey Frayer, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America and a former adviser to Gensler, noted that the absence of fraud charges in the Justin Sun case signifies a “troubling politicization” of the SEC. The director remarked that the agency’s current approach appears to be “benefitting Trump’s business associates,” suggesting a shift in regulatory focus that aligns with the interests of the former president. This comes amid significant investments in Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI), with Justin Sun purchasing over $70 million in WLFI token’s to support this upcoming decentralized finance (DeFi) venture.

While DOGE eyes that dollar milestone, a fresh contender, Panshibi is stealing the show. This Ethereum-based, panda-themed meme coin has already hauled in a stunning $1.17 million in its presale in mere weeks, fueled by a passionate community and bold promises of 50x gains. As investors weigh their next move, the contrast between Dogecoin’s established hype and Panshibi’s explosive newcomer vibe sets the stage for a thrilling showdown in the meme coin arena. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Aiming for $1 by Year-End Dogecoin has long been a rollercoaster powered by community spirit and Elon Musk’s unpredictable influence - now amplified by his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The number 1 meme coin is trading at $0.21 as of February 25, 2025 and currently has a market cap of $31 billion. A bold Dogecoin price prediction has set the crypto world abuzz, with Dogecoin analysts eyeing a climb to $1 by the close of 2025. The year so far boasts a 130% gain, but that all-time high remains elusive, sitting 65% above today’s mark. Could Dogecoin price finally crack the dollar barrier? Dogecoin ecosystem developments offer clues. Musk’s recent appointment to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Vivek Ramaswamy under President Trump’s administration has reignited significant buzz. With an inflationary supply - no cap, just 10,000 new DOGE minted every minute - the road to $1 feels steep unless sentiment flips hard. Analysts are looking to Panshibi, a fresh contender stealing the spotlight with a presale haul that’s turning heads. Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Panda Powerhouse Surging to Life While Dogecoin claws for that $1 dream, Panshibi has stormed in, raking up $1.1 million in mere weeks during its presale - proof it’s got massive backing. Built on Ethereum’s stable blockchain, this panda-themed meme coin isn’t just coasting on cuteness. Priced at $0.005 in Stage 4 as of now, SHIBI’s presale is a 60-day dash toward $10 million, with 60% of its 2 billion token supply up for grabs. Investors are piling in, drawn by whispers of a 50x surge - or even a wild 145,000% post-launch leap - once it hits heavyweights like Binance and Uniswap. Unlike DOGE’s slow grind, Panshibi’s momentum feels like a rocket priming for takeoff and it’s not hard to see why. Early buyers get a VIP pass to the Bamboo Private Club, where NFT perks and community quests await. Security’s no joke either - a Coinsult audit greenlights its smart contract and liquidity has been locked for 10 years with team tokens sealed for two years to secure trust. Beyond the crypto hustle, SHIBI ties its gains to panda conservation, blending a feel-good mission with fat-profit potential. Dogecoin price prediction might tease $1, but Panshibi’sbrewing a storm that could dwarf it, fueled by Social-Fi flair and AI-driven engagement that’s got the crypto market buzzing. Panshibi Surges In Presale; Grab SHIBI Tokens Now! Panshibi’s roadmap is a feast: NFT drops and AI quests make SHIBI a living ecosystem, not just a ticker like Dogecoin. Analysts peg a $0.026 listing - 520% from now - with 50x chatter if whales bite. Staking alone dangles a jaw-dropping 1,200% APY, with 15% of tokens locked for rewards, ensuring long-term holders feast. Analysts think SHIBI presale must not be missed: Join Now!

However, the recent correction which triggered a massive selloff has led to investors searching for alternative cryptos that can guarantee short and long-term returns. Among the altcoins making waves is the RemittixDeFi coin which is projected to rise by over 5000% in the coming weeks. With its fantastic PayFi platform, which allows for the seamless conversion of crypto to fiat, Remittix is projected to lead the DeFi landscape revolution. Market watchers believe that Remittix could enter the top 10 DeFi coins within weeks of launching, making it one of the altcoins on investors' watchlists. Let's see why. Expert Predicts Pepe Coin Could Surge 15x in Short Term Pepe (PEPE) has seen a significant drop in price in recent weeks as a result of the general crypto market bearish sentiment which was occasioned by a series of macroeconomic developments. However, a recovery could be close. As per CoinMarketCap , Pepe price dipped 33% in the past month and 12% in the past week. Amidst these successive declines, experts remain bullish about the Pepe coin. Source: CoinMarketCap One of such experts who are positive about Pepe is Crypto Elites . The analyst claims Pepe cryptocould make a big move very soon. This move could see the price of Pepe surge by 15x in the short term. Meanwhile, Pepe market sentiment remains bearish despite showing signs of a potential rally. Source: CryptoElites on X As per TradingView , Pepe trades below the 50-day SMA with a price volatility of 13. Having hit over $10B in December, the Pepe market cap has dropped below $4B with the trading volume also shrinking. However, if it can break out from the falling wedge pattern, a potential 80% rally is possible according to Jonathan Carter on X. Shiba Inu Could See Massive Increase Despite Market Uncertainty Shiba Inu's (SHIB) run in 2025 has been rough with the Ethereum-based meme coin pricedropping by over 80% from the all time high of $0.000088. According to CoinMarketCap , Shiba Inu's price has plummeted by over 18% in the monthly chart, signaling its battle with the bear market. Source: CoinMarketCap However, Javon Marks in a tweet on X remains optimistic of a rally soon. In the Shiba Inu price analysis, Javon thinks that SHIB price is maintaining the structure of a large inverse head and shoulder pattern. This suggests that Javons 402% projection for the meme coin is still in play. Source: Javon Marks on X In terms of technical analysis, the Shiba Inu Fear and Greed index is 21 (Extreme Fear) as market sentiment remains bearish. This suggests that investors are exercising caution with the sellers having the upper hand. Should Shiba Inu's price fail to hold the $0.000012 support level, it could slide further into the bear market. However, the growing partnerships are likely to trigger a resurgence soon as more investors join the project. Remittix: The Revolutionary Platform Changing the Game with Crypto-to-Fiat Solutions While Shiba Inu and Pepe thrive on hype and speculation, Remittix (RTX) is already breaking records in the market. As it continues to make waves across the market, Remittix has already raised over $12.9M in cryptocurrency ICO funding. At the current trajectory, the presale funding might hit $20M in March. One of the driving factors is the PayFi platform, designed to allow individuals to convert over 40 different cryptos into fiat and send them to any approved global bank at no hidden fees for FX or wire. This would allow a quicker, more secure and low-cost avenue of global money transfer than traditional financial institutions. Through the Remittix pay API, businesses can accept cryptos as a form of payment and settle transactions in fiat. Although it competes with Stripe and Wise, none of them allows for crypto-to-fiat conversion. The Remittix ecosystem comes with a robust security architecture with all transactions stored in a public ledger, allowing for transparency and traceability. Sold for just $0.0671, more than 16,000 users have joined the community, with 20,000 expected in the coming days. Early investors have made over 1000% ROI which could rise to 2000% in March. Given the massive adoption, the Remittix price might surpass the 5,880% projection before the end of Q1. This makes it one of the top altcoins to invest in for massive returns in 2025. Which Altcoin Should Investors Buy for Big Gains in 2025? Shiba Inu and Pepe are undergoing corrections as they battle to break out from the dip. However, there are positive signals of these altcoins witnessing relief rallies in the coming days. As the crypto market continues to struggle, Remittix presale has continued to make waves. Its cross-border payment platform will attract more investors soon which will increase the demand for RTX. With the principles of demand and supply, the RTX price might jump to $5 on the listing in a major exchange, making it the best altcoin to buy in the dip.

Investors are flocking to this decentralized lending platform, eyeing a potential leap to $5. Meanwhile, established tokens like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) linger in slower growth lanes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charging ahead in phase two of its presale, offering a clear shot at 300% returns by launch at $0.06. Could it outpace its bigger rivals? Four reasons suggest yes, and they hinge on momentum, utility, and market timing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Riding High Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has opened phase two of its presale, listing tokens at $0.015 after a rapid first phase that raised eyebrows across the crypto market. Already, $1,424,320.08 has been raised, backed by 2,790 holders who see value in this early entry. The opening phase sold out fast, signaling urgency among buyers snapping up tokens before the price climbs. By launch, the tokenomics lock in a rise to $0.06, delivering a 300% profit for those jumping in now. Looking further, a post-launch climb to $5 isn’t a wild guess; it’s a target fueled by the platform’s lending and borrowing system. Unlike many tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ties its value to real use, not just hype. As demand surges, this phase two window narrows, pushing investors to act before the next price hike. Ripple (XRP) Facing Uphill Climb As Cardano (ADA) Lags in Speed Ripple (XRP) holds a solid spot in the crypto market, but its path to $5 feels less certain. Trading around $2.50 recently, it leans heavily on regulatory wins and adoption for cross-border payments. Progress exists, yet the pace drags compared to fresher projects. Investors note Ripple’s growth often stalls under legal pressures or market shifts, keeping it from explosive jumps. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) boasts a loyal following and steady development, hovering near $0.65 lately. Its focus on scalability and research-driven upgrades earns respect, but the gains come slowly. Investors waiting for Cardano to hit $5 face a long road, as its ecosystem grows at a measured clip. Four Reasons Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Leads the Pack Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) isn’t just riding a wave; it’s creating one. First, its presale structure locks in a 4x return at $0.06, a concrete gain baked into the plan. Second, the platform’s lending utility drives demand, letting users earn or borrow with crypto assets. Third, phase two at $0.015 offers a low entry before launch, a rare chance slipping away fast. Fourth, its post-launch potential points to $5, outstripping Ripple and Cardano’s slower trajectories in 2025. Each reason flows from the last, representing a token built for growth. 1,000 invested today in Mutuum Finance could turn into $4,000 at launch and $333,000 at $5. The crypto market thrives on opportunity, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers it. Phase two is selling quickly at $0.015, with $1.4 million already raised and 2,790 holders on board. Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) carry name recognition, but their climb to $5 leans on hope and time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clearer shot, blending presale gains with a platform ready to skyrocket. The first phase flew by, and this second one won’t linger. For those chasing a jump from $0.015 to $5 in 2025, now’s the ideal time to join the presale. Visit their official site today and grab your share of MUTM tokens ahead of the next price hike in phase 3.

While Bitcoin hovers near all-time highs and major altcoins fight for dominance, one low-cost crypto is making waves, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. This viral token, still priced below $1, is not only attracting retail traders but also drawing in major crypto whales who see massive upside potential. Among the hottest altcoins right now, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as the project that has gone viral, surpassing $1.5 million in its presale and gaining serious traction as a game-changer in blockchain-powered e-commerce. With whales rushing in, this token could be setting the stage for an explosive rally. What’s Causing This Altcoin to Go Viral? In the crypto world, prices don’t always tell the full story. While some investors chase the latest meme coins or short-lived hype projects, smart traders look for fundamentally strong projects with a clear use case and growing adoption. Web3Bay has gone viral for all the right reasons, tapping into one of the largest industries in the world—e-commerce. Unlike meme coins that rely on hype alone, Web3Bay is solving a real-world problem by creating a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact directly, cutting out the high fees and restrictions imposed by platforms like Amazon and eBay. This has positioned Web3Bay as a token with both utility and growth potential, making it an attractive option for long-term investors. As more traders recognize this, the project has rapidly gained momentum, with social media chatter exploding and big-money investors pouring into the presale. Crypto Whales Are Accumulating—What Do They See in Web3Bay? One of the biggest indicators of a project’s success is whale accumulation. Large-scale investors don’t chase hype—they analyze market trends, tokenomics, and real-world applications before making moves. The fact that whales are entering Web3Bay’s presale in record numbers suggests they see serious upside potential. Several factors are likely driving this whale accumulation: Low Entry Price – At just $0.004562 per token, Web3Bay is still extremely undervalued right now. Investors looking for 100x gains prefer entering projects early before mainstream adoption kicks in. Real-World Use Case – Unlike many altcoins that struggle to define their purpose, Web3Bay is bringing decentralization to e-commerce, offering buyers and sellers a more secure, transparent, and cost-effective way to trade. Growing Adoption – The presale has already surpassed $1.5 million, with more than 380 million tokens sold. As more investors jump in, early backers are seeing their holdings appreciate before the token even hits the open market. Tokenomics Designed for Growth – Web3Bay’s carefully structured token supply ensures long-term sustainability, reducing the risk of sudden crashes or massive sell-offs that plague many other low-cost cryptos. Whales recognize early-stage opportunities when they see them, and Web3Bay is proving to be one of the strongest investment options in the sub-$1 category. Web3Bay vs. Other Low-Priced Altcoins—Why It Stands Out The sub-$1 crypto space is full of risky bets, from meme coins with no real use case to projects that lack development progress. Web3Bay, however, is setting itself apart by building something that has never been done before in e-commerce. While other cryptos rely solely on speculative demand, Web3Bay has an entire decentralized ecosystem backing its value. Users can buy and sell goods with cryptocurrency while maintaining full ownership of their data and avoiding the high fees associated with centralized marketplaces. This real-world integration means that Web3Bay has the potential to see widespread adoption, leading to sustainable price appreciation rather than short-term hype-driven pumps. With a strong development team, growing investor support, and a presale that’s exceeding expectations, Web3Bay is proving why it’s the standout choice among low-priced altcoins. Could This Be the Next 100x Altcoin? Web3Bay’s viral rise has led many analysts to predict major price appreciation in the near future. Given its low presale price and strong investor demand, the numbers suggest that it could deliver massive gains once it launches on major exchanges. If Web3Bay were to reach just $0.20, it would represent a nearly 4,300% increase from its presale price, turning a $1,000 investment into over $40,000. If the token reaches $1 in the coming years, early investors could see gains of over 100x. With whales accumulating and mainstream investors starting to take notice, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Web3Bay has the potential to be one of the biggest breakout stars of 2025. Final Thoughts With major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum already highly valued, investors looking for massive returns are turning to undervalued projects that still have room to grow. Web3Bay checks all the boxes for a top-tier crypto investment—it has real utility, a growing investor base, and strong financial backing. Unlike other low-priced cryptos that rely on speculation alone, Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model provides a clear path to sustained growth. As crypto whales continue to buy in, and the presale surpasses new milestones, it’s only a matter of time before Web3Bay’s price starts climbing rapidly. For investors who want to capitalize on an early-stage opportunity before it explodes, now is the time to act.

Bitcoin Mega Whales Have Been Reducing Their Supply Recently In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed the latest trend in the Bitcoin supply held by the whales. The ‘whales‘ broadly refer to the entities who own more than 1,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Headed For $72,000? These Metrics Could Hint So At the current exchange rate, this amount converts to a whopping $88.9 million, so the only investors who would qualify for the cohort would be the big-money ones. In the context of the current topic, the holders of focus aren’t just any ordinary whales, but in fact the largest among them: those carrying more than 10,000 BTC ($889 million) in their balance. This group may be termed as the ‘mega whales.’ Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the holdings of the Bitcoin mega whales over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin mega whales sold some of their supply during the price crash. More interesting, though, is the detail that these investors already began their selloff a few days back, a potential indication that they saw the price plunge coming. According to IntoTheBlock, this cohort was the primary seller in this window. In fact, the analytics firm has pointed out that the rest of the groups have shown combined accumulation at the same time, meaning the smaller entities are looking at the plummet as an opportunity to buy. In total, the mega whales have sold 25,740 BTC (almost $2.3 billion) over the last seven days. The behavior of the cohort could now be to keep an eye on in the coming days, as with the rest of the market buying, what these humongous investors do could tip the balance one way or the other for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loss Holders Highest Since October As BTC Crashes To $87,000 Holder balance is just one way to classify BTC cohorts. Another is through exchanges, as different platforms can host a different demographic of investors. Two exchanges in particular are generally of relevance in this type of analysis: Coinbase and Binance. Coinbase is mainly used by entities from the US, especially large institutional traders, while Binance serves global investors. An indicator that can be used for tracking the difference in behavior between the two user bases is the Coinbase Premium Index. This metric measures the percentage difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). As CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju pointed out in an X post, the Coinbase Premium Index has been negative recently. This trend, alongside the fact that Coinbase’s spot volume dominance has shot up recently (left chart), would suggest the American whales have been the main drivers during the crash. BTC Price Bitcoin approached the $86,000 mark during yesterday’s dip, but the coin has since seen a rebound as its price is now trading around $88,700.

Dogecoin, once a rocket fueled by Musk’s tweets and a fervent community, now faces a rocky road down 31% in the past month. Meanwhile, big funds are flowing elsewhere, going in on Panshibi , an Ethereum-based meme coin that’s raised $1.17 million in its presale within 33 days Let us see Panshibi’s allure and why investors anticipate a 20x surge in the coming weeks. Could Dogecoin’s Price Tumble to $0.10? As of February 26, Dogecoin price is trading at $0.212 , which marks a return of the top altcoin’s price to retest key support levels on the back of selling pressures affecting the broader market. Dogecoin’s ecosystem leans hard on Musk’s star power, but even that is proving to be insufficient to buoy DOGE these days. However while price suffers, Dogecoin’s market cap currently clinging to $31 billion means it is still the OG and number 1 meme. In Dogecoin’s recent news, Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, submitted its 19b-4 filing through NYSE Arca in late January to convert its recently launched Grayscale Dogecoin Trust into an ETF, following similar moves for XRP and Polkadot funds. Technical analysis shows a forming death cross and an RSI of 32, indicating oversold conditions but also potential for further short-term drops. Support at $0.20 is critical; if it breaks, the price might test lower levels like $0.15, aligning with bearish predictions. Dogecoin price prediction aside, Dogecoin faithfuls face a choice: ride Musk’s rollercoaster or jump ship. Many are picking Panshibi, where big funds are flowing fast. Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Panda-Powered Meme Coin Surge Panshibi attracts users because it allows them to use meme creativity to earn significant financial rewards. The developers of this ERC20 coin have built their tokenomics system with precision to support fast growth and protect investment as Dogecoin price predictions encourage investors to exercise caution. Currently priced at $0.005 in Stage 4 of its token presale, this panda-themed token blends Asian cultural appeal with cutting-edge features like Social-Fi and AI-driven community engagement, setting it apart from the typical hype-driven meme coin pack. Investors are buzzing about forecasts of a 20x or even 145,000% surge post-launch on major exchanges like Binance and Uniswap. Investors can obtain a stake in what experts consider to be the best crypto to buy in 2025. Early investors also gain access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club, unlocking exclusive perks like NFT drops and community quests, while a Coinsult-audited smart contract and a 10-year liquidity lock cement trust in its stability. Beyond the blockchain, Panshibi ties its success to panda conservation efforts, adding a layer of purpose that resonates with its growing community. Panshibi Presale Surge Is Not Ending Anytime Soon Top altcoin investors including Dogecoin and Ethereum holders are shifting stacks of money into Panshibi. They are doing this with the idea that $1,000 today could flip into $20,000 in the coming weeks if SHIBI’s 20x promise lands. While Dogecoin price predictions foresee a crash to $0.10, Panshibi dodges that pitfall with a tighter grip on its tokenomics. Today’s market is craving winners and this panda’s massive backing could see it outrun Musk’s pup. Don’t sleep on SHIBI 2025’s meme panda might just go bamboo.

Andriunin, the founder and CEO of crypto market maker Gotbit is charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit market manipulation and wire fraud in connection with wash trading activities. Gotbit allegedly offered wash trading services to cryptocurrency issuers. Wash trading is the practice of carrying out sham trades to inflate trading volume and give the impression of high market demand. Gotbit sales director Qawi Jalili, director of market making Fedor Kedrov, and the company itself have also been charged. According to Reuters’ Kedrov and Jalili are thought to be located in Russia. Gotbit allegedly offered wash trading for years Gotbit allegedly collected tens of millions of dollars for its services between 2018 and 2024. Andriunin, a 26-year-old Russian national, allegedly transfers millions of dollars of company money to his personal Binance account. He was arrested in Portugal on Oct. 8 and extradited. He will remain in custody until his trial. If found guilty of the wire fraud, Andriunin could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy charge could bring another five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. Gotbit Hedge Fund, which still operates, describes its activities as “crafting and executing a tailored growth strategy for your token. Our primary goal is to generate buy pressure within your market.” It claims on its website to have 180+ employees, as well as 1.3 billion [dollars?] in assets under management for 400+ institutional clients. The FBI caught four companies doing wash trading at the same time Gotbit’s downfall came about due to a complex sting operation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) called Operation Token Mirrors in October. The FBI created a token called NexFundAI (NEXF) and engaged the services of four companies to promote it. The company does not seem to have been involved in promoting NEXF, but it promoted tokens whose illicit backgrounds were uncovered in the larger investigation. Operation Token Mirrors led to charges against 18 people and eight companies in all. Trades with 60 cryptocurrencies were deactivated and $25 million in cryptocurrency was seized. NEXF is still being traded . Online crypto investigator ZachXBT had warned against dealing with Gotbit a year earlier. “I would be weary of any projects you see working with the market maker @gotbit_io as a leaked report shows highly questionable services offered,” he wrote on X. Among the members of its “community” shown on its website are Binance, Bybit, Crypto.com, HashKey, KuCoin and OKX. Nobody knows you when you’re an alleged wash trader Another party in the Gotbit debacle was the tremendously popular Telegram-based game Hamster Kombat. Gotbit announced in April that it was the Hamster Kombat team’s “official advisor on their web3 journey.” After Operation Token Mirrors was wound up, Hamster Kombat denied that it had ever worked with Gotbit. The company also claimed to work with the memecoin BONK beginning in August 2023. It is known to have worked with the NEIRO team. The developers of that memecoin cut ties with Gotbit after the FBI operation. ZachXBT took the NEIRO team to task for ignoring his warning. NEIRO’s anonymous CTO co-lead S responded . S said the team needed to find a market maker fast when it was okayed for listing on HTX and it was its only “warm connection.” S continued, “I had heard various bad things about Gotbit. Similarly, I’ve heard various bad things for pretty much everyone in this industry, so it’s difficult to apply discretion.” ZachXBT was not mollified.

Undoubtedly, many investors will be expecting the top crypto tokens to be among the best-performing assets in 2025. However, this new Remittixproject, currently surging in presale, may flip these tokens in percentage growth. The Remittix (RTX) project has already sold more than half its presale as investors troop in to be part of the project. Termed as the next blue-chip crypto, Remittix represents one of the top DeFi projects to look out for in 2025. SEC Likely to Drop Case with XRP as Market Sentiment Grows Bullish The ongoing legal battle between the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and XRP could be nearing its end. This is coming after the SEC dropped its ongoing case against Uniswap and other crypto companies like Coinbase, Robinhood, Binance and OpenSea, with many predicting that XRP could be the next case to be dropped. Already, the SEC has acknowledged the filing of XRP spot ETF from CoinShares and WisdomTree in recent weeks. These all combine to provide an air of bullish potential for the XRP token which has been on a decline. According to market stats , XRP price has lost 22% within the past month. Source: CoinMarketCap While the retracement still rages in the short-term, it possesses a buy zone opportunity considering the bull run that could be triggered with approval of spot ETF and case drop from SEC. In a tweet on X, crypto analyst Butcher believes the XRP price chart looks bullish and could hit $20 very soon. Source: Butcher on X Will SOL Price Dip Lower? Solana's price has lost over 41% of its value within the last month as per CoinMarketCap . This trajectory has seen the altcoin price decline below the $150 mark from an all-time high of $294.33 recorded in January. Also, Solana's market volume doesn't look good with over 40% decline on a day-to-day average over the past week. Source: CoinMarketCap Amid the price downturn, analyst Crypto King on X is projecting a rebound for Solana at the $131 level. The last time that Solana traded below $140 in November, it rebounded and triggered a parabolic surge to $257. It is likely that the same trajectory could occur in March. Source: Crypto King on X Although technical indicators from Tradingview suggest further downturn, the Solana ecosystemactivity has continued to grow with 37 out of the top 40 trending coins based on the Solana blockchain. Once the altcoin clears the current resistance zone, it is likely to witness massive rallies. Remittix (RTX) Generates Over $12.9 Million in Presale as Launch Draws Close While it is rare to see a crypto project generate over $12.9 million in presale, Remittix has done just that thanks to its revolutionary DeFi solution and exponential growth potential in the crypto market in 2025. Approximately 60% of the token's presale has been bought by investors with the expectation that the presale will sell out before the end of Q1. Most importantly, the major driving force of the Remittix project is its utility offerings. For context, Remittix is a revolutionary DeFi solution that facilitates smooth, efficient and cheap crypto-to-fiat transactions. With Remittix, users can send fiat currency to any approved global bank by simply connecting their wallet at no hidden fees outside of the flat fees charged. While companies like Coinbase facilitate crypto-to-crypto payment and Stripe offers fiat-to-fiat transactions, Remittix acts as a hybrid with its crypto-to-fiat solution. With the Remittix pay API, businesses can accept cryptos as a form of payment from customers and settle transactions in fiat. Companies can also utilize the platform to pay global workers. Remittix prioritizes the safety of investors' assets as all transactions are stored in a public ledger, allowing for easy traceability. As a decentralized peer-to-peer platform, users have full control of their assets. Sold for just $0.0671, early investors have made over 340% ROI. Given the growing momentum, the RTX price is expected to hit 100x in 2025. Top Crypto Assets to Prioritize in March Among the three highlighted tokens above, XRP and Remittix stand out as viable crypto projects to invest in ahead of Solana. Even better, Remittix comes top given its unique DeFi solution, its presale status, and its exponential post-launch growth potential. That is why, at just $0.0671, investors can buy the presale and position for the potential high-end ROIs.

Meme coins are making millionaires overnight, and with the latest market shifts, a few standout names are catching serious attention as the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Popcat (POPCAT) has surged by over 13% in the past 24 hours, pushing its market cap beyond $231 million. Meanwhile, Floki Inu (FLOKI) is expanding into DeFi with a newly approved European Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), giving it fresh momentum. But the real headline? BTFD Coin (BTFD) is entering its final presale stretch with a mind-blowing 3650% ROI potential, and the Bulls Squad is rallying hard. The meme coin race is on, and the smart money is already moving. While established names like Floki Inu and Popcat fight for traction, BTFD Coin’s exclusive presale at $0.00016 is giving early adopters a front-row seat to the biggest gains. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game fully launched, staking rewards at 90% APY, and an army of bulls behind it, this is the moment to grab the dip before the final presale stage closes. The BTFD Bulls Squad is making waves—are you in on one of the top new meme coins to invest in this month? BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad: The Final Stretch with 3650% ROI Potential Ever wonder how some investors turn small stacks into fortunes while others are stuck watching from the sidelines? It’s all about timing. BTFD Coin is at Stage 14 of its presale, and if you’re not paying attention, you could miss out on the kind of gains that crypto legends are made of. Let’s break it down. BTFD started its presale at just $0.000004 per coin. Right now, it’s sitting at $0.00016, and by the time it lists, it’ll be worth $0.0006. That’s a 275% gain at listing alone. But analysts are eyeing something much bigger—a potential moonshot of $0.006, meaning an insane 3650% ROI. Now, imagine you put $2500 into BTFD at today’s presale price of $0.00016. That gets you 15,625,000 BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at the listing, your investment grows to $9375. But hold on—if the BTFD Coin follows its projected moonshot to $0.006, you’re looking at a whopping $93,750. That’s life-changing money, and it’s exactly why the Bulls Squad is charging hard into this presale’s final phase. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. The Bulls Squad is a community-driven powerhouse, designed to help investors stack gains and ride the next bull market wave. With over 11,000 holders, more than $6.20 million raised, and 70 billion coins already sold, this isn’t a project that’s still looking for traction—it’s already moving at full speed. And the best part? BTFD’s P2E game is LIVE. That means holders can earn while playing, staking their rewards at a massive 90% APY. So, whether you’re stacking for the long haul or flipping for fast gains, BTFD is setting up investors for serious profits. Grab BTFD Coin Before the Presale Ends! This presale stage 14 is already 98.50% complete, and the price isn’t staying at $0.00016 much longer. Here’s how you can secure your stack before it jumps: Visit the official BTFD website Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Select your preferred currency (ETH, USDT, or BNB) Buy BTFD and confirm the transaction Secure your tokens before the final stage closes Don’t wait for the price to rocket—this is your chance to get in before BTFD makes history. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Expands into DeFi with New ETP Approval While BTFD is gearing up for massive presale gains, Floki Inu (FLOKI) is making waves in the DeFi space. Floki just secured approval for a European Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), expanding its reach to traditional investors. This move could boost FLOKI’s adoption, but its price remains 75.8% below its all-time high. At $0.00008401, FLOKI is seeing some recovery, but it still has a long way to go. The DeFi expansion is promising, but it doesn’t offer the same kind of explosive upside that BTFD’s presale is delivering. For long-term investors, Floki’s DeFi push could be interesting, but if you’re looking for the fastest gains right now, BTFD is where the action is. Popcat (POPCAT) Surges 13% as Meme Coin Frenzy Continues POPCAT is proving that meme coins aren’t going anywhere. In just the past 24 hours, Popcat has soared by 13%, pushing its price to $0.2363. With a market cap of $231.7 million, it’s holding strong, but it’s still 88.5% below its all-time high of $2.05. Popcat’s recent momentum comes from increased exchange listings and growing community interest, but it’s still playing catch-up. While it’s a solid project, it doesn’t have the same upside potential as BTFD Coin’s presale, where investors are getting in at the absolute ground floor. Final Thoughts: The Bulls Squad is Taking Over – Will You Join? Based on market trends and current opportunities, there’s one clear winner among the top new meme coins to invest in this month. While Floki Inu is expanding into DeFi and Popcat is gaining short-term momentum, BTFD Coin is offering the most explosive potential. With its final presale stage closing soon, a projected 3650% ROI, and a thriving Bulls Squad community, this is the meme coin opportunity that could define 2025. The choice is yours—watch from the sidelines, or join the Bulls Squad before this presale ends. The window is closing fast. Secure your BTFD now.

How much can I earn if BTFD hits its moon price? If you invest $2500 at today’s presale price ($0.00016), your holdings could be worth $93,750 if BTFD reaches $0.006. Is BTFD’s presale almost over? Yes, Stage 14 is already 98% complete, and the price will jump from $0.00016 to $0.0006 at listing. Where can I buy BTFD Coin?

PEPE Crashes Could Have Something To Do With This,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/have-pepe-holders-just-signaled-a-100x-presale-thats-live-right-now-pepe-crashes-could-have-something-to-do-with-this,"Several Pepecoin price predictions have been circulating lately, each offering conflicting forecasts about the future of the popular meme coin. While some analysts expect a rebound, others point to Pepecoin’s struggle amid mass liquidations in the market. Many investors reacted negatively to President Donald Trump’s sudden confirmation that the U.S. would impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, triggering widespread panic sales. Selling activity intensified as the tariffs' impact rippled through the crypto market, plunging hundreds of utility and meme coins into the red. Pepecoin holders have just signalled Panshibi’s ongoing ICO , a 100x presale is live now. This new meme-based project is believed to have a massive upside potential. But could its presale be the escape route for PEPE holders and other market participants looking to recover their losses? Let’s answer this question, but before that, we will look at Pepecoin price prediction. Pepecoin Price Prediction Market sentiment plays a vital role when assessing the future of digital assets. The crypto market just endured a brutal two-week stretch, with sell-offs appearing to have ended - until President Donald Trump’s tariffs announcement created new turmoil. Last Friday, there were reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would likely drop charges against Coinbase . Not too long after these reports were made public, PEPE spiked by about 6%. Yet, since then, the token has retraced its steps, deepening its losses. Market metrics show that it was in the green for just 12 days out of a possible 30 (i.e., 40%) in the past month. Since its peak last December, Pepecoin's price has remained in a downtrend, creating a descending channel characterized by lower highs and lower lows, a strong sign of selling pressure. Pepecoin is currently selling at $0.000008192 . The RSI signal, from its price charts, currently stands at 33.44, barely above the oversold zone (i.e., below 30). While this might suggest that the selling pressure is weakening, translating into a short-term rebound, the bears still have a firm grip on the market. At this juncture, Pepecoin price prediction is faced with two options. In case of a collapse from the $0.0000077 – $0.0000082 support zone under intense selling pressure, the price of Pepecoin can plummet to $0.0000065 or even lower. On the other hand, if the buyers manageto defend this pivotal level, Pepecoin can jump to $0.000010, the upper limit of its decliningchannel. On Pepecoin price prediction, most analysts believe there will be more downside, which is why Pepecoin investors are moving to a profitable project to recoup their losses. This subtleyet tactical movement leads us to Panshibi, which has created a market buzz following the start of its 60-day ICO. Panshibi: Could Explode 100x This Year While Panshibi may be new to the crypto market, its foundation is anything but random. The project is deeply rooted in Asian culture, featuring a Panda mascot - a calculated decision that could prove extremely valuable. Asia is one of the largest markets in crypto, making it a prime audience for a meme coin with cultural significance. By integrating Panda symbolism, Panshibi embodies power and resilience, positioning itself as a project capable of resisting financial market exploitation. The saying goes: With Panshibi, there is Pandas, power and profits. Panshibi is backed by a serious team with a long-term vision. This is not a bluff - the core team has locked tokens for two years and liquidity for an entire decade, proving their commitment to sustainability. Furthermore, they have made their CEX and DEX listing plans public, aiming to secure top-tier exchange listings this year. Panshibi’s 60-day presale is still on and SHIBI tokens are available at a discounted price of $0.005 each. Join Pepecoin holders and other market participants in exploiting the 100x profit potential of this new meme coin.

33767162,[object Object],1740623420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Price At The End Of The Bull Market? Analyst Shows Where We Are In The Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-end/,"Given the bearish state of the market and the recent Bitcoin price crash below $95,000, it’s unsurprising if many would believe that the end of the bull market is here. However, a crypto analyst negates this possibility, sharing details regarding the current position the market is in this bull cycle. Bitcoin Price Rally Has Just Begun According to MartyParty, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), the Bitcoin price rally since 2023 has been primarily driven by institutional adoption through Spot Bitcoin ETFs . This price increase also occurred without the help of Quantitative Easing (QE), rate reductions, or liquidity injections. What this means is that while Bitcoin has risen over the past year, the true bull market is yet to come. The analyst argues that a real crypto bull market is expected when the Federal Reserve (FED) shifts to an accommodative stance, suggesting a stop in Quantitative Tightening (QT) and the beginning of rate cuts. The Federal Reserve plays a critical role in determining the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Historically, crypto bull cycles have thrived in environments where liquidity is high, interest rates are low, and speculative risk-taking is encouraged. However, since 2022, the FED has aggressively tightened monetary policy to prevent further inflation, raising interest rates and decreasing liquidity through QT. Despite these unfavorable market conditions, Bitcoin experienced a historic uptrend, largely due to institutional inflows into Spot ETFs and political changes, including the inauguration of Donald Trump as the new United States (US) President. Although the market is currently in a downtrend, with concerns rising over the possibility of a bear market, MartyParty emphasizes that the bull market, where altcoins surge alongside Bitcoin, will likely begin when the FED shifts from QT to QE. The analyst declared that the bull market had not begun at all, highlighting that current market dips and crypto crashes present a prime accumulation opportunity for investors. He urges the broader crypto community to begin accumulating tokens now, when Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) still dominate the market and sentiment is negative. Historically, periods of market decline often precede major price surges; however, investors should still maintain caution as the market remains volatile and unpredictable. Analyst Says Market Is Positioned At A Bear Trap While MartyParty claims that the bull run has not even begun, the analyst has also revealed that the market may be in a bear trap . For more clarity, a bear trap is a market situation where an asset’s prices drop rapidly but quickly reverse and continue on a stronger upward momentum. Depending on how severe the price declines are, a bear trap can easily be confused for a bear market . The analyst has warned investors not to fall for this market’s bear trap, predicting the onset of a full-fledged bull market when FED rates decrease. He highlights that a critical moment to look out for was March 19, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will provide updates on the US economic outlook and potential rate cuts.",Bitcoin News|and Doubt|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|fear|Fed|federal open market committee|Federal Reserve|FOMC|fud|MartyParty|QE|QT|Spot ETFs|Uncertainty,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-27 02:30:20

40891710,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=29740,1740623560,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,Dogecoin Price Prediction – Will DOGE Hit $0.40 in March?,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/dogecoin-price-prediction-february-2025/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies despite its origins as a joke. Initially created in 2013 as a parody of Bitcoin, DOGE has since gained real-world adoption, largely thanks to social media hype and support from figures like Elon Musk . As the crypto market prepares for another potential bull run in 2025, many investors are wondering: Can Dogecoin reach new all-time highs? This article breaks down Dogecoin’s price forecast for 2025 and beyond based on market trends, expert opinions, and potential catalysts. Current Market Performance Dogecoin currently trades at around $0. 20, fluctuating alongside broader crypto market trends. DOGE saw a massive surge in 2021 , reaching an all-time high of $0.73 in May before crashing alongside other cryptocurrencies. Since then, it has remained a favorite among retail investors but has struggled to regain its former highs. Short-Term Dogecoin Price Prediction (2024-2025) Many experts believe the crypto market could enter another bullish phase, benefiting Dogecoin. Here’s what analysts predict for DOGE’s price in the short term: Moderate Growth Expected : Most forecasts suggest DOGE could reach between $0.30 and $0.65 by the end of 2025 if market conditions remain favorable. Elon Musk’s Influence : Tesla and X (formerly Twitter) continue to be potential catalysts. If Musk integrates Dogecoin payments on X, DOGE could see a rapid price increase. Increased Utility : More businesses are accepting Dogecoin for payments, which could support steady price appreciation. Expert Predictions for 2025 WalletInvestor : Predicts a price range of $0.15 – $0.25 by late 2025. Changelly : Estimates DOGE could hit $0.30 – $0.40 if the crypto bull market takes off. CryptoNewz : A more optimistic forecast, suggesting DOGE might touch $0.50 if mass adoption increases. Long-Term Dogecoin Price Prediction (2026-2030) Long-term predictions for Dogecoin vary widely, depending on factors such as crypto adoption, regulatory policies, and overall market sentiment . Bullish Scenario If Dogecoin continues to gain traction as a medium of exchange , it could potentially reach $1.00 or higher by 2030 . Partnerships with major brands or integration into X for payments could be a game-changer. The broader adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions on Dogecoin’s network could improve transaction efficiency, driving price growth. Bearish Scenario If interest in Dogecoin declines or newer meme coins surpass it , DOGE could stagnate or drop below $0.05 . Regulatory crackdowns on meme coins could hinder its adoption and price potential. A prolonged bear market in crypto could keep DOGE’s price below $0.20 for years. Factors Influencing Dogecoin’s Future Price Several key factors will determine Dogecoin’s price trajectory in the coming years: 1. Elon Musk’s Endorsement Musk’s continued support for DOGE has been one of its biggest price drivers. If he integrates Dogecoin payments into Tesla or X (Twitter) , its value could surge. However, if Musk shifts focus away from DOGE, its hype could decline. 2. Bitcoin Halving & Market Trends Bitcoin’s 2024 halving is expected to trigger a crypto bull run , which typically benefits altcoins like Dogecoin. If history repeats itself, DOGE could see significant gains in 2025-2026 . 3. Real-World Adoption More merchants, platforms, and companies are accepting DOGE payments. Increased utility could drive long-term price growth and help it transition from a meme coin to a serious digital asset. 4. Competition from Other Meme Coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and newer meme tokens could overshadow Dogecoin if they offer better technology, faster transactions, or stronger communities. The meme coin market is highly competitive , making it crucial for DOGE to stay relevant. 5. Regulatory Challenges The global crypto market faces growing regulatory scrutiny , and meme coins like Dogecoin could be at risk if governments impose strict regulations. Investors should monitor legal developments closely. Is Dogecoin a Good Investment? Dogecoin remains a high-risk, high-reward asset. While it has strong community support and brand recognition, its future price depends on market trends, adoption, and continued hype . Investors should consider: Pros: Strong community backing and mainstream recognition. Potential integration into X (Twitter) payments . Historically follows Bitcoin’s bull cycles. Cons: Extremely volatile with no fixed supply limit. Meme coin competition (e.g., Shiba Inu, Floki, PEPE). Dependent on speculation and social media influence. Conclusion: Will Dogecoin Reach $1? While $1 DOGE is possible, it would require major adoption, Musk’s backing, and a booming crypto market . Most analysts predict DOGE will stay within the $0.20 – $0.50 range in the coming years , with the potential for higher gains in 2026-2030 . For investors, Dogecoin remains an exciting but speculative asset . It may not have the fundamentals of Bitcoin or Ethereum, but its meme-powered community and Elon Musk factor make it a unique play in the crypto space.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|SHIB|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-27 02:32:40

The Solana price remains a focal point for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as SOL holders assess its trajectory for 2025. Amidst Solana’s robust ecosystem, a new PayFi altcoin is gaining traction. Dubbed ""the next XRP"" by experts, this ERC20 coin offers a compelling alternative, drawing attention from SOL investors seeking the next big opportunity. This article delves into Solana’s outlook while spotlighting why this new Defi project is poised to redefine the altcoin landscape with its innovative approach to payments. Solana Price Prediction: A Shifting Landscape for SOL Holders Solana sits at $135 as of February 26, 2025 , stirring curiosity among holders about its future. This Solana price is a 21% decline over the past one week and with Solana market capitalization currently under $70 billion, SOL has faced a rocky month. While Solana price has tried to weather the storm of sell offs, a looming $2 billion FTX token unlock in March threatens further pressure. Analysts warn of a possible slide to $110 if support weakens. Despite its technical strengths, like 6.3 million daily users, Solana faces hurdles. An Argentina-based LIBRA token scandal shook confidence recently. The Solana price struggles to regain its 2024 peak near $300. Investors ponder if SOL’s rally has lost steam. Optimists still see upside. Some predict the Solana price could hit $230 by mid-2025 with speculation swirling around Franklin Templeton pushing forward with Solana ETF filings. Analysts at Coincodex estimate the Solana price to trade anywhere between $148 and $170 dollars in the coming weeks. However, bearish signals linger with volatility spiking. Holders are growing restless, seeking alternatives as uncertainty clouds Solana’s next move. Ripple’s Resurgence: XRP’s Payment Power Ripple, primarily linked to payment solutions, trades at $2.24 as of late February 2025 . A whale’s $51.8 million XRP withdrawal from an exchange sparked rally rumors. This moveslashed exchange supply, hinting at a potential price boost. The XRP Ledger saw a 40x surge in trading volume recently. Analysts like eye $5 by year-end. Some even forecast $27, echoing XRP’s 2017 highs. Yet, regulatory shadows loom, keeping the Ripple price volatile despite its payment prowess. In other news, DekaBank announced it was teaming up with Ripple Custody to deliver safe, regulated crypto trading and custody solutions for institutions. Ripple’s focus on cross-border transfers draws institutional interest. While the XRP price climbs, its legal battles with regulators persist. Investors weigh its stability against newer, agile players like Remittix in the market. Remittix: The Altcoin Gaining Traction Amid Solana price and XRP regulatory turbulence, Remittix emerges as a compelling option. Built on Ethereum, this PayFi token targets global remittances. It converts crypto to fiat instantly, slashing fees and delays. Remittix’s crypto-to-FIAT product streamlines payments across borders. Unlike XRP’s regulatory woes, Remittix prioritizes compliance and utility. It eyes the $700 billion remittance market, offering practical solutions. Analysts whisper of a 100x rally post-launch, exciting early adopters. Remittix stands out with its presale haul of more than $12.9 million. Its 300% token presale growth in 2025 dwarfs Solana’s flat performance. Targeting mass adoption via e-commerce and lending, RTX is more than a token, it's a payment revolution poised for exponential growth. Security sets Remittix apart. Institutional-grade protections build trust in a hack-prone space. Its capped supply fuels demand, unlike the Solana price facing risk of FTX dilution. Investors fleeing volatility see Remittix as a grounded bet with explosive upside. While Ripple battles regulators, Remittix builds quietly. Its instant fiat conversions outshine traditional systems. The XRP price may soar but it cannot match Remittix’s 20x growth potential. Investors see it as the next big leap, blending stability with sky-high potential. By solving global payment woes, Remittix is proving to be a utility powerhouse primed to outshine top competitors in 2025 and beyond. Join in now and don’t get left out!

This pattern could significantly slow down the next rebound phase at key price levels, raising concerns among investors about XRP’s near-term trajectory. Ripple (XRP) finds support at $2.20 as seller fatigue sets in XRP price action has leaned overwhelmingly bearish since the start of February, despite several bullish developments, including the SEC dropping charges against Ripple. This marked the end of the regulatory onslaught filed against the company under the outgoing Gary Gensler-led regime. Additionally, XRP had gained momentum when the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s spot XRP ETF filing , fueling optimism for broader institutional adoption. However, the market turned sharply negative following a hotter-than-expected inflation CPI report on Feb. 13, the $1.4 billion exploit on Bybit, and former President Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on North American neighbors Canada and Mexico. These macroeconomic factors compounded the bearish momentum, dragging XRP price to a three-week low of $2.15 on Feb. 26. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | Source: TradingView Despite these challenges, bulls made a strong push to reclaim the $2.20 level at press time. Zooming out XRP has now reached 20% losses since the start of February 2025. However, the sell-off appears to have subsided, with declining volume on on Thursday suggesting that short-term sellers may be running out of steam. If demand continues to strengthen, Ripple price could consolidate above this level before making another attempt at higher resistance zones. Rebound prospects at risk as sellers execute 2 million transactions in high-volume sell-offs XRP staged a mild 2% gain in the early hours of Feb. 27, briefly reclaiming the $2.20 level. However, market sentiment remains fragile as the U.S. tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports are set to take effect on March 1, casting doubt on the prospects of a sustained recovery. On-chain data further highlights that high-volume sell-off clusters formed earlier this week could hinder weak rebound attempts. CryptoQuant ’s Daily Transactions chart, which tracks the number of unique transactions executed on the XRP Ledger since the start of February, reflects a surge in trading activity tied to key market events. XRP Price vs. Daily Transactions The chart shows that XRP traders executed 2 million transactions on Feb. 25, coinciding with the market’s reaction to Trump’s latest tariff announcement. This represents a three-week high in transaction volume, with the last comparable spike occurring on Feb. 3, when Deepseek’s breakout triggered a U.S. tech stock sell-off that spilled into the crypto markets. Historically, when sharp price downswings align with high transaction volume, it indicates that a significant number of traders executed sell orders. As a result, when XRP approaches these key price levels during the next rebound phase, those who previously bought in at those levels may opt to exit at break-even points, creating additional resistance. For context, XRP opened at $2.70 on Feb. 3 before declining sharply and later opened at $2.32 on Feb. 25. Given the volume spikes observed at these points, XRP price is unlikely to break above these levels without a major bullish catalyst that triggers a rapid buying frenzy. Without such a catalyst, XRP’s next attempt to breach resistance could falter, keeping the price trapped in a tight consolidation range. XRP price forecast: $2.32 resistance could cap recovery efforts XRP price struggles to gain upside momentum after a steep five-day decline that erased nearly 25% of its value, sinking to $2.16. The Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility, with the price currently testing the lower band, a sign of oversold conditions. While this could attract dip buyers, the lack of strong volume inflows suggests bulls face resistance in staging a sustainable recovery. XRP price forecast The 50-day moving average at $2.51 remains well above current levels, reinforcing the bearish control. XRP must reclaim this level to restore bullish confidence. Meanwhile, the Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator at -0.50 highlights persistent bearish pressure, a key signal that sellers remain dominant. Until this turns positive, upside attempts are likely to fizzle out. A decisive close below $2.16 could open the door for a deeper correction, with the next major support near $2.00. Conversely, reclaiming $2.32—where the last rebound attempt failed—could signal early recovery signs. However, given the lack of bullish momentum and heavy sell-side volume, the path of least resistance remains downward unless a strong catalyst emerges.

Solana and Tron are two of the most widely held crypto assets, yet recent price movements have left many holders reeling from losses. In response, some investors have already started selling, fearing further declines. Market analysts warn that the worst may not be over. According to industry experts, Tron and Solanacould face an additional 40% crash within the next 48 hours, leading many investors to seek a safer alternative. The latest buzz in the market is Panshibi , a new meme coin with the potential to mint investors at least 100x in profits. Panshibi has started gaining traction, making it an attractive hedge against the looming Solana and Tron downturn. Let’s uncover the details surrounding Tron price prediction, Solana’s current outlook and why Panshibi might be the must-have in this season. Tron Price Prediction Despite new developments in the Tron ecosystem, the price action of TRX remains weak. Tron founder Justin Sun recently announced that Tether’s USDT stablecoin will soon feature commission-free transactions on the Tron blockchain. Sun’s post on X (formerly Twitter) on February 25 shows that Tron’s Gas Free feature will allow users to make USDT transactions without needing TRX for gas fees. While this should be a positive development for Tron’s long-term growth, its price action tells a different story. Tron has been on a downward trajectory, buying and selling at a current price of $0.229 . The intense selling pressure over the past two weeks has put TRX in a precarious position, with bears tightening their grip on the market. Tron's recent run shows a dearth of buying momentum, which has exposed the token to the possibility of another 40% dump this week. Unless the sellers' grip loosens, Tron might fall through critical support zones deeper into bearish territory. Solana's Decline Continues Solana started this year with bullish momentum, reaching a yearly high last month. However, February has been brutal for Solana holders, with prices tumbling by 19.5% in just one week. The price of Solana seems to be in a steep decline for almost two weeks, erasing most of the profits from its January surge. Ongoing sell-offs have caused the SOL price to plunge to $141.64 , reflecting a 15.18% drop over the week. Buyers are desperately trying to reclaim the $150 resistance level, but given the immense selling pressure, this recovery attempt seems unlikely to succeed. Analysts warn that if Solana fails to close the month above this critical price point, the bearish momentum could escalate, leading to another 40% dump. The Solana network also experienced decreasing activity, further eroding investor confidence. With technicals in red alert, most Solana holders are second-guessing their holding positions, believing that the losing trend may continue. Panshibi: The Must-Have in this Season Panshibi is proving the latest meme sensation in the market today, housing the flocking herd of investors and market participants in its safe and secure Bamboo Valley. This new meme coin is inspired by Asian culture and has a Panda mascot and a unique ecosystem designed to reward early adopters. This project is ultimately one investors cannot ignore; look at the numbers given the strong market headwinds. In a few weeks alone, Panshibi's 60-day presale has managed to surpass $1.1M, showing that the project is gaining serious traction amid a market downturn. That’s really impressive. When you buy SHIBI tokens and join the project, you unlock early access to various benefits within the Panshibi ecosystem. These benefits include staking rewards of up to 1200% APY and exclusive membership in the Bamboo VIP club, among others. Moreover, Investor confidence in Panshibi is further reinforced by its strong security measures. The team tokens are locked for two years, eliminating the risk of insider sell-offs. As of today, SHIBI tokens are available in presale at just $0.005 per token. Demand is expected to soar as more investors recognize Panshibi’s explosive potential, pushing prices higher once it hits the open market.

Meanwhile, Lightchain AI , which has already raised over $16.4 million at a presale price of $0.006, is capturing the attention of investors with its innovative AI and blockchain integration. While Solana’s potential remains strong, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world applications and scalability positions it for substantial growth in 2025. As both projects continue to develop, investors are eager to see if Lightchain AI can surpass expectations and deliver impressive returns in the near future. Can Solana (SOL) Reach $2000 by 2026? As of February 19, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $165.24. Analyst projections for SOL’s price by 2026 vary widely. Changelly estimates an average price around $1,524, with the potential to reach $1,887. Investing Haven suggests a peak between $1,250 and $2,000, possibly by 2027-2028. Meanwhile, Crypto News forecasts a potential high of $264.65 in 2026. These projections highlight differing opinions, with some analysts expecting SOL to hit $2,000 by 2026, while others predict more conservative growth. Given the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility and the rapid pace of technological advancements, precise predictions remain challenging. Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Lightchain AI’s Price Prediction for 2025- What Experts Are Saying Lightchain AI (LCAI) has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency market, with various analysts offering optimistic price predictions for 2025. Some forecasts suggest that LCAI could reach $5 by the end of 2025, driven by its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Another analysis predicts a more conservative estimate, with LCAI potentially reaching $3 by 2025, highlighting its unique features and real-world applications as key drivers for growth. These projections underscore the growing optimism surrounding Lightchain AI’s potential in the crypto space. However, it’s important to note that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and actual performance may vary. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider market risks before making investment decisions. Will Lightchain AI Be the Breakout Star of 2025? With its innovative approach to integrating AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI has positioned itself as a promising player in the crypto market. Its successful presale and growing adoption highlight strong investor sentiment and optimism for its future performance. While Solana (SOL) remains a top contender with its solid foundation in the blockchain ecosystem, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world applications and scalability may position it for more significant growth by 2025.

Though its price has dropped more than 36% over the previous month, investors still have hope. Could Dogecoin still have a big comeback? Some analysts agree, noting on the Dogecoin price chart positive trends. But is this only another hype cycle or will it truly reach $1? Remittix (RTX) another cryptocurrency is drawing interest in the market concurrently. This $0.0671 token is generating buzz in 2025 with its inexpensive, fast payments and spectacular presale. Given its deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, several analysts believe RTX may be among the best altcoins to buy right now. Before Dogecoin recovers its $0.737 ATH, could this under-the-radar altcoin hit $1? Read on to find out. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Wild Ride: A Rollercoaster of Price Swings The Dogecoin price has lately shown interesting swings. Though the change was not consistent, it dropped more than 19% over the past week. Before the bearish breakout, the Dogecoin price chart first showed consolidation between $0.265 and $0.248. A rapid decline then sent the memecoin below $0.199. Buyers intervened, though, dragging the price back above $0.213. However, shortly afterwards, bearish pressure sent the Dogecoin pricedown once more to $0.205. The past month was bearish as well; Dogecoin dropped more than 36% of its value. Notwithstanding this, the community is still hopeful and many holders still see Dogecoin’s long-term promise. Certain experts believe Dogecoin may move significantly not too far off. On the Dogecoin price chart, CryptoELITES noted a bullish breakout from a ""cup and handle"" pattern. This tendency usually points to a price rally. One of the top altcoins to hold, CryptoELITES estimates Dogecoin might surge to $5 soon . Technical indicators send conflicting messages. While the ADX, MACD, and MAs point to more selling pressure on the weekly timeframe, the Momentum Oscillator advises buying Dogecoin. Remittix (RTX) Offers Fast and Low-Cost Payments Remittix is transforming worldwide methods of money transfer. Moreover, Remittix addresses the slow and expensive problem that conventional banking systems usually bring. Following the fast conversion of over forty cryptocurrencies into fiat money, users can send crypto straight to bank accounts. This qualifies Remittix as a major participant in the remittance sector. Still, Remittix is among the best crypto investment prospects available right now. Remittix Wallet users have complete control over their digital resources. Those who use this non-custodial wallet can quickly trade, swap, and store their coins. As the platform maintains developing ties with big CEXs and DEXs and worldwide blockchain acceptance grows, RTX is among the best cryptos to invest in right now. Having already sold over 505 million tokens in a few months, the Remittix presale has raised over $12.9 million. Meanwhile, RTX is priced at just $0.0671 in the ongoing presale. This provides a fantastic starting point. Strong characteristics of RTX include deflationary tokenomics, which causes its supply to drop with time, increasing value. Trading is simple as neither buying or selling RTX is taxed. Investors could also get staking benefits ranging from 4% to 8% annually. RTX is becoming among the best cryptos to buy for long-term profits given its fast growth and great demand. Dogecoin vs. Remittix: The Next Big Crypto Winner? Though some analysts forecast a breakout, Dogecoin has seen notable fluctuations; its road to $1 is yet uncertain. Meanwhile, Remittix is creating waves with its rapid payments, explosive presale, and deflationary tokenomics. RTX is proving more than just hype with over 504 million tokens sold and over $12.9 million raised in a few months. RTX provides a fantastic entry point at just $0.0671 before its price skyrockets. Don't wait until RTX reaches $1, the presale is fast selling out and the total RTX token supply is only limited.

From the rise of Trump-related tokens like $TRUMP and $MELANIA to meme coins fueled by internet culture, the market is buzzing with opportunities. As speculation and hype drive the space, some meme coins stand out with unique narratives and massive return potential. Among the latest contenders, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Official Melania Meme ($MELANIA), and ANDY ($ANDY) are capturing attention for their innovation, community engagement, and potential for explosive gains. Let’s dive into what makes each of these meme coins a must-watch for those hunting for exponential returns. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Legendary Expedition for Unparalleled Gains Deep in the heart of the Arctic, where myths intertwine with reality, a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo embarks on a journey unlike any other. His mission? To uncover the Earth’s most hidden mysteries, with $APC coins representing his findings. But this isn’t just a story—it’s an investment opportunity with the potential for 11,844.78% returns from the current location to the launch price. Unlike traditional meme coins with fixed stages, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) progresses through different locations, each unveiling a new chapter in the explorer’s quest. Right now, Pablo has reached Penguinopolis, the 12th location, where investors can buy $APC for just $0.000067 per coin. With over $1.61 million already raised, demand is skyrocketing. When $APC lists at $0.008, early investors who bought in at the current price could see insane returns. A $500 investment today gets 7,462,685 APC, which could balloon to $59,701.48 upon launch. Arctic Pablo Coin burns unsold tokens weekly, reducing supply and boosting value. The project also offers a massive 66% APY staking program, allowing holders to earn big just by holding. Staked tokens are locked for two months post-launch, ensuring sustainability and long-term investor gains. With 221.2 billion APC in total supply, Arctic Pablo Coin has a well-structured distribution model. Fifty percent is allocated to the public presale, liquidity accounts for twenty-five percent, staking rewards are set at fifteen percent, ecosystem growth takes up twenty percent, community rewards hold ten percent, and five percent is reserved for the team with a one-year lock-in. With the presale nearing its final days, investors have a limited window to grab $APC at its lowest price. Once Penguinopolis sells out, the next location will have a higher price. It stands among top new meme coins for exponential returns . Official Melania Meme: The First Lady of Meme Coins $MELANIA is one of the latest political meme coins, launched in tribute to Melania Trump. Following in the footsteps of $TRUMP, which saw massive growth, this token aims to capitalize on political and cultural interest. With Melania Trump’s name attached, $MELANIA quickly gained traction in the crypto space. The token has a passionate holder base, with X (Twitter) engagement skyrocketing. Meme coins thrive on speculation, and $MELANIA has already shown wild price swings, perfect for traders looking to capitalize. However, concerns about centralized token ownership and potential rug pulls make it essential to conduct thorough research before investing. Some investors see $MELANIA as a long-term play, while others view it as a short-term speculative opportunity. ANDY: The Meme Coin Paying Tribute to a Digital Icon Another hot meme coin making waves is ANDY ($ANDY), a tribute to a viral internet persona. Like PEPE and Wojak coins, ANDY is all about embracing meme culture, and rewarding holders who join the movement. ANDY memes are going viral, fueling organic adoption. The coin has gained traction quickly, with early investors already seeing big profits. ANDY also plans to launch exclusive NFT collections, adding another utility layer. For meme coin traders and collectors, ANDY offers a fresh take on the ever-growing sector. Conclusion: The Next Big Meme Coin Could Be One Click Away Based on research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Official Melania Meme ($MELANIA), and ANDY ($ANDY) all present unique opportunities for exponential returns. While $MELANIA rides the wave of political hype and ANDY taps into meme culture, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its adventure-driven narrative and lucrative tokenomics. With Penguinopolis nearing its final days, now is the last chance to get in at $0.000067 before the price increases.

Many beginners hesitate, wondering if they’ve already missed out on the biggest gains or if the market is too complex to navigate. However, the truth is that the next wave of high-growth opportunities is already forming, and savvy investors are positioning themselves early. For those just starting, picking the right cryptos is crucial. The best beginner-friendly coins combine strong fundamentals, real-world use cases, and high-growth potential. With the right picks, even a small investment could lead to life-changing returns. As the market continues its upward trajectory, here are five promising cryptocurrencies that could skyrocket soon. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is quickly emerging as one of the most talked-about crypto projects of 2025, thanks to its revolutionary approach to online shopping. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that rely on centralized systems, Web3Bay is building a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact directly without middlemen, excessive fees, or data privacy concerns. With major online platforms facing backlash over rising costs and strict policies, the demand for blockchain-powered alternatives is growing rapidly. Web3Bay taps into this demand by offering a secure, transparent, and user-driven marketplace powered by cryptocurrency transactions. The Web3Bay presale has already surpassed $1.5 million, proving strong investor interest. The current price of 3BAY is still $0.00456, making it a high-upside opportunity for those who get in early. Analysts predict that as Web3Bay gains mainstream adoption, its price could surge, providing early buyers with significant returns. Unlike speculative meme coins, Web3Bay has a real-world use case that addresses a trillion-dollar industry. This makes it one of the best beginner-friendly cryptos to watch, as it offers both high-growth potential and a practical application. 2. Solana (SOL) – The Fastest Blockchain for Smart Contracts Solana has positioned itself as one of the leading blockchain networks for high-speed transactions and decentralized applications. Its key advantage over competitors like Ethereum is its extremely low fees and fast processing times, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike. The growing adoption of DeFi projects, NFTs, and gaming applications on Solana’s network has fueled demand, and many analysts believe its price will continue to climb. While Solana is no longer in the under-$1 category, its growth potential remains strong, especially for beginners looking for an established yet high-upside crypto. The network continues to expand, with major partnerships and increasing institutional interest. As the next bull run gains momentum, Solana could once again prove to be a top performer. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – The Meme Coin with Long-Term Potential While meme coins often carry a high level of speculation, Shiba Inu has managed to evolve beyond its meme status. Originally created as a Dogecoin competitor, SHIB has since built a growing ecosystem, including its own decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), NFT marketplace, and upcoming blockchain developments. The Shiba Inu community remains one of the largest and most active in crypto, which has helped sustain its price growth. With the potential launch of a Shiba Inu-based Layer-2 network, SHIB could see renewed investor interest and increased adoption. For beginners, Shiba Inu offers a low-cost entry point and strong community-driven momentum, making it a fun yet potentially rewarding investment option. 4. Polygon (MATIC) – Scaling Ethereum for Mass Adoption Ethereum’s high transaction fees and slow processing times have been a major hurdle for mass adoption. That’s where Polygon (MATIC) comes in, offering a Layer-2 scaling solution that improves Ethereum’s efficiency and reduces costs. Polygon has secured major partnerships with corporations, DeFi platforms, and gaming projects, making it one of the most widely used scaling networks in the space. As Ethereum continues to grow, Polygon will remain a crucial part of its ecosystem, which means its demand is likely to keep rising. For beginner investors, Polygon offers a balance between stability and growth potential, making it a great choice for those who want exposure to Ethereum’s future without the high price tag. 5. XRP – A Crypto with Institutional Backing XRP has long been known as one of the most institutionally supported cryptocurrencies, with its primary use case being cross-border payments. Despite regulatory challenges in the past, XRP continues to see strong adoption from financial institutions looking for efficient and low-cost remittance solutions. The potential approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the near future could bring billions of dollars in institutional investment, which may push prices significantly higher. XRP’s strong network effect and real-world use case make it a great long-term hold for beginners who want exposure to the crypto payments industry. Final Thoughts – Start Your Crypto Journey the Right Way The crypto market offers endless opportunities, but for beginners, selecting the right coins is crucial. Web3Bay stands out as the most exciting opportunity for early-stage growth, with its decentralized e-commerce vision attracting increasing investor attention. Solana and Polygon offer strong blockchain infrastructure plays, while Shiba Inu and XRP present alternative options for those looking to capitalize on market trends and mainstream adoption. As crypto continues to disrupt traditional industries and gain global recognition, now is the perfect time for new investors to start building their portfolios before the next market surge. The key is to identify projects with strong use cases and long-term viability, and the five cryptos listed above provide some of the best starting points for a successful crypto journey.

RCOF Takes the Lead as a Top Crypto to Buy in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/from-0-1-to-1-in-3-weeks-rcof-takes-the-lead-as-a-top-crypto-to-buy-in-2025/,"Barely 2 months into the year, the search for the top crypto to buy in 2025 is heating up. While established cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the market, emerging high-growth altcoins offer the greatest potential for exponential gains. From the numerous projects vying for the position, one crypto, RCO Finance (RCOF) , stands out as a strong contender. This altcoin has integrated AI, offering cutting-edge investment tools and real-world asset integration. Analysts predict it could surge from $0.1 to $1 in just 3 weeks, making it one of the most promising crypto investments of the year. The Top Crypto to Buy: Why RCOF Is a Better Bet Than Other Altcoins in 2025 Crypto markets are entering a bullish phase, creating the perfect conditions for undervalued tokens to explode in value. For growth-oriented investors looking for the next big opportunity, here’s why RCOF is emerging as a top contender for the top crypto to buy in 2025. Despite still being in its presale phase, this altcoin has attracted immense crypto whale and institutional investor interest. They are accumulating this token at an increasing rate, recognizing its disruptive potential. Its low price, $0.1, has attracted a surge of interest from early adopters looking for the next top crypto to buy. This low price is an ideal entry point that allows investors to accumulate more tokens for a lot less, setting them up for massive gains as the crypto surges to $1. Unlike purely speculative altcoins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu , which rely on hype to drive growth, RCOF offers real-world utility. The project leverages AI-driven trading tools to enhance market analysis, automated investment strategies, and portfolio optimization, making it the top crypto to buy. Key Features Driving RCO Finance (RCOF) Rapid Rise from $0.10 to $1 What makes RCO Finance the top crypto to buy in 2025? Its unique blend of AI-driven automation, real-world asset integration, and decentralized financial solutions separates it from the competition. RCOF has integrated AI, helping simplify the complexities of crypto trading and navigating financial markets. This integration allows the altcoin to provide advanced trading tools that provide users with a holistic view of the market and generate data-driven insights that inform personalized strategies, mitigate risks, and maximize potential returns through intelligent automation. The star of this AI toolkit is the robo-advisor , a tool that personalizes its support, allowing even users with no prior experience to build profitable portfolios by simplifying complex investment decisions. If you want quick gains and are open to taking on more risk, it can list high-reward but higher-risk assets that can help you achieve your goals faster. If you are more conservative, it can list mid-to low-risk assets you can invest in for steady long-term gains. What’s great about the robo-advisor is you can create a hybrid strategy and get the best of both worlds. This tool offers actionable insights based on real-time market data. These insights help eliminate guesswork and emotional biases, ensuring you make smarter investment choices. It can identify emerging trends and patterns, such as pinpointing undervalued assets or potential breakout opportunities. Imagine getting alerts about Raydium (RAY) at $1.6 in October, creating a good buying opportunity before it climbed to $8.65, a 440% jump. With advanced tools like the robo-advisor, you can capitalize on such opportunities. RCOF offers users something more than crypto trading. It has integrated real-world assets like bonds, shares, real estate commodities and more to increase investment options on its platform. This inclusion makes diversification a lot easier, democratizes access to high-value assets and allows for fractional ownership. To guarantee a secure, safe and reliable investing environment, SolidProof has rigorously audited RCOF’s smart contracts and codebase. This certification showcases RCOF’s adherence to high industry standards and reassures investors of the platform’s integrity. Many platforms require users to fulfill lengthy KYC (Know Your Customer) verification; however, RCOF employs a non-KYC policy, meaning users can participate without going through these hurdles. This model helps break down geographical barriers and enables users from anywhere in the world to participate. It also maintains user privacy, attracting investors who value online anonymity. The recently released beta platform is giving you the chance to access RCOF core features such as the robo-advisor. Over 10k users have already joined, transforming their investment experience with superior insights, diverse asset access and personalized support. Since this is just a beta version, you can expect more enhancements as the official launch approaches. If you want to experience the RCOF difference for yourself, join the beta platform here . Get in Early: Don’t Miss RCOF’s 10x Surge If you are looking for the top crypto to buy in 2025, RCOF, with its AI-driven features and real-world utility, is one of the most promising options available.

To get these gains, you must invest now while prices are still low before they jump to $0.13, cutting your potential gains by 30%. Don’t let this chance slip away.

This massive sell-off has raised concerns among investors, prompting analysts to explore the underlying causes of this dramatic decline. Bitcoin And Ethereum Plummet According to insights from the Kobelsi Letter, a global commentator on capital markets, the frequency of “flash crashes” in the crypto sector has surged since January. These rapid price declines can occur without major bearish news, leaving investors puzzled about the sudden volatility. The recent downturn began with Bitcoin (BTC), which initially fell below $95,000. However, a sharp drop from $95,000 to $90,000 within just 30 minutes early in the morning served as a wake-up call for traders. Ethereum (ETH) has fared even worse, experiencing a staggering 37% drop over 60 hours on February 2nd, despite trade war headlines that had already been priced into the market. Related Reading: Why Ethereum Is A Must-Watch: Expert Analysis Highlights 4 Strong Bullish Indicators One of the critical factors contributing to this crypto volatility, according to the analysts, is the drastic shift in liquidity and short positioning in Ethereum. In a single week, short positions surged by 40%, and since November 2024, they have skyrocketed by 500%. This unprecedented level of shorting by Wall Street hedge funds has created a precarious situation for Ethereum, which is now valued at approximately $300 billion. As institutional investors increasingly short Ethereum, many have turned their attention to Bitcoin, creating a stark contrast in market dynamics. While retail interest in Bitcoin has waned, driven partly by a surge in memecoins, institutional capital continues to flow into Bitcoin, exacerbating the volatility in altcoins like Solana. Retail Vs Institutional Investors Amid Crypto Volatility Kobelsi further highlights that the current market environment is characterized by a polarization between retail and institutional investors. As liquidity decreases, price movements become increasingly erratic. This has resulted in significant “air pockets,” where sentiment can shift dramatically, leading to rapid price changes. Recent sentiment analysis reveals that the crypto market is experiencing its lowest levels of enthusiasm for 2024. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which previously indicated a state of greed, has now dropped to a fear level of 29%. Such shifts in sentiment often precede flash crashes, as traders react to the changing landscape. Related Reading: XRP Price Continuation After Crash Below $2.4? New Targets Emerge Adding to the complexity of the situation, public figures like Eric Trump have been vocal about their views on the largest crypto assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump has suggested that these price dips present buying opportunities, a perspective that may influence retail investors’ behavior. Furthermore, companies like MicroStrategy have also impacted the crypto market dynamics. Despite a 45% drop in its stock since its November 20th peak, MicroStrategy continues to accumulate Bitcoin through convertible note offerings, reinforcing its commitment to the crypto and potentially influencing market sentiment. So far, Ethereum has managed to regain the $2,500 level after falling below $2,300 on Tuesday, recording losses of 7% in the 24-hour time frame.

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face hurdles near $2,400 and $2,450. Ethereum is facing an increase in selling below the $2,450 zone. The price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,390 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,400 and $2,500. Ethereum Price Extends Losses Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,550 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace below the $2,500 and $2,450 support levels to move further in a bearish zone. The price declined over 5% and even traded below the $2,320 support zone. A low was formed at $2,251 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,519 swing high to the $2,251 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,390 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,380 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,519 swing high to the $2,251 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,420 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,450. A clear move above the $2,450 resistance might send the price toward the $2,500 resistance. An upside break above the $2,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,550 resistance zone or even $2,620 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,315 level. The first major support sits near the $2,250 zone. A clear move below the $2,250 support might push the price toward the $2,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,050.

Speaking at his first cabinet meeting on Feb. 26, U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his intention to put a 25% tariff on European Union goods, as reported by The Guardian. The cryptocurrency industry has been significantly impacted by this announcement. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is currently down 4% in the last 24 hours, trading at $84,600 levels at press time. The broader crypto market has also suffered, with total market cap shrinking 4% following President Trump’s remarks, according to CoinGecko. CoinGlass data also shows that total liquidations have surpassed $765 million in the past 24 hours, adding to the $1.5 billion wiped out on Feb. 25. According to SoSoValue data , the market decline has coincided with the biggest one-day withdrawal from Bitcoin ETFs since their inception, with $937.78 million leaving on Feb. 25. This further solidifies the change in institutional investors’ sentiment, bringing the total outflows for the last week to almost $1.5 billion. You might also like: Here’s why Bitcoin and Ethereum prices could recover despite February’s losses Since Trump took office in January, Bitcoin has fallen about 20% from its peak of $109,225. After Trump’s election victory and hopes of a more favorable regulatory environment, there was a period of optimistic momentum, followed by the current sell-offs. Hopes for rapid implementation of pro-crypto policies have declined as the administration seems to be prioritizing aggressive trade policies. Security concerns have also shaken investor sentiment. The market’s liquidity has been depleted by the collapse of the Solana memecoin boom, and concerns over centralized exchange vulnerabilities have been ignited by the unresolved $1.4 billion Bybit hack . Although some analysts see the correction as a healthy reset, others caution that a decline below $80,000 would lead to yet another round of liquidations, which might send Bitcoin toward $70,000. Traders continue to exercise caution as macroeconomic uncertainty rises, anticipating possible regulatory changes that would re-establish trust in the digital asset market.

According to a notice shared by Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, the SEC informed their legal team on Monday that the investigation has concluded and, based on the information available, the agency will not recommend any enforcement action at this time. This decision comes 699 days after the initiation of the investigation and 277 days after the SEC had issued a Wells Notice, signaling the potential for an enforcement action. While this decision provides relief for Gemini, it is important to note that the SEC’s notice does not exonerate the company. The agency clarified that its conclusion is not final, and the possibility remains that further action could be taken in the future. The investigation had centered around Gemini’s “Earn” program, which the SEC had alleged involved the offering of unregistered securities through a partnership with crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital. A Long Battle with the SEC In his statement, Cameron Winklevoss took to social media to reflect on the lengthy battle with the SEC and its impact on Gemini and the broader crypto ecosystem. He opened u[ about the immense legal costs incurred, amounting to tens of millions of dollars, as well as the broader economic losses resulting from the uncertainty caused by the SEC’s regulatory approach. He lamented that while the SEC’s actions may have been framed as a protective measure, the agency’s conduct had significant negative consequences on American innovation, causing crypto talent to seek opportunities in other sectors. However, he wrote, “So where do we go from here? It’s wholly unacceptable for an agency like the SEC to bully, harass, and attack a lawful industry and then decide one day to simply say we’re good and walk away. Unless there is a cost and price to be paid for this behavior, it will happen again.” A Changing Regulatory Landscape This development follows the SEC’s recent withdrawal of lawsuits against other major players in the crypto industry, including Coinbase, and the closure of investigations into OpenSea, Robinhood, and Uniswap. This move raises the possibility that the SEC may take similar actions with other high-profile cases, including the ongoing legal battle involving Ripple Labs.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-27 03:46:42

Bitcoin also dropped below $84,000, adding to the pressure on cryptocurrencies. Several factors, including market trends and economic developments, have contributed to Dogecoin’s price movement. Dogecoin Price Plummets, Is A Recovery Near? Dogecoin’s price has fallen to around $0.20, with analysts suggesting that it is following a familiar cycle seen in previous years. Historically, Dogecoin has gone through corrections before rebounding. Crypto analyst Bithereum noted that Dogecoin price was moving within a falling wedge pattern, which indicated that a drop to $0.20197 was likely. This level has been tested, aligning with historical trends where Dogecoin price experiences pullbacks before rallying. Despite the drop, analysts believe Dogecoin could reverse to the upside, potentially reaching $0.45 soon. DOGE/USD price chart (Source: TradingView) Another factor contributing to the DOGE price decline is the decrease in network activity. According to market data, new address creation on the Dogecoin network has significantly dropped from 1.29 million in November to just 30,815. A decline in new addresses suggests lower investor participation, which can weaken buying pressure and lead to price declines. Donald Trump 25% European Union Impact on DOGE Price Dogecoin price recent drop also comes amid broader economic concerns. A major factor influencing the market is U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on the European Union. “We have made a decision, and we’ll be announcing it very soon. It’ll be 25 per cent,” Trump said during a cabinet meeting, as reported by the Financial Times. His comments raised concerns about potential trade tensions between the U.S. and the EU, which affected global markets, including cryptocurrencies. Following the announcement, Bitcoin price fell below $84,000 , dragging the broader crypto market down. Dogecoin saw a decline of over 6%, as traders reacted to economic uncertainty. Some analysts believe that fear surrounding economic policies led to increased selling pressure across digital assets. Concurrently, continued DOGE selling pressure , particularly from large investors, could lead Dogecoin to retest lower levels before stabilizing. Dogecoin Price May Be Ready for a Rebound, Top Analyst Despite the price drop, technical indicators suggest that Dogecoin price may be approaching a reversal. According to crypto analyst Ali (@ali_charts), the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the daily chart. This indicator is often used to identify potential trend reversals, suggesting that Dogecoin could soon experience upward momentum. Trader Tardigrade, another analyst, pointed out that DOGE price has been following a similar pattern to its 2017-2018 bull run. If the trend continues, Dogecoin could see a strong rally, potentially moving toward the $1.70 level. Additionally, Master Kenobi noted that Dogecoin is holding above a critical trend line that has historically acted as support. He also mentioned that Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at its lowest level since March 2023, which could indicate that the selling pressure is easing and a recovery may follow. Consequently, crypto analysts have identified key price levels that could determine Dogecoin price next move. If Dogecoin price maintains its support around $0.20, a potential rebound could push it toward targets of $0.30998, $0.37154, and $0.45918 in the coming weeks.

It’s now aiming for the $3 mark after hitting a high of $2.98. The price has already climbed 176% from $0.63, and many believe a new all-time high (ATH) could be coming soon. Binance Listing Could Be Next This price surge has caught the attention of many in the crypto world, and analysts believe Pi Coin could soon be listed on Binance. With Pi’s 24-hour trading volume now ranking 5th among major cryptocurrencies, it’s clear that interest in Pi is growing fast. Crypto analyst Kim Wong thinks Pi’s price could hit $3.8 next, and that a new ATH might be just around the corner. What Makes Pi Coin Stand Out? According to Wong, Pi Network is seen as one of the most innovative projects, with the potential to become the world’s digital currency, beating out many other cryptocurrencies. Pi Network has over 100 million app downloads, with 65 million active users and 19 million verified members. Pi Coin is already listed on five popular centralized exchanges (CEXs) and is trading at an all-time high. The coin’s market cap has placed it among the top 10 cryptos (excluding stablecoins), and it’s been trending since its recent listing on February 20, 2025. This success is putting pressure on exchanges like Binance and Coinbase to add Pi Coin. Wong stressed that unlike many other cryptos, Pi Coin is not just another meme coin. While its popularity is growing quickly, it’s backed by real use cases and a strong network. The meme market could help push Pi’s price even higher, especially if more major exchanges list the coin.

40892661,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=703262,1740628842,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Dogecoin Forms ‘Monster Falling Wedge’ Pattern: What It Means,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-monster-falling-wedge-pattern/,"In a post on X today, crypto analyst Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper) shared a daily chart of DOGE/USDT on Binance that highlights what he calls a “monster falling wedge.” The chart shows Dogecoin’s price moving within two converging trendlines—one descending from the coin’s recent swing highs, and the other descending at a shallower angle from its short‐term lows, forming a classic wedge structure. Buy Or Sell Dogecoin Now? According to the chart, Dogecoin is currently trading in the $0.21–$0.22 range, hovering just above the wedge’s lower boundary. This trendline extends from the coin’s mid‐December levels—when Dogecoin first began its downward trajectory—through its successive lower lows, culminating near the apex in early March. Meanwhile, the upper boundary of the wedge connects a series of descending peaks from the coin’s local highs, including one in mid-January, sloping downward into the same apex region. A ‘falling wedge’ is typically viewed by technical traders as a potential bullish reversal pattern, particularly when accompanied by decreasing volume during the consolidation phase. The idea is that as sellers become exhausted, buyers may begin stepping in near the wedge’s support line, driving price momentum upward once the resistance line is broken. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Falls Below This Level, A Freefall To $0.06 Is Possible: Analyst In the chart Satoshi Flipper shared, a dashed arrow projects a possible bullish move if Dogecoin can decisively break above the wedge’s top boundary. While no guarantees exist in crypto markets, this hypothetical trajectory arcs from current price levels around $0.21 to as high as the $0.50 region by late-April. The chart also shows a notable horizontal support zone below the market, hovering around $0.10–$0.15, which dates back to Dogecoin’s earlier base before its large run‐up. Meanwhile, sentiment among other crypto analysts on X appears divided. Carlos Garcia Tapia (@CAGThe3rd) cautions that he sees “h patterns everywhere” and suggests a potential retracement before the next leg down: “Sad to say, this is all cooked, bois. DOGE 14 cents :(“ In response to another user who was unfamiliar with the “h pattern,” Tapia reiterated his view of a likely downward move. “Pretty much a retracement before the next leg down,” he stated. “This contrasts with the more optimistic stance from Suzzy | DeFi (@SuzzyDefi), who highlighted a strong wick off the $0.19–$0.20 support zone: Related Reading: Dogecoin Warning: One Level Could Trigger A Surge, Says Analyst “Took a glance at DOGE, and I just spotted a strong wick off the $0.19 – $0.20 support, giving me serious bullish vibes!

The price is now trading below $2.320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.250 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).
