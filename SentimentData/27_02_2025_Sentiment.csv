ZachXBT also warned Pump.fun followers that the hackers were promoting scam tokens through false announcements on the page. The hackers posted their first tweet about one hour ago promoting a fake pump.fun governance token dubbed $PUMP. The post stated, ‘Introducing $PUMP, the OFFICIAL Pump.fun GOVERNANCE token, where DEMOCRACY has never been this degen.’ The hackers added that they would be rewarding the ‘OG DEGENS.’ The post has since then been deleted. pumpdotfun account is hacked ⚠️ $PUMP is heavily bundled and will dump pic.twitter.com/7wOy7lhka5 — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) February 26, 2025 The hackers have posted 3 more tweets in the past hour, with one promising that the token would not be a bundle and would be launched via Pump.fun. Another tweet asked the memecoin launchpad’s followers whether to launch a legit token called hackeddotfun. The hackers further encouraged users to pump the coin to $100 million. The last tweet stated that the hackers were ‘here to save crypto,’ promoting another token called $HACKED. The hackers alleged that none of the token’s supply would be owned and not bundled. The tweets notably included CAs for followers to engage with. ZackXBT still encouraged users not to interact with any of the CAs or links posted. The 3 posts have also been deleted since. The Solana memecoin launcher has still not commented on the situation, and it is unclear whether the platform is aware of the hack. A Pump.fun staff member has still reportedly acknowledged the hack, informing followers that the platform was investigating the situation. ZackXBT connects the hack to Jupiter DAO and DogWifCoin hacks ZachXBT mentioned in another Telegram post that Pump.fun X account hack could be connected to the Jupiter DAO X account hack this February and DogWifCoin’s hack in November last year. The investigator still insisted that the hacks were possibly not the fault of the teams. ZachXBT further speculated that the threats could be connected to X social engineering employees with fraudulent documents or emails. The investigator also suggested that the exploitation of an X panel could be another probable cause of the compromised accounts. Jupiter Exchange’s X account suffered a hack on February 6, prompting the team to announce the incident on the official Jupiter DAO page. The team warned users not to engage with any of the links, CAs, or information shared on the exchange’s X account. The incident was not the first the platform experienced over the past few months, leading users to discuss whether to boycott the exchange. Hackers had exploited the JUP token airdrop account about one year ago, costing users approximately $1 million. DogWifCoin’s X account suffered a hack on November 15 last year, where hackers attempted to scam the memecoin’s followers through phishing links. The project still reported that the hackers did not manage to steal any funds from users. Pump.fun hack comes a few days after Bybit’s incident Bybit Hack Forensics Report As promised, here are the preliminary reports of the hack conducted by @sygnia_labs and @Verichains Screenshotted the conclusion and here is the link to the full report: https://t.co/3hcqkXLN5U pic.twitter.com/tlZK2B3jIW — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 26, 2025 The recent Pump.fun X account hack comes only a few days after one of the top exchanges, Bybit, experienced a cyber-attack. The Bybit hack was tied to the North Korean cybercrime organization Lazarus Group, leading to about $1.4 billion in losses. The exchange’s attack was one of the largest hacks recorded in crypto history, standing above the Ronin Network cyber-attack 3 years ago, which cost users about $625 million. The hackers swiped $400,000 ETH from one of the exchange’s cold wallets. The attack happened during a routine transfer from the exchange’s hot wallet despite the transaction undergoing multiple checks, including a sign-off from Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhao. Chainalysis reportedly confirmed that the attack was tied to social engineering, with the hackers taking advantage of the cold wallet signers through phishing attacks. The exchange immediately executed security protocols to manage the situation. The exchange’s deposits and withdrawals went back to normal on Saturday after Bybit handled the backlog of over 500,000 withdrawal requests. Bybit also announced that the exchange worked to return its ETH reserves back to 1:1. Lookonchain data also revealed that the platform’s reserves were back to 100% by February 24 through loans, ETH purchases, and whale deposits. Bybit’s CEO announced further steps to ensure the capture of the Lazarus Group through the Lazarus Bounty Program. Zhao outlined that the bounty site, the first the crypto industry ever had, would employ complete transparency. The exchange has employed a team to ensure the website remains up-to-date. Bybit hackers use Pump.fun to launder stolen funds Thanks to @caLilyLiu and the @pumpdotfun team for taking swift action to block and remove a Solana-based token whose creator may be affiliated with hacker groups, ensuring the security of the ecosystem. This is a great example of proactive security in action — Bybit (@Bybit_Official) February 23, 2025 The Bybit hackers attempted to use Pump.fun to launder the stolen funds through scam memecoins. The attempt came after the hackers split the stolen funds across multiple wallets, for which several exchanges were on the lookout. ZachXBT revealed that the cyber-criminals received $1.08 million in USDC in one wallet before bridging the funds to Solana. The hackers shifted the funds through a complex web of money laundering schemes, passing them through BSC wallets before sending them back to Solana. The group later created scam memecoins to guise transactions as memecoin trades, including through the QinShihuang token. The hackers managed to trade $26 million through the token before the Solana memecoin launcher blocked it. Pump.fun has blocked several other memecoins tied to the Bybit hackers. Bybit applauded the efforts of the Memecoin launcher to prevent money laundering in the ecosystem. The exchange tweeted that Pump.fun’s efforts showed proactive steps to ensure user safety and prevent fraudulent behavior. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s foray into the digital asset world. It turns out, like many public figures and savvy investors, Trump too has dipped his toes into the crypto waters. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence has peeled back the curtain, revealing that a crypto wallet linked to Donald Trump currently holds a substantial portfolio of digital currencies. But the ride hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. Let’s delve into the fascinating details of Trump crypto wallet and the rollercoaster of value it has experienced. Donald Trump Crypto Wallet: A Peek into the Holdings Thanks to the transparent nature of blockchain technology and the investigative prowess of firms like Arkham Intelligence, we can get a glimpse into the crypto holdings of public figures. In the case of Donald Trump, it appears he possesses a crypto wallet that, as of recent data, contains approximately $1.6 million worth of crypto assets . This revelation sparks numerous questions: What types of cryptocurrencies are held in the wallet? How has the value of these holdings changed over time? What does this mean for Trump’s stance on the crypto industry? Let’s break down what we know so far. The $1.6 Million Portfolio: A Snapshot According to Arkham Intelligence’s data, the Trump crypto wallet holds a diverse range of digital currencies. The most significant portion of this portfolio is comprised of a token called TROG. As of the latest valuation, TROG alone accounts for a whopping $877,000 within the wallet. While the specifics of other crypto assets in the wallet haven’t been detailed in this initial report, the presence of TROG as the dominant holding is noteworthy and warrants further exploration. From $10 Million to $1.6 Million: The Value Rollercoaster The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and even high-profile figures like Donald Trump aren’t immune to its swings. Just a little over a month ago, on January 10th, the estimated value of the Donald Trump crypto wallet stood at an impressive $10 million. However, in a relatively short span of just 48 days, the wallet’s value has experienced a significant downturn, plummeting by $8.4 million to reach the current $1.6 million mark. This dramatic decrease highlights the inherent risks and fluctuations associated with investing in crypto assets . Here’s a quick look at the value fluctuation: Date Estimated Value Change January 10th $10 Million – February 27th (Approx.) $1.6 Million -$8.4 Million TROG Token: The Major Player in Trump’s Crypto Portfolio The dominance of TROG within the Trump crypto wallet raises eyebrows and prompts questions about this particular cryptocurrency. With a valuation of $877,000, TROG constitutes a significant chunk of the portfolio. Understanding TROG becomes crucial to understanding the overall dynamics of Trump’s crypto holdings. Is TROG a meme coin? Is it associated with any specific project or community? Further investigation into TROG is needed to decipher its role and potential impact on the wallet’s performance. While Arkham Intelligence’s data reveals the presence and value of TROG, more details are needed to fully understand: The origins and purpose of the TROG token. The market capitalization and trading volume of TROG. The potential risks and rewards associated with holding a significant amount of TROG. Celebrity Crypto Holdings: A Growing Trend?

40883494,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134624,1740612455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Whales’ Shocking 6,813 BTC Dump Sends Market Reeling",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whales-btc-dump/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The usually calm waters of the Bitcoin market are looking choppy. Why? Because Bitcoin whales , those colossal holders of vast amounts of BTC, have just executed a significant sell-off, sending ripples across the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just any ordinary transaction; it’s a hefty 6,813 BTC dump, the largest we’ve witnessed since July. Let’s dive deep into what this means for the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market . Why Are Bitcoin Whales Dumping BTC Now? The million-dollar question, or rather, the multi-billion dollar question, is: why now? Whale activity is often seen as a bellwether for market sentiment, and a large BTC dump like this can signal various things. Here are a few potential reasons: Profit Taking: After periods of price appreciation, even Bitcoin whales might decide to lock in profits. If they bought Bitcoin at lower prices, selling now could represent a substantial return. Market Correction Anticipation: Whales, with their vast resources and analytical capabilities, might foresee a potential market correction. Dumping a significant portion of their holdings could be a preemptive move to avoid larger losses if prices decline. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large investors often rebalance their portfolios to manage risk and optimize returns. This BTC dump could be part of a broader strategy to shift funds into other assets, whether within or outside the crypto space. External Economic Factors: Macroeconomic events, regulatory changes, or geopolitical uncertainties can influence whale behavior. These external pressures might be driving some whales to reduce their Bitcoin exposure. Decoding Whale Activity: What Does a 6,813 BTC Dump Mean? Santiment, a renowned on-chain analytics platform, highlighted this significant BTC dump , noting its correlation with Bitcoin price movements. According to their report on X, wallets holding 10+ BTC – categorized as whales and sharks – are key indicators of market direction. A decrease of 6,813 BTC from these wallets is not just a blip; it’s a substantial outflow that can impact market dynamics. Metric Data Platform Santiment Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Type Whales and Sharks (10+ BTC holdings) BTC Dump Amount 6,813 BTC Period Since last week Significance Largest decline since July Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Crypto Market Historically, significant whale activity , especially large sell-offs, has often been associated with increased market volatility and potential price drops. Here’s how this BTC dump could affect the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market : Short-Term Price Pressure: An immediate effect could be downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . A large sell order increases supply in the market, which, if demand remains constant, can lead to price depreciation. Market Sentiment Shift: Whale moves can significantly influence market sentiment. When large holders sell, it can create fear and uncertainty among other investors, potentially triggering further sell-offs and amplifying price declines across the crypto market . Volatility Spike: Expect increased volatility in the short term. The market might react sharply to this news, leading to wider price swings as traders and algorithms adjust to the changing supply dynamics. Altcoin Impact: Bitcoin’s price movements often cascade into the altcoin market. If Bitcoin experiences a significant dip due to this BTC dump , altcoins are likely to follow suit, potentially leading to a broader market correction. Navigating the Whale-Infused Crypto Market: Actionable Insights So, what should you do amidst this whale activity ? While predicting the market with certainty is impossible, here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment and follow reputable crypto news sources. Understanding whale activity and market sentiment is crucial. Manage Risk: In times of increased volatility, prudent risk management is paramount. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocation, setting stop-loss orders, or reducing leverage if you are engaged in trading. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and corrections are a natural part of its cycle. If you have a long-term investment horizon, short-term fluctuations caused by BTC dumps might present buying opportunities. Diversification: Diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can help mitigate risks associated with specific asset volatility. Consider exploring other promising cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Crypto Volatility The recent BTC dump by Bitcoin whales serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the crypto market . While it has introduced a degree of uncertainty, it also underscores the importance of staying informed, managing risk effectively, and maintaining a balanced perspective. Whale activity is just one of many factors influencing Bitcoin price , and the market’s long-term trajectory will depend on a multitude of evolving dynamics. As always, navigate these waters with caution, knowledge, and a strategic approach to thrive in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

The nation’s official press agency published a video on its YouTube page showing the Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at a press event at the construction site, laying the first foundation stone on what will one day become Pacific Airport (official name). However, bitcoiners have been dismayed to discover that the 40-minute event contained no mention of Bitcoin City – the BTC “haven” it is supposed to serve. Bitcoin City Airport – Bukele Lays Foundation Stone Bukele first announced plans to build Bitcoin City in November 2021, claiming it would become a tax-free haven for international Bitcoiners. In 2022, the President unveiled further plans to build the airport, designed by the Mexican architect Fernando Romero. However, the original airport plans date back to 2018, predating both the Bitcoin City plan and the nation’s adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender (September 2021). The Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Mexican architect Fernando Romero discuss plans to build “Bitcoin City Airport,” officially known as Pacific Airport, in 2022. Critics have slammed Bukele’s plans for the airport and Bitcoin City, claiming work had failed to begin on both projects, years after they were first announced. Bukele spoke at the event, claiming that in “phase one” of its operation, the airport would have two gates. He said the airport’s initial capacity would be 300,000 passengers per year, claiming that builders would complete “phase one” of construction by 2027. However, the government plans to expand the airport in two further “phases.” The second phase will see the number of gates increased to 10, with the final phase seeing an expansion to 18. In its final form, this will allow the airport to serve 5 million passengers per year. Bukele said that the “initial investment” cost of the project was $320 million. The President added: “This airport is not just a runway. It is a gateway for development, tourism, investment, and economic growth. In the 10 years, we expect it to generate 50,000 jobs and a per annum GDP growth rate of 1.5%.” El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at a press event for the Pacific Airport building project. (Source: Secretaría de Prensa El Salvador/YouTube/Screenshot) New Jobs Bukele added that the project would also create 10,000 “direct and indirect jobs” in its first phase. And he claimed the project would have an immediate impact on the economy. He said it would generate $300 million in revenue in its first year of operation. #AeropuertoDelPacífico | El Gobierno del Presidente @nayibbukele construirá el Aeropuerto del Pacífico en tres fases. Aquí detallamos en qué consiste cada una de ellas. #SecretaríaDePrensa pic.twitter.com/c1tmIaAht7 — Secretaría de Prensa de la Presidencia (@SecPrensaSV) February 26, 2025 However, talk of Bitcoin was conspicuously absent at the event, as was mention of the Bitcoin City project. Observers claim that whereas the government once bundled the two projects together, officials are no longer doing so. The Spanish-language media outlet Criptonoticias wrote: “[The government says that this] aeronautical project, originally announced in 2018, will be operational within two years. The event marks a concrete step towards its realization. On the other hand, the vision of Bitcoin City – presented to great fanfare in 2021 – remains shrouded in uncertainty. To date, no clear deadlines or tangible progress have been outlined for the city, which was supposedly designed for bitcoiners.” Boost for La Unión The government will build the airport in the La Unión area, near the Conchagua Volcano. The volcano, per the government’s plans, is to be the focal point of Bitcoin City. At its peak, according to the original design, will be a thermal plant that powers Bitcoin mining rigs . In late 2021, Bukele promised that Bitcoin City would not require residents to “ever” pay income tax. He also said there would be no property tax or local taxes in the city, with VAT the sole levy for residents. However, Bukele appears to have lost none of his enthusiasm for Bitcoin. Earlier this week, the country’s National Bitcoin Office paid around $94,050 per coin to buy BTC 7 for the state’s reserves .

33767162,[object Object],1740612608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Are Bitcoin ETFs Responsible For The Crash? The Hidden Truth,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-responsible-crash-hidden-truth/,"In the past two days, the Bitcoin price has tumbled more than 10%, rattling a crypto market that had seen a sustained period of relative stability. The pullback has left investors questioning the role of US spot-based Bitcoin ETFs in the downturn, as data emerges revealing significant outflows from these products. Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research, highlighted on X that ETF outflows have reached notably high levels:“Yesterday’s net outflow of 14,579 BTC in BTC ETPs globally is the largest recorded net outflow since the launch of US spot ETFs. Outflows have dominated throughout February. 69% of all trading days have concluded with net outflows.” Are Bitcoin ETFs To Blame? These figures point to a steady drumbeat of selling pressure in the ETF market. The significance, according to Lunde, is not just the single-day spike in outflows but the persistent trend throughout the month of February. However, not all market observers agree that the large outflows necessarily spell doom. Adam (@abetrade) from Trading Riot argues that dramatic ETF flows have historically preceded market corrections that eventually revert to mean behavior. He pointed out that, except for an exceptional inflow following Trump’s win on November 7th, such “big red numbers” typically trigger panic selling that sets the stage for a subsequent rebound. Adam’s view is that the current situation might be an overreaction: once the initial wave of selling subsides, the market could stabilize or even see a relief rally. This perspective is built on historical precedents where similar episodes did not lead to sustained downturns, suggesting that the prevailing sentiment could eventually turn contrarian. “Except for November 7th, when large inflows followed Trump’s win, every other occurrence of outsized inflows or outflows has been a mean-reverting signal. Generally, people see a big red number and start panic selling, or vice versa, which ends up sending the market in the opposite direction,” Adam stated. Adding further complexity to the picture is the evolving dynamics in the futures markets. Zaheer Ebtikar, Chief Investment Officer and founder of Split Capital, connects the dots between ETF outflows and futures pricing. Until recently, CME Futures were trading at nearly double the premium of conventional cryptocurrency exchanges. However, a recent correction saw the futures premium dip below 5%—a level approaching the risk-free rate. Ebtikar noted that this correction has been pivotal. As the futures premium normalized, market participants appeared to “throw in the towel” on Bitcoin ETFs, with CME Futures open interest falling to its lowest since the last election cycle. This decline in open interest, accompanied by near-record trading volumes on the CME, points to a shift in sentiment where investors are increasingly cautious about holding ETFs while still engaging in futures speculation. The interplay between a shrinking futures premium and rising futures volume creates a paradox. “In a paradoxical way, futures premium down = futures start getting bid and ETFs start dumping. The final tell here was CME Futures volume in the past couple of days reaching near record highs since the election,” Ebtikar concluded. Macro Headwinds Macroeconomic unease is also dragging on crypto and traditional markets alike. Singapore-based QCP Capital describes the situation as a “global risk-off move” affecting equities, gold, and BTC, amid growing whispers of stagflation . Consumer sentiment has taken a hit, suggested by a weaker-than-expected Consumer Confidence Index of 98 (versus 103 expected), while the US administration’s newly confirmed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports—effective March 3—have further dampened sentiment. As QCP Capital sees it, investors are growing wary of potential trade escalations and elevated inflation, which together create an atmosphere of uncertainty. The once-crowded “Magnificent 7” equity trade is unraveling, and “long crypto” has also been identified as one of the most overextended positions. In choppy markets, crypto is often the first to be liquidated, reinforcing the negative price action. Looking ahead, QCP Capital points to a pair of key events that could set the tone. The NVIDIA earnings and this week’s PCE print. Results from the chipmaker, which has ridden the wave of AI-driven demand, could trigger another leg down if guidance disappoints. The upcoming Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data is forecast at 2.5% year-over-year, still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Until inflation convincingly trends lower, the Fed is likely to keep rates steady. Markets currently price two rate cuts in 2025, the first in June or July. QCP Capital warns that markets remain fragile, advising caution as consumer and retail sentiment surveys—often leading indicators—could provide early signals of a stagflationary trajectory.

You’re not alone. Investors are digesting a mixed bag of signals as major U.S. stock market indexes concluded trading on a varied note. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broader S&P 500 managed to eke out gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average faced headwinds, closing in the red. Let’s dive into what this intriguing market behavior means for your portfolio and the broader economic landscape. Decoding the Day’s Stock Market Performance The closing bell painted a picture of nuanced performance across the primary U.S. stock market benchmarks. Here’s a quick snapshot: S&P 500: Climbed slightly by +0.02% Nasdaq Composite: Posted a moderate gain of +0.26% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Declined by -0.43% This ‘mixed’ closing suggests a market grappling with diverse forces, where certain sectors or types of stocks are experiencing positive momentum while others are under pressure. But what exactly does this mean for you as an investor? S&P 500: A Razor-Thin Gain in the Stock Market The S&P 500 index, often seen as a barometer of the overall U.S. stock market health, barely nudged into positive territory with a marginal 0.02% increase. This near-flat performance indicates a state of equilibrium, where buying and selling pressures were almost perfectly balanced across the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Is this a sign of market stability, or just a pause before the next big move? Investors are keenly watching for signals that could tip the scales. Nasdaq: Tech Sector Drives Modest Gains Outperforming its counterparts, the Nasdaq Composite Index registered a 0.26% gain. This positive performance was largely propelled by the technology sector, which continues to be a significant driver of market momentum. Are tech stocks leading the charge once again? The Nasdaq’s positive close suggests that investor confidence remains robust in growth-oriented tech companies, even amidst broader market uncertainties. This could be attributed to ongoing innovation, strong earnings in specific tech segments, or simply the sector’s perceived resilience in a fluctuating economic environment. Dow Jones: Industrial Downturn Weighs on the Index In contrast to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a notable decline of 0.43%. This downturn in the Dow, which is heavily weighted towards industrial and more traditional ‘blue-chip’ companies, could indicate weakness in these sectors. Several factors might be at play, including concerns about industrial demand, rising input costs, or sector-specific headwinds. The divergence between the Nasdaq and Dow highlights the sectoral variations within the broader stock market and underscores the importance of portfolio diversification. Critical Market Analysis: Decoding the Mixed Signals What are we to make of this mixed market performance? Here’s a breakdown of potential interpretations and actionable insights: Uncertainty Prevails: A mixed market often reflects underlying uncertainty in the economic outlook. Investors may be hesitant to commit strongly in either direction, leading to choppy trading sessions and varied index performance. Sector Rotation: The divergence between the Nasdaq and Dow could signal a sector rotation. Investors might be shifting away from traditional industrial stocks towards growth sectors like technology, or vice versa, depending on their economic outlook and risk appetite. Economic Data Dependency: Market movements are increasingly sensitive to economic data releases. Upcoming inflation reports, jobs numbers, and GDP figures could significantly sway investor sentiment and market direction. Geopolitical Factors: Global events and geopolitical developments continue to play a crucial role. Uncertainties related to international relations, trade policies, and global economic conditions can contribute to market volatility and mixed performance. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: In a mixed market, staying updated on market news, economic data, and geopolitical events is more crucial than ever. Knowledge is your best tool to navigate uncertainty. Diversify Your Portfolio: The sectoral differences highlighted today reinforce the importance of diversification. A well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk and potentially capitalize on opportunities across different market segments. Exercise Caution: Mixed signals suggest a need for caution. Avoid impulsive decisions and consider a more measured approach to investing, especially in volatile periods. Review Your Strategy: Regularly review your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, especially in light of evolving market conditions. Conclusion: Navigating the Cautious Stock Market Landscape Today’s mixed closing across major U.S. stock market indexes underscores a landscape characterized by caution and selective optimism. While the Nasdaq demonstrated tech sector strength and the S&P 500 held its ground, the Dow’s decline serves as a reminder of the varied pressures at play. For investors, this environment necessitates vigilance, informed decision-making, and a strategic approach to portfolio management. The market’s next moves will likely be dictated by upcoming economic data and evolving global dynamics. Stay tuned and stay informed to navigate these intriguing times.

The titan of GPUs, Nvidia, just dropped a bombshell, and it’s reverberating through the tech and potentially the crypto world. Nvidia’s latest Q4 earnings report is not just good; it’s phenomenal, smashing analyst expectations and signaling robust demand for its cutting-edge technology. Let’s dive into what this spectacular performance means and why it should be on your radar, especially if you’re navigating the volatile waters of the cryptocurrency market. Why Nvidia’s Q4 Earnings are a Big Deal? Numbers don’t lie, and Nvidia’s Q4 figures are screaming success. In their recent press release, the company unveiled some truly impressive financial results: Revenue Rocket: Nvidia announced a staggering Q4 revenue of $39.33 billion. This isn’t just a slight beat; it’s a significant leap past analyst estimates of $38.04 billion. Imagine exceeding expectations by nearly a billion dollars – that’s the scale of Nvidia’s triumph. Profit Powerhouse: Net income also soared, reaching $22.09 billion, comfortably surpassing the estimated $19.61 billion. This demonstrates not only strong sales but also efficient operations and healthy profit margins. These figures are more than just numbers; they represent the incredible demand for Nvidia’s products across various sectors. But what exactly is driving this explosive growth, and how does it tie into the world of crypto and tech investments? The Power of GPUs in the Crypto Market and Beyond Nvidia is synonymous with GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), and these powerful processors are the lifeblood of many industries, including: Gaming: Nvidia’s GeForce GPUs are the gold standard for gamers worldwide, delivering stunning visuals and immersive experiences.

And yes, crucially for our crypto-minded readers, GPUs play a significant role in the crypto market . While the direct impact of crypto mining on Nvidia’s revenue has fluctuated, the underlying technology and infrastructure that supports blockchain and Web3 often relies on powerful processing capabilities – areas where Nvidia excels. Furthermore, the advancements in AI, heavily reliant on GPUs, are indirectly shaping the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency through applications in data analysis, security, and more. Decoding the Q4 Revenue Surge: What’s Fueling Nvidia’s Success? Several factors are contributing to Nvidia’s remarkable Q4 revenue performance: AI Boom: The artificial intelligence revolution is in full swing, and Nvidia is at the forefront.

Monitor Crypto Market Impact (Indirect): While Nvidia’s revenue isn’t directly tied to crypto mining to the same extent as in the past, its GPUs still play a role in certain crypto applications and infrastructure. Furthermore, the broader trends driving Nvidia’s growth – AI, data centers, advanced computing – are also relevant to the evolution of blockchain and Web3 technologies. Keep an eye on how these converging trends might shape the future of the crypto market . Diversification and Long-Term Vision: Nvidia’s success story underscores the importance of diversification in your investment portfolio and focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential.

I'm Ben Schiller, managing editor at CoinDesk. In this issue: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade Goes Live Avalanche Visa card launched Ethereum Foundation executive director leaving Hackers using GitHub to steal bitcoin Network News PECTRA GOES LIVE ON TESTNET: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live on the Holesky testnet Feb. 24 but failed to finalize in the expected time. The Pectra hard fork combines together 11 major upgrades , or ""Ethereum improvement proposals"" (EIPs), into one package. At the heart of this is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user-experience of crypto wallets. The proposal, which was scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in just 22 minutes , will allow wallets to have some smart contract capabilities, as part of a broader strategy to bring account abstraction to Ethereum — a concept that makes the usability of wallets a lot less clunky. Another key proposal, EIP-7251, will allow validators to increase the maximum amount they can stake from 32 to 2,048 ETH. The proposal is supposed to ease some of the technicalities that validators who stake ETH face today: Those that stake more than their 32 ETH have to spread that across multiple validators, making the process a bit of a nuisance. By lifting the maximum stake limit and combining those validators, it could speed up the process of setting up new nodes. Holesky is the first of two testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. The next test is supposed to occur on the Sepolia testnet on Mar. 5. But according to Christine Kim, a Vice President of Research at Galaxy, developers could delay it depending on the scale of today's issue. After Pectra goes live on both testnets, developers will ink in a final date to activate the upgrade on mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . MIYAGUCHI LEAVES ETHEREUM FOUNDATION ROLE: Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi is leaving her position to transition to a new role as president at the organization. The news comes as the nonprofit goes through a leadership shake-up and as Ethereum has become less popular for new builders in recent months, with some even blaming Miyaguchi’s leadership as for why the blockchain’s token price is lagging behind other cryptocurrencies. “This new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships, and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly,” Miyaguchi wrote in a blog post published Feb. 25. The Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that supports the development of the Ethereum blockchain. Founded in 2014, Miyaguchi joined in 2018 and has been the executive director ever since. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote in a post on X that “every success of the EF - the steady execution of Ethereum hard forks, client interop workshops, Devcon, Ethereum's culture and steadfast commitment to its mission and values, and more - is in part a result of Aya's stewardship.” — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . AVALANCHE VISA CARD LAUNCHES: The Avalanche Foundation, the non-profit that helps steward the development of the Avalanche blockchain, said its much-anticipated Avalanche Card, a Visa credit card that allows users to purchase items with their cryptocurrency, is live and ready to be used. The card was developed in collaboration with Rain, a blockchain-based card issuing platform. It enables users to spend their Avalanche tokens (AVAX), wrapped AVAX, and stablecoins USDT and USDC at any store that takes Visa, the foundation said in an email. While other teams have also released credit cards tied to a user's crypto holdings, the news signals the further integration between traditional financial technologies and cryptocurrency. The Avalanche Foundation said in October that it planned to introduce the card, focusing on signing up users from Latin America and the Caribbean. According to the card’s website , the credit card will be linked to users' “new self-custody wallet and unique address per asset.” “In a move to double down on mainstream adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), Avalanche remains committed to powering accessible inroads to blockchain for every type of user,” the team said. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . HACKERS USE GITHUB TO NAB BTC: The GitHub code you use to build a trendy application or patch existing bugs might just be used to steal your bitcoin (BTC) or other crypto holdings, according to a Kaspersky report. GitHub is a popular tool among developers of all types, but even more so among crypto-focused projects, where a simple application may generate millions of dollars in revenue. The report warned users of a “GitVenom” campaign that’s been active for at least two years but is steadily on the rise, involving planting malicious code in fake projects on the popular code repository platform. The attack starts with seemingly legitimate GitHub projects — like making Telegram bots for managing bitcoin wallets or tools for computer games. Each comes with a polished README file, often AI-generated, to build trust. But the code itself is a Trojan horse: For Python-based projects, attackers hide nefarious script after a bizarre string of 2,000 tabs, which decrypts and executes a malicious payload. For JavaScript, a rogue function is embedded in the main file, triggering the launch attack. Once activated, the malware pulls additional tools from a separate hacker-controlled GitHub repository. Once the system is infected, various other programs kick in to execute the exploit. How can users protect themselves? By scrutinizing any code before running it, verifying the project’s authenticity, and being suspicious of overly polished READMEs or inconsistent commit histories. Because researchers don’t expect these attacks to stop anytime soon: “We expect these attempts to continue in the future, possibly with small changes in the TTPs,” Kaspersky said. — Shaurya Malwa Read more .

More than two years ago when Elon Musk took over Twitter, there was a lot of drama both behind the scenes and publicly. While most members of the free world jubilated, having had enough of Twitter’s censorship and use as a tool for propaganda, those who worked every day to make the platform work were worried. A fork in the road The new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, was a man who had built his brand around efficiency and who had a reputation for taking decisions and letting the chips fall where they may. Of course, they had reason to worry because when Musk took charge, he asked Twitter employees in an email with the subject line “A Fork in the Road” to either dedicate themselves to an “extremely hardcore” work environment or leave the company. Photo of Elon Musk wielding the chainsaw that Argentine president, Javier Milei gave to him at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) It’s been some time since then, and four ex-Twitter workers have just prevailed in a recent series of closed-door arbitration proceedings over claims they were illegally denied severance. This win has observers predicting Musk will be visiting courtrooms a lot in the future as the billionaire is using the same formula he used to mold Twitter into an efficient platform in his new capacity as the head of DOGE. The billionaire’s cost-cutting strategies have been thrust into the national spotlight as he takes a similar approach to reduce the federal workforce. One of his latest moves has included sending more than two million federal workers an email with the same gist as his “Fork in the Road” message. It gave those who received it the option to leave but be paid through the end of September, while warning them of an impending downsizing. Musk had the email sent as he took up his new role as key adviser to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Donald Trump. The argument of the four workers The four former Twitter employees successfully argued that they didn’t respond to the email and did not resign. Still, they were terminated, which entitled them to severance promised by the company before it came under Musk’s management. After Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion and immediately downsized by more than half the staff, former employees responded by filing complaints. The early losses for Musk in arbitration could build pressure for a settlement of similar allegations by individual workers demanding compensation of anywhere from nearly $100,000 to more than $1 million. According to what Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing former employees in arbitrations, wrote in a memo, the 20 cases she’s won so far have cost the company at least twice the amount of contested severance pay because the awards have also included interest, arbitration expenses and legal fees. The memo in question came from an unidentified former Twitter employee. In response to a request for comment, Liss-Riordan refused to discuss specifics about severance awards as the company has insisted they remain confidential. She’s reportedly representing more than 2,000 former employees who want their own pound of flesh from Musk. This time around, trade unions and Democrats are at the forefront of the litigation efforts. Is Musk going too far? Even though he is still fighting litigation from what he pulled when he took over Twitter, Musk has used a similar playbook in his DOGE gig with the Trump administration. Not only did he send federal workers the “Fork in the Road” email, Musk followed it up with an ultimatum this past weekend that demanded that they justify their positions in writing or risk dismissal. And if there was any confusion about where Trump stands on the matter, it was cleared up when the president said on Tuesday that workers who did not respond to Musk’s demands could lose their jobs. This has caused some grumbling from the general public even though a majority of them have supported DOGE’s actions and the skeletons they’ve been revealing in the government’s closet. Addressing growing discontent about the brash and aggressive actions of the Musk-led agency, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is out again doing damage control and trying to reassure the public that the end will justify the means. Photo of White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on stage at CPAC with Mercedes Schlapp, Former WH Strategic Senior Advisor for President Trump. Source: Karoline Leavitt (X/Twitter) “All of President Trump’s executive actions are lawful, constitutional, and intended to deliver on the promises he made to the American people,” Leavitt said Tuesday. “Partisan elected officials and judicial activists who seek to legally obstruct President Trump’s agenda are defying the will of 77 million Americans who overwhelmingly re-elected President Trump, and their efforts will fail.” Trump has also defended Musk’s actions, highlighting them as a legitimate bid to get rid of fraud and waste in the US government. Meanwhile, those affected by those actions like the employee unions, Democrats in Congress and even some constituents in Republican-leaning districts, have been protesting against them. The recent arbitration decisions that favored the ex-employees indicate there may be legal challenges in the future in response to Musk’s handling of layoffs and severance agreements. Twitter’s former employees talk about Musk Musk’s takeover of Twitter foreshadows what comes next for US government workers, especially those who got the boot. One former senior employee at Twitter, who worked extensively under Musk before leaving the company, told CNN the billionaire’s actions align with his “algorithm that he basically touts as his … keys to success with anything.” “[B]asically, question every requirement, assume that every requirement that anybody ever gives you is dumb. Question it, eliminate it wherever possible,” they said. “I remember him directly saying, ‘If you’re not adding things back in afterwards, then you weren’t cutting hard enough to start with.’” Two former Twitter employees who spoke on the subject asked not to be named so they could speak freely about their time at the company and avoid any potential retaliation from Musk. It reportedly only took Musk hours to fire Twitter’s top executives after taking over. Within days, he had dismissed around 3,500 employees, which was about 50% of the company’s total staff. In the end, he eliminated 80% of Twitter’s workforce, demanded everyone return to the office, and often required employees to work far more than 40 hours a week. Musk’s DOGE is making similar moves throughout government; the United States Agency for International Development is about to shut down; the Office of Personnel Management was directed to prepare to eventually cut as much as 70% of its workforce; and the General Services Administration was told to present proposals to cut 50% of business expenses, according to multiple sources in the know. Photo of American president Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Twitter executive chairman and DOGE head. Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) “Elon seems to think that he’s bought the federal government now, and he’s playing out the same series of events” as he did at Twitter, said Liss-Riordan. Federal government workers now have until Thursday to decide whether they wish to remain in their roles and accept the Trump administration’s new demands through Musk, which include being “reliable, loyal, trustworthy,” or to resign and accept a buyout paying them through September. Unfortunately, if they take the deal, there is no guarantee they will get the money because it is unclear if Trump has the authority to guarantee that.

To put it in perspective, the reported $1.4 billion loss eclipses even the infamous Mt. Gox collapse and the more recent FTX implosion. That’s a hefty sum of digital dough, making this incident one of the largest hacking incidents in the history of cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick rundown of what we know so far: The Target: Cryptocurrency exchange platform, Bybit. The Stolen Asset: A staggering $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH). The Suspected Culprit: The notorious North Korean hacker group, Lazarus. The Source of Information: Unfolded report on X, citing Coin Metrics data. Imagine the sheer scale of this operation! $1.4 billion in ETH – that’s not loose change; that’s a treasure trove of digital gold spirited away in a single heist. This Bybit hack immediately raises some critical questions. How could such a massive breach occur? And what does this mean for the crypto security landscape moving forward? Bybit Hack vs. Crypto History: How Does This Compare? When we talk about significant losses in the crypto world, names like Mt. Gox and FTX often come to mind. These were watershed moments that shook investor confidence and prompted serious discussions about regulation and security. But how does this cryptocurrency hack stack up against these infamous events? Let’s take a comparative look: Incident Estimated Loss Key Features Bybit Hack (Reported) $1.4 Billion Ethereum stolen, suspected Lazarus Group involvement, reportedly largest crypto hack. Mt. Gox Collapse (2014) Approximately $450 Million (at the time, much higher value now) Massive Bitcoin theft, led to exchange bankruptcy, significant impact on Bitcoin’s early days. FTX Implosion (2022) Estimated $8-10 Billion (various asset types) Internal mismanagement and misuse of funds, not purely a hack, but a catastrophic loss of user funds. As you can see, while FTX involved a larger sum in total assets lost due to its complex nature of mismanagement, the Bybit hack , if confirmed at $1.4 billion from a direct hack, stands out as potentially the largest *pure* hacking incident in terms of stolen value. Mt. Gox, while impactful in its time, is dwarfed by this new figure. This comparison underscores the severity and unprecedented scale of the Bybit hack . Lazarus Group: Are They Really Behind This Crypto Heist? The name “Lazarus Group” sends shivers down the spines of cybersecurity experts and crypto enthusiasts alike. This North Korean hacking collective has been implicated in numerous high-profile cyberattacks, often with financial gain as the primary motive to fund the North Korean regime. Their alleged involvement in the Bybit hack is certainly plausible, given their track record and sophistication. Why Lazarus Group? Here’s what makes them a prime suspect: History of Crypto Theft: Lazarus Group has been linked to multiple major cryptocurrency heists over the years, demonstrating their expertise in targeting crypto exchanges and wallets. Sophisticated Techniques: They are known for using advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics, making them incredibly difficult to detect and defend against. Financial Motivation: North Korea faces significant economic sanctions, and cryptocurrency theft is believed to be a key source of revenue for the regime. Previous Attacks: They have been associated with attacks on other crypto platforms and financial institutions globally. While investigations are likely still underway to definitively confirm Lazarus Group’s involvement in this crypto hack , their profile and past activities strongly suggest they could be the masterminds behind this audacious operation. If confirmed, it highlights the ongoing threat posed by state-sponsored cybercriminals to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Crypto Security: Is Enough Being Done to Protect Digital Assets? The Bybit hack is a stark reminder that even with advancements in crypto security , vulnerabilities persist. The question isn’t just about *if* exchanges can be hacked, but *when* and *how*. This incident throws a spotlight on the continuous cat-and-mouse game between cybersecurity professionals and sophisticated hacking groups. What are some critical areas in crypto security that need urgent attention? Enhanced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Beyond basic password protection, robust MFA is crucial, including hardware keys and biometric verification. Cold Storage and Secure Key Management: A significant portion of crypto assets should be held in cold storage, offline and away from potential online threats. Secure key management practices are paramount. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Exchanges must conduct frequent and thorough security audits by reputable firms and engage in penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities proactively. Advanced Threat Detection Systems: Implementing AI-powered threat detection systems to monitor network activity and identify suspicious patterns in real-time. Employee Training and Awareness: Human error is often a weak link. Comprehensive cybersecurity training for all employees is essential to prevent phishing attacks and social engineering. Decentralization and Transparency: Exploring decentralized exchange models and enhancing transparency in security practices can build greater user trust and resilience. The Bybit hack should serve as a wake-up call for the entire crypto industry to double down on crypto security measures and continuously innovate to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Moving Forward: Actionable Insights After the Bybit Crypto Hack So, what can be learned from this devastating Bybit hack , and what actionable steps can be taken by exchanges, users, and the broader crypto community?

40883950,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134654,1740613172,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Solid Bitcoin Support at $70K Fuels Optimistic Price Rally Prediction to $110K,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-solid-support-price-rally/,"Bitcoin enthusiasts, are you ready for the next potential surge? Amidst fluctuating global markets, a prominent crypto strategist is pointing towards a critical zone for Bitcoin that could set the stage for a significant price rally. Let’s dive into why the $70,000–$75,000 range is being touted as a robust foundation for Bitcoin and what this means for its future trajectory. Decoding Bitcoin Support Levels: The $70K–$75K Fortress According to Blockworks, Joel Kruger, a seasoned crypto strategist at LMAX Group, has identified a compelling Bitcoin support level between $70,000 and $75,000. This isn’t just arbitrary speculation; it’s a technical analysis-backed observation suggesting that Bitcoin has built a strong base within this price range. But what exactly makes this zone so significant? Historical Price Action: Previous price movements likely consolidated around this level, indicating buyer interest and resistance to further downward pressure. Technical Indicators: Various technical analysis tools may align to confirm this zone as a key area where buying demand outweighs selling pressure. Market Sentiment: Investor behavior and overall market confidence around Bitcoin at these levels contribute to the strength of this support. Kruger’s analysis suggests that this robust Bitcoin support level isn’t just a temporary floor; it’s a launchpad for potential upward momentum. Think of it as a solid foundation upon which Bitcoin can build its next ascent. Is a Price Rally to $110K on the Horizon? The million-dollar question – or should we say, the $110,000 question – is whether this support level can indeed propel Bitcoin to new heights. Kruger believes so, suggesting that a price rally past $110,000 is a distinct possibility. This optimistic outlook is underpinned by several factors: Factor Explanation Bitcoin as Store of Value In times of economic uncertainty and traditional market volatility, Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold or store of value becomes increasingly attractive. Portfolio Diversification Investors looking to diversify their portfolios away from traditional assets may turn to Bitcoin, especially amid concerns over global trade tensions and hawkish monetary policies. Institutional Adoption Continued institutional interest and adoption of Bitcoin further legitimize it as an asset class and drive demand. While traditional markets might be experiencing headwinds due to global economic factors, Bitcoin’s unique value proposition could act as a tailwind, fueling this potential price rally . Why Bitcoin’s Store of Value Narrative Matters Now More Than Ever In a world grappling with economic uncertainties, the narrative of Bitcoin as a ‘store of value’ gains significant traction. But what does this really mean, and why is it so crucial for Bitcoin’s price trajectory? Hedge Against Inflation: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin has a limited supply, making it a potential hedge against inflation. As traditional currencies potentially lose purchasing power, Bitcoin’s scarcity becomes increasingly appealing. Safe Haven Asset: In times of geopolitical instability or economic downturns, investors often seek safe haven assets. Bitcoin is increasingly being considered as a digital safe haven, similar to gold. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust security features offer an alternative to traditional financial systems, attracting individuals seeking greater control and security over their assets. This ‘store of value’ narrative is not just theoretical; it directly influences demand. As more investors recognize and embrace Bitcoin’s role in preserving wealth, the demand for Bitcoin increases, potentially driving up its price and contributing to the predicted price rally . Navigating Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s Role in Portfolio Diversification The current global economic landscape is marked by volatility. Trade tensions, shifts in central bank policies, and geopolitical events are creating uncertainty in traditional markets. In such an environment, portfolio diversification becomes paramount. How does Bitcoin fit into this picture? Low Correlation with Traditional Assets: Bitcoin has historically shown a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This means that Bitcoin’s price movements are often independent of traditional market fluctuations, making it an effective diversification tool. Risk Mitigation: By including Bitcoin in a portfolio, investors can potentially mitigate overall portfolio risk. When traditional assets underperform, Bitcoin may act as a counterbalance, cushioning potential losses. Enhanced Returns: While diversification aims to reduce risk, it can also enhance returns. Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can boost overall portfolio performance, especially when traditional markets are stagnant or declining. For investors seeking to navigate the choppy waters of today’s markets, Bitcoin offers a compelling option for diversification, potentially enhancing portfolio stability and returns. This increased adoption for diversification purposes further strengthens the bullish case for Bitcoin and its potential to reach the predicted price rally targets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this analysis, and how can you leverage this information? Monitor Support Levels: Keep a close eye on the $70,000–$75,000 Bitcoin support level . A sustained hold above this zone could signal further upward momentum. Stay Informed on Market Dynamics: Be aware of global economic factors, traditional market trends, and regulatory developments that could influence Bitcoin’s price. Consider Portfolio Allocation: If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and diversification benefits, consider strategically allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin, keeping risk tolerance in mind. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Always conduct thorough research and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. This analysis provides insights, but it’s not financial advice. The crypto market is dynamic and fast-paced. Staying informed, understanding key technical levels like Bitcoin support levels , and considering Bitcoin’s broader role in the financial landscape are crucial for navigating this exciting asset class. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Resilient Foundation and Future Potential In conclusion, the analysis highlighting the $70,000–$75,000 zone as a strong Bitcoin support level paints an optimistic picture for the cryptocurrency’s near future. While global market uncertainties persist, Bitcoin’s inherent strengths as a store of value and a diversification tool could very well propel it towards – and potentially beyond – the $110,000 mark.

40883951,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134655,1740613252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Astonishing Bitcoin Exchange Outflows: 8,826 BTC Withdrawn in One Hour – Bullish Sign?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/astonishing-bitcoin-exchange-outflows/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The Bitcoin market just witnessed a truly astonishing event. In a single hour, a staggering 8,826.43 Bitcoin (BTC) were withdrawn from major cryptocurrency exchanges. This significant Bitcoin withdrawal is turning heads and sparking conversations across the crypto sphere. What does this massive movement of Bitcoin mean for the future of the market? Let’s dive deep into the details. What’s Behind This Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal? According to data from CryptoQuant, a leading cryptocurrency analytics platform, a substantial amount of Bitcoin has left centralized exchanges in the last 60 minutes. Specifically, CryptoQuant reported that: Bitfinex saw an outflow of 5,425 BTC. Coinbase Advanced experienced a withdrawal of 1,118 BTC. Binance recorded 971 BTC in outflows. These are not small numbers. Such a large and rapid Bitcoin withdrawal suggests a significant shift in investor sentiment or strategy. CryptoQuant suggests that these withdrawals, particularly from exchanges that do not offer custody or OTC (Over-the-Counter) trading services, could indicate new wallet transfers. But what does that actually mean? Decoding the Exchange Outflows: New Wallets or Something More? When we talk about exchange outflows , it essentially means Bitcoin is moving off of exchanges and likely into private wallets. This is often interpreted as a bullish signal because: Reduced Selling Pressure: Bitcoin held on exchanges is readily available for selling. When large amounts are withdrawn, it reduces the immediate supply available for trade, potentially decreasing selling pressure and supporting price appreciation. Long-Term Holding: Moving Bitcoin to personal wallets often signifies a long-term holding strategy. Investors may be less inclined to sell if their Bitcoin is securely stored offline, indicating confidence in future price increases. Institutional Accumulation?: Large exchange outflows could be a sign of institutional investors accumulating Bitcoin for their treasuries or long-term investment portfolios. Institutions often prefer to hold their assets in secure, non-custodial solutions. However, it’s crucial to consider alternative explanations. While CryptoQuant suggests “new wallet transfers,” we should also ponder: OTC Deals: While mentioned as less likely by CryptoQuant for these specific exchanges, large withdrawals can sometimes be related to Over-the-Counter (OTC) deals where large blocks of Bitcoin are traded privately, and then withdrawn from exchanges. Custodial Solutions: Although CryptoQuant notes exchanges not supporting custody, it’s possible some withdrawals are related to movements to different custodial solutions, though this might be less likely to occur in such a short timeframe. Impact on the Crypto Market: Is This a Bullish Signal? The immediate impact of such significant exchange outflows on the crypto market is often perceived as positive. Why? Because it hints at reduced supply and potentially increased scarcity. Think of it like this: If demand remains constant or increases while the readily available supply on exchanges decreases, basic economics suggests prices could rise. This Bitcoin withdrawal event could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s future, signaling that large holders are choosing to store their BTC rather than trade it actively on exchanges. However, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, and no single event guarantees a specific outcome. Other factors also play a crucial role, including: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic factors, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events can all influence crypto prices. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in regulations concerning cryptocurrencies can have a significant impact on market sentiment and price action. Overall Market Sentiment: General investor mood, fear and greed levels, and media narratives can drive short-term price fluctuations. BTC Transfers: Understanding the Movement of Bitcoin Understanding BTC transfers is key to interpreting on-chain data like these exchange outflows . When we see large BTC transfers off exchanges, it’s essential to ask: Who is moving the Bitcoin? Is it retail investors, whales (large holders), institutions, or exchanges themselves rebalancing their reserves? Where is the Bitcoin going? Is it moving to known custodial wallets, cold storage, or unknown addresses? What is the likely motivation? Is it accumulation, long-term storage, participation in DeFi (Decentralized Finance), or something else entirely? Analyzing BTC transfers in conjunction with other on-chain metrics and market indicators can provide a more comprehensive picture of market dynamics. Are Institutional Investors Fueling the Bitcoin Outflow? The potential involvement of institutional investors in these exchange outflows is a hot topic. Institutions are increasingly entering the crypto space, and their investment strategies can significantly impact the market. If institutions are indeed behind these large withdrawals, it could signify: Growing Institutional Adoption: Large Bitcoin withdrawal events could be further evidence of increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Long-Term Investment Horizon: Institutions typically have a longer investment horizon than retail traders. Their accumulation of Bitcoin for long-term holding could contribute to sustained price appreciation over time. Market Maturation: Increased institutional participation often signals a maturing market, bringing more stability and potentially reducing volatility in the long run (though short-term volatility can still be significant). However, definitively attributing these outflows to institutional investors requires more data and analysis. Following on-chain movements and tracking institutional announcements and filings can provide further clues. Conclusion: A Significant Event, But Context is Key The astonishing Bitcoin withdrawal of 8,826.43 BTC from exchanges in just one hour is undoubtedly a significant event. It suggests a potential shift in supply dynamics and could be interpreted as a bullish signal for the crypto market . Whether it’s driven by institutional investors , whales moving funds to new wallets, or a combination of factors, it warrants close attention. However, remember that the crypto market is complex and influenced by numerous variables. While this Bitcoin withdrawal is noteworthy, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Always consider the broader market context, macroeconomic factors, and your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions based on a single event.

40884072,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134662,1740613399,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: Justin Sun SEC Case Nears Potential Resolution – What it Means for Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/justin-sun-sec-case-settlement/,"The crypto world is buzzing with news that could potentially alter the landscape of digital asset regulation. According to a recent report from Solid Intel on X, Justin Sun, the influential founder of Tron (TRX), is reportedly exploring a settlement in his ongoing civil fraud case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This urgent development could signal a significant shift in how regulatory bodies approach cryptocurrency projects and their leaders. But what exactly does this mean for Justin Sun, Tron holders, and the broader crypto ecosystem? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. Justin Sun SEC Case: Unpacking the Allegations In March 2023, the SEC dropped a bombshell lawsuit against Justin Sun, accusing him of a range of serious violations. The charges are multifaceted and strike at the heart of regulatory concerns within the cryptocurrency space. The SEC’s accusations against the Tron Founder include: Selling Unregistered Securities: The core of the SEC’s argument revolves around the allegation that TRX tokens and BitTorrent (BTT) tokens were offered and sold as unregistered securities. Under U.S. law, securities must be registered with the SEC unless they qualify for an exemption. The SEC claims that Sun and his entities failed to register these tokens, thus violating securities laws. Fraudulent Scheme: Beyond unregistered securities, the SEC alleges that Sun engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the secondary market for TRX. This involves accusations of wash trading, where the same individual or entity acts as both the buyer and seller to create artificial trading volume and inflate the perceived demand for TRX. Market Manipulation: The SEC further contends that Sun orchestrated a manipulative scheme to artificially inflate the trading volume of TRX. This alleged manipulation was intended to create a false impression of active trading and investor interest in TRX, potentially misleading other investors. Airdrops as Unregistered Securities: Adding another layer to the complexity, the SEC also classified airdrops of TRX and BTT as unregistered securities offerings. Airdrops, typically used for marketing and distribution, are being scrutinized under the lens of securities regulations, raising significant questions for future token distribution models. These are serious accusations that have cast a shadow over Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem. The potential TRX Settlement now being explored could represent a crucial turning point in this legal battle. TRX Settlement on the Horizon: What Could Resolution Look Like? News of a potential settlement brings a glimmer of hope for a resolution to this protracted legal saga. While the specifics of any potential TRX Settlement remain undisclosed, settlements in SEC cases often involve several components: Settlement Component Potential Implications for Justin Sun & Tron Financial Penalties (Fines & Disgorgement) Substantial fines and disgorgement (returning ill-gotten gains) are common. This could impact Tron’s treasury and Sun’s personal finances. Cease-and-Desist Orders An order to halt specific activities deemed unlawful. This might involve changes to how Tron operates, particularly regarding token sales and marketing. Undertakings & Compliance Measures Agreements to implement specific compliance measures to prevent future violations. This could include enhanced reporting, oversight, or changes to governance structures. Admission of Guilt (Varying Degrees) Settlements can range from admitting no guilt to admitting certain facts or agreeing to findings without admitting or denying the allegations. The level of admission can significantly impact public perception and future legal implications. For Tron holders, a settlement could bring a sense of clarity and reduce the uncertainty surrounding TRX. However, the terms of the settlement will be crucial. Large financial penalties could indirectly impact the Tron ecosystem, while required compliance measures might alter future operations. Conversely, a settlement could be viewed positively, removing a major legal overhang and potentially boosting investor confidence in TRX. Crypto Regulation and the SEC Lawsuit: A Broader Industry Perspective The SEC Lawsuit against Justin Sun is not an isolated incident. It’s part of a broader trend of increased regulatory scrutiny on the cryptocurrency industry. The SEC has been actively asserting its jurisdiction over digital assets, particularly those it deems to be securities. This case, along with others, highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the crypto space and the need for regulatory oversight to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Key aspects of the broader Crypto Regulation landscape illustrated by this case include: Securities Classification: The SEC’s stance on classifying many cryptocurrencies as securities remains a contentious issue. The Howey Test, used to determine if an asset is an investment contract and thus a security, is being applied to digital assets, often leading to debates and legal challenges. Enforcement Actions: The SEC is increasingly using enforcement actions, like the lawsuit against Justin Sun, to signal its regulatory boundaries and deter non-compliance. These actions can have significant repercussions for crypto projects and the market as a whole. International Regulatory Coordination: Crypto regulation is not just a U.S. issue. Global coordination among regulatory bodies is becoming more important as crypto markets are inherently international. The outcome of the Justin Sun case could have ripple effects on international regulatory approaches. The Need for Clarity: Many in the crypto industry call for clearer regulatory guidelines. The ambiguity surrounding regulations can stifle innovation and create uncertainty. Cases like this underscore the urgency for more defined rules of the road for crypto businesses to operate within legal frameworks. Tron Founder’s Response and Potential Defense Strategies While Justin Sun has maintained a public profile and continued to be active in the crypto space throughout the SEC investigation, his direct legal defense strategies have been less publicly discussed. However, in similar cases, potential defense arguments often revolve around: Token Utility vs. Investment Contract: Arguing that TRX and BTT tokens primarily serve utility purposes within the Tron network and are not solely investment contracts. This challenges the SEC’s classification of these tokens as securities. Lack of Intent to Defraud: Contesting the allegations of fraud and market manipulation by arguing that any trading activity was not intentionally manipulative or fraudulent. This requires demonstrating a lack of malicious intent and potentially presenting alternative explanations for the trading patterns the SEC flagged. Due Process and Fair Notice: Raising concerns about due process and whether sufficient notice was given regarding the SEC’s evolving interpretation of securities laws in the context of cryptocurrencies. This argument often centers on the novelty of crypto assets and the lack of clear, pre-existing regulations. A settlement could indicate a strategic decision by Justin Sun to avoid a potentially lengthy and costly legal battle, regardless of the strength of his potential defenses. Settlements often represent a compromise, allowing both sides to mitigate risks and move forward. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Key Takeaways for the Industry The Justin Sun SEC Case and the potential TRX Settlement offer valuable lessons for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Legal Compliance: Crypto projects must prioritize legal compliance from the outset. This includes seeking legal counsel early, understanding securities laws, and implementing robust compliance programs. Transparency and Disclosure: Increased transparency and clear disclosures about token sales, tokenomics, and project operations are crucial for building trust with investors and regulators. Engage with Regulators: Proactive engagement with regulatory bodies can be beneficial. Open communication and a willingness to address regulatory concerns can foster a more constructive dialogue and potentially mitigate future enforcement actions. Decentralization and Governance: Projects should consider robust decentralization and governance models to reduce reliance on central figures and potentially mitigate regulatory risks associated with centralized control. Monitor Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. Staying informed about the latest regulatory developments, both in the U.S. and globally, is essential for navigating this complex environment. Conclusion: A Developing Story with Far-Reaching Implications The potential settlement in the Justin Sun SEC case is a developing story with potentially far-reaching implications for Justin Sun, Tron, and the broader cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the increasing regulatory scrutiny on digital assets and the urgent need for clarity and compliance within the crypto space.

According to Saylor, Bitcoin is an open protocol for enhancing personal freedom and expanding free markets through networks. The endorsement is particularly taking place against the backdrop of economic policies and financial independence. Saylor, a well-known supporter of Bitcoin, argues that the asset offers an environment that can replace traditional finance systems. He speaks this at a time when there is a push for digital currencies that would enhance a country’s monetary independence. Bitcoin is the best way to promote personal liberties and free markets. It offers an open protocol for prosperity that can be delivered to everyone via digital technology. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) February 26, 2025 Bezos’ controversy over editorial policy Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, recently changed the policy for the paper’s opinion section. According to the new policy, only content that promotes free markets and individual freedoms will be allowed. David Shipley, who is the editor responsible for the opinion page, tendered his resignation regarding the change. Bezos supported the policy, arguing that free markets and liberties for its people are good for the country. He also noted that the internet offers enough outlets for opposition opinions and implied that the subject is selected on purpose. Although Bezos’ decision became a subject of debate, certain industry analysts argue that he is not alone in this, as media outlet owners have always influenced their outlets’ editorial policies. Some people state that, in large measure, private ownership enables editorial freedom, though this may lead to perceptible bias. Bitcoin adoption among public companies surges At the same time, the number of operating companies that have adopted Bitcoin in their investment plans is rapidly growing. According to Cryptopolitan, the acquisition of BTC by public corporations increased to 139% in 2023. It is also important to mention that Bitcoin has not taken more than 1 % of the country’s Treasury. Bitcoin was compared to the Internet, and it remains undiscovered as far as its use in saving and payment systems is concerned. The report also explained that companies have been acquiring over 1000 BTC per day since January 2024. Also, 80% of the publicly listed firms made an investment in Bitcoin last year. Bitcoin’s price has now dipped to 83,500, the lowest level it has been at since November 2024. The cryptocurrency has dropped by $12,820 in the last three trading days, leading to over $1 billion in leveraged long liquidations, as per CoinGlass. The price drop comes just when it attained an all-time high above $108,000 less than one month ago. Currently, BTC’s value has been reduced from its high by 23%.

According to recent reports from Aggr News, this closure comes without any enforcement action, marking a potentially significant moment for Gemini and the broader landscape of crypto regulation . Are we witnessing a shift in regulatory approaches, or is this a unique case for Gemini? Let’s dive into what this means for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, and industry observer. Decoding the SEC Investigation Gemini Closure: What Happened? For those following the intricate world of digital assets, regulatory scrutiny is no stranger. The SEC’s investigation into Gemini SEC , a well-known cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, has been a point of concern and speculation. The exact details of the investigation were never fully public, adding to the uncertainty. However, the outcome is now clear: the SEC has decided to close the case without pursuing any charges or regulatory action against Gemini. This is a crucial development because: No Enforcement Action: The most immediate takeaway is that Gemini has avoided potential penalties, fines, or restrictions that could have arisen from SEC enforcement. Validation for Gemini: The closure can be interpreted as a form of implicit validation for Gemini’s operations and compliance measures, at least in the context of this particular investigation. Broader Market Sentiment: Such news can positively influence market sentiment, suggesting that not all regulatory engagements necessarily lead to negative outcomes for crypto platforms. To put this into perspective, consider the table below comparing potential outcomes of SEC investigations: Outcome Impact on Company Market Perception Enforcement Action (Fines, Restrictions) Financial penalties, operational limitations, reputational damage Negative, potential market downturn for the company and sector Investigation Closure (No Action) Avoidance of penalties, affirmation of compliance (in this instance) Positive, potential market boost for the company and sector Why is the SEC Investigation into Gemini Significant for Crypto Regulation? The SEC’s decision regarding the SEC investigation Gemini isn’t just about one exchange; it carries broader implications for the entire crypto regulation landscape. Here’s why this closure is being closely watched: Precedent Setting? While each case is unique, decisions from regulatory bodies like the SEC can set precedents or at least provide signals about their current stance. The lack of action in this instance might be interpreted by some as a less aggressive approach, although it’s crucial not to overgeneralize. Clarity (or Lack Thereof): The crypto industry has long sought clearer regulatory guidelines. While this specific closure provides relief, it doesn’t inherently offer broad clarity on SEC’s overall approach to digital asset regulation. The industry still awaits comprehensive frameworks. Investor Confidence: News like this can subtly boost investor confidence. It suggests that established players in the crypto space can navigate regulatory scrutiny and emerge without major repercussions, fostering a sense of stability. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”Gemini SEC Investigation Closure”] What Does This Mean for Gemini and Other Crypto Exchanges? For Gemini SEC , this news is undoubtedly a victory. It allows them to move forward without the shadow of an ongoing investigation, potentially strengthening their position in the competitive cryptocurrency exchange market. But what about other exchanges? Benchmarking Compliance: Other exchanges will likely scrutinize this case to understand what might have contributed to the SEC’s decision. Was it Gemini’s compliance protocols, their engagement with regulators, or other factors? It serves as an informal benchmark. Continued Vigilance: Despite this positive outcome for Gemini, no crypto exchange can afford to become complacent. Regulatory scrutiny remains a constant in the industry, and proactive compliance is paramount. Market Competition: A relieved Gemini can now focus more intently on growth and innovation, potentially intensifying competition among crypto exchanges.

Bybit concluded from the review that ""the credentials of a Safe developer were compromised,"" which allowed the Lazarus hacking group to gain unauthorized access to the Safe wallet and subsequently deceive Bybit staff into signing the malicious transaction. However, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that despite the wallet's infrastructure being compromised by social engineering, the hack would not have been possible had Bybit not ""blind signed"" the transaction. The term refers to a mechanism where a smart contract transaction is approved without comprehensive knowledge of its contents. Safe also issued a statement saying that ""Safe smart contracts [were] unaffected, an attack was conducted by compromising a Safe {Wallet} developer machine which affected an account operated by Bybit."" It also pointed out that a ""forensic review of external security researchers did NOT indicate any vulnerabilities in the Safe smart contracts or source code of the frontend and services."" The apparent back and forth between both companies mirrors that of WazirX and Liminal Custody, which blamed each other following a $230 million exploit last July. On-chain data analyzed by ZachXBT shows that Lazarus is attempting to launder the stolen funds, with 920 wallets currently being tainted with the ill-gotten gains. The funds, perhaps inadvertently, have been commingled with stolen funds from hacks targeting Phemex and Poloniex, linking Lazarus Group to all three.Read more: Bybit Declares ‘War on Lazarus’ as It Crowdsources Effort to Freeze Stolen Funds",Finance|Lazarus group|Hack|Bybit,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-26 23:46:39

The future of Bitcoin mining post-2028 halving is looking less like a gold rush and more like an energy crunch. Mara Holdings (MARA), previously known as Marathon Digital, has sounded the alarm, and it’s a wake-up call the crypto world needs to hear. Are you ready to navigate the turbulent waters ahead for Bitcoin miners ? The Looming Shadow of Bitcoin Halving: What’s the Fuss? For those new to the crypto game, let’s quickly break down what a Bitcoin halving is and why it’s such a big deal. In simple terms, a Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that happens roughly every four years where the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is cut in half. This is designed to control the supply of Bitcoin, making it scarcer over time, mimicking precious metals like gold. Think of it as digital gold becoming even more digitally scarce! Historically, halvings have been associated with price surges, driven by this reduced supply and increased scarcity narrative. However, Mara Holdings is pointing towards a less discussed, but equally critical consequence – the impact on energy costs for miners. While everyone’s been focused on price predictions, are we overlooking the practicalities of keeping the Bitcoin network running? Energy Costs: The Achilles’ Heel for Bitcoin Miners? Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process. Massive server farms, humming 24/7, are needed to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This requires significant electricity consumption, and for many miners, especially those relying on older, less efficient equipment, energy costs are already a major operational expense. Mara Holdings highlights a critical point: most miners are still plugged into the traditional power grid. This means they are subject to fluctuating energy prices, and as demand for electricity grows globally, these prices are unlikely to decrease. Post-halving, when mining rewards are slashed, the equation changes drastically. Miners will need to be significantly more efficient to remain profitable. Imagine running a business where your revenue is automatically cut in half every four years – you’d need a solid strategy to survive, right? Mara Holdings’ Stark Warning: Adapt or Perish Mara Holdings, a significant player in the Bitcoin mining space, isn’t just speculating; they’re sharing insights from the front lines. Their shareholder letter, as reported by CoinDesk, isn’t sugarcoating the situation. They explicitly state that many miners, especially those who fail to adapt, may not survive the rising energy costs after the 2028 halving. This isn’t just about profitability; it’s about survival in a rapidly evolving and competitive landscape. The core message from Mara Holdings is clear: differentiation and diversification are no longer optional – they are essential. Miners who simply operate as ‘price takers,’ passively accepting market conditions, will likely struggle. This calls for a proactive and strategic approach. What exactly does this proactive approach entail? Strategies for Bitcoin Mining Survival: Beyond Price Speculation So, how can Bitcoin miners navigate this impending energy cost crisis and thrive beyond the 2028 halving? Here are some key strategies to consider: Embrace Renewable Energy: This is perhaps the most crucial step. Miners need to aggressively transition towards renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power. Not only is this environmentally responsible, but it also offers a pathway to more stable and potentially cheaper energy costs in the long run. Imagine powering your mining operations with sunshine – a truly decentralized and sustainable approach! Improve Mining Efficiency: Investing in the latest generation of mining hardware is paramount. Newer ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are significantly more energy-efficient than older models. Upgrading equipment can dramatically reduce the energy consumed per Bitcoin mined, directly impacting profitability. It’s like upgrading from a gas-guzzling car to a fuel-efficient hybrid. Diversify Revenue Streams: Relying solely on Bitcoin mining rewards might become increasingly risky. Miners should explore diversifying their revenue streams. This could include: Offering hosting services for other miners. Participating in transaction fee markets. Exploring opportunities in adjacent sectors like AI and high-performance computing, which can leverage similar infrastructure. Strategic Location Selection: Location, location, location! Miners need to strategically choose locations with access to affordable energy, favorable regulatory environments, and potentially cooler climates to reduce cooling costs. Think of regions with abundant renewable energy resources or those offering incentives for green energy adoption. Hedging and Risk Management: Implementing robust hedging strategies to mitigate price volatility and energy cost fluctuations is crucial. This can involve using derivatives markets and securing long-term energy contracts. Diversification: The Crypto Mining Game Changer? Mara Holdings’ emphasis on diversification isn’t just about surviving the halving; it’s about future-proofing the crypto mining industry. The crypto landscape is rapidly evolving, and miners need to adapt to remain relevant and profitable. Diversification can take many forms, from exploring different cryptocurrencies to mine (although Bitcoin remains dominant) to venturing into related tech sectors. The core idea is to move beyond being solely reliant on Bitcoin price fluctuations and mining rewards. By diversifying, miners can create more resilient and sustainable businesses, capable of weathering market volatility and adapting to technological advancements. It’s about building a broader foundation for long-term success in the dynamic world of crypto. The Road Ahead: Navigating the Post-Halving Landscape The message from Mara Holdings is clear and compelling: the Bitcoin halving in 2028 and beyond will present significant challenges for miners, primarily driven by rising energy costs. However, these challenges are not insurmountable. By embracing innovation, prioritizing efficiency, diversifying revenue streams, and adopting sustainable practices, Bitcoin miners can not only survive but thrive in the evolving crypto ecosystem. The future of Bitcoin mining hinges on proactive adaptation and strategic foresight. Those who heed the warning and take decisive action will be best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. The energy crisis isn’t just a threat; it’s a catalyst for innovation and a push towards a more sustainable and resilient Bitcoin network.

40884318,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134677,1740613802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: Sen. Lummis Champions Landmark Crypto Regulation with FIT21 and GENIUS Act,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lummis-champions-crypto-regulation/,"In a powerful move that could redefine the future of digital assets in the United States, Senator Cynthia Lummis has stepped into the spotlight, urging immediate action on two groundbreaking pieces of legislation: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and the Stablecoin Act, also known as the GENIUS Act. For anyone invested in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, this is a pivotal moment. Let’s dive into what these bills mean and why Senator Lummis’s advocacy is making waves in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation . Why is Senator Lummis Pushing for Crypto Regulation Now? Senator Lummis, a well-known advocate for responsible innovation in the digital asset space, has consistently emphasized the need for clear and concise rules to govern the cryptocurrency market. Her recent call to action during a congressional hearing underscores the growing bipartisan consensus that the U.S. needs to establish a robust framework for crypto regulation to foster growth while protecting consumers and investors. The urgency stems from several factors: Investor Protection: The current lack of clarity leaves investors vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation. Clear regulations can provide a safety net and boost confidence in the market. Innovation and Growth: Ambiguity stifles innovation. A well-defined regulatory landscape can encourage businesses to build and innovate within the crypto space in the U.S., rather than moving overseas. Global Competitiveness: Other countries are actively developing their crypto regulations. The U.S. risks falling behind if it doesn’t establish its own framework, potentially losing out on economic opportunities. Market Stability: Unregulated markets can be volatile. Clear rules can contribute to a more stable and predictable crypto environment. Senator Lummis believes that FIT21 and the GENIUS Act are crucial steps towards achieving these goals. Let’s break down each bill to understand their individual significance. Decoding the FIT21 Act: A New Dawn for Crypto Classification? The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21 Act , is arguably the more comprehensive of the two bills. Its primary aim is to provide much-needed clarity on how cryptocurrencies should be classified under U.S. law. Currently, the debate often revolves around whether a cryptocurrency should be considered a security or a commodity. This distinction is critical because it determines which regulatory agency—the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)—has jurisdiction. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what the FIT21 Act proposes: Key Feature Description Primary Classification Classifies most cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities. Regulatory Agency Grants the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) primary regulatory authority over crypto commodities. Decentralization Focus Emphasizes the degree of decentralization of a cryptocurrency network in determining its classification. More decentralized networks are more likely to be considered commodities. Clarity for Businesses Aims to provide a clear legal framework for crypto businesses to operate within, reducing uncertainty and encouraging compliance. By classifying cryptocurrencies as commodities, the FIT21 Act seeks to recognize the unique nature of these digital assets and apply a regulatory approach that is more suited to their decentralized and transactional characteristics. This move could potentially unlock significant innovation and investment in the crypto space, as it provides a more predictable and less burdensome regulatory path compared to being classified as securities. The GENIUS Act: Taming the Wild West of Stablecoins? The Stablecoin Act, or GENIUS Act (though it’s officially known by a longer, more formal title), zeroes in on stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins have become increasingly important in the crypto ecosystem, serving as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. However, their rapid growth has also raised concerns about their stability, reserves, and potential risks to the financial system. The GENIUS Act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins. Here’s what it entails: Federal Oversight: Proposes federal oversight of stablecoin issuers, likely under a banking regulator or a newly designated agency. Reserve Requirements: Seeks to mandate that stablecoin issuers hold adequate reserves to back their stablecoins, ensuring that they can maintain their peg and meet redemption requests. Transparency and Auditing: Aims to increase transparency by requiring regular audits and public disclosure of stablecoin reserves and operations. Consumer Protection: Focuses on protecting consumers by ensuring stablecoin stability and providing recourse in case of issuer failure. The GENIUS Act is particularly timely given the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market and the potential systemic risks associated with these assets. By establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuers, the legislation aims to foster trust and stability in this critical segment of the crypto market, paving the way for broader adoption and integration with the traditional financial system. Bipartisan Support: A Ray of Hope for Crypto Legislation? One of the most encouraging aspects of the push for FIT21 and the GENIUS Act is the bipartisan support it’s garnering. As The Block reported, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are recognizing the need to advance stablecoin legislation and broader crypto regulation in the new Congress. This bipartisan momentum is crucial because it increases the likelihood of these bills moving forward and eventually becoming law. In a politically polarized environment, finding common ground on complex issues like crypto regulation is a significant achievement and signals a growing understanding of the importance of this sector. Why is bipartisan support so vital? Increased Probability of Passage: Bipartisan bills have a much higher chance of passing through both houses of Congress and being signed into law by the President. Political Stability: Bipartisan support ensures that crypto regulation is less likely to be drastically altered with changes in political power, providing long-term stability for the industry. Broader Acceptance: Bipartisan consensus can help build public trust and acceptance of crypto assets by demonstrating that regulation is not a partisan issue but a matter of national economic and technological importance. Senator Lummis’s call for action is therefore not just a voice from one side of the political spectrum but represents a growing consensus that spans party lines. This unified front significantly strengthens the prospects for meaningful crypto regulation in the U.S. What are the Potential Benefits of FIT21 and the GENIUS Act? If FIT21 and the GENIUS Act are successfully passed and implemented, the potential benefits for the crypto industry and the broader U.S. economy are substantial: Clarity and Certainty: The most immediate benefit is the clarity these bills would provide. Businesses and investors would have a much clearer understanding of the rules of the game, reducing legal and regulatory uncertainty. Attracting Investment: Clear regulations can attract significant investment into the crypto space. Institutional investors, in particular, are more likely to enter the market when there is a well-defined regulatory framework. Fostering Innovation: By providing a predictable regulatory environment, these bills can encourage innovation in crypto technologies and applications. Businesses can focus on building and growing without constant fear of regulatory crackdowns. Consumer Protection: Both bills prioritize consumer protection, whether through stablecoin reserve requirements or clearer rules for crypto exchanges and service providers. This can enhance trust and confidence in the market. Global Leadership: By establishing a comprehensive and forward-looking regulatory framework, the U.S. can reassert its leadership in financial innovation and technology, attracting crypto businesses and talent from around the world. These benefits are not just theoretical. Countries that have already implemented clear crypto regulations, like some in Europe and Asia, are seeing increased investment and innovation in their digital asset sectors. The U.S. has the potential to unlock similar growth by embracing sensible and forward-thinking crypto regulation . Challenges and the Road Ahead While the momentum behind FIT21 and the GENIUS Act is encouraging, the path to passage is not without its challenges. Here are some hurdles that need to be overcome: Regulatory Turf Wars: There may be ongoing debates and negotiations between different regulatory agencies (SEC, CFTC, banking regulators) regarding their respective roles and jurisdictions under these new laws. Lobbying and Opposition: Incumbent financial institutions and other interest groups may lobby against certain aspects of these bills, seeking to protect their existing market positions. Complexity of Implementation: Even if passed, implementing these laws will be a complex undertaking, requiring detailed rule-making and coordination among various agencies. Evolving Technology: The crypto space is rapidly evolving. Regulations need to be flexible and adaptable to keep pace with technological advancements and prevent unintended consequences. Despite these challenges, the bipartisan support and the clear need for crypto regulation provide a strong foundation for moving forward. Senator Lummis’s vocal advocacy is a crucial catalyst in pushing these important conversations and legislative efforts ahead. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto in the U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis’s urgent call for the passage of the FIT21 and GENIUS Act marks a pivotal moment in the quest for clear and effective crypto regulation in the United States. These bills represent a significant step towards establishing a framework that can foster innovation, protect consumers, and ensure market stability in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. With bipartisan support growing and the need for clarity becoming increasingly pressing, the crypto industry and its stakeholders are watching closely to see if this moment will translate into landmark legislation that shapes the future of finance. The potential is immense, and the time for action, as Senator Lummis emphasizes, is now.

Technology is the future of economic growth, and I’m eager to help innovators navigate the policy landscape so they can build. — Patrick McHenry (@PatrickMcHenry) February 26, 2025 McHenry did not elaborate on his specific responsibilities but emphasized his commitment to removing “bureaucratic barriers for American entrepreneurs.” “For too long, D.C. has created barriers for startups and emerging companies,” McHenry continued. “It’s time to level the playing field and ensure that Little Tech—the next generation of builders—gets a fair shot.” Andreessen Horowitz’s Role in Tech and Crypto A16z, founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, has made substantial investments in the technology and blockchain sectors. The Silicon Valley-based firm was a major contributor to Fairshake, a digital asset super PAC focused on supporting crypto-friendly congressional candidates ahead of the 2024 U.S. elections. Andreessen, known for advising key figures in the tech sector such as Mark Zuckerberg, has voiced concerns about regulatory policies under the Biden administration after previously backing Democratic candidates. McHenry’s Background in Digital Asset Legislation McHenry, a key advocate for digital asset legislation during his time on Capitol Hill, briefly served as Speaker pro tempore of the House after Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s removal in late 2023. In May 2024, he spearheaded efforts to pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act through the House of Representatives, marking a rare instance of bipartisan cooperation in crypto regulation. News of McHenry’s latest venture comes just weeks after he announced a new advisory position at fintech payments organization Stripe. Crypto’s Policy Battle Moves Beyond Capitol Hill For years, McHenry fought to bring regulatory clarity to digital assets from within Congress. Now, as a senior advisor to one of crypto’s most powerful venture firms, his role shifts from lawmaker to industry advocate. This transition highlights a broader trend in the financial sector: when regulatory progress stalls in Washington, the private sector steps in to steer the conversation. A16z has already been active in political funding, backing pro-crypto candidates and advocating for industry-friendly policies. With McHenry onboard, the firm is doubling down on its efforts to influence the rules of the game. Whether this fosters constructive dialogue with regulators or deepens tensions between Washington and the crypto industry will become clear over time, but one thing is certain—policy decisions affecting digital assets are no longer confined to legislative chambers. What does McHenry’s move to a16z signify for the future of crypto regulation? His appointment signals a growing recognition that regulatory expertise is vital not only in public policy but also in shaping the private sector’s approach to technology. By bringing his legislative experience to a16z, McHenry is positioned to help craft frameworks that balance innovation with effective oversight—a trend increasingly observed as traditional regulators and private firms work more closely together. How might McHenry’s extensive background in legislative advocacy benefit a16z? McHenry’s history of advancing bipartisan crypto legislation and reducing bureaucratic barriers can provide a16z with nuanced insights into the regulatory process. His expertise is likely to inform strategic decisions that align with both industry innovation and the evolving demands of regulatory bodies, helping the firm navigate complex policy environments. Can this strategic hire influence the balance between regulatory oversight and innovation in crypto? Yes, by leveraging his deep understanding of regulatory processes, McHenry can help shape policies that encourage innovation while ensuring necessary consumer protections. His involvement at a16z may facilitate more constructive interactions between industry players and regulatory agencies, potentially leading to a more balanced and supportive framework for digital assets. What challenges might arise from transitioning from a public office role to a private advisory position? One challenge is managing the potential conflict of interest between public policy advocacy and private sector goals. Additionally, the shift requires navigating the political nuances of regulatory reform while maintaining credibility among both regulators and industry stakeholders. Ensuring transparency and objective decision-making will be key to overcoming these hurdles.

Shiba Inu’s $0.01 dream remains a long shot, reliant on extreme token burns and broader adoption. Meanwhile, Hedera (HBAR) is showing technical potential, but its movement depends on breaking key resistance levels. Amid these uncertainties, Web3Bay is gaining traction for its practical approach to decentralization. By reshaping e-commerce with blockchain-based transparency and cost efficiency, Web3Bay has already raised $1.5 million in presale funding, drawing strong interest from venture capitalists and crypto whales seeking sustainable investments. Web3Bay Presale: Why VCs & Whales Are Loading Up on Decentralized Shopping Web3Bay is attracting serious investor attention, as its presale has already surpassed $1.5 million in early fundraising. Currently in Stage 4, Web3Bay has already sold over 380 million tokens at a batch price of $0.00456, signaling strong confidence from both venture capitalists and crypto whales. One key reason for this interest is Web3Bay’s vision of redefining e-commerce through decentralization, removing intermediaries and lowering costs for buyers and sellers. As a result, institutional investors recognize its potential to disrupt traditional online marketplaces, offering greater transparency and ownership over digital assets. Consequently, the surge in presale participation reflects growing interest in blockchain-driven retail, a sector poised for major transformation. Unlike speculative memecoins, Web3Bay presents a real-world use case, positioning itself as a promising long-term investment. Thus, early adopters are securing tokens at a discount before prices increase in future stages. Looking ahead, as Web3Bay continues to gain traction, its presale momentum suggests a strong market debut, making it a compelling opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the shift toward decentralized commerce. HBAR Eyes Bullish Reversal as Double-Bottom Pattern Forms Hedera (HBAR) is showing signs of a potential trend shift since it has formed a double-bottom pattern around the $0.21 support level. Additionally, this structure, combined with bullish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicates that the ongoing downtrend may be losing strength. To confirm an upward move, HBAR must break through $0.258, aligning with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. If successful, a breakout could trigger further gains toward $0.278, an area of previous price congestion. However, failure to hold above $0.217 may lead to another drop toward $0.20 before a possible rebound. From a technical standpoint, Elliott Wave analysis suggests a five-wave impulsive structure in development, with the third wave potentially pushing HBAR past key resistance levels. At present, HBAR trades at $0.214, with intraday highs of $0.229 and lows of $0.205. A break below $0.217 would invalidate the bullish setup, signaling further consolidation before any decisive movement. Shiba Inu’s $0.01 Dream: Reality Check for 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB) has captivated the crypto community, transforming from a meme into a significant player. However, the aspiration for SHIB to reach $0.01 by 2025 faces substantial challenges. For this to happen, drastic token burns would be required to reduce its vast supply, along with the development of robust use cases beyond its meme origin and significant adoption driven by large-scale investors. At present, SHIB’s price remains far from this target, and while there’s potential for growth, expecting a surge to $0.01 appears overly optimistic. In contrast, emerging projects like Dawgz AI are gaining attention. Unlike SHIB, which heavily relies on community enthusiasm, Dawgz AI offers tangible utilities, such as automated trading bots designed to optimize profits. This shift suggests a growing investor interest in cryptocurrencies that provide real-world applications and consistent returns, moving beyond the traditional meme coin hype. Final Thoughts Investors often weigh potential against practicality, and Web3Bay stands out by offering a real-world use case rather than relying on speculation. While Shiba Inu’s ambitious price target faces steep challenges and HBAR’s movement depends on overcoming resistance levels, Web3Bay is already demonstrating strong market confidence. With over $1.5 million raised and 380 million tokens sold, its decentralized e-commerce model is attracting both institutional and retail investors. As the presale continues to gain momentum, Web3Bay presents a compelling case for those seeking a sustainable, utility-driven investment over short-term hype.

With meme coins dominating headlines, early investors are constantly looking for the next breakout project. While Dog (Bitcoin) continues to be the big dog in the crypto space, and SLERF makes waves, a new contender is stealing the spotlight— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). Arctic Pablo Coin is more than just another meme token. This project is quickly gaining traction with an innovative staking system, referral rewards, and an engaging presale journey. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin, Dog (Bitcoin), and SLERF, offering insights into what makes these meme coins so exciting. Earn While You Hold: Arctic Pablo Coin Offers 66% APY During Presale One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s standout features is its lucrative staking rewards. During the presale, investors can stake their APC tokens and earn a massive 66% APY. This provides a strong incentive to hold and boosts long-term profitability. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about passive income—it also rewards active supporters. The project offers referral incentives where users can invite others and earn rewards in return. By spreading the word, investors can grow their holdings without spending an extra dime. Arctic Pablo coin is among the Top New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential . Meme coins thrive on strong communities, and Arctic Pablo Coin is no different. The project hosts engaging community competitions where participants can win APC tokens or USD rewards. This adds a gamified element, increasing engagement and drawing in more investors. With the crypto market constantly evolving, staying ahead with innovative incentives makes all the difference. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Heats Up – Now at Penguinopolis! Unlike traditional meme coin presales , Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) follows a one-of-a-kind journey, moving from one location to another instead of fixed stages. Currently, APC has arrived at Penguinopolis, marking the 12th phase of its journey. This moment presents a golden opportunity for investors, with the current price set at $0.000067 per APC and a total of over $1.61 million already raised. With an anticipated launch price of $0.008, APC offers a massive ROI potential of 11,844.78% from its current value. An investor putting in $1,000 today would receive 14,925,370.00 APC tokens, which could skyrocket to an incredible $14,925,370.00 at launch. As Arctic Pablo Coin continues moving forward, its price will increase, making this a limited-time entry point before the next surge Dog (Bitcoin): The Undisputed King of Meme Coins Dog (Bitcoin) remains the top dog in the meme coin market, solidifying its position as a leader in the crypto space. Recently, the coin has experienced a significant surge in on-chain activity, with whale transactions and adoption rates skyrocketing. This uptick highlights growing confidence among both retail and institutional investors, who are increasingly recognizing the value of meme coins beyond their viral appeal. As more platforms and merchants integrate Dog (Bitcoin) as a payment method, its utility and relevance continue to expand. Institutional interest has also surged, with major players entering the market and driving further momentum. Dog (Bitcoin) is not just a meme—it’s a cultural phenomenon and a testament to the enduring power of community-driven projects in the crypto world. SLERF: The Rising Meme Coin Shaking Up the Crypto Space SLERF has been making waves in the crypto world with its unexpected partnerships and community-driven growth. What started as a fun meme coin has quickly evolved into a serious contender, drawing the attention of traders and investors alike. With new exchange listings, increasing adoption, and a rapidly growing user base, SLERF is proving that it has the potential to break into the mainstream. The coin’s high trading volume reflects strong market interest, and recent developments suggest that SLERF is gearing up for a major rally. As the meme coin market remains one of the most volatile yet rewarding crypto spaces, SLERF defies expectations. With its expanding ecosystem and loyal community, this meme coin is one to watch closely in the coming months. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out The meme coin sector is buzzing with opportunities, but few projects offer as much growth potential as Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . With its high APY staking rewards, lucrative referral incentives, and engaging presale journey, APC draws massive attention from investors. While Dog (Bitcoin) continues to dominate and SLERF’s rapid expansion is turning heads, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as one of the top new meme coins with the potential for massive returns. Currently, in the Penguinopolis phase, APC’s price is still at an early entry point—but not for long. The price will increase as it moves to its next destination, making now the perfect time to invest. Don’t miss out on one of the most explosive presales in the crypto space!

As the excitement surrounding memecoins wanes, prices have dropped to their lowest levels in several months. Following the historic hack of the ByBit exchange and President Trump’s controversial tariff proposals, the overall crypto market has seen a downturn, with Bitcoin falling 12% in the past week. In contrast, Solana has plummeted 22%, reaching a new five-month low. Solana Struggles As New Data Shows Dramatic Drop As reported by Fortune, the decline in Solana’s value can be attributed to its association with recent celebrity-backed memecoin scandals, particularly the LIBRA incident. This cryptocurrency surged to a nearly $5 billion market cap before crashing, following promotion from Argentine President Javier Milei, whose involvement has sparked outrage and prompted an investigation. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Overextended—Is A Market Shakeup Imminent? Zach Pandl, head of research at the crypto asset manager Grayscale, noted that this incident has highlighted the volatility and risks associated with memecoins, stating, “The current phase of memecoin trading on Solana is over.” Solana’s rise as the preferred blockchain for memecoin development was largely due to its low transaction costs, high transaction speeds, and user-friendly infrastructure. Platforms like Pump.fun facilitated the rapid creation of cryptocurrencies on Solana, leading to a peak of over 71,000 memecoins launched in a single day. However, this number has since dwindled to just 26,000, according to data from analytics firm Dune. Analysts Warn Of Potential Drop Below $100 While many memecoins lack intrinsic value and are often linked to scams, Pandl suggested that the recent memecoin frenzy had some positive impacts on the Solana ecosystem. “It onboarded users, generated revenue, and helped stress test the Solana blockchain in various ways,” he explained. “In that sense, memecoin trading is one of the many building blocks to developing the next generation of financial infrastructure.” Adding to Solana’s woes, the open interest for Solana futures has declined by 44% over the past month, dropping from an all-time high of $6.39 billion to just $3.57 billion today. This decline indicates a reduction in investor confidence and interest in leveraging Solana positions. Related Reading: Panic Sell? Bitcoin’s $86K Fall Wipes Out $1 Billion In Trades CoinGecko data also shows a similar pattern from investors, as trading volume has dropped 54% in the last 48 hours, representing only $5 billion of Solana’s total market cap of $66 billion. Currently trading at $134, analysts have identified this price point as a crucial support zone in the ongoing downtrend. According to Crypto General, if this support fails to hold, the next support level could fall below $100, representing a drop of more than 65% from Solana’s all-time highs.

The forensic report left former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao with more questions than answers, and he heavily criticized them, claiming the report was written in vague language to brush over the issues. According to Safe’s investigation report , the forensic review into the targeted attack by the Lazarus Group on Bybit concluded that this attack targeted the Bybit Safe was achieved through a compromised Safe developer machine. The hack resulted in the proposal of a disguised malicious transaction that saw the hackers draw funds from Bybit’s wallet. According to the report, the forensic audit on external security researchers did not indicate any shortcomings in the Safe smart contracts or source code of the frontend and services. The report also indicated that the Safe team conducted a thorough investigation and has now reinstated Safe on the Ethereum mainnet with a phased rollout. The Safe team has fully rebuilt, reconfigured all infrastructure, and rotated all credentials, ensuring the attack vector is fully eliminated. The Safe frontend remains operational with additional security measures in place. However, the report cautioned users to carry out extreme caution and remain vigilant when signing transactions. CZ criticizes Safe’s forensics report for not being detailed enough I usually try not to criticize other industry players, but I still do it once in a while. 😂 This update from Safe is not that great. It uses vague language to brush over the issues. I have more questions than answers after reading it. 1. What does ""compromising a Safe… https://t.co/VxywHyzqXb — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) February 26, 2025 The report has received heavy backlash from Binance founder and former CEO CZ. According to CZ, the report is not detailed enough to address all concerns and has gaping holes as to how the occurrence happened. CZ first questioned what “compromising a Safe developer machine” means. He also questioned how the hackers compromised the subject machine and wondered if it was social engineering, a virus, or something else. CZ also expressed concerns about how a developer machine gained access to an exchange account. He asked if some code got remotely deployed from the developer machine straight to the prod. CZ also expressed his concerns about how the hackers bypassed the ledger verification step at multiple signers. He questioned if the signers failed to verify properly or if they did a blind signing. Bybit also embarked on a deep forensics investigation by contracting to blockchain security firms Sygnia and Verichains. The aim of the investigations centered around the three signers’ hosts as a follow-up on the $1.4 billion hack. CZ also questioned if the $1.4 billion was the largest address managed using Safe and why the hackers didn’t target other wallets. CZ also asked what lessons other “self-custody, multi-sig” wallet providers and users can learn from the ordeal. The investigations from Sygnia concluded that the cause of the incident was a malicious code emanating from Safe’s infrastructure. The report concluded that Bybit’s infrastructure was not affected or compromised in any way during the attack. The report highlighted that the investigations will deepen further to confirm the recent findings. Preliminary conclusions from Verichains revealed that the benign JavaScript file of app.safe.global was replaced on February 19th with malicious code aimed at maiming Bybit’s Ethereum Multisig Cold Wallet. Verichains investigators also recommended that further investigations be conducted to confirm the root cause. Lazarus Group reportedly launders Bybit funds via meme coins UAE-based Bybit exchange fell victim to hackers last week, resulting in the loss of $1.5 billion. The exchange’s CEO said the funds were drawn from one of Bybit’s cold multisig wallets. According to onchain data, North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group, believed to be behind the attack, was observed to have been leveraging memecoins to launder the stolen funds. Cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT reported that Lazarus Group distributed several meme coins on Pump.fun. Binance has also been affected by malicious attacks from cyber criminals. Recently, Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur Joe Zhou reported that scammers sent him a message through the usual Binance number where he typically receives his verification codes, telling him his account was accessed from North Korea. Joe Zhou got on a call with the attackers who misled him into sending funds to a different wallet. Zhou managed to act fast and recover most of his funds before the hackers cashed out.

Neiro has surged 15.06% in the last 24 hours, gaining traction within the Ethereum community, while Floki Inu has seen a 2.24% daily increase despite its 13.93% weekly decline. These tokens are making waves, but all eyes are on BTFD Coin, whose presale has now crossed $6.20 million, drawing in bullish investors at a record pace. Meme coins have evolved beyond simple internet jokes, turning into full-fledged investment opportunities. With BTFD Coin leading the charge as the next crypto to explode , thanks to its 3650% ROI potential, a booming referral program, and an active community, traders are looking for their next high-reward bet. Will Neiro and Floki Inu continue their streak, or will BTFD’s presale momentum make it the most explosive pick? BTFD’s $6.20M Frenzy: 3650% ROI Potential Has Investors Stacking Up BTFD Coin’s presale has been unstoppable, rapidly selling over 70 billion tokens and attracting more than 11,000 investors. With Stage 14 currently live at $0.00016, early buyers are seizing the 100% bonus offer using the LAUNCH100 code—which means double the tokens for every purchase. BTFD is more than just hype—it has an entire ecosystem fueling its success. Its P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, offering players the chance to earn while gaming, while its 90% APY staking program keeps long-term holders raking in passive income. This multi-pronged approach is why analysts predict a post-listing moon price of $0.006—a staggering 3650% potential return for presale investors. Investors who act fast could secure a massive upside. A $5,000 investment at $0.00016 per BTFD token could balloon to $18,750 at $0.0006. But if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price, that same investment could skyrocket to $187,500—an opportunity too good to ignore. For those looking to stack even more tokens, BTFD’s Referral Program is a game-changer. Top 20 referrers get 10% of the total raise in BTFD tokens, making it one of the most rewarding systems in the market. Simply share a referral code, and both the referrer and referee win. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Securing BTFD tokens during presale is quick and easy. Investors need to: Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Visit the BTFD presale page , connect their wallet, and enter the LAUNCH100 code to double their tokens. Complete the purchase and get ready to ride with the bulls. With only two presale stages left, the current $0.00016 price won’t last much longer. This is the perfect dip for those looking to join the bull run before BTFD hits major exchanges. Neiro’s 15.06% Surge Draws Eyes Neiro has made waves in the meme coin market, with a 15.06% daily pump pushing it higher on traders’ radars. The project has strong community backing as it honors Neiro, the Shiba Inu pup adopted by the owner of the legendary Doge meme dog, Kabosu. This Ethereum-based token is built on a 100% community-owned model, where holders dictate the direction of the project. In just a week, Neiro has gained 10%, and with its trading volume up by 23.07%, the excitement around this token is only growing. Neiro’s connection to the Doge legacy gives it an added layer of hype that has helped it cement its place in the meme coin landscape. Investors looking for a fast-moving, community-driven project are keeping a close eye on how Neiro continues to develop in the coming weeks. Floki Inu Sees Market Movement Floki Inu has been a staple in the meme coin space, emerging as a community favorite with its Viking-themed branding and strong ecosystem. In the last 24 hours, Floki Inu has climbed 2.24%, showing signs of resilience even after a 13.93% decline over the past week. Originally inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, Floki Inu has gone beyond the meme status, offering utility through its Floki ecosystem. It features a metaverse game, DeFi tools, and an NFT marketplace, which have helped it build a strong following. While its trading volume has dipped by 16.4%, its ability to sustain gains suggests that long-term holders are staying strong.

According to a Wednesday X post from Gemini co-founder and President Cameron Winklevoss, the SEC informed Gemini on Monday that it was closing its investigation into the New York-based crypto exchange and would not be filing enforcement charges against it. But the anti-climactic resolution to the long-running investigation was unsatisfying to Winklevoss, who said in his X post that the SEC’s retreat “does little to make up for the damage this agency has done to us, our industry, and America.” “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation,” Winklevoss wrote. “The SEC’s behavior in aggregate towards other crypto companies and projects cost orders of magnitude more and caused unquantifiable loss in economic growth for America.” Winklevoss said that, without consequences for both the SEC and the individual staff members involved in the investigations of Gemini and other crypto companies, other federal agencies could again, in the future, “bully, harass and attack a lawful industry and then decide one day to simply say we’re good and walk away.” In his post, Winklevoss suggested that any agency that “refuses to write rules before it opens an investigation or brings an enforcement action” should be required to reimburse defendants “for 3x [their] legal costs.” Winklevoss also called for all SEC staff members involved in the probe into Gemini to be publicly fired, and their “names, roles, and the actions they participated in should be posted on the SEC website.” “It should not be acceptable to bring the full might of the U.S. government to bear against fledgling companies in a nascent industry and then hide behind a faceless agency or say you were ‘just doing your job’ or ‘following orders.’ These individuals had a choice,” Winklevoss wrote. “They could have asked to be reassigned or resigned. Nobody was forcing them to work at the SEC. Nonetheless they chose to violate their oath and the agency’s mission to ‘make a positive impact on the U.S. economy, our capital markets, and people’s lives’ and instead aided and abetted an unlawful war against a lawful industry.” The SEC’s decision to drop its probe into Gemini comes shortly after it dropped similar investigations into Uniswap Labs, Robinhood Crypto and OpenSea. Earlier Wednesday, the SEC also filed a joint motion to pause its litigation against the Tron Foundation and Justin Sun, similar to recent motions filed in its cases against Coinbase and Binance.
