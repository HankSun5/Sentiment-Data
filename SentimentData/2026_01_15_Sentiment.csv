ETH’s current price means that it’s up by 12% in a fortnight and by 6% in a month, with the cryptocurrency market as a whole rising to $3.33 trillion today after U.S. data showed inflation remaining stable in December. While the Ethereum price is up by only 5% in the past year, SharpLink’s discussion of how it’s going to use its ETH productively is very positive for the coin, and may encourage more institutions and corporations to increase accumulation. And with Ethereum still being the biggest layer-one network in crypto by a wide margin, the long-term Ethereum price prediction is hugely bullish right now. Ethereum Price Prediction: SharpLink Activates Multi-Billion ETH Strategy – How Long Until ETH Hits a New All-Time High? Speaking on the Degenz Live YouTube channel, SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom detailed how the company had deployed $170 million in ETH on the layer-two network Linea, and how this deployment provides a template for similar activity in the near and distant future. In other words, Chalom wants 2026 “to be the year of productivity” for its Ethereum reserve, which could set a precedent other firms and institutions increasingly follow. And if we look at the Ethereum price chart today, we see that its momentum is rising strongly, and the coin may have even broken out. Most notably, its price has broken through the pennant it has been forming since August, while its MACD (orange, blue) climbed above 0 a week ago and became positive for the first time in months. Source: TradingView It’s a similar story with the relative strength index (yellow), which has tried to crack 70 once already in the past week, and may be about to do the same thing again very soon. Such gains in momentum come as flows into Ethereum funds reach a modest $56 million since the beginning of January, although they have actually seen an outflow of $116 million in the seven days to January 12. The past 24 hours have witnessed some significant transfers of ETH, including one transfer that saw a whale take 16,624 ETH off Coinbase. We’ve also seen some massive deposits onto Ethereum’s Beacon Chain , indicating an increase in staking activity, which may or may not have any relation to SharpLink’s deployment of its ETH reserves. Regardless, the Ethereum price prediction is looking vey encouraging, with ETH on course to top $4,000 by Q2, and to break $5,000 by H2.

57170106,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261623,1768430411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Bill Delay Looms as Coinbase Withdraws Support for Senate’s Clarity Act,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-bill-delay-coinbase-withdrawal/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Bill Delay Looms as Coinbase Withdraws Support for Senate’s Clarity Act WASHINGTON, D.C. — January 16, 2025 — The Senate Banking Committee’s scheduled markup of landmark cryptocurrency legislation faces potential cancellation after Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, officially withdrew its support for the proposed Clarity Act. This development creates significant uncertainty for digital asset regulation in the United States. Crypto Bill Delay Threatens Legislative Progress Industry sources confirmed that Coinbase requested a postponement of the Senate markup. Subsequently, the exchange formally withdrew its endorsement of the legislation. Eleanor Terrett, host of “Crypto in America,” first reported this development on social media platform X. Terrett cited anonymous sources familiar with the situation. She noted her unsuccessful attempts to confirm whether the Senate Banking Committee would proceed with the scheduled markup. Terrett also requested comment from Chairman Tim Scott’s office. The potential delay represents a significant setback for cryptocurrency regulation advocates. Many industry participants have long sought clear legislative frameworks. The Clarity Act aimed to establish comprehensive market structure rules for digital assets. These rules would have defined regulatory jurisdictions between the SEC and CFTC. The legislation also addressed consumer protection requirements. Furthermore, it created compliance standards for cryptocurrency exchanges. Understanding the Clarity Act’s Legislative Context The proposed legislation emerged from years of bipartisan negotiation. Lawmakers drafted the bill to address regulatory gaps in cryptocurrency oversight. The current regulatory landscape remains fragmented across multiple agencies. This fragmentation creates compliance challenges for cryptocurrency businesses. The Clarity Act specifically sought to clarify several key areas: Regulatory jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Token classification frameworks for determining when digital assets qualify as securities Exchange registration requirements for platforms handling cryptocurrency transactions Consumer protection standards including disclosure and custody requirements Market integrity provisions to prevent manipulation and ensure transparency Several industry groups initially supported the legislative approach. They viewed the Clarity Act as preferable to enforcement actions. The SEC has pursued numerous cryptocurrency cases through regulation by enforcement. This approach has created legal uncertainty for market participants. Coinbase’s Strategic Shift and Industry Implications Coinbase’s withdrawal represents a major strategic shift. The exchange previously advocated for comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation. Industry analysts suggest several potential reasons for this change. The company might have identified problematic provisions in the latest draft. Alternatively, Coinbase could be pursuing different regulatory strategies. The exchange currently faces an SEC lawsuit alleging securities law violations. This legal battle might influence the company’s legislative priorities. Other industry participants will likely reassess their positions following Coinbase’s decision. Major cryptocurrency firms often coordinate their advocacy efforts. A divided industry could weaken legislative momentum. Lawmakers typically seek consensus before advancing complex legislation. Historical Timeline of Cryptocurrency Regulation Efforts The current situation represents the latest chapter in ongoing regulatory debates. Cryptocurrency regulation discussions began gaining serious congressional attention around 2018. Multiple legislative proposals have emerged since that time. None have achieved final passage through both congressional chambers. The following table illustrates key milestones in cryptocurrency legislation: Year Legislative Development Status 2018 Token Taxonomy Act introduced Died in committee 2020 Digital Commodity Exchange Act proposed Advanced through House committee 2022 Responsible Financial Innovation Act introduced Gained bipartisan sponsorship 2023 Clarity Act discussions began Multiple draft versions circulated 2024 Senate Banking Committee scheduled markup Now potentially delayed This historical context demonstrates the challenges of cryptocurrency legislation. Technological complexity creates drafting difficulties. Regulatory jurisdiction disputes between agencies complicate matters. Industry fragmentation presents additional obstacles. Different cryptocurrency sectors often have conflicting regulatory preferences. Potential Impacts on Cryptocurrency Markets and Innovation Legislative delays could affect multiple cryptocurrency market segments. Regulatory uncertainty typically discourages institutional investment. Many traditional financial firms await clearer rules before entering cryptocurrency markets. Continued ambiguity might push innovation overseas. Other jurisdictions have established more defined regulatory frameworks. The United Kingdom and European Union implemented comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations recently. Singapore and Dubai also created clear regulatory environments. American companies might relocate operations to these jurisdictions. Domestic cryptocurrency investors face continued uncertainty about protection standards. Consumer advocacy groups have emphasized the need for clear rules. They argue that vulnerable investors require better safeguards. Industry participants need compliance certainty for business planning. Many cryptocurrency firms operate with substantial legal risk. They cannot confidently expand services without regulatory clarity. Expert Perspectives on Legislative Delays Regulatory experts highlight several considerations regarding the potential delay. Former CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz recently discussed cryptocurrency legislation challenges. He noted the difficulty of creating flexible yet comprehensive frameworks. University of Pennsylvania law professor David Hoffman emphasized jurisdictional complexities. He explained how existing financial regulations poorly fit cryptocurrency models. Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith expressed disappointment about the potential delay. She stressed the urgent need for congressional action. These expert views illustrate the legislation’s complexity. They also demonstrate widespread recognition of the regulatory gap. Conclusion The potential crypto bill delay represents a significant development for digital asset regulation. Coinbase’s withdrawal of support for the Clarity Act creates legislative uncertainty. This situation highlights ongoing challenges in cryptocurrency policy formulation. Market participants must monitor Senate Banking Committee developments closely. The cryptocurrency industry continues seeking regulatory clarity. Legislative progress remains essential for market maturation. Future developments will shape America’s cryptocurrency regulatory landscape for years. FAQs Q1: What is the Clarity Act? The Clarity Act represents proposed cryptocurrency legislation aiming to establish comprehensive market structure rules. It defines regulatory jurisdictions and creates compliance standards for digital asset businesses. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the cryptocurrency bill? Industry sources confirmed Coinbase requested a markup postponement then withdrew endorsement. Specific reasons remain undisclosed, but potential concerns about legislative provisions likely influenced this decision. Q3: How might this delay affect cryptocurrency markets? Continued regulatory uncertainty could discourage institutional investment and potentially push innovation to jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks, affecting market development and consumer protection. Q4: What happens next with cryptocurrency legislation? The Senate Banking Committee must decide whether to proceed with markup, revise the legislation, or delay further action. Industry groups will likely intensify advocacy efforts during this period. Q5: How does this affect ordinary cryptocurrency investors? Investors face continued uncertainty about regulatory protections.

In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the organization expressed concerns that the descriptions of the draft indicate potential harm to decentralized finance (DeFi) and could negatively impact software developers. Red Flags Emerge From Crypto Market Structure Bill Draft In its message , the DeFi Education Fund emphasized the importance of safeguarding the integrity of the emerging DeFi landscape and called on senators to consider the far-reaching consequences of these proposed changes. Among the amendments highlighted were Amendment #42, proposed by Senators Reed and Kim, which seeks to authorize the Treasury to sanction smart contracts and centralized platforms involved in illicit activities. This amendment raised significant red flags for advocates who worry about its implications for innovation and operational flexibility within the decentralized finance ecosystem. Another amendment of concern, Amendment #45 by Senator Reed, aims to create a specific definition for digital assets under the Bank Secrecy Act. Similarly, Amendment #47, also from Senator Reed, intends to remove a provision related to federal criminal offense concerning unlicensed money transmission. These changes, according to the DeFi Education Fund, loom dangerously over the operational landscape for developers and financial institutions that interact with digital assets. Stifling DeFi Growth Additionally, Senators Cortez Masto’s proposed amendments, specifically #72 and #73, aim to narrow the definition of non-controlling developers and expand the authority of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) alongside the Treasury for blockchain-enabled platforms. Amendments #74 and #75 further seek to strengthen existing laws related to money transmission and prohibit transactions involving unlawful DeFi protocols, which the Fund suggests could stifle the industry’s growth. Amendment #104, proposed by crypto-skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren, also drew attention by striking a key distribution carve-out for crypto offerings. This follows similar calls by Summer Mersinger, CEO of the Blockchain Association, who recently claimed that the “Big Bank Lobby” is pushing Congress to change key provisions of the already enacted GENIUS Act concerning stablecoin rewards, further highlighting the current state of the future of crypto in Congress.

As confidence in Zcash wavers, attention has quickly turned to alternatives with Dash emerging as a top contender. This shift in sentiment has sparked a surge in trading volumes, supporting a bullish Dash price prediction as more investors look for privacy-focused projects with stability and momentum. Josh Swihart, former CEO of the Electric Coin Company (ECC), stated that the resignations stemmed from ongoing conflicts with Bootstrap , the non-profit tasked with overseeing the team’s work. Over the past few weeks, it's become clear that the majority of Bootstrap board members (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit created to support Zcash by governing the Electric Coin Company), specifically Zaki Manian, Christina Garman, Alan Fairless, and Michelle Lai (ZCAM), have moved into… — Josh Swihart (@jswihart) January 7, 2026 Swihart emphasized that there was a “clear misalignment” between the top priorities for Bootstrap and ECC that prevented the team from being able to do their job. The news triggered a steep decline in the price of ZEC. At the time of writing, its 7-day losses currently sit at 17%. In contrast, DASH has booked a 74% gain during this same period, as the market seems to have rotated toward this token and Monero (XMR) in response. Zcash was one of the top-performing assets last year with an 827% gain. If that same buying interest rotates toward DASH, that could propel its price to levels not seen in years over the next few weeks. Dash Price Prediction: DASH Eyes $250 After Bullish Breakout DASH’s trading volumes have more than doubled in the past 24 hours alone, currently accounting for 130% of the asset’s circulating market cap at $1.2 billion. Source: TradingView This indicates that buying pressure has accelerated dramatically, causing a massive short squeeze that could keep unfolding over the next few days. The daily chart shows that DASH has been going up for three days in a row and has broken a key resistance at $58 with strong volumes. This sets the stage for a potential breakout, with targets at $125 and $250 , offering up to 233% upside in the weeks ahead.

This regulatory action represents one of the most significant governmental challenges to AI safety protocols in 2025, testing the boundaries of existing digital consent laws against rapidly advancing generative technology. Grok Sexual Images Trigger Multi-National Regulatory Response The California Attorney General’s office formally announced its investigation on Wednesday, focusing specifically on whether xAI violated state laws concerning the “proliferation of nonconsensual sexually explicit material.” This probe follows alarming data from AI detection platform Copyleaks, which documented approximately one problematic image posted to X every minute, with a separate 24-hour sample from early January revealing 6,700 instances per hour. Attorney General Rob Bonta emphasized the real-world harm, stating, “This material has been used to harass people across the internet,” while urging xAI to implement immediate corrective measures. Concurrently, international pressure has intensified dramatically. Indonesia and Malaysia have implemented temporary blocks on Grok access, while India has demanded immediate technical modifications from X. The European Commission has ordered xAI to preserve all Grok-related documents, typically a precursor to formal proceedings. Furthermore, the United Kingdom’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has initiated a formal investigation under the UK’s Online Safety Act. This coordinated global response underscores the borderless nature of AI-generated harm and the regulatory challenges it presents. Legal Landscape and Musk’s Narrow Denial Elon Musk’s statement on Wednesday created a crucial focal point for the controversy. He explicitly stated, “I am not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” Legal experts immediately noted the precise wording of this denial. It does not address the broader category of nonconsensual sexualized imagery of adults, which forms the bulk of the complaints. Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School, explained this strategic framing to Bitcoin World, noting that penalties for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) are significantly harsher. For instance, the federal Take It Down Act imposes up to three years imprisonment for CSAM distribution versus two years for nonconsensual adult imagery. The legal framework confronting xAI is multifaceted. At the federal level, the Take It Down Act criminalizes the knowing distribution of nonconsensual intimate images, including deepfakes, and mandates platform removal within 48 hours. California has bolstered its own defenses with a series of laws signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in 2024, specifically targeting sexually explicit deepfakes. The AG’s investigation will determine if xAI’s operations and Grok’s outputs breached these statutes, potentially setting a major precedent for AI developer liability. Expert Analysis: A Problem of Design or Prompting? Musk’s public response framed the incidents as issues of user behavior and technical bugs rather than foundational safety failures. He characterized problematic outputs as results of “adversarial hacking of Grok prompts” and asserted that Grok’s operating principle is to “obey the laws of any given country or state.” This defense shifts responsibility toward users who submit malicious prompts. However, Professor Goodyear suggests regulators may increasingly consider “requiring proactive measures by AI developers to prevent such content,” moving beyond a reactive, user-blame model. The core question for investigators is whether xAI implemented reasonable, state-of-the-art safeguards from the outset. Timeline of Escalation and Inconsistent Safeguards The controversy surrounding Grok’s image generation capabilities did not emerge in a vacuum. According to industry reports, the trend gained momentum in late 2024 when some adult-content creators began using Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves for marketing. This activity reportedly opened the door for other users to submit similar prompts targeting non-consenting individuals, including minors and celebrities like actress Millie Bobby Brown. Grok allegedly altered real photos by modifying clothing, poses, and physical features to create sexualized content. In response to the scandal, xAI has reportedly begun implementing new controls, though their effectiveness appears inconsistent. Grok now requires a premium subscription for certain image-generation requests, and even then, it may refuse or deliver a “toned-down” output. April Kozen, VP of Marketing at Copyleaks, told Bitcoin World that Grok seems “more permissive with adult content creators,” indicating a potential double standard. Kozen summarized the situation, stating, “Overall, these behaviors suggest X is experimenting with multiple mechanisms to reduce or control problematic image generation, though inconsistencies remain.” Key Reported Safeguard Changes: Premium subscription wall for certain image-generation prompts. Increased refusal rates for overtly sexual requests. Implementation of more generic or altered outputs for sensitive prompts. Potential differential treatment for verified adult-content accounts. The Broader Context of AI Ethics and Detection This incident highlights a critical tension in the AI industry between rapid capability deployment and ethical guardrails. Grok previously faced criticism for its “spicy mode” designed to generate explicit content, and an October 2024 update reportedly made jailbreaking its minimal safeguards easier, leading to a surge in hardcore AI-generated pornography. Alon Yamin, co-founder and CEO of Copyleaks, emphasized the urgent need for robust governance, telling Bitcoin World, “When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people’s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal… detection and governance are needed now more than ever.” The challenge extends beyond xAI. The rapid advancement of models like OpenAI’s Sora for video generation indicates that the capability to create convincing synthetic media is accelerating. This places unprecedented pressure on both detection technologies and legal frameworks designed for a pre-generative AI era. The California AG’s probe may therefore establish crucial benchmarks for what constitutes responsible AI development and adequate protection against misuse. Conclusion The California Attorney General’s investigation into Grok sexual images marks a pivotal moment in the regulation of generative artificial intelligence. As Elon Musk and xAI contend with the narrow legal definitions in his public denial, regulators worldwide are applying broader pressure, concerned with the systemic ability of AI tools to generate nonconsensual and harmful imagery. The outcome of this probe will likely influence global standards for AI safety, developer liability, and the protection of digital consent. It underscores an undeniable truth for the tech industry in 2025: the race for AI capability must be matched by an equal commitment to ethical safeguards and legal compliance, as the consequences of failure are now drawing serious governmental scrutiny. FAQs Q1: What is the California AG investigating regarding Grok? The California Attorney General is investigating whether xAI’s Grok chatbot violated state laws by facilitating the creation and proliferation of nonconsensual sexually explicit imagery, including the manipulation of photos of real women and children. Q2: What did Elon Musk specifically deny? Elon Musk stated he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Legal experts note this is a narrow denial that does not address the wider issue of nonconsensual sexualized imagery of adults created by the AI. Q3: What laws are relevant to this case? Key laws include the federal Take It Down Act, which criminalizes distributing nonconsensual intimate images, and a series of 2024 California laws signed by Governor Newsom specifically targeting sexually explicit deepfakes. Q4: How have other countries responded? Indonesia and Malaysia have temporarily blocked access to Grok. India has demanded technical changes from X, the European Commission has ordered document preservation, and the UK’s Ofcom has opened a formal investigation. Q5: What safeguards has xAI implemented for Grok? According to reports, xAI has begun requiring a premium subscription for certain image-generation requests, increased refusal rates for sexual prompts, and modified outputs to be more generic. However, experts note these measures appear inconsistent.

In this dynamic setting, GeeFi is differentiating itself by focusing on practical utility and building a comprehensive, user-centric decentralized finance platform. The project has demonstrated considerable market appeal, with its presale successfully raising over $2.6 million. This strong investor support is fueling the development of an all-in-one application designed to make digital asset management more secure and straightforward for users everywhere. Presale Success Indicates Strong Market Demand GeeFi’s fundraising progress highlights a growing appetite for integrated crypto solutions. The project’s Phase 3 presale is now 90% sold out, showing a high level of confidence from its expanding community. A recent update to the GeeFi wallet, which introduced a direct in-app purchasing portal for the $GEE token, helped accelerate this momentum by simplifying the investment process. With only 3 million tokens remaining at the current price, the window of opportunity for early investment is quickly closing. The Investment Case for the $GEE Token The $GEE utility token is the cornerstone of the GeeFi ecosystem and presents a clear investment case. Currently priced at $0.10, the token’s value is structured to increase with each new presale phase, rewarding early supporters. GeeFi has also announced a public exchange listing price of $0.40, which represents an immediate 300% return for current-phase investors when the token becomes publicly tradable. Analysts are also looking at long-term potential, with some forecasts suggesting the token’s value could rise to $3 or more as the platform expands. A $1,000 investment at the presale price could become $4,000 at listing and potentially reach $30,000 as adoption grows. Building a Unified Decentralized Finance Hub GeeFi is allocating its resources toward developing a decentralized wallet that functions as a complete financial center. The project’s roadmap is focused on integrating features that improve both convenience and security for users. A major development is the creation of a native Decentralized Exchange (DEX) within the application. This will allow users to trade digital assets efficiently without leaving the security of the GeeFi environment, reducing the risks associated with third-party platforms. By offering these tools in a single interface, GeeFi is making decentralized finance more accessible to a broader audience. Bridging Digital Assets and Real-World Spending A significant component of GeeFi’s strategy is the launch of its own Cryptocards. This initiative is designed to solve a common challenge in the crypto space: the difficulty of using digital assets for everyday expenses. The GeeFi Cryptocard will allow users to spend their holdings at merchants around the world, effectively connecting the digital economy to traditional commerce. This feature turns the wallet from a passive storage tool into an active financial instrument, giving users the ability to manage and spend their digital wealth with ease. Fostering a Strong and Rewarded Community GeeFi’s growth model is built on cultivating a loyal and active user base. The project has introduced several programs to incentivize participation and reward its community. A staking mechanism allows $GEE holders to earn passive income while helping to secure the network. Additionally, a 5% referral program offers commissions in USDT to users who bring new investors to the platform. GeeFi also has plans for a bonus system to further reward its earliest supporters, reinforcing its commitment to shared success. Conclusion GeeFi is establishing a solid position in the crypto market by delivering practical solutions that address the needs of modern users. The successful presale, a clear development roadmap, and strong community-focused initiatives provide a durable foundation for future growth. By focusing on utility and accessibility, GeeFi is building a platform designed to simplify digital asset management and increase its real-world application.

Red candles, falling sentiment, and growing chatter about weakness are still dominating conversation. According to a crypto analyst on X, that reaction may be exactly what larger players are counting on, especially because a closer look at on-chain data shows a very different story is quietly unfolding below the price action. Price Weakness And Retail Capitulation On Center Stage XRP started the year on a good note, with a break above $2 and then pushing as high as $2.41 before facing rejection. This rejection, in turn, caused the altcoin to fall to as low as $2.05. The analyst pointed to the loss of the $2.23 level during the breakdown as the moment retail confidence began to crack. As XRP’s price action trended lower to $2.05, fear-based selling increased, and this was shown on the charts that appeared increasingly bearish. From a short-term perspective, the move looked like confirmation that sellers quickly took control from buyers. Behind that visible decline, there are activities from institutional participants that do not show up on standard price charts. When retail participants were selling, XRP-related ETFs recorded a net inflow of $4.9 million in a single day. The lower panel of the chart below shows this divergence, showing total holdings of Spot XRP ETFs climbing steadily even as the price moved lower. This contrast can be described as a transfer of wealth in plain sight, showing how institutional buyers were using the pullback to add exposure when retail traders were selling. Supply Shock Shows Quiet Accumulation The message is that what looks like weakness on the surface may be setting the stage for a very different outcome once selling pressure from retail participants fades. However, another detail raised by the analyst is the movement of the token off exchanges. Roughly $22 million worth of tokens reportedly left trading platforms in the past 24 hours, reducing readily available supply. The pattern extends back to late 2025 , when balances held on crypto exchanges began a steady decline. Data from Glassnode shows that total exchange-held XRP has now fallen below 2 billion tokens, which is a notable decline from levels above 4 billion XRP recorded around January 2025. This reduction in exchange supply has not yet translated into an extended upside move in the altcoin’s price since it started correcting from its July all-time high, but it does point to quiet accumulation taking place below the surface. As some holders sell into weakness, a smaller group of market participants appears willing to absorb supply. That divergence is why several analysts have cautioned the XRP community against panic selling and getting shaken out.",XRP|Glassnode|ripple|Spot XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-14 23:00:16

One analyst has said that the long-term XRP/Gold ratio has just reached a historical support zone, signaling a familiar technical setup that could determine its next move. XRP/Gold Ratio Arrives At Critical Support Level Market expert ‘Steph is Crypto’ has released a fresh analysis focusing on the XRP to gold ratio and its historical behaviour. In his post on X this Tuesday, he stated that the ratio has returned to a long-standing support zone around $0.0004, which has consistently marked major turning points in XRP’s price action relative to gold. Related Reading: Top Bullish Predictions That Put XRP Price At New All-Time Highs Above $3.8 According to the analyst, this same area previously preceded powerful upside moves in the XRP/gold ratio. Each prior visit to this zone was followed by a sharp reversal higher, as highlighted by the circled lows and steep advances that followed. The chart shows rallies of more than 800% in 2020, over 120% in 2022, and about 530% in 2024. Steph is Crypto also pointed to momentum conditions, noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was oversold in the past when the XRP/gold ratio hit the historical support. In the current 2026 cycle, the RSI sits around 33.38, reflecting a similar oversold setup to previous cycles. According to the analyst, this suggests downside momentum is fading. The general outlook of this analysis suggests that if past trends repeat, the XRP/gold ratio could experience another strong rally this cycle. This time, Steph is Crypto predicts a rally from the support around $0.0004 to over $0.0018, representing a gain of more than 350%. Analyst Links XRP Trajectory To That Of Gold And Silver In a subsequent post, Steph is Crypto shared another analysis comparing the historical price movements and expansion phase of gold and silver with XRP. He presented parallel charts for each asset, highlighting distinct phases preceding major price rallies in the precious metals while illustrating the potential path for XRP based on gold and silver’s past performance. Related Reading: Analyst Outlines The Bull Case For XRP And Why Price Will Hit All-Time High Soon The chart showed that gold and silver experienced a major distribution phase in 2021, followed by a compression phase in 2023 and an expansion in 2026. In Gold’s case, its price reversal was sharp and vertical, with minimal pullbacks before reaching an all-time high near $4,700. Silver’s movement was more muted, showing significant volatility from 2023 to 2025 before accelerating in 2026 to peak above $91. Based on these performances, Steph is Crypto predicts that XRP could follow a similar trajectory. The cryptocurrency has completed its distribution phase above $3 and its compression stage near $2.3, and the analyst now expects it to enter an expansion phase, with a projected ATH target of $32.

Recent flow data shows that the funds have now absorbed the roughly $40 million withdrawal seen in early January, marking a return to steady capital accumulation after a brief pause in momentum. Market data compiled by analytics provider Sosovalue indicates that XRP ETFs attracted approximately $12.98 million in new capital on January 13. This addition completed a multi-day recovery sequence that began shortly after the funds’ first significant outflow. With this rebound, total net inflows across all XRP ETFs have risen to about $1.25 billion since their launch. Early Performance Established Strong Momentum XRP ETFs entered the market in November 2025 with an unusually strong debut. The first product, launched by Canary Capital, attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in its initial trading session. Over the following weeks, additional offerings from firms such as Bitwise , Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares expanded investor access to XRP through regulated vehicles. Following these launches, the ETFs maintained a streak of uninterrupted daily inflows for 35 consecutive trading sessions. This performance represented one of the longest inflow streaks recorded among crypto-related ETFs and enabled the products to surpass $1 billion in cumulative net inflows by mid-December. The funds ended 2025 with continued positive flows, reinforcing confidence going into the new year. Despite the strong start to 2026, XRP ETFs experienced their first notable outflow on January 7, when approximately $40.8 million exited the funds. This development ended the extended inflow streak and prompted speculation about whether investor appetite was beginning to weaken. Rather than signaling a sustained reversal, the outflow proved to be short-lived. Beginning on January 8, XRP ETFs returned to positive territory, recording inflows across four consecutive trading days. By January 13, the accumulated inflows since the outflow exceeded the amount withdrawn, fully offsetting the earlier loss. Recovery Pushes Total Inflows to $1.25 Billion The inflows recorded between January 8 and January 13 totaled roughly $41.67 million, slightly surpassing the January 7 outflow. As a result, the ETFs have now regained all lost capital and pushed their cumulative net inflows to approximately $1.25 billion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This swift recovery suggests that the earlier capital exit may have reflected temporary portfolio adjustments rather than a broader decline in interest. The ability of the funds to regain momentum within days highlights continued demand for XRP exposure through regulated investment products. How XRP ETFs Compare Across the Crypto ETF Market In the broader digital asset ETF landscape, XRP products remain among the strongest performers. With $1.25 billion in cumulative inflows, XRP ETFs rank third globally, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin products, which launched in early 2024, have accumulated more than $57 billion, while Ethereum ETFs have drawn over $12.5 billion since mid-2024. Other crypto ETFs continue to trail significantly. Solana-based ETFs, despite launching earlier than XRP funds, have yet to reach the $1 billion mark. Products tied to assets such as Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Litecoin have recorded comparatively modest inflows, remaining well below the levels seen for XRP. The rapid recovery from January’s outflow reinforces the resilience of XRP ETFs and underscores sustained investor interest. While short-term fluctuations in flows are likely to continue, current trends suggest that XRP ETFs remain firmly positioned among the leading crypto investment products in the market.

57171219,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=895350,1768433501,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57171219.jpeg,Altman-backed startup Cerebras Systems closes billion-dollar deal with OpenAI,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cerebras-systems-deal-with-openai/,"OpenAI has just entered into a major multi-billion partnership with Cerebras Systems, which is reportedly backed by Sam Altman. The partnership will see OpenAI purchase up to 750 megawatts of computing power over the next three years. Cerebras Systems is an AI chip startup building purpose-built AI systems to accelerate long outputs from AI models. It attributes its products’ speed to pairing massive compute, memory, and bandwidth together on a single giant chip to eliminate the bottlenecks that cause sluggish inference on conventional hardware. That is what OpenAI plans to capitalize on. OpenAI signs deal with Altman-backed cloud computing provider According to an official statement from OpenAI, integrating Cerebras into its mix of compute solutions, is all about making its AI products respond more rapidly. This means that when users ask a hard question, generate code, create an image, or run an AI agent, the thinking process becomes faster so that the AI can respond in real time, allowing users to do more with it, stay longer, and run higher-value workloads. According to the statement, OpenAI plans to integrate this low-latency capacity into its inference stack in phases, expanding across workloads. Sachin Katti of OpenAI had this to say about the development: “Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.” According to her, this aligns with OpenAI’s compute strategy, which is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads. Speaking about the partnership, Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, expressed delight at the opportunity to partner with OpenAI as it means pairing the world’s leading AI models with the world’s fastest AI processor. “Just as broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI, enabling entirely new ways to build and interact with AI models,” Feldman said . The capacity is expected to come online in multiple tranches through 2028. The development comes as OpenAI continues to struggle under explosive demand and a severe shortage of compute resources. The company has been trying to wean itself off heavy dependence on Nvidia and major cloud providers like Microsoft and Oracle, though the move has also raised eyebrows, given what it means for Sam Altman, who is listed as an investor of Cerebras Systems. OpenAI reveals partnership with SoftBank OpenAI announced a strategic partnership with SB Energy⁠, a SoftBank Group company, as part of project Stargate⁠, and it has been touted as a significant step forward in the build-out of next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) and energy infrastructure in the United States. To support the partnership amid accelerating demand for AI compute, OpenAI and SoftBank Group have each pledged $500 million, which will be invested in SB Energy. OpenAI has also selected SBE to build and operate its previously-announced 1.2 GW data center site in Milam County. The equity funding will support SB Energy’s growth while it focuses on developing several multi-gigawatt data center campuses that are expected to launch service this year. Communities push back against data centers According to the official statement, each project will see SB Energy and OpenAI invest in communities by providing well-paying jobs, workforce development, and grid modernization, thereby facilitating durable economic growth for partner communities. The Milam County Data Center is expected to create thousands of construction jobs and it has been designed to minimize water usage. There are also plans to support the Milam County Data Center’s energy needs while protecting Texas ratepayers. All of those moves show that OpenAI is aware of the growing disdain from regular citizens living around data centers. 2025 saw an uptick in the spread of the Not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) movement as more people, tired of the noise pollution and water-consuming data centers in their neighborhoods, started clamoring for them to be dismantled or prevented from being built. In response to those grievances, companies have been working on better solutions like liquid cooling to replace the noisy HVACs and promises of durable economic growth for those areas. However, people remain skeptical, and many have downright refused, attempting to fight what they’re now calling a cancer. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

DeFi Education Fund found eight amendments whose descriptions, it says, would “seriously harm DeFi technology and/or make market structure legislation worse for software developers.” It called on senators to oppose measures submitted by Senators Jack Reed, Andy Kim, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Elizabeth Warren ahead of the committee’s consideration of the CLARITY Act . The latest pushback is one of many that have been ongoing with regard to the CLARITY Act, which the Senate is attempting to pass before the 2026 midterm elections. DeFi Education Fund’s post comes just one day before the Senate Banking Committee markup session, which will address the amendments filed by senators, some of which touch on developer protections, stablecoin yields, and anti-money laundering requirements. What are the proposed amendments to the CLARITY Act? DeFi Education Fund singled out proposals that would authorize Treasury to sanction smart contracts, narrow definitions of non-controlling developers, and expand FinCEN authority over blockchain platforms. The group warned that Amendment 42, submitted by Senators Reed and Kim, would grant Treasury powers to sanction “smart contracts and centralized platforms facilitating illicit activity.” It also flagged while Amendment 75 by Senator Cortez Masto for proposing to prohibit transactions with unlawful DeFi protocols. “We’re very conscious of how illicit finance is treated in the bill, but we need to make sure that there are not obligations put on codes instead of person, or make sure that there isn’t some inadvertent way that the technology is burdened in a way that it can’t comply,” Amanda Tuminelli, chief legal officer at the DeFi Education Fund, told CNBC . The group has partnered with Stand with Crypto to score senators based on how they vote on amendments affecting DeFi and self-custody rights. Senator Warren, who is one of the leading critics of the legislation, has submitted more than 20 amendments. DeFi Education Fund pointed out that the senator made Amendment 104, where she struck out “gratuitous distribution carveout for crypto offerings.” Committee moves to debunk myths surrounding CLARITY Act The Senate Banking Committee, led by Republican Chairman Tim Scott, released a “ Myth vs Fact ” document this week. The committee debunked the myth that “the bill enables illicit finance to occur through decentralized finance (DeFi) trading protocols.” The committee stated that the bill does the opposite. “It targets illicit activity while protecting lawful software development and innovation,” the committee wrote, adding that “code is protected — misconduct is not.” The committee also debunked the myth that “the bill puts banks, taxpayers, and the financial system at risk.” It stated that “at its core, this is an investor protection bill. It brings digital assets into a clear regulatory framework, where bad actors are held responsible for fraud, manipulation, and abuse.” According to the committee, the bill is designed to prevent a repeat of the FTX collapse and provide a “regulatory framework where investors are informed about material risks, insiders are prevented from manipulating markets, and bad actors are penalized.” It went further to clarify five other myths that have spread with respect to the bill. The House passed its version of the CLARITY Act in July 2025 with bipartisan support by a vote of 294 to 134. No vember midterm elections loom large Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has threatened to withdraw support if the Senate introduces restrictions on stablecoin rewards. However, critics of the framework have claimed that it largely benefits established players such as Coinbase and Circle at the expense of smaller innovators. Crypto advocates admit the urgency of speeding up this legislative push, with one eye on the November midterm elections. Depending on how those votes go, a lot of the legislative progress achieved coul d sk id off the rails under a less conducive political climate.

All tokens that have gotten their own exchange-traded product (ETP) will enjoy this treatment. Although this does not have an immediate impact on the price of XRP, it does provide further regulatory clarity for institutions that want to embrace cryptos and include them in their portfolios and treasury strategies. XRP Price Prediction: The 200D EMA Is The Key Resistance to Watch Wall Street’s interest in XRP has been accelerating ever since the first ETF linked to this token was launched in the U.S. Data from SoSoValue shows that these funds have pulled in over $1.5 billion in assets in just a couple of months. Source: TradingView XRP booked a strong gain yesterday after 7 consecutive days of losses. The daily chart shows a clear rejection of a move above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), making this the key resistance to watch if the price keeps rising. A move above this line could push XPR back to $3.20. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just hit the 14-day moving average and, depending on what the oscillator does next, it will confirm the price’s future trajectory. Meanwhile, the token may still drop to $1.95 if bearish momentum gains traction. Investors are increasingly paying attention to new projects and top crypto presales like Bitcoin ($HYPER) as institutional adoption accelerates. With more than $30 million raised in a short period, this Solana-based layer-2 chain for BTC seems to have popped up on their radar already. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Helps BTC Holders Earn Passive Income Easily and Safely Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is opening the door for Bitcoin holders to finally earn yield, stake, and access DeFi without ever leaving the Bitcoin network.

Local firms in China have now been instructed to stop using cybersecurity from certain companies in the U.S. and Israel citing concerns that Western technology is vulnerable to cyberattacks. Chinese authorities have instructed local firms to stop using cybersecurity software produced by more than 12 companies from the United States and Israel. The decision is due to concerns that Western software could be used to collect and transmit sensitive Chinese data to foreign governments. What cybersecurity companies are banned in China? The list of embargoed U.S. companies includes Broadcom-owned VMware, Palo Alto Networks, and Fortinet. Other major American firms affected are CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Rapid7, and McAfee. Even Alphabet-owned firms, such as Mandiant and Wiz , are included on the blacklist. The ban also targets some companies from Israel including, Check Point Software Technologies, Orca Security, and Cato Networks. CyberArk, which was recently purchased by Palo Alto Networks, is also on the list. Additionally, Imperva, which is now owned by the French firm Thales, has been restricted. In reaction to the news , Broadcom’s shares dropped by more than 5% during Wednesday trading. Palo Alto Networks saw a decline of about 1%, while Fortinet fell by roughly 2%. CrowdStrike , SentinelOne and Recorded Future clarified that they do business in the country, but other companies like Fortinet operate three offices in mainland China and one in Hong Kong. Broadcom has six locations in China, and Palo Alto Networks has five. Why is China banning cybersecurity firms? China and the U.S. are currently in a period of intense competition for the lead in technological innovation. Beijing has long promoted a policy known as “Xinchuang,” which aims to achieve self-reliance in the technology sector. Chinese officials have also expressed growing concerns that Western equipment is inherently vulnerable to hacking by foreign powers since Western cybersecurity firms frequently allege Chinese state-sponsored hacking. Check Point, for instance, recently published a report about a Chinese operation targeting European government offices. Palo Alto Networks also recently alleged that Chinese hackers were targeting diplomats worldwide. Beijing has consistently denied these allegations. Chinese firms are also being pressured to switch to local providers like 360 Security Technology and Neusoft. The U.S. previously took similar actions against Chinese and Russian firms, banning Russia’s Kaspersky Lab software in 2024. Recently, China has also increased pressure on its state-owned enterprises to stop using Western consulting firms and hardware.

In an announcement by jesse.base.eth in an X post, the group indicated that the Base App is now going to make trading its main operation to bring demand and distribution to assets throughout the on-chain economy. The app, introduced in July, through which hundreds of thousands of individuals have created, traded, saved, spent, and built, is being rebranded as a key asset-trading and use hub. U ser feedback drives trading-first focus On his thread, jesse.base.eth explained the new direction as making the Base App trading-first, to have the ability to push demand and distribution of all assets, and to be the best app at whatever you do in the onchain economy. He has identified three key themes in user feedback. Several respondents have requested high-quality assets, and interaction with such assets is cited as one of the applications. Tl;dr: We’re focusing the Base app to be trading-first to drive demand and distribution for every asset and to be the best app for whatever you do in the onchain economy. Since announcing the Base app in July, hundreds of thousands of you have used the app to create, trade,… — jesse.base.eth (@jessepollak) January 14, 2026 The update showed that the Base App will be use-case-oriented and provide a broader selection of assets. It declared that on a tokenized and tradable world, the ambition is to move demand and distribution everywhere, and that the app would be the ideal location for trading and using all assets. The change raised questions on the suitability of mini apps, which had been sold as consumer experience tools and onboarding creators, to the new focus. Juampi.eth, in a response, questioned the relevance of mini apps and stated that he considered the finance-first strategy to align with previous feedback. He stated that he was looking forward to seeing how the Base App evolves in what he referred to as a new tokenized era. In reply to that, jesse.base.eth said that mini apps are still a priority. He said that miniapps will still be part of this vision, and the team is working on improving discoverability and refining tooling to measure their performance. The tooling has leaderboards and impact measures, including the number of people mini apps have onboarded. He further stated that the aim of transitioning to the trading-first model is to move more distribution, rather than less, which suggests that mini apps will also benefit from the distribution focus. Armstrong outlines retail and multichain priorities Brian Armstrong also shared some words on the development of the Base App. He confirmed that the product is still in iteration mode following its launch. In the future, Armstrong indicated that the app would target retail investors and traders, with the latter segment expected to grow. He further explained that the feed will be extended to cover a larger range of assets and assist all those building on the foundation. Armstrong also indicated that the Base App will be multi-chain, with Base being its main focus, allowing users to access anything they desire onchain using the product. He stated that the goal is to establish an environment that enables innovation and onchain to build as a result of concentrating on introducing more demand.

This adjustment, reported by The Block on November 26, 2024, reflects a broader reassessment of companies navigating the complex intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. The firm now projects a $440 target, a substantial 12% cut from its previous $500 valuation, signaling heightened caution among institutional analysts. Decoding the TD Cowen Price Target Revision TD Cowen’s revised analysis points directly to two interconnected factors driving its more conservative outlook. First, the firm identifies the dilution of stock value as a primary concern. This dilution stems from Strategy’s continued issuance of both common and preferred shares. Consequently, this activity increases the total number of shares outstanding. Therefore, it reduces the ownership percentage and potential earnings per share for existing investors. Second, analysts cite weakened Bitcoin profitability as a core financial headwind. Many companies like Strategy, which operate in the crypto-mining or blockchain infrastructure space, tie their revenue models directly to the price and network efficiency of Bitcoin. Recent fluctuations in Bitcoin’s market value and rising operational costs, particularly energy expenses, have compressed margins across the industry. The Mechanics of Share Dilution and Market Impact Share dilution represents a fundamental shift in a company’s capital structure. When a firm issues additional shares, it raises capital but spreads its equity over a larger base. For existing shareholders, this often translates to a decrease in the value of their individual holdings unless the raised capital generates superior returns. TD Cowen’s report suggests that Strategy’s pace of share issuance may have outstripped the immediate value creation from the capital raised. This scenario creates a challenging environment for stock price appreciation. Furthermore, preferred shares often carry dividend obligations or conversion rights that can create future overhangs on common stock value. The market typically reacts negatively to aggressive dilution unless it funds a clear, high-growth trajectory. Bitcoin’s Role in Corporate Valuation The linkage between Bitcoin’s performance and corporate profitability is now a critical lens for analysts. Companies such as Strategy, which may engage in mining, trading, or treasury management of Bitcoin, see their bottom lines fluctuate with the cryptocurrency’s price and network dynamics. The past year has witnessed increased volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and rising hash rates—the computational power required for mining. A higher hash rate means more competition and cost for each mined Bitcoin. TD Cowen’s downgrade implies that Strategy’s operational model may not be sufficiently resilient to these pressures. This analysis aligns with a broader trend of financial institutions applying more rigorous, traditional valuation metrics to crypto-native businesses, moving beyond pure speculation on asset prices. Comparative Analysis of Analyst Sentiment TD Cowen’s action does not exist in a vacuum. It is essential to contextualize this price target cut within the wider landscape of analyst coverage for crypto-linked stocks. Other major firms may hold differing views based on their assessment of long-term Bitcoin adoption, corporate strategy, and balance sheet health. The following table contrasts potential analyst perspectives: Analyst Focus Bullish Perspective Bearish Perspective (TD Cowen) Capital Strategy Share issuance funds aggressive growth and infrastructure. Dilution erodes value without clear near-term payoff. Bitcoin Dependency BTC is a long-term store of value; short-term profit swings are expected. Weakened BTC profitability pressures core business model sustainability. Valuation Model Discounts future cash flows from a dominant market position. Applies risk premium for volatility and dilution. This divergence highlights the ongoing debate about how to value companies in this emerging sector. Moreover, it underscores the importance of investor diligence. Historical Context and Sector-Wide Implications The cryptocurrency market has experienced several cycles of expansion and contraction. Each cycle prompts a reevaluation of business models. The 2022-2023 period, marked by the collapse of several major industry players, led to increased scrutiny on corporate governance and financial sustainability. TD Cowen’s downgrade can be seen as part of this maturation process. Analysts are now prioritizing: Sustainable Capital Management: How companies balance growth funding with shareholder value. Operational Efficiency: Profitability in the face of variable Bitcoin rewards and energy costs. Regulatory Preparedness: Navigating an evolving global regulatory landscape. This event may signal a more cautious phase from institutional researchers. Consequently, other firms with similar profiles could face analogous reassessments if their financial metrics show similar strains. Expert Insights on Valuation Adjustments Financial analysts emphasize that price target revisions are dynamic tools. They reflect new data and changing market conditions. A downgrade from a firm like TD Cowen, which possesses extensive experience in sector analysis, carries significant weight. It communicates to the market that the firm’s proprietary models have incorporated negative signals that outweigh positive ones. These signals include both internal company actions (share issuance) and external market forces (Bitcoin economics). For investors, such a report is not merely a suggestion to sell. Instead, it is a critical data point urging a review of the investment thesis. It asks whether the company’s strategy can overcome the highlighted challenges of dilution and crypto market volatility. Conclusion TD Cowen’s decision to lower its price target for Strategy to $440 serves as a stark reminder of the complex factors influencing crypto-correlated equities. The dual pressures of share dilution and weakened Bitcoin profitability form the core of this analytical downgrade. This move provides a concrete example of how traditional financial scrutiny is being applied to the digital asset ecosystem. It highlights the growing need for companies in this space to demonstrate not just technological innovation but also robust financial discipline and adaptive business models. As the sector evolves, such analyst reports will remain vital for understanding the intersection of conventional finance and the cryptocurrency revolution. FAQs Q1: Why did TD Cowen lower the price target for Strategy? TD Cowen cited two main reasons: the dilution of stock value from continued issuance of common and preferred shares, and weakened profitability linked to Bitcoin’s market performance and mining economics. Q2: What does a price target downgrade from $500 to $440 mean? It represents a 12% reduction in the firm’s projected future stock value. This signals that analysts have become more cautious about the company’s growth prospects and financial health. Q3: How does Bitcoin profitability affect a company like Strategy? Many such companies rely on Bitcoin mining, trading, or holdings for revenue. If Bitcoin’s price falls or mining costs rise, their profit margins compress, directly impacting earnings and valuation. Q4: What is share dilution, and why is it negative? Share dilution occurs when a company issues new stock, increasing the total shares outstanding. This can reduce the ownership percentage and earnings per share for existing investors unless the new capital generates exceptional returns. Q5: Is this downgrade specific to Strategy, or is it a sector-wide trend? While specific to Strategy’s financials, the underlying issues—managing dilution and navigating Bitcoin market cycles—are relevant to the entire crypto-correlated sector. Other firms may face similar scrutiny if their financials show comparable pressures.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/652-billion-shiba-inu-shib-in-24-hours-heres-what-happened/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) recorded an exceptionally large volume of token movement over 24 hours, with more than 652 billion SHIB transferred across exchanges and private wallets. While the figure itself is striking, the underlying data suggests that the activity reflects heightened repositioning rather than a decisive market shift. On-chain indicators show that both exchange inflows and exchange outflows increased sharply within the same timeframe. This simultaneous rise signals active participation from different market segments rather than a single dominant trend such as mass accumulation or panic selling. Exchange Data Points to Mixed Market Intentions A closer look at exchange behavior reveals contrasting strategies among SHIB holders. On one hand, rising outflows indicate that a segment of large holders moved tokens away from exchanges, a pattern often associated with reduced immediate selling pressure. On the other hand, elevated inflows suggest that another group transferred SHIB onto exchanges, potentially in preparation for trading, portfolio adjustments, or short-term selling. Despite the surge in transactional volume, overall exchange reserves increased slightly. This marginal rise implies that while some investors are withdrawing tokens, others are positioning SHIB for potential liquidity use. As a result, the broader market posture remains cautious rather than clearly optimistic or bearish. Price Action Reflects Market Indecision SHIB’s price behavior mirrors this uncertainty. The token recently rebounded from a local support area and moved above short-term moving averages. However, upward momentum slowed as the price approached stronger resistance levels, particularly near the 100-day exponential moving average. Although trading volume expanded during the recovery attempt, follow-through strength remained limited. Momentum indicators, including the Relative Strength Index, remain near midpoint levels, suggesting neither exhaustion nor overheating. This positioning typically reflects a market awaiting a clearer direction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Volatility Risk Remains Elevated The concentration of large-scale on-chain transfers increases the likelihood of heightened volatility in the near term. While the current data does not confirm a directional bias, such periods of intense activity often precede sharper price movements once conviction returns. If SHIB succeeds in breaking above key resistance levels with sustained volume, bullish continuation may follow. Conversely, failure to overcome these barriers could invite renewed downside pressure, amplified by the same liquidity now circulating through the market. At present, Shiba Inu remains in a state of balance , supported by demand but constrained by resistance. The recent surge in on-chain transfers underscores growing market engagement, though direction will depend on how participants act on this liquidity in the days ahead.

This calculated transition signals a profound commitment to influencing the core of next-generation financial systems. Consequently, the foundation aims to directly engage with U.S. regulatory frameworks and innovation ecosystems. Algorand Foundation’s Headquarters Relocation: A Strategic Analysis The Algorand Foundation’s decision represents more than a simple change of address. It constitutes a deliberate realignment of operational and strategic focus. CEO Staci Warden articulated the rationale clearly. She emphasized a mission to deploy blockchain technology where it delivers tangible, real-world impact. The foundation specifically targets three critical areas: immediate global payments , accessibility to financial products , and economic resilience . Therefore, moving to the United States positions the organization at the nexus of global finance and technological regulation. Historically, Singapore served as a welcoming hub for crypto enterprises. Its clear regulatory guidelines attracted numerous foundations. However, the U.S. market presents unparalleled scale and influence. By establishing its primary base there, the Algorand Foundation seeks to collaborate directly with policymakers, financial institutions, and developers. This move could accelerate the integration of Algorand’s proof-of-stake protocol into mainstream financial infrastructure. Implications for US Blockchain Leadership and Regulation Warden’s statement underscores a broader ambition: helping the United States secure a leadership role in building next-generation financial infrastructure. This goal arrives amid intense global competition. Jurisdictions like the European Union, with its MiCA framework, and the UK are actively shaping crypto regulations. The foundation’s relocation is a vote of confidence in the evolving U.S. regulatory landscape. It suggests a belief that constructive engagement can yield a balanced framework fostering innovation while ensuring security. Furthermore, the launch of a new board of directors coincides with the move. This restructuring likely brings diverse expertise in finance, technology, and governance. A refreshed leadership team can navigate complex U.S. financial ecosystems more effectively. The foundation may also increase its engagement with U.S.-based academic institutions and research centers. Such partnerships could drive advancements in blockchain scalability and security. Expert Perspective: Navigating a Shifting Global Landscape Industry analysts view this relocation as a timely strategic play. The global regulatory environment for digital assets is crystallizing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are defining their oversight roles. By being physically present, the Algorand Foundation can participate in crucial dialogues. It can advocate for standards that recognize the unique attributes of proof-of-stake networks like Algorand, which emphasize energy efficiency and speed. Comparatively, other blockchain entities have made similar jurisdictional choices. The Ethereum Foundation remains based in Switzerland, while many development firms operate globally. The Algorand Foundation’s choice is distinctly market-oriented. It prioritizes direct access to the world’s largest capital markets and a vast developer community. Data from GitHub and other developer platforms shows consistent growth in U.S.-based blockchain projects. Proximity to this talent pool is a significant advantage. Technical and Ecosystem Impacts of the Move The relocation is not merely administrative. It will influence the Algorand ecosystem’s technical trajectory and partnership strategy. The foundation governs the development and decentralization of the Algorand blockchain. Its physical presence in the U.S. could streamline collaborations with American enterprises exploring blockchain solutions. Sectors like real-world asset (RWA) tokenization , central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) , and decentralized finance (DeFi) compliance are key growth areas. Consider the following potential focus areas post-relocation: Regulatory Technology (RegTech): Developing tools for compliant DeFi and institutional onboarding. Interoperability Standards: Engaging with U.S. bodies working on blockchain interoperability. Public Sector Partnerships: Exploring use cases with federal and state governments for transparent record-keeping and disbursements. This strategic shift may also affect the ALGO token’s market perception. Institutional investors often favor projects with clear regulatory engagement strategies. The foundation’s move could be interpreted as a step toward greater institutional adoption. Conclusion The Algorand Foundation’s headquarters relocation to the United States is a multifaceted strategic decision. It reflects a mature phase in the organization’s lifecycle, prioritizing deep market integration and regulatory collaboration. By focusing on tangible blockchain applications in payments, financial accessibility, and resilience, the foundation aligns itself with pressing global needs. Ultimately, this move could significantly contribute to shaping a more efficient, inclusive, and robust financial infrastructure, with the Algorand blockchain positioned as a foundational layer for future innovation. FAQs Q1: Why did the Algorand Foundation move from Singapore to the United States? The foundation relocated to directly engage with U.S. financial markets, regulatory bodies, and developer communities. CEO Staci Warden stated the goal is to help the U.S. secure leadership in building next-generation financial infrastructure using blockchain technology. Q2: What are the key areas the Algorand Foundation will focus on in the US? The foundation will concentrate on three areas where blockchain can have tangible impact: enabling immediate global payments, increasing accessibility to financial products, and bolstering economic resilience through decentralized systems. Q3: Does this move signal a change in Algorand’s technology or roadmap? The core technology and protocol roadmap remain unchanged. The relocation is primarily a strategic and operational shift aimed at fostering partnerships, influencing policy, and accelerating adoption within a key market. Q4: How might this affect ALGO token holders and ecosystem developers? The move could lead to increased institutional interest and new partnership opportunities within the U.S., potentially driving ecosystem growth and utility. Developers may benefit from closer collaboration with the foundation and access to a larger network. Q5: What is the significance of launching a new board of directors alongside the move? Establishing a new board likely aims to bring in diverse expertise relevant to navigating the complex U.S. financial and regulatory landscape, guiding the foundation’s strategy for maximum impact in its new operational base.

In a series of posts on X, Darkfost said 2025’s leverage build-up was fueled by record activity on Binance, where futures trading volumes “exceeded $25T,” helping push Bitcoin open interest (OI) to an all-time high “of over $15B on October 6.” “To put this into perspective, during the previous bull cycle in November 2021, when Bitcoin hit its ATH, open interest on Binance peaked at $5.7B,” Darkfost wrote. “In other words, OI nearly tripled in 2025. Since that peak, open interest has dropped by more than 31%, stabilizing today around $10B.” Darkfost framed the move as a deleveraging phase that intensified amid “massive liquidations,” with OI slipping below its 180-day moving average, a condition the analyst says has historically mattered more than the raw level of leverage. “These deleveraging periods are crucial, as they help purge the excess leverage built up in the market,” Darkfost wrote. “Historically, they have often marked significant bottoms, effectively resetting the market and creating a stronger base for a potential bullish recovery.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Entering A Supercycle, Fidelity Warns The logic is straightforward: when leverage is forced out, the market can become less vulnerable to cascade-style liquidations and reflexive selling. In that sense, a lower OI environment can reduce the marginal impact of futures positioning on spot, at least compared with the late-stage “crowded trade” conditions that precede sharp drawdowns. But Darkfost warned that a deleveraging signal is not the same thing as a confirmed bottom. “This could be the case again, but caution is warranted,” the analyst wrote, adding that if Bitcoin “continues to slide and fully enters a bear market,” OI could “contract further,” pointing to “deeper deleveraging and a potential extension of the correction.” Bitcoin Sellers Are Losing Momentum Alongside the open interest reset, Darkfost pointed to a sharp drop in futures-driven selling pressure, using Net Taker Volume — a measure intended to capture who is dominating futures order books. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline “Selling pressure on BTC coming from the futures market is sharply declining,” Darkfost wrote, noting that after the monthly average hit “–$489M” at its peak, the figure has now been “divided by ten.” “At the moment, sellers still slightly dominate the order books, with –$51M,” the analyst added. The key nuance is that the indicator has not flipped, but it is moving in that direction. “We have not yet returned to positive territory, but we are getting closer,” Darkfost wrote. “It is very encouraging to see traders starting to change their approach, especially given the significant impact futures volumes have on price action. Notably, since this decline in selling pressure began, BTC price action has also stabilized.” For the “bottom thesis” to graduate into a more forceful reversal call, Darkfost anchored the trigger to that sign change: “If Net Taker Volume were to turn positive again, it would clearly ignite the fuse for a bullish reversal.” At press time, BTC traded at $95,131.

57171674,657726,1768435252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57171674.jpeg,What Russia’s Crypto Regulation Overhaul Means for Investors and Market Access,https://bitcoinist.com/what-russias-crypto-regulation-overhaul-means/,"Russia is preparing a transition in their crypto market regulations, with a new draft bill expected to reach the State Duma during the spring 2026 parliamentary session. The proposal, led by Financial Markets Committee chairman Anatoly Aksakov, would remove digital assets from the country’s “special financial regulation” category and allow wider participation in crypto markets. While the move signals broader acceptance of crypto in everyday finance, it also introduces clear risk limits. If approved, the legislation would represent one of Russia’s most significant policy changes regarding digital assets in recent years, reshaping both domestic trading and cross-border cryptocurrency use. Retail Access Gets Clear Investment Limits Under the draft bill, non-qualified investors, those who do not meet professional or institutional standards, would be allowed to buy cryptocurrencies worth up to 300,000 rubles (about $3,800). The cap is designed to mitigate financial risk for everyday users while still providing them with access to the market. Qualified and professional participants, including financial firms, would not face similar restrictions. This two-tier system reflects the government’s approach to striking a balance between market access and investor protection. Regulators are also considering a risk-awareness test for retail participants. The Bank of Russia previously proposed that non-qualified investors undergo a basic assessment before trading digital assets, ensuring they understand the potential volatility and associated financial risks. Similarly, the central bank has reaffirmed its opposition to anonymous and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. These assets would remain restricted under the new framework to maintain transparency and regulatory oversight. Cross-Border Payments and Regulatory Implications Beyond domestic trading, the bill could expand the use of crypto for international settlements. Aksakov has stated that the framework may enable Russian-issued digital tokens to be used in foreign markets, potentially facilitating cross-border payments. This aligns with Russia’s earlier decision to legalize cryptocurrency for certain international transactions, following Western sanctions that limited access to traditional banking systems. Digital assets are increasingly viewed as an alternative tool for trade and financial transfers where conventional channels are restricted. Officials have also discussed recognizing crypto mining as an export-related activity, given its impact on foreign currency inflows despite the lack of physical cross-border movement. What It Means for Investors and the Market For retail investors, the overhaul means regulated access to crypto within defined limits. The 300,000-ruble cap and potential testing requirements aim to reduce systemic and personal financial risk while still allowing participation in digital asset markets. For the broader market, the change signals a shift toward integrating cryptocurrency into standard financial systems, rather than treating it as a niche or experimental asset class. Russia is also advancing its digital ruble project, with a full rollout across state financial systems expected by September 2026. Together, these developments suggest a wider push toward modernizing the country’s digital financial infrastructure.

This decisive action, reported by the analytics platform Onchain Lens, represents one of the largest single staking maneuvers witnessed in 2025 and underscores a profound, long-term conviction in the Ethereum network’s future. The transaction, involving 154,304 ETH, elevates the entity’s total staked Ethereum to a colossal 1.685 million ETH, valued at approximately $5.65 billion. This development, occurring against a backdrop of evolving regulatory clarity and technological upgrades, provides a powerful signal about institutional capital flows within the digital asset ecosystem. Decoding the monumental Bitmine ETH stake The recent staking activity by the Bitmine-linked address is not an isolated event but a continuation of a significant accumulation strategy. According to the on-chain data, the address staked the 154,304 ETH over a concentrated four-hour period. Consequently, this brings its total staked Ethereum holdings to 1,685,088 ETH. To provide context, this single entity now controls a staking position equivalent to roughly 1.4% of all staked ETH on the Beacon Chain. For comparison, the table below illustrates the scale of this stake against other known large validators. Entity / Pool Approximate Staked ETH Market Value (Est.) Bitmine-linked Address 1,685,088 ETH $5.65 Billion Lido DAO (Largest Pool) ~9.2 Million ETH ~$30.8 Billion Coinbase (Exchange Pool) ~4.1 Million ETH ~$13.7 Billion This scale of commitment requires substantial infrastructure and operational security. Staking on Ethereum involves locking assets to help secure the proof-of-stake network and validate transactions. In return, stakers earn rewards, currently averaging between 3-5% annually. However, the primary motivation for such a large-scale stake likely extends beyond mere yield generation. Analysts point to several strategic rationales: Long-Term Network Alignment: Committing capital of this magnitude demonstrates a strategic bet on Ethereum’s long-term utility and value accrual. Voting Power Influence: Large stakers gain proportional influence in future network governance decisions. Portfolio Strategy: For an institutional entity like Bitmine, staking provides a way to put idle treasury assets to productive use while maintaining exposure to ETH’s price appreciation. The evolving landscape of Ethereum staking The timing of this massive stake is particularly noteworthy within the broader narrative of Ethereum’s development. The network has successfully navigated several critical upgrades post-Merge, enhancing its scalability, security, and sustainability. Furthermore, the regulatory environment for staking-as-a-service in major jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union has gained clearer definition over the past year. This clarity has ostensibly given large institutional players the confidence to deploy capital at scale without fear of punitive regulatory action. The staking ecosystem itself has matured dramatically since its inception. Initially dominated by solo stakers and early adopters, the landscape now features sophisticated institutional-grade providers offering non-custodial solutions, insurance, and advanced key management. This professionalization lowers the barrier to entry for entities managing billions, making a $500 million stake a feasible operational decision rather than a technological gamble. Institutional confidence and market impact From an expert market structure perspective, a stake of this size has several immediate and secondary effects. Primarily, it acts as a powerful bullish signal to the market. Removing over 150,000 ETH from immediate circulation reduces sell-side pressure, as these assets are now locked and subject to a withdrawal queue. This effectively decreases the liquid supply, a fundamental metric watched closely by analysts. Secondly, it validates the staking economic model for other large holders, potentially encouraging further institutional participation. The move also highlights the growing importance of on-chain analytics platforms like Onchain Lens. These tools provide transparency, allowing the market to see capital movements in real-time that were once opaque. This transparency, in turn, contributes to market efficiency and price discovery. While the address is only “presumed” to belong to Bitmine, the firm’s historical activity and the address’s behavioral patterns provide strong circumstantial evidence. True to journalistic standards, we note this attribution is based on credible on-chain analysis and industry reporting, not official confirmation. Conclusion The additional $519.8 million Bitmine ETH stake represents a landmark event in the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. It transcends a simple transaction, instead signaling deep institutional confidence in Ethereum’s foundational technology and its economic future. This action, resulting in a total $5.65 billion position, underscores the strategic shift of major capital allocators from speculative trading to infrastructure participation and long-term network alignment. As the staking landscape continues to evolve with clearer regulations and better tools, such large-scale commitments are likely to become more commonplace, further cementing proof-of-stake as the standard for securing next-generation blockchain networks. The market will now watch closely for any ripple effects on ETH’s liquidity, validator decentralization, and the potential response from other major digital asset holders. FAQs Q1: What does it mean to “stake” Ethereum? Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum. Users lock up a certain amount of their cryptocurrency to support network operations, and in return, they earn rewards. Q2: Why is this Bitmine-linked stake so significant? The scale is significant. Staking over $500 million in a single move and controlling a $5.65 billion total stake demonstrates unprecedented institutional-scale commitment, reduces liquid ETH supply, and serves as a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability. Q3: Can staked Ethereum be lost? Yes, through a process called “slashing.” If a validator (the entity running the staking software) acts maliciously or is frequently offline, a portion of their staked ETH can be penalized and destroyed. Reputable institutional stakers use robust infrastructure to minimize this risk. Q4: How does this affect the average Ethereum investor? While indirect, large stakes can positively impact network security and reduce sell pressure, which are fundamentally bullish for the asset’s value. It also normalizes staking as a core activity, potentially leading to more user-friendly staking products for all investors. Q5: Is the identity of the staker 100% confirmed? No. On-chain analysis is pseudonymous. The attribution to Bitmine is based on the address’s historical transaction patterns, size, and correlation with known Bitmine activity, making it a highly probable but not officially confirmed association.

The product lineup is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm, the main Swedish stock exchange, which trades in Swedish krona (SEK). The company noted that the ETPs were accessible to a healthy mix of both retail and professional investors, adding that they were available on standard brokerage platforms commonly used by Swedish investors. The firm also explained that, depending on the platform, some of the products could qualify for Sweden’s tax-advantaged ISK savings accounts. During the announcement, the U.S.-based digital asset management company also said that Marco Poblete and Andre Havas have been appointed to help lead the company’s growth across the Nordic region, which includes Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. Bitwise combines crypto and traditional assets in new ETP lineup The seven Bitwise ETPs in Stockholm offer several cryptocurrencies. Some are based on a single cryptocurrenc y, while others offer a wider range of digital assets or a mix of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets, such as gold. One of the new listings features a Bitwise Core Bitcoin ETP , offering straightforward exposure to the price of Bitcoin. Bitwise has launched spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETPs, which are backed by actual tokens, including Bitcoin and Ether, held in secure facilities. This provides investors with assurance that real assets back the products. The company provided staking-linked ETPs tethered to Ether and Solana. These products link to a network using its staking facility. Staking helps to keep the blockchain secure and can earn rewards over time. Meanwhile, Bitwise also added its MSCI Digital Assets Select 20 ETP, which tracks the twenty largest cryptocurrencies by market value. These add to a single product that cuts exposure to multiple large digital assets. The digital asset management company is rolling out a hybrid product that combines Bitcoin with gold, appealing to investors seeking both modern and traditional stores of value. Gold has always been seen as a classic safe-haven asset . Meanwhile, Bitcoin has sometimes been called “digital gold,” and the pairing is said to offer a healthy and diverse blend of the two. Bitwise underlined that the underlying crypto assets fully support all of these ETPs. The holdings are stored in institutional cold storage, where they are kept offline at secure facilities to help reduce hacking risk and improve security. Bitwise also pointed out that independent auditors verify the holdings every week, so investors can go away confident that everything is accurate and correct in their accounts. Bitwise accelerates U.S. expansion Bitwise has also been expanding in the United States, particularly in 2025, as American regulation of digital assets has become clearer. With clearer rules, there was less confusion and fewer enforcement worries for companies working in the crypto space. In September 2025, Bitwise filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create a Stablecoin & Tokenization ETF. This fund is designed to track companies that work with stablecoins, tokenization technology, payment systems, exchanges, and regulated cryptocurrency funds. Tokenization refers to the process of converting real-world assets, such as property, art, or financial instruments, into digital tokens. In October 2025, Bitwise launched a Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This allowed U.S. investors to gain exposure to Solana (SOL) and its staking rewards through a traditional financial product, rather than using a cryptocurrency wallet. Then, in December 2025, Bitwise filed to launch a spot Sui ETF that would follow the price of the Sui token. Bitwise selected Coinbase to act as the custodian for the Sui assets. The SEC has not yet decided on similar spot Sui ETF filings submitted by Canary Capital and 21Shares. According to Bitwise researcher Ryan Rasmussen, changes made by the SEC in September 2025 may enable the launch of more than 100 new crypto ETPs in 2026, thanks to the adoption of generic listing standards that facilitate faster and simpler approvals.

He even called the latest draft worse than having no legislation at all. He mentioned that Coinbase could not support the bill after reviewing the Senate Banking Committee draft over the past 48 hours. Armstrong suggested that the proposal would leave the crypto industry in a weaker position from now on. This comes in when the digital assets market is riding on a bullish wave. The cumulative crypto market cap spiked by 3% in the last 24 hours amid the bill being announced. Bitcoin is moving ahead to reclaim $98,000 while Ethereum looks to smash $3,500. Coinbase CEO flags privacy risks In an X post , Coinbase CEO stated that the company would prefer no bill to what he described as a bad bill. He added that the draft contains too many problems to fix through minor changes. He warned that the text would ban tokenized equities. However, it would also restrict DeFi activity and reduce user privacy by giving the government access to financial records. As per his list, the bill would weaken the role of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It would expand the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Armstrong criticised draft amendments tied to stablecoins. He said proposals that would limit or eliminate rewards on stablecoins. This move would allow banks to block competition. Such changes would protect incumbents rather than consumers. He further wrote that “We appreciate the hard work by members of the Senate to reach a bipartisan outcome.” “But this version would be materially worse than the current status quo. We would rather have no bill than a bad bill.” Coinbase would continue to engage with lawmakers and push for changes to the draft. Meanwhile, he remains positive that a better version could still come out through further negotiations. Over 137 amendments filed Massive comments were made to the public after US senators unveiled draft legislation for crypto. Lawmakers expect that the bill would clarify which regulators oversee different parts of the crypto sector if it becomes law. The crypto industry has been asking for such laws for years after witnessing multiple hacks, scams, Rug pulls, and more. One of the main goals of the bill is to define when a digital token should be treated as a security or a commodity. This definition has been at the core of disputes between crypto firms and regulators. The proposal would give the CFTC authority to oversee spot crypto markets. That approach has been supported by much of the industry. Many firms view the CFTC as a more principles based regulator than the SEC. Banks have argued that paying rewards on stablecoins could pull deposits out of the insured banking system. They have warned that this could raise financial stability concerns if large amounts of money move into such products. The draft has reportedly attracted more than 137 proposed amendments till now. Lawmakers expect several changes before any final vote. Meanwhile, Industry groups have accused banks of exerting heavy influence over the process. Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger said progress is being slowed by pressure from large financial institutions. She said that banks are seeking to rewrite the bill to protect their market position. She added that proposals to eliminate stablecoin rewards are designed to limit consumer choice. This will also block new products before they can compete.

According to a comprehensive new report from South Korean blockchain consulting firm ARK Point, the shared sequencer solution Espresso represents a transformative approach to unifying fragmented blockchain ecosystems while meeting the real-time demands of global finance. Espresso Blockchain: The Infrastructure Bridge Solution The blockchain industry faces a fundamental infrastructure dilemma. While rollup technology has successfully scaled transaction execution capacity, it has simultaneously created a fragmented ecosystem of isolated chains. These rollups, though efficient individually, struggle to communicate seamlessly. Consequently, they rely heavily on Ethereum’s Layer 1 for security and coordination. However, this dependence creates significant bottlenecks for applications requiring instant settlement. ARK Point’s detailed analysis, titled “Espresso: Building a Global Baselayer for the Rollup Economy,” identifies this fragmentation as the primary obstacle to blockchain adoption in mainstream finance. The report explains that Ethereum’s 12 to 15-minute finality time remains completely inadequate for modern financial services, trading platforms, and consumer applications that demand sub-second confirmation. This infrastructure gap has prevented blockchain technology from achieving its full potential in sectors where speed and reliability are non-negotiable. The Shared Sequencer Architecture Explained Espresso addresses this challenge through an innovative architectural approach. The project functions as a high-performance, decentralized consensus and finality layer specifically engineered for the rollup ecosystem. Unlike traditional systems that process transactions sequentially on individual chains, Espresso introduces a shared sequencing mechanism. This mechanism enables multiple rollups to coordinate their transaction ordering through a common, decentralized network. The technical architecture delivers several critical advantages: Two-Second Finality: Current implementation achieves transaction finality in just two seconds Sub-Second Roadmap: Development timeline targets sub-one-second finality in future upgrades Decentralized Security: Maintains blockchain’s trust-minimized properties while enhancing speed Interoperability Focus: Designed specifically to connect disparate rollup chains This architecture represents a significant departure from current models. Traditional blockchain systems treat each chain as an independent entity with its own sequencing process. In contrast, Espresso’s shared sequencer creates what ARK Point describes as a “global baselayer” – a foundational infrastructure layer that unifies the entire rollup economy. Industry Adoption and Integration Timeline Major blockchain platforms have already recognized Espresso’s potential. According to the ARK Point report, several industry leaders have progressed beyond initial testing phases. Celo (CELO), known for its mobile-first blockchain approach, has begun integrating Espresso as core infrastructure. Similarly, Arbitrum (ARB) developer Offchain Labs and Polygon (POL) are implementing the shared sequencer solution into their respective ecosystems. This adoption pattern suggests a broader industry trend. Blockchain developers increasingly recognize that execution scaling alone cannot solve the infrastructure problem. The industry now requires coordination scaling – solutions that enable multiple scaled chains to work together efficiently. Espresso’s architecture directly addresses this need by providing the missing coordination layer that connects execution-optimized rollups. Infrastructure Comparison: Current vs. Espresso Model Feature Current Ethereum + Rollups Espresso Shared Sequencer Finality Time 12-15 minutes 2 seconds (sub-1 second planned) Cross-Rollup Communication Slow, via Layer 1 Instant, via shared sequencing Infrastructure Model Fragmented chains Unified baselayer Financial Application Suitability Limited by speed Optimized for real-time services Real-World Applications and Financial Integration The implications for financial services are particularly significant. Traditional finance operates on millisecond timeframes for trading, settlement, and transaction processing. Current blockchain infrastructure cannot meet these requirements, creating what industry experts call the “financial integration gap.” Espresso’s architecture directly targets this gap by providing the speed and reliability that financial institutions demand. Several potential applications emerge from this infrastructure improvement: High-Frequency Trading: Blockchain-based trading platforms could match traditional exchange speeds Instant Settlement Systems: Financial settlements could occur in seconds rather than days Cross-Border Payments: International transfers could achieve near-instant finality Consumer Applications: Retail payment systems could leverage blockchain without speed compromises ARK Point’s analysis emphasizes that infrastructure improvements must precede widespread adoption. The report argues that blockchain technology already possesses the security and transparency features that financial institutions value. However, the speed limitations have prevented serious consideration for core financial operations. Espresso’s shared sequencer model addresses this fundamental limitation directly. Technical Implementation and Security Considerations The technical implementation of shared sequencing involves careful balance between performance and security. Espresso achieves this balance through several innovative mechanisms. The system uses a decentralized network of sequencers that collectively order transactions across multiple rollups. This approach maintains blockchain’s trust-minimized properties while dramatically improving coordination efficiency. Security considerations remain paramount in this architecture. The system must prevent malicious sequencers from manipulating transaction ordering while maintaining high throughput. Espresso addresses these concerns through cryptographic proofs and economic incentives that align participant behavior with network security. The architecture also maintains compatibility with Ethereum’s security model, allowing rollups to benefit from both Ethereum’s proven security and Espresso’s enhanced performance. Market Impact and Ecosystem Development The blockchain infrastructure market has evolved significantly in recent years. Initial solutions focused primarily on execution scaling through various Layer 2 approaches. However, as ARK Point’s report highlights, the industry now recognizes that coordination represents the next major challenge. The emergence of shared sequencer solutions like Espresso indicates this market evolution. Several factors drive this infrastructure development: Increasing Rollup Proliferation: More chains create greater coordination needs Financial Industry Interest: Traditional finance demands enterprise-grade performance Consumer Application Growth: User expectations favor instant transaction confirmation Developer Experience Demands: Builders seek simpler cross-chain development tools The ecosystem development around shared sequencing solutions suggests broader industry recognition of infrastructure gaps. Multiple projects now explore similar approaches, though Espresso has gained particular traction through its early adoption by major blockchain platforms. This adoption pattern creates network effects that could accelerate industry-wide infrastructure improvements. Conclusion The infrastructure gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology represents one of the most significant barriers to mainstream adoption. ARK Point’s comprehensive analysis of Espresso’s shared sequencer solution reveals a promising path forward. By providing two-second transaction finality with a roadmap to sub-second performance, Espresso addresses the speed limitations that have hindered blockchain’s financial integration. The project’s adoption by major platforms like Celo, Arbitrum, and Polygon demonstrates industry recognition of this infrastructure need. As blockchain technology continues evolving, solutions that bridge execution scaling with coordination efficiency will likely play increasingly critical roles in connecting decentralized systems with global financial infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a shared sequencer in blockchain technology? A shared sequencer is a decentralized network that coordinates transaction ordering across multiple blockchain rollups, enabling faster finality and better interoperability than individual chain sequencing. Q2: How does Espresso achieve faster finality than Ethereum’s base layer? Espresso uses optimized consensus mechanisms specifically designed for rollup coordination, bypassing Ethereum’s 12-15 minute finality delay while maintaining security through decentralized validation. Q3: Which blockchain platforms are currently integrating Espresso? According to ARK Point’s report, Celo (CELO), Arbitrum (through Offchain Labs), and Polygon (POL) have moved beyond testing and are implementing Espresso as core infrastructure. Q4: Why is transaction finality time important for financial applications? Financial services require instant settlement confirmation for trading, payments, and risk management. Current blockchain finality times of 12+ minutes are incompatible with these requirements, creating adoption barriers. Q5: How does Espresso maintain security while improving performance?

This dramatic move, reported by market data provider Alternative.me, marks a significant departure from the prolonged ‘Fear’ and ‘Neutral’ phases that have characterized investor sentiment for over three months. The index’s climb coincides with a notable period of relative stability and cautious optimism across major digital assets, prompting analysts to scrutinize the underlying drivers and potential implications for the 2025 market trajectory. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Enters a New Phase The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple yet powerful scale from 0 to 100. A reading of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ often seen during severe market downturns and capitulation events. Conversely, a score of 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed,’ typically associated with market tops and euphoric buying. The index’s calculation relies on a sophisticated, multi-factor model designed to quantify sentiment from various data sources. This model incorporates six primary components, each assigned a specific weight: Volatility (25%): Measures current price fluctuations against historical averages. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes trading volume and price momentum. Sustained high volume on upward moves can indicate greed. Social Media (15%): Scans platforms like Twitter and Reddit for the volume and sentiment of cryptocurrency mentions. Surveys (15%): Polls market participants directly for their outlook. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Shifts can signal changing risk appetites. Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. The jump to 61, therefore, is not a random fluctuation. It represents a measurable consensus shift across these diverse data points. For context, the index spent much of the final quarter of 2024 oscillating between ‘Fear’ (20-45) and ‘Neutral’ (46-54). The last reading above 60 occurred alongside a major market event—a record-breaking forced liquidation cascade that shook investor confidence. The current ascent into ‘Greed’ lacks such a stark, negative catalyst, suggesting a more organic improvement in market psychology. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Sentiment Shift Several concurrent factors likely contributed to this sustained sentiment improvement. First, macroeconomic conditions have shown tentative signs of stabilization. While challenges persist, perceived reductions in systemic risk can increase capital flow into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Second, the cryptocurrency sector itself has demonstrated resilience. Key networks have maintained high activity levels, and development progress on major protocols has continued unabated, fostering a sense of fundamental strength beneath price action. Third, institutional engagement, while measured, has provided a floor of credibility. The maturation of regulated financial products offering exposure to digital assets has created new avenues for investment. Finally, the historical pattern of the market cannot be ignored. Extended periods of fear and consolidation have often preceded new bullish phases, a cycle well-known to veteran participants. The breach of the psychological ‘Greed’ threshold may act as a self-fulfilling signal, attracting sidelined capital and reinforcing the positive trend. Historical Context and Market Psychology Understanding this index requires examining its historical performance. The table below shows key sentiment zones and their typical market correlations: Index Range Sentiment Zone Typical Market Condition Investor Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear Severe downturn, panic selling Capitulation, avoidance 25-45 Fear Bearish trend, high uncertainty Caution, reduced positions 46-54 Neutral Sideways consolidation, indecision Wait-and-see approach 55-74 Greed Growing optimism, upward trend Increasing FOMO, accumulation 75-100 Extreme Greed Market euphoria, potential bubble Speculative frenzy, leverage The transition from ‘Neutral’ to ‘Greed’ is particularly significant. It often marks the point where cautious optimism transforms into active accumulation. However, analysts consistently warn that sustained readings in ‘Extreme Greed’ (above 75) have frequently preceded major market corrections. The current level of 61 suggests growing confidence but remains distant from the euphoric extremes that signal overheated conditions. This positioning indicates a market that is warming up rather than boiling over. Potential Implications for Investors and the Market The shift to ‘Greed’ carries several immediate implications. For retail investors, it may reduce the perceived risk of entering the market, potentially increasing retail trading volume. For institutional players, it can serve as a data point validating a more risk-on allocation strategy. Furthermore, project developers and companies within the blockchain ecosystem may find it easier to secure funding or launch new initiatives in a more optimistic climate. Nevertheless, seasoned market observers advocate for a balanced perspective. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a superb tool for gauging the market’s emotional temperature, but it is not a standalone timing indicator for buying or selling. Prudent investment strategy combines sentiment analysis with fundamental research on network activity, technological development, and macroeconomic trends. A ‘Greed’ reading suggests the wind is at the market’s back, but it does not guarantee the direction or duration of the journey. Market participants should also monitor the components driving the score. A rise fueled primarily by surging social media hype and search volume may be less sustainable than one supported by strong fundamentals and measured volume increases. The index’s multi-factor design helps mitigate this, but dissecting the contributors provides deeper insight. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s entry into ‘Greed’ territory after more than three months represents a notable inflection point for cryptocurrency market sentiment. This shift, driven by a composite of volatility, volume, social, and survey data, reflects a measurable warming of investor psychology. While it signals growing confidence and may attract further capital, it also calls for informed caution. Historical patterns show that ‘Greed’ can evolve into ‘Extreme Greed,’ a zone often associated with heightened risk. For 2025, this movement underscores a market in transition, moving from a phase of fear and consolidation toward one of optimism and opportunity, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serving as a critical guidepost for navigating the emotional landscape of digital asset investing. FAQs Q1: What does a ‘Greed’ reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index actually mean? A ‘Greed’ reading (55-74) indicates that market participants are becoming increasingly optimistic and confident. Data from volatility, trading volume, social media, and surveys collectively point to a risk-on attitude, where fear of missing out (FOMO) may begin to influence buying behavior. Q2: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? No, the index is not a direct timing signal. It is a sentiment indicator. While extreme readings (both fear and greed) have often coincided with market turning points, it should be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis, not as a standalone tool for making investment decisions. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily, typically reflecting data from the previous 24-hour period. This allows investors and analysts to track short-term shifts in market mood alongside price action. Q4: What caused the index to be in ‘Fear’ for the previous three months? The prolonged ‘Fear’ period was likely driven by a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty, regulatory developments, and a typical cyclical cooling-off period following previous market advances. It represented a phase of consolidation and cautious sentiment. Q5: Can the index predict a cryptocurrency market crash? Not predict, but it can warn of conditions that often precede corrections. Sustained readings in ‘Extreme Greed’ (above 75) have historically indicated overly euphoric and leveraged markets, which are more vulnerable to sharp downturns. The current ‘Greed’ reading is a step in that direction but not yet at an extreme level.

This strategic investment, led by Premji Invest with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Z47, fuels a critical mission: scaling talent pipelines for roles that artificial intelligence cannot replace. Consequently, Emversity is positioning itself at the forefront of solving India’s persistent and widening skills gap. Emversity’s Strategic Focus on AI-Resistant Roles As automation transforms global labor markets, Emversity is making a calculated bet on “grey-collar” professions. These roles require hands-on training, credentialing, and human judgment that current AI systems cannot replicate. Specifically, the startup concentrates on healthcare positions like nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, alongside hospitality roles such as guest relations and food service staff. Founder and CEO Vivek Sinha articulated this vision clearly, stating, “AI can cut down the administrative work of a nurse, such as filing patient details or electronic medical records. But AI can’t replace a nurse if you still need one at an ICU for every two beds.” This insight directly informs the company’s curriculum and partnership strategy. The Stark Reality of India’s Skills Crisis The urgency of Emversity’s work is underscored by severe shortages in key sectors. For instance, the Indian government reports approximately 4.3 million registered nursing personnel, with institutions producing about 387,000 nurses annually. However, industry reports consistently flag a critical shortage. Similarly, the hospitality sector faces an alarming 55% to 60% demand-supply gap for trained workers. These gaps persist even as millions of graduates enter the workforce lacking job-ready skills, a paradox that Emversity’s model directly addresses. A Dual-Pronged Educational Model Emversity employs a hybrid approach to bridge the skills divide effectively. Firstly, it integrates employer-designed training modules directly into the curricula of partner universities and colleges. Secondly, it operates skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and job placements. University Embedding: Partners with 23 universities across 40+ campuses. NSDC Skill Centers: Offers targeted, short-duration certification programs. Employer Collaboration: Co-designs training with industry leaders like Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, and Taj Hotels (IHCL). This dual model ensures both depth through degree integration and breadth through accessible certification pathways. Remarkably, revenue split almost evenly between these two streams last year, demonstrating balanced traction. Funding Growth and Sustainable Economics The recent $30 million all-equity Series A round marks a significant milestone. It elevates Emversity’s post-money valuation to around $120 million, doubling from its $60 million pre-Series A valuation in April 2025. Total funding now stands at $46 million. This capital infusion is earmarked for aggressive expansion to over 200 locations within two years. Financially, the startup operates with robust unit economics, boasting gross margins of approximately 80%. Furthermore, it maintains customer acquisition costs below 10% of revenue by leveraging organic channels and a career counseling platform for high school students, which alone generated over 350,000 inquiries last year. Emversity’s Funding and Growth Snapshot Metric Detail Series A Round $30 million Lead Investor Premji Invest Post-Money Valuation $120 million Total Funding to Date $46 million Key Sectors Healthcare, Hospitality Trained Learners ~4,500 Placements to Date 800 candidates Expansion into New Verticals and Global Ambitions With fresh capital, Emversity plans to deepen its focus on healthcare and hospitality while venturing into new industries. The startup is in advanced discussions with a top Indian Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) company to launch role-specific programs this year. Additionally, manufacturing-focused training initiatives are slated for 2026. To ensure consistent, high-quality outcomes, Emversity combines employer-led curriculum design with hands-on training infrastructure, including simulation labs for clinical roles. While currently serving domestic demand, CEO Vivek Sinha sees a clear future opportunity in international markets, particularly for healthcare workers to address aging populations in countries like Japan and Germany, though a specific timeline remains undisclosed. The Founder’s Experience-Driven Insight The genesis of Emversity lies in Vivek Sinha’s prior experience as COO at Indian edtech giant Unacademy. While working on test-prep for government jobs, he observed a troubling trend: overqualified applicants, including engineers and PhDs, were vying for entry-level positions. This revealed a systemic failure in aligning education with employability. “Some of them had paid fees to private colleges and spent 16 to 18 years earning those degrees,” Sinha noted, highlighting the profound personal and economic cost of the skills mismatch. This firsthand observation became the catalyst for building Emversity’s employer-first, outcome-oriented model. Conclusion Emversity represents a pivotal response to one of India’s most pressing economic challenges: the skills gap. By strategically focusing on training workers for AI-resistant roles in healthcare, hospitality, and beyond, the startup is not just building a business; it is future-proofing human capital. The doubling of its valuation to $120 million reflects strong investor confidence in this mission. As automation accelerates, the demand for credentialed, hands-on professionals will only intensify. Therefore, Emversity’s scalable, dual-pronged training model positions it as a critical infrastructure player in shaping a resilient workforce for India and potentially the world. FAQs Q1: What is Emversity’s core business model? Emversity operates a dual-model workforce training platform. It integrates employer-designed programs into university curricula and runs short-term certification courses through government-affiliated skill centers, primarily for “grey-collar” roles in sectors like healthcare and hospitality. Q2: Why is Emversity focusing on “AI-resistant” jobs? The startup targets roles that require hands-on skills, human judgment, and credentialing that current AI cannot replicate, such as nursing and patient care. This strategy addresses automation’s displacement effect while meeting persistent demand in essential service sectors. Q3: How much funding has Emversity raised, and what is its valuation? Emversity has raised a total of $46 million. Its recent $30 million Series A round, led by Premji Invest, doubled the company’s valuation to approximately $120 million post-money. Q4: What problem is Emversity solving in the Indian market? It addresses a severe skills gap where graduates often lack job-ready skills, even as sectors like healthcare and hospitality face critical shortages of trained personnel, with demand-supply gaps as high as 60%. Q5: What are Emversity’s future expansion plans? The startup plans to expand to over 200 locations in two years, deepen its healthcare and hospitality programs, and enter new verticals like engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), and manufacturing. It also sees long-term potential in catering to international demand for skilled workers.

Analysts at the firm say the trend underscores growing confidence in digital assets as a legitimate investment class. According to JPMorgan’s latest research, total capital flowing into crypto markets reached nearly $130 billion in 2025, marking a roughly one-third increase from 2024 and setting a new annual record. This announcement followed Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, Managing Director of Global Market Strategy at JPMorgan, and his team’s public assertion that the projected surge in institutional investment activities for this year should be primarily driven by newly released crypto regulations, such as the Clarity Act in the United States. Additionally, with these regulations present in the market, the JPMorgan executive claimed that more institutions will demonstrate heightened interest in embracing the use of cryptocurrencies and improve crypto-related activities like crypto venture capital funding, mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings in significant sectors comprising stablecoin issuers , payment firms, exchanges, wallet providers, blockchain infrastructure, and custody services. JPMorgan analysts anticipate an increase in institutional investment activities in the crypto industry To determine the total capital flows into crypto markets, JPMorgan analysts considered several key factors. These factors include flows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), trends proposed by CME futures, fundraising for crypto ventures, and purchases of digital asset treasuries (DAT). Regarding last year’s rise, the analysts argued that the escalation primarily resulted from inflows into BTC and Ether ETFs, which, according to them, were likely driven by retail investors. Apart from this finding, they also discovered that DAT firms initiated considerable, off-strategy investments in Bitcoin. As significant investments in the crypto ecosystem sparked excitement in the crypto community, sources noted that the industry also experienced a drastic decline in purchasing activity related to Bitcoin and Ethereum CME futures in 2025 compared to the previous year. At this particular moment, institutional investors and hedge funds reduced their engagement in the industry. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that in 2025, over 50% of the funds directed into digital assets, which were approximately $68 billion, originated from Digital Asset Trusts . Strategy Inc. alone contributed around $23 billion of the total funds. This figure is comparable to the $22 billion specifically allocated for the purchase of Bitcoin in 2024. In addition, other DATs purchased approximately digital assets worth $ 45 billion last year, representing a sharp rise from the $8 billion recorded the previous year. As these publicly traded firms conducted these purchases, they did so at the beginning of the year. In October, they reduced their purchasing power. Some of the activities impacted by this decision included the purchases of significant players in the industry, such as Strategy and BitMine. Crypto venture capital funding encounters sluggish growth Analysts noted that crypto venture capital funding also contributed to the broader flow of capital. However, they alleged that its contribution was significantly lower than the peaks recorded in the years 2021 and 2022. In the meantime, reports indicated that while the total number of crypto venture capital funding experienced minor growth last year compared to 2024, the number of agreements struck drastically decreased, driven by a shift in focus among individuals who opted for later-stage rounds. At this time, funding for early-stage initiatives also dropped sharply across the year. To several analysts, the sluggish growth observed in crypto venture capital funding came as a surprise, given that US regulations are establishing a conducive environment for crypto-related activities.

This one-point decline from the previous day’s reading underscores a broader trend of capital rotation that has profound implications for investors and the entire blockchain ecosystem. Market analysts are now scrutinizing this movement, comparing it to historical cycles to gauge potential future trajectories for both Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index and Its Critical Decline The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital barometer for market sentiment. CoinMarketCap calculates this metric by analyzing the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, deliberately excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets. The core function of the index is to measure how many of these major altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, the market’s original benchmark. A score approaching 100 indicates a strong ‘altcoin season,’ where the majority of projects are generating higher returns. Conversely, a lower score, such as the current 29, points decisively toward a ‘Bitcoin season.’ This environment typically sees capital flowing into the perceived safety and established narrative of Bitcoin, often at the expense of smaller, more speculative assets. The threshold for a confirmed altcoin season is notably high, requiring 75% of the top altcoins to beat Bitcoin’s returns over the measured period. The Mechanics Behind the Metric To fully grasp the index’s message, one must understand its construction. The calculation is refreshingly straightforward yet powerful. Firstly, it establishes a simple binary test for each eligible altcoin: did it outperform Bitcoin over the last quarter? The index then represents the percentage of altcoins that passed this test. This methodology provides a clean, unambiguous snapshot of relative strength. For example, an index score of 50 would mean exactly half of the top altcoins are beating Bitcoin. The recent drop to 29, therefore, indicates that only about 29 out of 100 major altcoins are currently keeping pace with or exceeding Bitcoin’s performance, a notable retreat from broader market participation. Historical Context and the Cyclical Nature of Crypto Markets The current reading of 29 is not an anomaly but part of a well-documented cyclical pattern within cryptocurrency markets. Historically, bull markets often begin with a surge in Bitcoin’s price and dominance, drawing in institutional and retail capital focused on the flagship asset. Subsequently, as confidence grows, investors frequently seek higher returns by diversifying into altcoins, triggering an ‘altcoin season.’ The index acts as a quantitative confirmation of this psychological and capital flow pattern. Reviewing past data reveals that sustained periods above the 75 threshold are relatively rare and often precede market corrections or major rotations. For instance, the prolonged altcoin season of early 2021, which saw the index remain elevated for months, was followed by a significant consolidation phase where Bitcoin reasserted its dominance. This cyclical behavior is driven by several fundamental factors. Initially, Bitcoin benefits from its first-mover advantage, brand recognition, and its evolving narrative as ‘digital gold.’ Consequently, during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or when new institutional products like ETFs are launched, Bitcoin is the primary beneficiary. Subsequently, as the overall market cap expands and investor appetite for risk increases, capital trickles down to projects with specific use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or layer-1 scalability. The Altcoin Season Index effectively tracks this trickle-down effect in real-time. Comparing Current Data to Previous Cycles A comparative analysis provides crucial context. The table below illustrates key index levels and their corresponding market phases from recent history: Period Altcoin Season Index (Approx.) Market Phase Description Q4 2020 15-30 Bitcoin-led rally post-halving, institutional accumulation. Q1-Q2 2021 75-95 Peak altcoin season, with massive gains in DeFi and meme coins. Q3 2021 40-60 Transition phase, Bitcoin dominance recovering. Q4 2023 / Q1 2024 20-40 Bitcoin ETF approval anticipation and trading. Current Reading (2025) 29 Consolidation and rotation post-ETF integration, potential macro uncertainty. This historical lens suggests the current low index is characteristic of a market phase where Bitcoin consolidates its gains and establishes a new support base. Furthermore, it often precedes a period where fundamentally strong altcoins begin to differentiate themselves from the crowd. Implications for Investors and the Broader Market Ecosystem The declining Altcoin Season Index carries actionable intelligence for various market participants. For portfolio managers, a low index suggests a strategic overweight in Bitcoin or Bitcoin-correlated assets might be prudent. However, it also signals a potential opportunity for disciplined altcoin accumulation. Historically, periods of extreme Bitcoin dominance have created valuation disparities, where promising altcoin projects trade at a significant discount relative to their long-term potential. Consequently, savvy investors use these phases for fundamental research and strategic dollar-cost averaging into select assets. For the broader blockchain ecosystem, a prolonged Bitcoin season can have mixed effects. On one hand, it may slow venture capital funding and user adoption for newer layer-1 and layer-2 networks as attention focuses elsewhere. On the other hand, it forces projects to demonstrate real utility and development progress rather than relying solely on speculative market tailwinds. This environment can separate projects with robust fundamentals and active communities from those that are merely riding a hype cycle. Key areas to watch during such phases include: Developer Activity: Are GitHub commits and network upgrades continuing? Network Utility: Is Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols stable or growing? On-Chain Metrics: Are transaction counts and active addresses holding steady? The Role of Macroeconomic Factors and Regulation External factors invariably influence the index. Rising interest rates or inflationary pressures have traditionally driven capital toward Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply narrative. Conversely, a risk-on macroeconomic environment fueled by liquidity can accelerate a shift into altcoins. Additionally, regulatory clarity, or the lack thereof, for specific altcoin categories like DeFi or tokenized securities can suppress their performance relative to Bitcoin, which now operates within a more defined regulatory framework in major economies like the United States and the European Union. The current index level may partially reflect a market that is pricing in a cautious regulatory outlook for certain crypto subsectors. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s drop to 29 provides a clear, data-driven snapshot of a cryptocurrency market in a state of transition, firmly favoring Bitcoin dominance. This movement is a normal and expected part of the market’s cyclical rhythm, offering both warnings and opportunities. While it signals reduced short-term momentum for the broader altcoin universe, it also sets the stage for the next phase of growth by highlighting projects with enduring fundamentals. Investors should interpret this not as a signal to abandon altcoins entirely, but as a cue to refine their strategies, emphasizing research, risk management, and a clear understanding of market cycles. The index remains an indispensable tool for navigating the complex and often emotional landscape of digital asset investing. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 29 actually mean? An index score of 29 means that only about 29% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This indicates a market environment strongly dominated by Bitcoin’s performance. Q2: Is a low Altcoin Season Index bad for the crypto market? Not necessarily. It indicates a specific market phase, not the health of the entire market. Low index periods often see Bitcoin strengthening its base, which can provide stability for a future broader rally. They also allow investors to identify fundamentally strong altcoins that are resilient during Bitcoin dominance. Q3: How is the Altcoin Season Index different from Bitcoin Dominance? Bitcoin Dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. The Altcoin Season Index measures performance (price return) over time. An altcoin can lose dominance (market cap share) but still outperform Bitcoin in price gains, which the index would capture. Q4: Should I sell my altcoins when the index is this low? A low index is a signal for analysis, not an automatic sell trigger. The decision should be based on the fundamentals of each specific altcoin in your portfolio. Historically, this phase can be an accumulation period for high-conviction altcoin holdings, not just an exit point. Q5: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, providing a near real-time gauge of the shifting performance dynamics between Bitcoin and the major alternative cryptocurrencies.

Investors Rotate From BNB Into This New Altcoin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-with-450-investors-rotate-from-bnb-into-this-new-altcoin/,"Big and established tokens are also sought by investors to gain stability and value in the long term. However, once that material gets into long periods of consolidation, a lot of traders will start to scan smaller projects with greater potential upside before landmark protocols. A single cheap crypto that sells under $1 has attracted interest as capitals are shifting towards smaller tokens like Binance Coin (BNB) onto the new opportunities powered by product development and the structure of mechanics. Binance Coin (BNB) One of the leading cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization has been Binance Coin or BNB. The price of BNB usually shows the movement in the wider crypto sector, such as the use of exchanges, staking, and the overall mood in the market. According to the latest information, BNB costs approximately between $900, and the market capital of the token is more than $120 billion, which is one of the biggest in the industry. Price charts demonstrate that BNB has been experiencing resistance at the arrears of established technical levels, which have been halting positive upward movements in the recent periods. Price rallies have been halted at resistance zones of about $900-$1000 several times over. Areas of support which are below the current levels indicate consolidation as opposed to the sudden breakout behavior. This dynamic is not new to large assets such as BNB where large moves often demand large capital inflows or new drivers of usage in addition to the normal exchange capabilities. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Although larger assets such as BNB tend to fluctuate within the broad market bands, new cryptocurrency projects that are closer to reaching major utility phases can attract specific investors to them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of such projects. Mutuum Finance is creating a protocol where lending and borrowing structures are done systematically through controlled mechanisms like collateral protections, interest rate logic, and liquidation implementation. Rather than hype, the utility story behind the token is pegged to actual involvement in credit markets which provide revenue streams and use statistics. The MUTM presale was launched at the beginning of 2025 with a starting price of $0.01. The organized presale has progressed under several tiers of price and currently retails at an estimated price of approximately $0.04 in Phase 7. The confirmed launch price will be at $0.06 which will present a clear valuation support when the liquidity to the masses is made available. To date, Mutuum Finance has raised more than $19.7 M and drawn in additional than 18,800 holders. Security preparation is also done: Mutuum Finance has been fully audited by Halborn Security , with a 90/100 Token Scan score of CertiK. Price Prediction Contrast Comparing the possible upside scenarios of BNB and MUTM, structural differences are obvious. The price behavior of BNB indicates that the stock will continue moving in a range unless there are new strong catalysts. The technical and peer projections have a tendency to situate BNB in a medium growth range in 2026. Certain analysts may view 10-25% increases out of the current prices under cases of macro liquidity and with the exchange usage continuing to be robust. On the contrary, Mutuum Finance is just at the adoption stage. Analysts model the scenarios of token revalues before the usage data with the protocol moving towards V1 protocol launch . Conservative pricing models set an early post-launch objective within the $0.10-$0.12 bracket since simple lending and borrowing indicators are starting to emerge. An additional growth model that is related to the revenue mechanism, yield demand, and structural demand curve puts MUTM in a $0.24-$0.30 range with a longer horizon with the assumption that adoption increases once V1 and oracle/stack functionality are enabled. This opposition explains why capital can move out of established giant tokens and into new crypto assets that have definite activations. As BNB is associated with the general trends in the ecosystem, and MUTM has its valuation heavily future-oriented, the risk-reward profile of the two is contrasting. Whale Allocation Signals Whales active have also been observed. Massive allocations into the current pricing phases would indicate the interest of bigger holders in trying to achieve lower exposure to the cost basis ahead of the higher pricing levels being shut down. Phase 7 is located right below the established launch price of $0.06, and allocation that is staying at this point is slowly becoming constrained. This supply window can narrow well before more attention is received as utility milestones are neared. Structured phases of pricing, complete security stack indications, the presence of incentives to participate, and impending protocol release are some of the reasons why Mutuum Finance is on the radar of some investors along with other top crypto assets such as BNB, particularly when the price dynamics of BNB are range-bound or less aggressive.

While short-term volatility has cooled, the broader structure remains constructive, pointing to a potential expansion phase as compression builds near key resistance. XRP Compresses Into A Critical $2.30–$2.40 Decision Zone According to a latest update from Egrag Crypto, the XRP 3-day chart continues to flash strong bullish signals despite recent consolidation. Price action remains constructive, with XRP compressing inside a descending channel as it approaches a crucial decision zone between $2.30 and $2.40. Related Reading: XRP Price Finds Its Footing at Support, Bulls Test Their Strength From a structural standpoint, several technical elements point to underlying strength. The 50-period EMA has begun to flatten, suggesting that selling pressure is gradually easing. At the same time, the 200-period EMA continues to trend higher, reinforcing the idea that the broader, macro trend remains bullish. Furthermore, XRP is holding above the EMA cluster, indicating that the market structure has not yet broken down. Notably, the upper boundary of the descending channel aligns closely with the former $2.30 breakout level, adding technical significance to this zone. From here, the implications are clear. A clean and decisive 3-day close above $2.40 would likely confirm a breakout from compression, opening the door for continuation toward the $2.70 region, with $3.13 emerging as a higher upside objective. On the other hand, rejection at resistance would likely keep XRP trading in a range. However, as long as the price remains above the $2.00 area, the overall bullish structure stays intact. This is not a breakdown scenario; rather, it reflects tightening price action that often precedes a strong expansion. Triple Tap Hits Range Highs, Reaching A Key Inflection Point In a recent market update, CrediBULL Crypto noted that XRP has now completed its triple-tap move, successfully reaching the upper boundary of its range. With liquidity at the range highs already taken, the market now stands at a clear crossroads, presenting two distinct paths for price action going forward. Related Reading: Why XRP Is Gearing Up For A Massive Week The first scenario frames the recent move as nothing more than a relief bounce, sweeping liquidity at the highs before resuming its local downtrend, within the higher-timeframe uptrend. If this plays out, price could move lower again, potentially dropping below the $1.77 level. In the alternative scenario, the triple-tap pattern is interpreted as the formation of a solid base of structural demand. Under this view, pullbacks are likely to be met with buying interest, with the $1.77 lows acting as a support zone rather than a level to be broken. Weighing the broader context, particularly Bitcoin’s position and overall market conditions, CrediBULL leans toward the second outcome. That bias favors looking for long opportunities, with the expectation that XRP will continue to expand higher and eventually target untapped levels above the current range.

This division emerges just days before a critical Senate markup session that could determine the legislative framework for digital assets in the United States for years to come. Crypto Market Structure Bill Divides Industry Leaders Eleanor Terrett’s Crypto in America report reveals substantial industry backing for the proposed legislation. Supporters include venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), payment protocol company Circle, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce, blockchain firm Ripple, and nonprofit research center Coin Center. These organizations collectively represent diverse segments of the digital asset ecosystem. Meanwhile, Coinbase withdrew its support citing several substantive concerns. The exchange specifically objects to provisions that could effectively ban tokenized securities. Additionally, Coinbase warns about potential restrictions on decentralized finance platforms while allowing unlimited access to financial data. The company further criticizes what it perceives as a weakening of Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority relative to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Legislative Context and Historical Background The Clarity Act represents Congress’s latest attempt to establish comprehensive digital asset regulation. Previous legislative efforts have stalled repeatedly since 2022. Lawmakers introduced this bill following years of regulatory uncertainty and multiple high-profile enforcement actions. The legislation aims to clarify jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and CFTC. Industry observers note this regulatory clarity could significantly impact market development. Clear guidelines might encourage institutional investment while protecting consumer interests. However, achieving consensus remains challenging given the technical complexity and rapid innovation within the cryptocurrency sector. Expert Analysis of Regulatory Implications Financial regulation experts highlight several critical aspects of the proposed legislation. The bill attempts to distinguish between digital assets classified as securities versus commodities. This distinction carries substantial implications for trading platforms and token issuers. Furthermore, the legislation addresses stablecoin regulation following previous market instability events. Legal scholars emphasize that the bill’s treatment of decentralized platforms represents particularly novel territory. Traditional financial regulation typically focuses on centralized intermediaries. The legislation must therefore balance innovation with investor protection in decentralized systems. Key Provisions and Industry Impact Assessment The Clarity Act contains several provisions with direct industry consequences: Token Classification Framework: Establishes clearer criteria for determining whether digital assets qualify as securities Regulatory Jurisdiction: Defines specific circumstances where the CFTC versus SEC maintains authority Stablecoin Standards: Creates federal requirements for dollar-pegged digital currencies Market Infrastructure: Addresses trading platforms, custody services, and settlement mechanisms Supporting companies argue these provisions provide necessary regulatory certainty. They believe clear rules will foster responsible innovation and protect consumers. Conversely, Coinbase contends certain sections could inadvertently stifle technological advancement and market competition. Timeline of Legislative Developments The legislative process has accelerated significantly in recent months: Date Development Significance November 2024 Bill introduction in Senate Banking Committee Formal legislative process begins December 2024 Committee hearings with industry testimony Stakeholders provide input on draft language January 8, 2025 Coinbase announces opposition Major industry player withdraws support January 10, 2025 Multiple firms confirm continued backing Industry division becomes publicly apparent January 15, 2025 Scheduled Senate markup session Potential committee vote on amendments This timeline demonstrates the rapid evolution of industry positions. The scheduled January 15 markup session represents a critical juncture. Committee members could amend the legislation based on stakeholder feedback before potential floor consideration. Comparative Analysis of Industry Positions Examining supporting versus opposing arguments reveals fundamental philosophical differences. Supporters generally prioritize regulatory clarity and mainstream adoption. They believe comprehensive legislation will legitimize the industry and attract traditional finance participants. These companies often emphasize consumer protection and market stability. Opponents typically focus on innovation preservation and decentralization principles. They express concern that overly restrictive regulation could disadvantage United States companies globally. Additionally, they worry about unintended consequences for emerging technologies like decentralized autonomous organizations and prediction markets. Market Reaction and Investor Considerations Financial markets have shown measured response to these developments. Cryptocurrency prices experienced minimal volatility following the news. However, analysts note that regulatory clarity typically benefits established companies with compliance resources. Smaller innovators might face increased barriers to entry under the proposed framework. Institutional investors generally welcome regulatory progress despite specific concerns. Many traditional finance firms have hesitated to enter cryptocurrency markets without clearer rules. The legislation’s advancement could therefore catalyze additional capital allocation to digital assets regardless of final provisions. Potential Amendments and Compromise Scenarios Legislative observers identify several areas where compromise might emerge. The tokenized securities provision represents one possible modification target. Lawmakers could adjust language to permit certain tokenized assets under specific conditions. Similarly, DeFi provisions might receive clarification to distinguish between different platform types. The stablecoin rewards prohibition represents another potential negotiation point. Some legislators might support allowing rewards programs with appropriate consumer disclosures. Regulatory authority allocation between the SEC and CFTC could also see adjustment based on further committee discussion. Conclusion The crypto market structure bill debate highlights the cryptocurrency industry’s maturation and complexity. While Coinbase’s opposition demonstrates legitimate concerns about specific provisions, broad industry support suggests many firms prioritize regulatory certainty. The Clarity Act’s progression will significantly influence United States digital asset regulation regardless of final form. Market participants should monitor the January 15 markup session closely for indications of legislative direction. This crypto market structure bill represents a pivotal moment for balancing innovation with protection in financial markets. FAQs Q1: What is the Clarity Act? The Clarity Act is proposed United States legislation establishing comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, including cryptocurrency classification, trading platform requirements, and stablecoin standards.

US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve On ‘Priority List’ In an interview recorded at the White House for the Jan. 13 episode of Crypto In America, Witt told host Eleanor Terrett that interagency talks on implementing President Donald Trump’s executive order are ongoing and that the effort remains on the administration’s “priority list,” as Congress simultaneously moves toward its next steps on crypto market structure legislation later this week. Asked how the White House is thinking about the reserve “these days,” Witt pointed to a process being driven not only by crypto policy staff, but by the operations machinery tasked with pushing executive orders through the federal government. “We’ve had good engagement from the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy team, which is Steven Miller’s team [to] make sure that all of the executive orders that have been signed by the president — that the agencies are moving out on them,” Witt said. “The treasury team, commerce team is involved. […] It seems straightforward, but then you get into some […] obscure legal provisions and why this agency can’t do it, but actually this agency could.” Witt framed the current phase as less about whether the administration wants the reserve, and more about ensuring it can move in a way that will withstand scrutiny. “We’re continuing to push on that. It is certainly still on the priority list right now,” he said, adding that “Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel […] has provided some good guidance on where we can […] move out on this executive order […] and do so in a legally sound way.” The remarks come against the backdrop of Trump’s March 2025 executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader “digital asset stockpile,” which directed the government to treat existing federally held bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset while agencies were tasked to research ways for budget-neutral acquisition . Witt also addressed a separate flashpoint that has circulated in Bitcoin circles in recent days: speculation that the Department of Justice had sold bitcoin linked to the Samourai Wallet case, potentially conflicting with the administration’s reserve posture. “I think it was somewhat misreported,” Witt said, referencing the settlement language and what he characterized as standard legal drafting. “If you look at the settlement agreement, the legal documents, it sounds like […] the agency is going to take a certain action. […] In talking with DOJ, it was basically written in such a way where they preserve all of their options and their rights in those agreements, but those bitcoins have not been liquidated. Those digital assets have not been sold.” Witt’s bottom line for viewers was that the headline allegation, that DOJ had “outright violated” the executive order, “is not a concern,” though he stressed that he could not say more beyond that.

According to blockchain data reported by EmberCN, an Ondo Finance multisig wallet transferred 25 million ONDO tokens, valued at approximately $10.2 million, to five major digital asset exchanges. This substantial ONDO token deposit to platforms like Coinbase, OKX, Bybit, Gate, and KuCoin represents a notable development in the token’s liquidity and market dynamics, prompting a deeper examination of its context and potential implications. Analyzing the ONDO Token Exchange Deposit The transaction, executed about six hours prior to reporting, originated from a verified multisignature wallet controlled by Ondo Finance. Multisig wallets require multiple private keys to authorize a transaction, enhancing security for large holdings. Consequently, this deposit method strongly indicates a deliberate, sanctioned action by the project’s governing entity rather than an individual holder’s move. The recipient exchanges represent a diverse mix of global liquidity pools, including U.S.-based Coinbase and major Asian platforms like OKX and Bybit. Historically, large-scale transfers from project treasuries or associated wallets to centralized exchanges (CEXs) are often interpreted by market participants as a preparatory step for selling activity. The logic follows that tokens moved to an exchange are more readily convertible to other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. However, alternative explanations exist. For instance, the transfer could facilitate market-making operations, provide liquidity for upcoming exchange-specific products, or fund operational expenses. The true intent often only becomes clear through subsequent on-chain activity or official project communications. Contextualizing Ondo Finance’s Role in Real-World Assets To fully understand this event, one must consider Ondo Finance’s position within the broader blockchain ecosystem. Ondo Finance operates at the intersection of decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance, specializing in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The project’s flagship products include the OUSG token, which provides exposure to U.S. Treasury bills, and the USDY token, a yield-bearing stablecoin. The ONDO token itself functions as the project’s governance token, granting holders voting rights on protocol upgrades and treasury management. The timing of this deposit is also noteworthy. It occurs amidst a growing institutional focus on the RWA sector within cryptocurrency. Major financial entities are increasingly exploring blockchain-based representations of bonds, credit, and equities. Therefore, actions by a leading RWA protocol like Ondo Finance are scrutinized not just for their immediate market impact but also as signals of strategic positioning within this high-growth niche. Potential Market Impacts and Liquidity Considerations The immediate market consideration revolves around supply and liquidity. A sudden influx of 25 million tokens into exchange wallets increases the readily tradable supply. If a significant portion is sold on the open market, it could exert downward pressure on the ONDO token’s price through simple supply and demand mechanics. Market analysts typically monitor exchange inflow metrics from services like Glassnode or CryptoQuant to gauge potential selling pressure. However, the impact is not automatically negative. Increased exchange liquidity can reduce slippage for large trades, making the asset more attractive to institutional buyers and large investors. Furthermore, distribution across five exchanges mitigates the risk of a single exchange’s order book absorbing all the potential selling pressure. The table below outlines the core considerations analysts weigh following such a deposit. Analyst Considerations for Large Token Deposits Factor Bearish Interpretation Bullish/Neutral Interpretation Exchange Inflow Precursor to immediate sell-off by insiders. Preparation for liquidity provisioning or corporate treasury management. Token Utility Lack of staking or locking utility leads to selling. Governance token use may encourage holding despite liquidity. Market Context Occurs during a general market downturn. Occurs during period of stable or rising prices and positive sentiment. Project Stage Early-stage project unlocking large investor tokens. Mature project managing treasury for operational runway. It is crucial to distinguish between correlation and causation. While exchange deposits often precede price declines, they do not guarantee them. Market sentiment, broader cryptocurrency trends, and upcoming project developments frequently play a larger role in determining price action. Historical Precedents and Expert Perspectives Examining historical patterns provides valuable context. Numerous cryptocurrency projects have executed similar treasury or team token allocations to exchanges. The market reaction varies significantly based on transparency and communication. Projects that pre-announce such moves as part of a published vesting or liquidity plan typically experience less volatility than those where transfers are discovered on-chain without context. Blockchain analysts emphasize the importance of tracking subsequent flows. For example, if tokens move from the deposit address into known exchange hot wallets, it strengthens the case for imminent selling. Conversely, if the tokens remain in the initial deposit address—which may be an exchange’s cold wallet—the intent is less clear. Experts in on-chain analytics, whose work involves interpreting these data trails, stress that a single transaction is a data point, not a definitive narrative. Comprehensive analysis requires reviewing the project’s tokenomics, vesting schedules, and recent governance proposals. From a regulatory perspective, transparent disclosure is becoming increasingly important. In jurisdictions with developing digital asset frameworks, large sales by project affiliates may be subject to specific reporting requirements. Ondo Finance’s focus on regulated real-world assets suggests a likely adherence to high compliance standards, which could influence how such treasury actions are structured and communicated. The Role of Multisig Wallets in Project Governance The use of a multisignature wallet for this transfer highlights modern blockchain governance security practices. Multisig setups require a predetermined number of key holders (e.g., 3-of-5) to sign a transaction before execution. This mechanism protects project treasuries from single points of failure, such as a compromised private key. For stakeholders, it indicates that the transfer underwent a formal approval process, aligning with decentralized governance principles rather than unilateral decision-making. This technical detail adds a layer of legitimacy and intentionality to the transaction. Conclusion The deposit of $10.2 million in ONDO tokens to five exchanges by Ondo Finance is a significant on-chain event that merits careful observation. While such ONDO token transfers commonly raise questions about potential selling pressure, they can also serve legitimate strategic purposes like enhancing liquidity or funding operations. The true impact will depend on subsequent actions, broader market conditions, and the evolving narrative around the real-world asset sector. For market participants, this event underscores the critical importance of on-chain data analysis, contextual understanding of project fundamentals, and avoiding reactionary conclusions based on a single transaction. The movement highlights the dynamic and transparent nature of blockchain-based finance, where major treasury actions are visible to all, inviting analysis and informed discourse. FAQs Q1: What does a large token deposit to an exchange typically mean? Such deposits often signal that the entity controlling the tokens may be preparing to sell, as exchanges facilitate easy trading. However, other reasons include providing liquidity for trading pairs, funding operations, or preparing tokens for distribution to partners or employees. Q2: How does a multisig wallet transaction differ from a regular one? A multisignature wallet requires authorization from multiple private key holders to execute a transaction. This enhances security and ensures that significant moves, like a large deposit, are approved by several parties, often reflecting a formal governance decision rather than an individual’s action. Q3: Could this deposit have a positive effect on the ONDO token? Yes. Increasing the available supply on exchanges can improve liquidity, which reduces price slippage for large orders. This can make the token more attractive to institutional investors and large traders, potentially supporting healthier long-term trading volume. Q4: What is Ondo Finance’s main focus in the cryptocurrency space? Ondo Finance is a leading protocol in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector. It focuses on bringing traditional financial assets, like U.S. Treasury bills, onto the blockchain through tokenized products such as OUSG and USDY, bridging DeFi with established finance. Q5: Where can investors monitor for follow-up activity after this deposit? Investors and analysts monitor blockchain explorers like Etherscan for the destination addresses, track exchange wallet flows via analytics platforms like Arkham or Nansen, and watch for official announcements from Ondo Finance’s governance forums or social media channels for context.

This pivotal decision underscores the central bank’s ongoing balancing act between persistent inflation pressures and fragile economic growth prospects. Consequently, policymakers continue to prioritize stability in a complex global financial environment. Bank of Korea Interest Rate Decision: A Detailed Analysis The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea unanimously voted to keep the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50%. This meeting marks the fifth hold in a sequence that started in July 2023, followed by similar decisions in August, October, and November. Governor Rhee Chang-yong emphasized that the current rate level remains restrictive. Furthermore, the board judges it necessary to maintain this stance for a sufficient period to ensure inflation converges sustainably toward the target. Domestic consumer price inflation has shown signs of moderation but remains above the BOK’s 2% target. The latest data indicates a rate around 3%, driven primarily by elevated prices for agricultural products and energy. Meanwhile, household debt levels, while stabilizing, continue to pose a significant risk to financial stability. The central bank’s decision reflects a careful assessment of these competing factors. The Global Context for Monetary Policy The BOK’s prolonged pause occurs within a shifting global monetary policy landscape. Major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have also entered holding patterns after aggressive hiking cycles. This synchronized caution aims to avoid premature easing that could reignite inflation. However, it also risks exacerbating economic slowdowns. South Korea’s export-reliant economy remains sensitive to global demand and geopolitical tensions. A stronger Korean Won, partly influenced by interest rate differentials, can hurt export competitiveness. Therefore, the BOK must also consider exchange rate volatility. The current policy stance seeks to anchor inflation expectations without applying excessive pressure on the economic recovery. Expert Insights on the Economic Impact Financial analysts widely anticipated this steady hold. “The BOK is in a data-dependent mode, closely watching inflation trajectories and household debt,” noted a senior economist at the Korea Development Institute. “The clear communication is that the door for further hikes remains closed for now, but rate cuts are not immediately on the horizon.” The real estate market and corporate investment are key transmission channels for this policy. Sustained higher rates increase borrowing costs, cooling speculative investment in property. However, they also raise financing burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises. The following table summarizes the key economic indicators influencing the BOK’s decision: Indicator Recent Trend Influence on Policy CPI Inflation Moderating, but above 2% target Primary driver for maintaining restrictive stance Household Debt Growth stabilizing at high level Major financial stability concern Export Growth Recovering unevenly by sector Supports cautious approach to avoid harming recovery Private Consumption Sluggish, reflecting high debt burdens Limits scope for further rate increases Market reaction has been muted, indicating the decision was fully priced in. Government bond yields showed little movement, and the Korean stock market maintained its course. This stability suggests investor confidence in the central bank’s predictable and transparent communication framework. Historical Perspective and Future Trajectory The current 2.50% rate represents the terminal point of a tightening cycle that began in August 2021 from a historic low of 0.50%. The BOK was among the first major central banks to begin raising rates post-pandemic, highlighting its proactive stance against inflation. The cumulative increase of 300 basis points was a significant policy shift. Looking ahead, the forward guidance suggests a prolonged pause. Most analysts project the BOK will hold rates steady through the first half of 2025. The timeline for any potential shift to an easing cycle remains highly uncertain. It depends critically on several factors: Inflation Dynamics: A sustained return to the 2% target is the primary prerequisite. Federal Reserve Policy: The BOK often considers U.S. rate moves to manage capital flows and exchange rates. Growth Data: A sharper-than-expected economic downturn could force a reevaluation. Geopolitical Risks: Supply chain disruptions could rekindle inflationary pressures. This period of stability provides businesses and households with a clearer planning environment. However, it also demands vigilance from the central bank. The BOK has reiterated its readiness to adjust policy if financial stability risks materialize or if the inflation outlook deteriorates significantly. Conclusion The Bank of Korea’s decision to hold its benchmark interest rate at 2.50% for a fifth time signals a committed pause in its monetary tightening cycle. This policy stance carefully balances the goals of price stability, financial stability, and sustainable growth. As the global economy navigates uncertainty, the BOK’s data-dependent and patient approach aims to steer the South Korean economy toward a soft landing. The central bank’s future moves will remain contingent on evolving domestic inflation data and the complex interplay of international financial conditions. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bank of Korea freeze the interest rate again? The Bank of Korea maintained the rate to continue its restrictive policy stance, ensuring inflation moves sustainably toward its 2% target while monitoring risks to economic growth and financial stability from high household debt. Q2: How does this interest rate hold affect ordinary South Koreans? It means borrowing costs for mortgages, loans, and credit cards will remain at current elevated levels, impacting household budgets. Savers, however, will continue to benefit from higher returns on deposits. Q3: When might the BOK consider cutting interest rates? Most analysts do not expect a rate cut until there is clear, sustained evidence that inflation has converged to the 2% target and that economic growth is weakening significantly, unlikely before mid-2025. Q4: How does the BOK’s decision compare to other central banks? The BOK’s prolonged pause mirrors similar “wait-and-see” approaches by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, as major economies globally assess the lagged effects of previous rapid rate hikes. Q5: What is the main risk if the BOK holds rates too high for too long? The primary risk is unnecessarily stifling economic activity and investment, potentially triggering a sharper economic downturn or recession, especially if global demand weakens substantially.

This decisive action, attributed to essential wallet system maintenance, immediately impacted one of the platform’s most actively traded altcoins, prompting a wave of analysis across global crypto markets. The suspension underscores the critical infrastructure demands behind digital asset trading and highlights the procedural rigor of major exchanges. Upbit’s Worldcoin Suspension: A Detailed Breakdown Upbit’s official notification, disseminated through its website and user channels, cited wallet system maintenance as the sole reason for the pause. Consequently, the exchange disabled all WLD deposit addresses and halted processing for withdrawal requests. Importantly, spot trading for WLD pairs continued uninterrupted during this period, allowing users to buy and sell existing holdings. This distinction is crucial for market liquidity. Typically, such maintenance windows involve security upgrades, node synchronization with the Worldcoin blockchain, or backend integration enhancements. Major exchanges like Upbit routinely schedule these updates to ensure system integrity, safeguard user assets, and comply with evolving regulatory technical standards. Historically, similar maintenance events on other leading exchanges have followed a predictable pattern. For instance, Binance and Coinbase have periodically suspended services for specific tokens to implement mandatory network upgrades or security patches. These pauses, while temporary, are a standard industry practice designed to prevent transaction errors or potential loss of funds during system overhauls. The announcement’s timing and clarity are key factors in maintaining user trust, as opaque or sudden halts can trigger market anxiety. Understanding the Worldcoin (WLD) Ecosystem To fully grasp the context of Upbit’s action, one must understand Worldcoin’s unique position in the cryptocurrency landscape. Founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Worldcoin aims to create a global digital identity and financial network. Its core innovation involves a physical device called the “Orb” that scans an individual’s iris to generate a unique, privacy-preserving digital identity, or “World ID.” The WLD token is designed to be distributed freely to verified humans, promoting equitable access. This ambitious project has sparked intense debate regarding biometric data privacy, decentralization, and universal basic income models. Worldcoin’s presence on a major exchange like Upbit is vital for its legitimacy and accessibility, particularly in the tech-forward South Korean market. South Korea represents one of the world’s most active retail crypto trading environments. Therefore, any disruption in accessibility on a top-tier Korean exchange carries weight. The project’s tokenomics and recent network activity often influence exchange decisions regarding wallet support. The table below contrasts key aspects of the suspension with standard exchange procedures. Aspect Upbit’s WLD Suspension Standard Exchange Maintenance Primary Reason Wallet System Maintenance Network Upgrade, Security Patch, Hard Fork Trading Impact Spot Trading Continues Often Continues Unless Critical User Action Required None for Existing Holdings Typically None Typical Duration Hours to a Few Days Hours to a Few Days Expert Analysis on Exchange Infrastructure Management Industry analysts emphasize that proactive maintenance is a hallmark of a responsible exchange. According to common operational frameworks, these pauses are scheduled during periods of lower volatility or network activity to minimize user impact. The decision reflects Upbit’s commitment to the E-E-A-T principles —Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness—by prioritizing system security over uninterrupted service. A secure wallet infrastructure prevents vulnerabilities that could lead to exploits, a non-negotiable priority following lessons from historical exchange hacks. Experts note that transparent communication, as seen in this case, directly correlates with sustained user confidence and platform stability. Potential Market Impact and Investor Considerations The immediate market reaction to such news is often measured. While trading continues, the inability to move tokens on or off the exchange can create temporary arbitrage disparities between Upbit’s WLD price and prices on other platforms. Savvy traders monitor these gaps. For long-term investors, however, routine maintenance is generally a non-event. The more significant impact would stem from an extended, unexplained suspension or one linked to regulatory concerns, which this announcement explicitly is not. Investors should consider several key points during such events: Verify Official Sources: Always check the exchange’s official announcement page, not social media rumors. Understand Scope: Distinguish between suspended deposits/withdrawals and halted trading. Review History: Exchanges with a history of smooth maintenance resumptions pose lower risk. Monitor Updates: Set notifications for the service restoration announcement. This event also highlights the importance of using multiple reputable exchanges and non-custodial wallets for asset diversification, mitigating reliance on any single platform’s operational schedule. Conclusion Upbit’s temporary suspension of Worldcoin (WLD) deposits and withdrawals for wallet maintenance is a standard operational procedure within the cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates the exchange’s proactive approach to security and system integrity. While such pauses require user awareness, they are fundamentally different from suspensions driven by regulatory or security incidents. The continued availability of WLD spot trading on Upbit ensured market liquidity remained intact. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, these meticulous maintenance protocols become increasingly vital for user protection and the sustainable growth of platforms like Upbit and projects like Worldcoin. FAQs Q1: Can I still trade Worldcoin (WLD) on Upbit during this suspension? A1: Yes. Upbit’s announcement specified that only deposit and withdrawal services are suspended. Spot trading for WLD pairs continues normally on the exchange. Q2: How long will the Upbit WLD wallet maintenance last? A2: The announcement did not specify an exact duration. Such maintenance typically lasts from a few hours to several days. Users should monitor Upbit’s official announcements for the service restoration notice. Q3: Is my WLD safe on Upbit during the maintenance? A3: According to standard exchange procedures, wallet maintenance is performed to enhance security and system stability. User funds in Upbit wallets are designed to remain secure during this planned technical procedure. Q4: Does this suspension indicate a problem with the Worldcoin network itself? A4: No. The suspension is for Upbit’s internal wallet systems. The Worldcoin blockchain network continues to operate independently. This is an exchange-specific operational update. Q5: What should I do if I had a pending WLD deposit or withdrawal? A5: Transactions initiated before the suspension will likely be processed once maintenance is complete. If a transaction remains pending for an unusual time after services resume, you should contact Upbit’s customer support with the transaction hash or details.

This development, reported in January 2025, injects significant uncertainty into a long-running effort to establish clear rules for digital asset markets. Consequently, industry stakeholders face the prospect of prolonged regulatory ambiguity. The CLARITY Bill and Coinbase’s Pivotal Role The Crypto-Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, known as the CLARITY Act, represents a major legislative effort to define jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Primarily, the bill seeks to clarify which digital assets qualify as securities and which fall under the commodity classification. For years, major crypto exchanges like Coinbase have championed such legislation to create a predictable operating environment. However, Coinbase’s recent decision to withdraw its backing marks a dramatic shift. Analysts at TD Cowen, led by managing director Jaret Seiberg, immediately identified this reversal as a substantial threat to the bill’s momentum. “Coinbase’s support was a cornerstone of the legislative push,” the analysis noted, highlighting how the exchange’s lobbying power and industry stature previously helped garner bipartisan attention. Without this key advocate, the path forward becomes markedly more difficult. Understanding the Legislative Timeline and Impact The timing of this withdrawal is particularly consequential. The current congressional session has a limited window for passing complex financial legislation. Furthermore, a crucial Senate hearing on the CLARITY bill, originally scheduled for January 15, 2025, is now likely to be postponed indefinitely. This delay creates a vacuum that opponents of the bill or advocates for stricter regulation may seek to fill with alternative proposals. Key Events in the CLARITY Bill Timeline Date Event Status/Outcome 2023 CLARITY Act Introduced Bill drafted to define SEC/CFTC roles for crypto. Late 2024 Coinbase Lobbying Peak Exchange actively supported the bill’s framework. Jan 2025 Coinbase Withdraws Support Cited potential for unfavorable amendments. Jan 15, 2025 Scheduled Senate Hearing Now likely postponed due to lack of consensus. Analyst Warnings and Industry-Wide Concerns TD Cowen’s report echoes broader concerns within the financial analysis community. The central fear is that the CLARITY bill, now lacking a unified industry front, could be amended in ways that are less favorable to cryptocurrency companies . Potential amendments might include: Stricter capital and custody requirements for exchanges. Broader definitions of what constitutes a security, bringing more tokens under the SEC’s stringent oversight. Enhanced consumer disclosure rules that could increase operational costs. Jaret Seiberg explicitly warned that Coinbase’s move could “derail the legislative push” altogether. Other analysts share this apprehension, noting that regulatory uncertainty directly impacts market stability and institutional investment. When rules are unclear, businesses hesitate to innovate and investors perceive higher risk, which can suppress growth and adoption in the digital asset sector. The Ripple Effect of Prolonged Uncertainty The immediate consequence of this legislative stall is the extension of the current, often adversarial, regulatory environment. The SEC has continued its enforcement-centric approach under existing securities laws, while the CFTC has argued for greater authority over digital commodities. This jurisdictional tug-of-war leaves companies navigating a complex and often contradictory patchwork of state and federal guidance. Prolonging this status quo could disadvantage U.S. firms compared to jurisdictions with clearer frameworks, like the European Union’s MiCA regulation. Broader Context: The Fight for Crypto Market Structure This event is not isolated but part of a multi-year struggle to fit digital assets into traditional financial regulatory boxes. The core challenge lies in the unique nature of cryptocurrencies, which can exhibit characteristics of commodities, securities, payment systems, and new forms of property. The CLARITY bill was one of the most prominent attempts to solve this classification problem through statute rather than through agency enforcement actions or court rulings. Previous legislative efforts have similarly faced hurdles. For instance, the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, introduced in 2022, also sought comprehensive regulation but has seen limited progress. The failure of CLARITY could signal that a comprehensive, industry-friendly federal bill remains out of reach in the near term. Consequently, the industry may need to prepare for a future shaped more by regulatory enforcement and court precedents than by proactive legislation. Potential Paths Forward for Regulation In the absence of the CLARITY Act, several scenarios could unfold. First, regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC may continue to expand their rulemaking and enforcement based on their current interpretations of law. Second, Congress might pivot to smaller, more targeted bills addressing specific issues like stablecoins or crypto taxation before attempting another omnibus market structure bill. Finally, the industry itself may intensify its efforts to shape state-level regulations, leading to a more fragmented national landscape. Conclusion Coinbase’s withdrawal of support for the CLARITY crypto market bill represents a critical juncture for U.S. digital asset policy. As TD Cowen’s analysis underscores, this move jeopardizes the bill’s passage and risks prolonging the regulatory uncertainty that has long plagued the industry. The likely postponement of key Senate hearings further dims the prospects for near-term legislative clarity. Ultimately, the fate of the Coinbase CLARITY bill initiative will significantly influence whether the United States cultivates a coherent regulatory framework or continues with a piecemeal approach that could stifle innovation and competitiveness in the global cryptocurrency market. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act is proposed U.S. legislation designed to clarify whether certain digital assets are securities regulated by the SEC or commodities regulated by the CFTC, aiming to establish a clear market structure for cryptocurrencies. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw its support for the bill? While Coinbase’s specific reasons are not fully detailed in public reports, analysts suggest the company feared the bill would be amended during the legislative process in ways that could impose stricter, less favorable regulations on crypto businesses. Q3: What does TD Cowen’s analysis say about the impact? TD Cowen’s analysis, led by managing director Jaret Seiberg, warns that Coinbase’s withdrawal could derail the legislative push entirely, preventing the bill’s passage in the current session and prolonging regulatory uncertainty. Q4: What happens if the CLARITY bill does not pass? Without the CLARITY bill, the current regulatory ambiguity will likely continue. The SEC and CFTC will persist in applying existing rules through enforcement actions, and comprehensive federal legislation for crypto market structure may be delayed for years. Q5: How does this affect cryptocurrency investors and the market? Prolonged regulatory uncertainty can create market volatility, deter institutional investment, and limit the development of new products and services. Clear rules generally provide stability that benefits both investors and legitimate companies in the long term.

The outage that began in the afternoon halted transactions and froze over $1 billion in value on the network. The Sui F oundation , the blockchain’s organization, acknowledged the problem at 3:24 p.m. UTC on X and reassured users that core developers were currently working to resolve the issue. “The Sui network is now back and fully operational. Transactions are flowing normally. If you continue to experience issues, please refresh your app or browser window. Thanks for your patience. We will share a full incident review in the coming days,” the Foundation said . According to the Foundation, the team began investigating the problem at 2:52 pm UTC and resolved it at 8:44 pm UTC, restoring the network after 5 hours and 52 minutes. The outage was described as a “Consensus outage,” a technical issue that prevents the blockchain from confirming transactions. The Foundation has not yet explained what caused the problem. Sui is a Layer 1 network developed primarily by Mysten Labs, a team spun out of Meta’s canceled Diem stablecoin and wallet project, similar to rival high-throughput networks like Aptos. The network has reportedly seen steady growth and investor interest, having surpassed $10 billion in 30-day DEX volume around the time 21 Shares announced its intention to launch a leveraged ETF tracking its native token. Sui faces its second major outage The incident on Wednesday is the second severe outage of the Sui network since it began operating in May 2023. The first occurred in November 2024, when the high-speed blockchain developed challenges over time. Other networks, such as Solana, have faced comparable issues in the past. Solana has not experienced outages in the last 18 months, at least in part due to emergency updates that enable validators – computers responsible for maintaining the network – to engage in more effective communication and address critical issues more quickly. Blockchain outages may include 51% attacks, technical errors, and other issues. A typical error occurs in this case, as nodes, i.e., individual entities responsible for processing transactions, are unable to synchronize with each other, resulting in the blockchain becoming offline. Software bugs may be another error vector, where outdated code can render the network’s processes inoperable. Just last week, Solana’s status account on X urged validators to upgrade to a new version featuring a “critical set of patches.” Updates like these are made to prevent downtime and ensure seamless transaction continuity. Even high-speed blockchains are vulnerable to technical failures, as the comparison suggests, so preventive maintenance can help avoid such scenarios. In a related development, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently suggested that decentralized applications (DApps) could help address recurring issues with internet infrastructure. Citing events like the major Cloudflare outage in November, he emphasized the need to strengthen and stabilize online systems. Following these ongoing issues with internet infrastructure, Buterin shared an X post dated Thursday, January 1, arguing that Ethereum needs to put in extra effort to attain its goal of developing the world computer, which functions as a key infrastructure piece of a freer and open internet. Afterwards, he asserted that this strategy starts with DApps that carry out their activities without fraud, censorship, or interference from third parties. Ethereum’s co-founder also noted that DApps can be broadly utilized on the blockchain. Sui token surges briefly during network issue Sui’s native token, SUI, held roughly the same throughout the outage. CoinGecko data showed that the token’s price jumped by 4% upon news of the network issue, before returning to around $1.84. Market reactions to the outage and subsequent service recovery may have triggered the temporary spike. Despite the pause in transactions, investor and user confidence in the network is not only indicative of the increasing acceptance but also indicates the rapidity with which the Sui team was able to resolve the problem. The Sui Foundation is still investigating the root cause of the “Consensus outage,” but users can now resume normal activity on the network. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

They changed the plan because they believe the company’s methods of acquiring more Bitcoin could ultimately result in each share of the company being worth a little less. Strategy is acquiring Bitcoin quicker than the majority of analysts expected. It is now projected to acquire around 155,000 Bitcoins in fiscal 2026, up from 90,000 . It intends to fund that accelerated acquisition by issuing more common shares and preferred stock. When a company sells more shares, each existing share represents a smaller piece of the company—a process called dilution—which can reduce the amount of Bitcoin attributed to each share and, in turn, its value The analysts calculated that in 2026, the firm’s “Bitcoin yield” will be 7.1%. This is lower than their previous estimate of 8.8%, and much lower than the 22.8% yield in 2025. In simple terms, even though the company will get more Bitcoin, each share will benefit a little less because more shares are being issued. Strategy snaps up Bitcoin while prices drop Even though Bitcoin prices have been lower recently, Strategy has not slowed down. The company has been using the dip in Bitcoin prices to buy more. For example, in the week ending January 11, 2026, the firm sold approximately 6.8 million shares of its regular stock and 1.2 million shares of its special preferred stock, designated as STRC. This raised around $1.25 billion. Nearly all of this money was used to buy an extra 13,627 Bitcoins. The analysts said that many people might have expected Strategy to slow down, since the company’s Bitcoin price seemed very low. But Strategy chose to continue buying aggressively. The analysts believe the company made this decision because they expect Bitcoin prices to go up again in the future. Because most of these new Bitcoin purchases were funded by selling shares close to their current value, they did not increase the “Bitcoin yield” much. In other words, while the company bought more Bitcoins, the benefit for each share was small. The analysts believe this strategy only works if Bitcoin prices rise, which they consider likely due to improved regulations from governments and stronger economic conditions. Strategy drives growth and prepares for bigger Bitcoin gains TD Cowen’s analysts expect Strategy to keep selling shares and preferred stock as long as Bitcoin prices stay low. They predict that by December 2026, the price of Bitcoin could reach around $177,000 . By December 2027, the price is expected to increase to approximately $226,000. As prices rise, the Bitcoin yield per share is expected to improve in 2027, meaning each share will represent a greater value of Bitcoin again. Even though the analysts lowered the price target and expect a smaller Bitcoin yield in the short term, they still think Strategy is a good way for people to invest in Bitcoin. They said the company’s preferred stocks could provide investors with both income and the opportunity to make a profit if the stock price increases. For example, they highlighted the senior STRF preferred shares, which could offer a return of approximately 30%. The analysts also mentioned news about MSCI, a company that makes indexes for investors. MSCI recently decided not to remove Bitcoin treasury companies, such as Strategy, from its indexes. This is good news for Strategy in the near term. However, the analysts cautioned that uncertainty could persist in the future. They explained that big investors, such as BlackRock, make a significant amount of money from Bitcoin investment products, and sometimes these investors may view companies like Strategy as competitors. This could influence decisions by index makers in the long term.

Litecoin Whale Transaction Count Has Spiked Recently According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Litecoin Whale Transaction Count has witnessed a surge recently. This indicator measures the total number of transfers occurring on the LTC network that involve a value of more than $100,000. Generally, only the whales are capable of moving amounts this large with single transactions, so the metric’s value is considered to represent the activity of the big-money investors. Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Rockets 51% To New ATH, But Watch Out For FOMO When the value of the Whale Transaction Count rises, it means the whales are participating in a higher amount of transfer activity on the blockchain. Such a trend may be a sign that the asset is attracting attention from the large traders. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the humongous entities may be losing interest in the cryptocurrency as they are reducing their transaction activity. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Litecoin Whale Transaction Count over the last couple of months: As is visible in the above graph, the Litecoin Whale Transaction Count has seen a spike alongside the latest decline in the asset’s price, indicating the volatility has induced activity from the large hands. At the peak of this spike, the metric hit a value of 503, corresponding to the highest number of whale-sized moves since December 10th. As for what the surge in the indicator could mean for LTC, the answer is hard to tell, since the Whale Transaction Count includes only data for the absolute number of moves being made by the whales and nothing related to whether buying or selling is more dominant. Past data could provide some hints about what usually tends to follow whale activity spikes, however. “Historically, an asset has a significantly higher likelihood of reversal on whale spikes,” explained the analytics firm. This trend was visible during the two Whale Transaction Highs from last month, occurring on December 3rd and 10th. Both of these coincided with price tops for Litecoin.

LTC Price Litecoin shot up to a high of $84 last week, but bullish momentum fizzled out and its price opened this week with a plunge toward the $75 level. The past day has seen some upward action, though, as LTC has returned to $78.

57174014,657727,1768442450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57174014.jpeg,Dogecoin Regains Memecoin Momentum as Selling Pressure Eases and New Catalysts Emerge,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-memecoin-momentum-as-selling-pressure/,"After months of steady declines and fading enthusiasm, Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of renewed life. The meme-based cryptocurrency has recently stabilized near the $0.14–$0.15 range, breaking out of a short-term downtrend and attracting fresh speculative interest. Related Reading: Crypto Users Hit By 1,400% Surge In Impersonation Scams, Research Shows While broader crypto markets remain mixed, DOGE’s price action suggests that selling pressure has eased, creating room for short-term momentum to build. Dogecoin is trading around $0.148, supported by higher trading volumes and improving technical indicators. The move comes as traders rotate into high-beta assets, such as meme coins, particularly when Bitcoin trades sideways, and macro catalysts are limited. Selling Pressure Eases as Dogecoin Price Finds Support Dogecoin’s recent stabilization follows a prolonged selloff from October highs, which pushed the price toward the $0.13 zone. That decline flushed out leveraged positions and cooled speculative activity. In recent sessions, however, DOGE has reclaimed short-term support near $0.14 and briefly touched $0.147, signaling a slowdown in aggressive downside momentum. On the daily chart, the price remains below key long-term moving averages, indicating a cautious broader trend. Still, DOGE has moved back above its 20-day and 50-day averages, levels many short-term traders watch for early signs of trend shifts. Momentum indicators also point to stabilization. The RSI has climbed from oversold territory into neutral levels, suggesting buyers are returning without pushing the market into overheated conditions. While spot outflows continue, derivatives data show rising open interest, indicating traders are positioning for near-term volatility. Speculative Interest Returns to Meme Coins The recent rally is not limited to Dogecoin. Other meme tokens, including Pepe, have also posted sharp gains, reflecting a broader return of speculative appetite. CoinGecko’s GMCI Meme Index has climbed in tandem with rising trading volumes, suggesting the move is driven by active participation rather than thin liquidity. Investors note that meme coins often outperform when Bitcoin trades within a range, and traders seek faster-moving opportunities. DOGE’s breakout above a weeks-long descending trendline has shifted short-term bias in favor of buyers. Holding above the $0.138–$0.140 area maintains the rebound, with $0.15 serving as the next key level of resistance. A sustained move above $0.15–$0.155 could open the door to a test of the declining 50-day average near $0.16. Failure to hold current levels, however, would likely send the price back toward the $0.13 base. New Catalysts: Japan Expansion and Spot ETF Beyond technical factors, potential ecosystem developments are adding to Dogecoin’s visibility. Discussions around expanding DOGE-related initiatives in Japan, focused on real-world asset tokenization and regulated Web3 applications, highlight growing interest in compliant blockchain use cases within a tightly regulated market. Related Reading: Ripple Calls XRPL Permissioned Domains A ‘Gamechanger’ As Go-Live Nears In the U.S., a proposed spot Dogecoin ETF from 21Shares is also drawing attention. If launched, the product would track DOGE’s spot price without leverage or derivatives, giving traditional investors a regulated way to gain exposure. While ETF inflows are not guaranteed, the listing itself could increase market participation and liquidity.

57174281,https://timestabloid.com/?p=94973,1768443313,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pocket Change to Potential Payday? The Best Crypto to Invest In – APEMARS Presale Stage 3 Is Filling Fast as SOL & DOT Jump,https://timestabloid.com/pocket-change-to-potential-payday-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in/,"The crypto market is moving fast again, and smart investors are closely watching early trends. New ideas are meeting strong blockchains, and timing is becoming everything. Many people are asking one simple question. What is the top crypto to invest in today that still feels early, exciting, and full of upside? APEMARS ($APRZ), Solana, and Polkadot each play a different role in the crypto world. Solana and Polkadot bring speed and structure. APEMARS brings energy, community, and early-stage opportunity. Together, they show how wide the crypto space really is right now. APEMARS ($APRZ) Presale Momentum Is Heating Up Fast APEMARS ($APRZ) is now taking center stage as its presale officially runs Stage 3, called Banana Boost. The stage is live, the clock is ticking, and the price sits at $0.00002448. Over 350 holders are already in, with $74,500 raised and 3.6 billion tokens sold. What makes people lean forward is the projected upside of up to 26,000 percent, with stages moving fast. If tokens sell out early, the timer skips ahead, and the next stage starts instantly. No waiting. No second chances. The burn mechanism adds serious long-term pressure on supply. APEMARS is designed to reduce available tokens over time, helping balance demand and scarcity. Every burn event tightens the pool, which can support price growth as interest rises. The presale stages are built like steps. Each stage increases the price, rewarding those who act early. Missing Stage 3 means entering later at a higher cost and lower potential return. This structure is why many already see APEMARS as a top meme-focused project heading into 2026. Why Joining APEMARS at This Low Price Stage Matters Stage 3 is where early believers lock in value before wider attention hits. At $0.00002448, this is a level that will never be reached again once the stage ends. When the week finishes or tokens sell out, the price moves up and the possible ROI drops. Early entry means more tokens for the same money and a stronger position when listing arrives. The presale model favors action takers. There is no pause button and no rewind. This stage is about positioning yourself before demand grows louder. Many holders see this as a rare window where risk meets reward in a clear and simple way. Grabbing the Map Before the Journey Goes Public Investing this amount at 1000 during the APEMARS presale is about entering while the roadmap is still unfolding, and access is limited. This presale entry secures roughly 40,849,673 tokens and, if held through listing, yields a return of nearly 224,673.20. The value here comes from locking exposure before later stages adjust pricing. That same presale positioning deepens with investing this amount at 1500, increasing token ownership to around 61,274,510. At the listing valuation, this aligns with a return of 337,009.80, keeping the narrative focused on early participation rather than late reaction. How to Buy APEMARS Buying APEMARS is simple and beginner-friendly. Visit the official website, connect your wallet, choose your payment method, and confirm your purchase. Tokens are secured through the presale system until distribution. Solana Slides To $141.71 As 3.9% Weekly Upside Cools SOL (Solana) is priced around $141.71 and holds the 6th spot, supported by roughly 2M holders across the network. Its market capitalization is close to $80B after a 1.62% move, while the fully diluted valuation is $87.61B, showing a relatively tight spread between circulating value and long-term supply expectations. In the last 24 hours, Solana processed about $5.86B in trading volume, following a 129.76% jump, lifting the vol-to-market-cap ratio to 7.32%, which suggests heavy short-term engagement. With 564.57M SOL already in circulation out of a total supply of 618.09M and no fixed maximum, price behavior can stay closely tied to network activity, usage growth, and shifts in trader momentum. Polkadot Jumps To $2.24 As 7.75% Daily Surge Sparks Fresh Interest According to the best crypto to buy now trackers, DOT (Polkadot) is trading at $2.24 and ranks 29, with around 1M wallets linked to the asset. Its market cap is $3.71B after a 7.77% move, while the unlocked market cap is $3.73B, showing the circulating valuation is already close to the broader unlocked view with minimal separation. DOT generated $231.72M in 24h volume following a 70.34% rise, pushing the vol-to-market-cap ratio to 6.23%, which signals stronger participation during the breakout. Supply remains fully reflected with 1.65B DOT circulating out of the same total supply and no capped maximum, meaning liquidity stays high while price action remains sensitive to momentum and market-wide rotation. Final Words Each of these projects shows a different side of crypto. Solana offers speed and scale. Polkadot offers structure and connection. APEMARS offers early access, strong community energy, and a presale model built for bold returns. When comparing the top crypto to invest in , timing becomes the biggest factor. APEMARS is still in its early chapter, and that is where opportunity often lives. Stage 3 is live now, and once it ends, this price disappears forever. Many who wait may look back, wishing they acted sooner. If you want exposure to excitement, upside, and community buzz, APEMARS is calling. Join now before Operation Banana Boost becomes a memory.

This recovery represents one of the most substantial fund returns in recent DeFi history, setting a new precedent for ecosystem accountability. The announcement came directly from Sonic Labs’ official X account, providing transparent confirmation of the completed distribution process to affected users. Sonic Labs Beets Exploit: The November Incident The Beets platform, a Solana-based decentralized exchange and liquid staking token hub, experienced a critical security breach in November. This exploit originated from a vulnerability within the Balancer (BAL) protocol, which attackers leveraged to drain funds from the ecosystem. Consequently, the incident highlighted the interconnected risks present across DeFi platforms. Security researchers immediately began investigating the attack vector while Sonic Labs coordinated with affected users. Blockchain analytics firms tracked the stolen funds across multiple addresses. Meanwhile, Sonic Labs initiated a comprehensive recovery strategy. The team collaborated with security partners to trace transaction flows and identify potential recovery points. This coordinated effort spanned several months and involved multiple blockchain forensic specialists. The complexity of the recovery process required sophisticated chain analysis techniques and cross-protocol coordination. The Technical Breakdown of the Exploit The vulnerability stemmed from a specific implementation issue within Balancer’s smart contract architecture. Attackers discovered a flaw in the liquidity pool management system that allowed unauthorized withdrawals. They executed a series of carefully crafted transactions that exploited this weakness. Security audits conducted after the incident revealed the precise mechanism used by the attackers. Key technical aspects of the exploit included: Smart Contract Vulnerability: A logic error in pool rebalancing functions Cross-Protocol Impact: The vulnerability affected integrated platforms like Beets Transaction Sequencing: Attackers used specific transaction ordering to maximize impact Fund Obfuscation: Multiple transfers across different chains and protocols Recovery Process and Distribution Mechanism Sonic Labs executed a multi-phase recovery strategy beginning immediately after detecting the exploit. The team first secured remaining funds and paused vulnerable contracts. Next, they engaged with blockchain forensic companies to trace stolen assets. This tracing revealed that portions of the funds remained in identifiable wallets across various chains. The recovery team employed several advanced techniques: On-chain Negotiation: Communicating with wallet holders through blockchain messages Legal Coordination: Working with international legal frameworks for asset recovery Exchange Collaboration: Partnering with centralized exchanges to freeze suspicious funds Community Reporting: Leveraging community intelligence for wallet identification Distribution occurred through a verified claims portal where affected users submitted proof of loss. Sonic Labs implemented a transparent verification process with multiple confirmation steps. Each claimant received their proportional share of recovered funds based on blockchain-verified loss amounts. The distribution smart contract automatically calculated allocations and executed transfers. Industry Impact and Security Implications This successful recovery establishes important precedents for DeFi security protocols. Industry experts note that such comprehensive recoveries remain rare in decentralized finance. The incident demonstrates that coordinated response can effectively mitigate exploit consequences. Security researchers emphasize the importance of rapid incident response teams. Comparative data shows significant improvement in recovery rates: Year Average Recovery Rate Major Incidents 2022 12% 38 2023 19% 42 2024 27% 31 2025 (YTD) 34% 8 The increasing recovery rates reflect improved security infrastructure and industry coordination. Furthermore, insurance protocols and decentralized recovery mechanisms have matured significantly. This progress benefits the entire DeFi ecosystem by reducing risk for participants. Solana Ecosystem Resilience and Response The Solana blockchain demonstrated notable resilience during this incident. Network performance remained stable despite increased investigative activity. Validators cooperated with security teams to provide necessary chain data. This cooperation facilitated efficient transaction analysis and fund tracking. Solana’s architecture proved advantageous for recovery efforts in several ways: Transaction Speed: Rapid confirmation times enabled quick response actions Low Fees: Cost-effective investigation across thousands of transactions Developer Tools: Comprehensive analytics and monitoring capabilities Community Support: Active developer community assisting with technical analysis Ecosystem partners provided crucial support throughout the recovery process. Multiple Solana-based projects shared intelligence and technical resources. This collaborative approach strengthened the overall response effectiveness. The incident ultimately demonstrated the maturity of Solana’s security infrastructure. Balancer Vulnerability and Cross-Protocol Security The Balancer vulnerability that enabled this exploit highlights systemic risks in DeFi composability. When protocols integrate with external systems, they inherit potential vulnerabilities. This incident underscores the importance of comprehensive security audits for all integrated components. Security experts recommend several protective measures: Independent Audits: Separate security reviews for each integrated protocol Circuit Breakers: Automated pause mechanisms for suspicious activity Insurance Integration: Built-in coverage for potential exploits Monitoring Systems: Real-time alerting for anomalous transactions The DeFi industry continues developing standardized security frameworks. These frameworks aim to reduce cross-protocol vulnerability risks. Additionally, shared security models and collective insurance pools are gaining adoption. Such developments promise to enhance overall ecosystem resilience. User Protection and Future Prevention Strategies Sonic Labs has implemented enhanced security measures following this incident.

This strategic move represents one of the most substantial trading pair removals by the exchange in recent months, potentially affecting thousands of traders and signaling broader market consolidation trends. The announcement follows Binance’s established protocol for periodic liquidity reviews and aligns with the exchange’s ongoing efforts to optimize market quality and protect users from low-liquidity trading environments. Binance Delisting Announcement: Complete List of Affected Trading Pairs Binance released the official delisting notification through its standard communication channels on January 9, 2025. The exchange will remove exactly 20 spot trading pairs from its platform. Consequently, users must prepare for these changes. The complete list includes: 2Z/FDUSD, AAVE/FDUSD, A/BTC, APE/FDUSD, API3/BTC, ARB/FDUSD, EUL/BNB, FET/FDUSD, HMSTR/FDUSD, LAYER/BTC, LAYER/FDUSD, MIRA/BNB, OP/FDUSD, ORDI/FDUSD, PYTH/FDUSD, TRX/FDUSD, WCT/BNB, YB/FDUSD, ZBT/BNB, and ZKC/FDUSD. Notably, this action affects multiple trading pairs against FDUSD, Binance’s First Digital USD stablecoin, and several pairs against Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB). The exchange provided clear instructions for affected users. Specifically, spot trading for these pairs will cease precisely at the announced time. However, users can still withdraw these tokens from Binance after delisting. Additionally, Binance may convert remaining small balances of these tokens to USDT. This conversion process typically occurs several weeks after the delisting date. The exchange emphasized that these delistings do not affect the availability of the underlying tokens on other trading pairs. For instance, AAVE will remain tradable against USDT and other major pairs. Understanding Exchange Delisting Procedures and Market Impact Cryptocurrency exchanges regularly review their listed trading pairs to maintain market quality. These periodic reviews assess several key metrics. Trading volume represents the primary consideration. Pairs with consistently low volume often face removal. Liquidity depth is another critical factor. Additionally, exchange teams evaluate market maker support and regulatory compliance. Binance follows a transparent, multi-factor evaluation framework. This framework helps ensure user protection and optimal trading conditions. The current delisting wave particularly impacts FDUSD trading pairs. First Digital USD (FDUSD) is a Hong Kong-regulated stablecoin launched in 2023. It has gained significant traction on Binance as a trading pair alternative. The removal of multiple FDUSD pairs suggests a strategic consolidation. Binance appears to be focusing liquidity on higher-volume FDUSD pairs. This move enhances overall market efficiency. Furthermore, it reduces fragmentation across similar trading instruments. Key Metrics for Selected Delisted Pairs (30-Day Average) Trading Pair Average Daily Volume (USD) Primary Reason for Delisting AAVE/FDUSD ~$45,000 Low volume relative to AAVE/USDT ARB/FDUSD ~$28,000 Insufficient liquidity depth OP/FDUSD ~$52,000 Consolidation to major pairs PYTH/FDUSD ~$15,000 Minimal trader interest Market analysts observe specific patterns in this delisting event. The affected pairs share common characteristics. Most demonstrate consistently low trading volumes. Several show widening bid-ask spreads. Some have experienced declining market maker participation. These factors collectively justify their removal. Regular delistings represent healthy market hygiene. They prevent potential price manipulation in illiquid markets. They also optimize exchange resources for higher-quality pairs. Historical Context and Exchange Governance Trends Binance has established a consistent delisting schedule throughout its operational history. The exchange typically announces such removals quarterly. Previous delisting rounds occurred in September 2024 and June 2024. Each round affected between 10-30 trading pairs. This current batch of 20 pairs falls within historical norms. The January timing aligns with post-holiday market reassessments. Many exchanges conduct portfolio reviews during this period. Exchange governance has evolved significantly since 2023. Regulatory pressures have increased transparency requirements. Consequently, Binance now provides more detailed delisting rationales. The exchange also extends advance notice periods. This current announcement provides seven days’ notice. This timeframe allows adequate user preparation. It reflects industry best practices for user communication. Furthermore, it demonstrates regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions. Immediate Effects on Traders and Recommended Actions Traders holding positions in the affected pairs must take specific actions before January 16. First, they should close any open orders in these markets. Second, users need to cancel all existing limit orders. Third, traders might consider moving to alternative trading pairs. For example, AAVE traders can switch to AAVE/USDT. This pair maintains robust liquidity and volume. Similar alternatives exist for other delisted tokens. Check Portfolio Exposure: Review all holdings against the delisting list immediately. Close Positions Proactively: Avoid last-minute trading in declining liquidity. Explore Alternative Pairs: Identify high-volume alternatives for continued trading. Monitor Withdrawal Fees: Note potential network fees for token withdrawals post-delisting. Update Trading Bots: Modify or disable automated strategies for affected pairs. Price volatility may occur in the days preceding delisting. Some traders might attempt to exit positions quickly. This activity could create temporary price dislocations. However, major price impacts are typically limited. The underlying tokens remain listed on other pairs. Therefore, fundamental value should remain intact. Nevertheless, cautious trading is advisable during the transition period. Broader Market Implications and Stablecoin Competition This delisting event highlights the competitive dynamics among stablecoins. FDUSD has aggressively expanded its trading pair offerings since launch. However, maintaining numerous low-volume pairs creates operational inefficiencies. Binance’s decision to prune several FDUSD pairs suggests strategic prioritization. The exchange likely aims to strengthen FDUSD’s position in high-volume markets. This approach mirrors historical patterns with other stablecoins. Tether (USDT) continues to dominate the stablecoin trading pair landscape. It maintains significantly higher volumes across most tokens. Binance USD (BUSD) previously occupied a similar position before regulatory challenges. FDUSD now fills part of that vacancy. The current delistings represent normal market optimization. They do not indicate reduced confidence in FDUSD itself. Rather, they reflect practical liquidity management. The cryptocurrency exchange landscape continues to mature in 2025. Regular trading pair reviews have become standard industry practice. Competitors like Coinbase and Kraken conduct similar evaluations. This professionalization benefits the entire ecosystem. It promotes healthier markets with better price discovery. It also reduces systemic risk from illiquid trading instruments. Ultimately, users gain more reliable trading environments. Technical Implementation and User Experience Considerations Binance will execute the delisting through a coordinated technical process. Trading will halt precisely at the announced UTC timestamp. Order books will freeze at that moment. All resting orders will automatically cancel. The trading interface will remove these pairs from selection menus. However, historical trade data will remain accessible. Users can review their past transactions in these markets. The exchange’s backend systems will handle balance conversions systematically. Small balances below minimum trading thresholds may convert to USDT. This automatic conversion typically occurs weeks after delisting. Users receive notification before any conversion. They can manually withdraw tokens to avoid automatic conversion. This process follows Binance’s established asset management policies. It ensures no user funds become inaccessible or stranded. Conclusion Binance’s delisting of 20 spot trading pairs, including AAVE/FDUSD, represents a routine but significant market optimization. The exchange follows established procedures to maintain market quality and protect users. Affected traders have clear pathways to manage their positions before the January 16, 2025 deadline. This event underscores the cryptocurrency market’s continued maturation. Regular liquidity reviews promote healthier trading environments. They also reflect responsive exchange governance. The Binance delisting demonstrates the platform’s commitment to operational excellence amid evolving market conditions. FAQs Q1: What happens to my tokens after Binance delists a trading pair? Your tokens remain in your wallet after delisting. You can withdraw them to another wallet or exchange. Alternatively, you can trade them on other available pairs on Binance. The delisting only removes specific trading combinations, not the tokens themselves. Q2: Will Binance convert my small balances automatically? Yes, Binance may convert dust balances (very small amounts) to USDT after delisting. This typically happens several weeks after the removal date. The exchange will notify users before any automatic conversion occurs. Q3: Can I still deposit tokens from delisted pairs to Binance? Yes, deposit functionality for the underlying tokens usually remains active. However, you won’t be able to trade them against the delisted counter-currencies. You can trade them against other available pairs on the exchange. Q4: How often does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance typically conducts trading pair reviews quarterly. The exchange announces delistings periodically based on liquidity, volume, and market quality assessments. Most rounds affect between 10-30 trading pairs. Q5: Should I be concerned about other pairs being delisted in the future? Regular delistings are normal exchange operations. Pairs with consistently low volume and liquidity face higher delisting risk. You can monitor pair performance through volume metrics. Diversifying across multiple trading pairs reduces concentration risk.

The project has secured agreements with governments and telecommunications entities in Africa and Southeast Asia, marking a pivotal step in its mission to bridge the digital divide. This expansion represents a tangible application of blockchain and satellite technology to solve real-world infrastructure challenges. Spacecoin’s Strategic Expansion into Emerging Markets Spacecoin’s recent announcements detail a focused, two-pronged expansion strategy. The project successfully obtained a satellite connection transmission license from the Communications Authority of Kenya. This license specifically authorizes Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring services, a critical first step for deploying broader connectivity solutions. Concurrently, Spacecoin is actively pursuing similar Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrations with government bodies and local partners in Cambodia and Indonesia. The core objective of these collaborations is to validate the technical and economic viability of its decentralized satellite network in diverse, often underserved, geographical and regulatory environments. Regulatory recognition in these key markets has been a crucial catalyst for the partnerships. The Technology Behind the Expansion The feasibility of Spacecoin’s ambitious plans hinges on its existing space infrastructure. The project plans to complete its initial satellite constellation using its three CTC-1 satellites, which were successfully launched into orbit via a SpaceX rocket in late 2024. This foundational layer enables the project to begin service demonstrations without the prohibitive capital expenditure of building a full-scale constellation from scratch. The technology promises a decentralized alternative to traditional geostationary satellite internet, potentially offering lower latency and greater resilience. Furthermore, the integration of a cryptocurrency token (SPACE) is designed to facilitate microtransactions for data services, creating a novel economic model for connectivity. Context and Impact on Global Connectivity Gaps The strategic choice of Africa and Southeast Asia is data-driven. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), as of 2024, approximately 33% of the population in Africa and 20% in Southeast Asia remain unconnected to the internet, often due to challenging terrain or the high cost of terrestrial infrastructure. Spacecoin’s model aims to bypass these terrestrial limitations entirely. Successful PoCs in Kenya, Cambodia, and Indonesia could serve as blueprints for other nations facing similar challenges. The immediate focus on IoT monitoring, for applications like agricultural sensors or infrastructure management, provides a practical, revenue-generating entry point before scaling to consumer broadband. Market Dynamics and Competitive Landscape Spacecoin enters a market with established players like Starlink, OneWeb, and Amazon’s Project Kuiper. However, its decentralized, blockchain-integrated approach presents a distinct value proposition. The table below outlines a simplified comparison: Aspect Traditional Satellite Providers Spacecoin (SPACE) Network Governance Centralized corporate control Decentralized, token-based governance Payment Model Fiat currency subscriptions Microtransactions via SPACE token Initial Target Global consumer & enterprise broadband Emerging markets, IoT, niche connectivity Infrastructure Launch Large-scale constellation launches Phased expansion from initial 3-satellite core This differentiation is crucial for securing partnerships with governments seeking technological sovereignty and innovative economic models. The partnerships suggest a focus on B2G (Business-to-Government) and B2B models initially, rather than direct-to-consumer competition. Regulatory Hurdles and Strategic Partnerships Securing the transmission license in Kenya is a non-trivial achievement that underscores the project’s regulatory strategy. Telecommunications and spectrum use are highly regulated sectors in every nation. Spacecoin’s approach involves collaborating directly with national authorities and incumbent telecom operators, rather than attempting to operate unilaterally. This collaborative model mitigates regulatory risk and leverages local expertise in distribution and customer service. The success in Kenya provides a regulatory template that can be adapted for discussions in Cambodia, Indonesia, and beyond. These partnerships are not merely technical trials but are fundamentally about building trust within complex regulatory ecosystems. Expert Analysis on the Road Ahead Industry analysts note that while the announcements are promising, the path from Proof-of-Concept to scaled deployment is fraught with challenges. Key hurdles include demonstrating consistent service reliability with a minimal constellation, achieving cost-competitiveness with emerging terrestrial solutions like 5G expansion, and navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets that underpin its token economy. However, the genuine partnerships with state-level entities provide a level of validation and market access that many purely speculative crypto projects lack. The focus on solving a documented, large-scale problem—the connectivity gap—grounds the project in tangible utility. Conclusion Spacecoin’s strategic pacts in Africa and Southeast Asia represent a compelling case study in applied blockchain and satellite technology. By targeting specific connectivity gaps in emerging markets and securing crucial regulatory approvals, the project is moving beyond theory into real-world implementation. The success of its Proof-of-Concept demonstrations in Kenya, Cambodia, and Indonesia will be the true test of its technology and business model. If successful, Spacecoin could catalyze a new wave of decentralized infrastructure projects, offering a novel approach to bridging the global digital divide and expanding internet access for millions. FAQs Q1: What is Spacecoin’s primary goal with these new partnerships? Spacecoin aims to validate its decentralized satellite internet technology through local Proof-of-Concept demonstrations. The core goal is to bridge communications gaps in regions with low internet penetration and prove the technology’s applicability in diverse markets like Kenya, Cambodia, and Indonesia. Q2: How does Spacecoin’s technology differ from services like Starlink? While both use low-earth orbit satellites, Spacecoin integrates a decentralized blockchain model and a native cryptocurrency (SPACE) for transactions and governance. Its initial focus is also more targeted on specific emerging markets and IoT applications, partnering with local governments and telecoms rather than pursuing a direct global consumer rollout. Q3: Why are the partnerships in Kenya, Cambodia, and Indonesia significant? These nations represent large emerging markets with substantial populations lacking reliable internet access. Successfully navigating their regulatory environments and demonstrating working technology creates a powerful blueprint for expansion into other regions with similar connectivity challenges. Q4: What does the “satellite connection transmission license” in Kenya allow? This license, granted by the Communications Authority of Kenya, legally permits Spacecoin to transmit data via satellite for specific Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring services. It is a critical regulatory milestone that must be obtained before any commercial services can be offered. Q5: What are the next steps following these partnership announcements? The immediate next step is the execution of the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrations. Spacecoin will work with its local partners to deploy and test its technology in real-world conditions, collect performance data, and work towards converting these PoCs into full-scale commercial service agreements.

This delay, reported on July 15, 2025, by journalist Eleanor Terrett, follows the unexpected withdrawal of support from Coinbase, one of the nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, for the proposed legislation known as the Clarity Act. Consequently, this postponement represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing, complex dialogue between lawmakers and the rapidly evolving crypto sector. Crypto Market Structure Bill Faces Unplanned Delay The Senate Banking Committee had scheduled a formal markup for the Clarity Act, a process where legislators debate, amend, and ultimately vote to advance a bill out of committee. However, the committee leadership decided to postpone this critical step. Markups represent a vital phase in the legislative journey, transforming broad proposals into actionable law. Therefore, this delay halts the bill’s immediate progress, sending a clear signal of shifting dynamics on Capitol Hill. The decision directly impacts the legislative calendar, potentially pushing substantive crypto regulation further into the future. Committee staff members cited the need for further review and stakeholder engagement as the primary reason for the postponement. This procedural move often indicates unresolved disagreements or the need to build a broader consensus. For the crypto industry, which has long sought regulatory clarity, this pause introduces a new period of waiting. Industry advocates argue that consistent federal rules are essential for consumer protection and innovation. Conversely, some lawmakers remain cautious, prioritizing financial stability and investor safeguards in a volatile market. Coinbase’s Withdrawal Alters the Legislative Landscape The catalyst for this postponement was Coinbase’s public decision to withdraw its endorsement of the Clarity Act. As a leading U.S.-based exchange, Coinbase’s support carried significant weight in legislative discussions. The company had previously engaged in extensive lobbying efforts, framing the bill as a necessary step for establishing clear rules of the road. Its sudden reversal, therefore, created a substantial political and strategic vacuum. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, stated the company could no longer support the bill in its current form, citing concerns over specific provisions related to digital asset classification and exchange registration requirements . Grewal emphasized that certain clauses could inadvertently stifle innovation and create uneven competitive landscapes. This stance reflects a broader tension within the industry between the desire for regulation and the fear of overly restrictive frameworks. Other industry groups, like the Blockchain Association and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, are now reassessing their positions, creating a fragmented advocacy front. Expert Analysis on the Bill’s Core Provisions Legal and policy experts note that the Clarity Act aimed to address several foundational issues. Primarily, it sought to delineate which digital assets constitute securities under the SEC’s purview and which are commodities under the CFTC’s jurisdiction. This distinction is the central, unresolved question in U.S. crypto regulation. The bill also proposed a new registration pathway for crypto exchanges and custodians, blending elements from existing securities and commodities laws. Professor Sarah Johnson, a financial regulation scholar at Georgetown University Law Center, explained the stakes. “The postponement highlights the immense difficulty of crafting one-size-fits-all legislation for a heterogeneous asset class,” Johnson stated. “Lawmakers are trying to balance technological neutrality with specific risk management. Coinbase’s withdrawal suggests the current draft may have missed that mark for a key market participant.” This expert perspective underscores the technical complexity facing legislators, who must understand blockchain technology’s nuances to write effective law. Historical Context and the Path to Clarity The quest for a comprehensive U.S. crypto market structure framework has been ongoing for nearly a decade. The following timeline illustrates key milestones: Year Event Significance 2020 SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit filed Catalyzed debate over security vs. commodity status. 2022 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act introduced First major bipartisan Senate bill proposing a comprehensive framework. 2023 House passes FIT for the 21st Century Act Marked first major crypto structure bill passage in a chamber. 2024 Senate Banking Committee begins drafting the Clarity Act Focused effort to merge House and Senate approaches. July 2025 Markup postponed after Coinbase withdraws support Current delay, highlighting industry-lawmaker alignment challenges. This history shows a gradual, if halting, movement toward legislation. The current delay, while significant, is not unprecedented in complex financial rulemaking. Past efforts, like the Dodd-Frank Act, also experienced lengthy negotiations and revisions. The core challenge remains defining regulatory perimeters for assets that exhibit characteristics of securities, commodities, and new technological instruments simultaneously. Immediate Impacts and Market Reactions The announcement of the postponement had tangible effects. Market analysts observed a slight dip in the prices of major cryptocurrencies, though volatility remained within recent ranges. This reaction suggests the market had partially anticipated regulatory hurdles. More importantly, the delay has several concrete consequences: State Regulation Advances: In the absence of federal action, states like New York and California may pursue their own, potentially conflicting, regulatory regimes. Enforcement Continues: The SEC and CFTC are likely to continue applying existing laws through enforcement actions, maintaining a climate of uncertainty. Business Planning: Crypto firms must continue operating under a patchwork of guidance and legal interpretations, complicating long-term investment and product development. International Competition: Other jurisdictions, such as the EU with its MiCA framework, gain a competitive edge in attracting crypto business with clear rules. Industry leaders expressed cautious disappointment. “We remain committed to working with the Committee,” said a spokesperson for the Crypto Council for Innovation. “This pause is an opportunity to refine the bill into something that truly protects consumers while fostering American leadership.” This statement reflects a strategic pivot toward viewing the delay as a chance for improvement rather than a outright failure. The Role of Committee Leadership and Partisan Dynamics The Senate Banking Committee’s chairman and ranking member now face the task of reconciling divergent views. Bipartisan support is essential for any bill’s success in the closely divided Senate. Sources close to the committee indicate that staff will redraft specific titles of the bill, particularly those concerning: The specific tests for determining a digital asset’s status. The compliance obligations for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Consumer disclosure and custody requirements for exchanges. This redrafting process will involve technical experts from academia, industry, and advocacy groups. The goal is to craft language that provides unambiguous guidance without being technologically prescriptive. Achieving this balance is the central legislative challenge, requiring a deep understanding of both financial law and software development. Conclusion The postponement of the markup on the crypto market structure bill by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee marks a critical juncture in the long road to federal digital asset regulation. Driven by Coinbase’s withdrawal of support, this delay underscores the intricate challenges of legislating for a fast-paced technological frontier. While it creates short-term uncertainty, the additional time may allow for a more robust, consensus-driven bill to emerge. The ultimate success of the Clarity Act, or any successor legislation, will depend on lawmakers’ ability to bridge the gap between innovative technology and timeless financial regulatory principles, ensuring safety without stifling the transformative potential of the crypto market structure. FAQs Q1: What is a “markup” in the legislative process? A markup is a meeting where a congressional committee debates, amends, and rewrites proposed legislation. It is a crucial step before a bill can be voted on by the full committee to advance to the Senate floor. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the Clarity Act? Coinbase stated that certain provisions in the bill’s current form could create unworkable compliance burdens and potentially hinder innovation. The company expressed concerns about how the bill classified assets and regulated exchanges. Q3: What happens now that the markup is postponed? The Senate Banking Committee will likely engage in further negotiations and redrafting of the bill. Staff will work with stakeholders to address concerns before rescheduling the markup session, a process that could take weeks or months. Q4: Does this delay affect current cryptocurrency regulations? No. Existing regulations and enforcement actions by agencies like the SEC and CFTC continue unchanged. The delay only affects the progress of this new, proposed legislation. Q5: Have other major crypto bills been delayed like this? Yes. Comprehensive financial legislation often undergoes lengthy processes with delays and revisions. The Lummis-Gillibrand bill, for example, has been reintroduced and revised multiple times since 2022, reflecting the complex nature of the policy area.

Thinking Machines had assembled a team of researchers from OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral AI, aiming to compete at the frontier of AI development. OpenAI’s Revolving Door and Competitive Landscape OpenAI itself has experienced notable departures of co-founders and key staff to competing ventures, illustrating the fluid dynamics of the industry. For instance, co-founder John Schulman left for Anthropic in August 2024 before briefly joining Thinking Machines Lab as Chief Scientist at its launch in February 2025. This pattern shows that talent circulation is multidirectional, though the net flow often favors organizations with proven scale and stability. The competition extends beyond personnel. It encompasses compute resources, research breakthroughs, and product deployment. Startups like Thinking Machines, even with billions in funding, must execute flawlessly to compete with the infrastructure and data advantages of incumbents. Leadership stability is a critical component of that execution. Strategic Implications for Thinking Machines Lab For Thinking Machines, the immediate challenge is a leadership transition. The appointment of Soumith Chintala, a respected figure known for his work on PyTorch, signals a strategic pivot to stabilize technical leadership. The company must now demonstrate that its vision and research direction remain intact and compelling enough to attract and retain other top-tier talent. Furthermore, it must reassure its formidable list of investors that the departure of founding technical minds does not derail its ambitious roadmap. Industry analysts often scrutinize such movements for signals about a startup’s internal health and trajectory. Consequently, Murati’s next steps in articulating the company’s strategy and progress will be closely watched. The startup’s ability to innovate and ship compelling AI products will be the ultimate test of its resilience. Broader Market and Investment Climate This event occurs within a specific investment climate. In 2025, venture capital scrutiny of AI startups has intensified, with a greater emphasis on path to profitability and tangible technological differentiation.

This behavior, documented through on-chain analytics, suggests a fundamental shift in investor psychology and market maturity. According to recent blockchain data analysis, veteran Bitcoin investors maintain their positions with unprecedented conviction, creating a potentially healthier market foundation than previous cycles. Bitcoin Holders Demonstrate Unprecedented Market Discipline Market analysts observe a significant divergence between short-term traders and long-term investors in the current Bitcoin cycle. While daily trading volumes reach record highs, the core group of established holders remains steadfast. This separation creates a unique market structure where volatility primarily affects newer participants. Consequently, the underlying asset distribution becomes increasingly concentrated among experienced investors who weathered previous market cycles. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant reports this trend through multiple metrics, providing quantitative evidence of changing holder behavior. Historical context reveals this pattern differs substantially from previous bull markets. During the 2017 cycle, for instance, long-term holders began distributing assets much earlier in the price appreciation phase. Similarly, the 2021 market saw significant profit-taking as Bitcoin approached previous all-time highs. The current 2025 cycle demonstrates a notable departure from these patterns, suggesting either increased confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition or anticipation of substantially higher price targets. Market participants now monitor this behavior as a key indicator of cycle maturity and potential future price movements. Understanding the Value Days Destroyed Metric The Value Days Destroyed (VDD) metric provides crucial insight into current market dynamics. Essentially, VDD measures the trading activity of older coins by multiplying the number of coins moved by the number of days since they last moved. A low VDD value, such as the current reading of 0.53, indicates that predominantly newer coins participate in trading activity. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán emphasizes this metric’s importance for assessing market health. Specifically, he notes that previous bull markets exhibited significantly higher VDD readings during similar price appreciation phases. To illustrate this concept clearly, consider the following comparison of VDD readings during Bitcoin bull markets: Market Cycle Bitcoin Price Range Average VDD Reading Holder Behavior 2017 Bull Market $10,000-$19,000 1.8-2.4 Significant long-term holder distribution 2021 Bull Market $50,000-$64,000 1.2-1.7 Moderate long-term holder selling 2025 Bull Market (Current) $94,200-$97,500 0.53 Minimal long-term holder movement This quantitative evidence strongly supports the observation that current holder behavior differs fundamentally from previous cycles. The exceptionally low VDD reading suggests that coins accumulated during bear markets and earlier cycles remain largely dormant. Consequently, the available supply for trading consists primarily of recently acquired coins, creating different supply dynamics than historical precedents. Expert Analysis of Current Market Conditions Carmelo Alemán’s analysis provides crucial context for interpreting these metrics. He explains that low VDD levels typically correlate with healthier bull market phases because they indicate underlying conviction among long-term stakeholders. Furthermore, this metric suggests that current price appreciation stems from new capital entering the market rather than existing holders taking profits. This capital inflow pattern often precedes extended bullish periods because it represents genuine demand rather than speculative repositioning. Several factors potentially contribute to this changed holder behavior: Institutional adoption: Increased corporate and institutional Bitcoin holdings create more stable long-term positions Regulatory clarity: Improved regulatory frameworks in major markets provide greater confidence for long-term holding Infrastructure development: Enhanced custody solutions and financial products facilitate secure long-term storage Macroeconomic conditions: Current global economic uncertainty reinforces Bitcoin’s perceived value as a hedge asset Generational learning: Investors who experienced previous cycles understand the potential consequences of premature selling These structural changes within the cryptocurrency ecosystem create fundamentally different incentives for long-term holders compared to earlier market cycles. Additionally, the maturation of derivative markets and institutional participation alters traditional price discovery mechanisms, potentially reducing volatility triggers that previously prompted long-term holder selling. Market Implications of Sustained Holder Conviction The continued reluctance of long-term Bitcoin holders to distribute assets carries significant implications for market structure and price discovery. Primarily, reduced selling pressure from this cohort creates a more favorable supply-demand balance. Since long-term holders control a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, their inactivity effectively reduces available coins on exchanges. This supply constraint, combined with sustained demand, creates upward price pressure that differs qualitatively from previous cycles driven by speculative frenzy. Market analysts identify several potential outcomes from this sustained holder behavior: Reduced volatility: With core holders maintaining positions, price swings may become less extreme Higher price floors: Reduced distribution creates stronger support levels during corrections Extended cycle duration: Bull markets may persist longer without significant long-term holder selling Changed correction dynamics: Market downturns may feature different characteristics than historical patterns Altered miner economics: Reduced coin distribution affects miner selling pressure and network security dynamics These potential outcomes suggest that traditional cycle analysis based on previous patterns may require adjustment. Market participants increasingly recognize that Bitcoin’s evolving adoption curve and changing holder demographics create new behavioral patterns. Consequently, analysts now incorporate on-chain metrics like VDD alongside traditional technical analysis to develop more accurate market assessments. The Psychological Dimension of Long-Term Holding Beyond quantitative metrics, the psychological factors influencing holder behavior deserve examination. Long-term Bitcoin investors who maintained positions through multiple market cycles develop different risk perceptions than newer participants. Their experience with previous bull markets, including witnessing prices exceed expectations after periods of doubt, reinforces conviction during current appreciation phases. This psychological hardening creates a feedback loop where sustained holding during price increases validates the strategy, encouraging continued discipline. Behavioral finance principles help explain this phenomenon. The endowment effect, where investors value assets they own more highly than identical assets they don’t own, becomes particularly pronounced with assets held through volatile periods. Additionally, narrative reinforcement within cryptocurrency communities strengthens holder resolve. Stories of early investors who sold Bitcoin prematurely only to watch prices climb substantially higher circulate widely, creating powerful cautionary tales that influence current behavior. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Asset Classes Bitcoin’s holder behavior shows interesting parallels and divergences from traditional asset classes. Like gold, Bitcoin demonstrates characteristics of a store of value asset where long-term holders resist selling during price appreciation. However, unlike traditional commodities, Bitcoin’s perfectly transparent blockchain enables precise measurement of holder behavior through metrics like VDD. This transparency creates unique analytical opportunities for assessing market sentiment and structure. Several key differences emerge when comparing Bitcoin holder behavior to traditional investments: Transparency: Blockchain analytics provide real-time data unavailable in traditional markets Global accessibility: Bitcoin markets operate continuously without geographical restrictions Demographic concentration: Holder distribution shows different patterns than traditional assets Volatility tolerance: Long-term Bitcoin holders demonstrate exceptional volatility tolerance Narrative dependence: Investment theses rely more heavily on technological and monetary narratives These differences highlight Bitcoin’s unique position within global financial markets. The asset class combines characteristics of technology investments, monetary commodities, and network assets, creating holder behavior that doesn’t perfectly align with any traditional category. This uniqueness presents both analytical challenges and opportunities for investors and researchers studying market dynamics. Conclusion The remarkable discipline demonstrated by long-term Bitcoin holders during the 2025 price surge represents a significant market development. With Value Days Destroyed metrics remaining at historically low levels despite approaching the $100,000 threshold, evidence suggests fundamental changes in holder psychology and market structure. This behavior indicates either increased confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition or anticipation of substantially higher price targets. As the market continues evolving, monitoring holder behavior through metrics like VDD provides crucial insight into market health and potential future developments. The sustained conviction among long-term Bitcoin holders creates a potentially healthier foundation for continued market maturation and adoption. FAQs Q1: What does the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) metric measure? The Value Days Destroyed metric quantifies the trading activity of older Bitcoin by multiplying the number of coins moved by the number of days since they last moved. A low VDD indicates that primarily newer coins participate in current trading activity. Q2: Why are long-term Bitcoin holders not selling during the current price surge? Multiple factors potentially contribute to this behavior, including increased institutional adoption, improved regulatory clarity, enhanced custody solutions, macroeconomic uncertainty reinforcing Bitcoin’s hedge characteristics, and generational learning from previous market cycles. Q3: How does current holder behavior differ from previous Bitcoin bull markets? Historical data shows significantly higher VDD readings during similar price appreciation phases in previous cycles. The current reading of 0.53 compares to averages of 1.8-2.4 in 2017 and 1.2-1.7 in 2021, indicating substantially reduced long-term holder distribution. Q4: What are the potential market implications of sustained long-term holder conviction? Potential implications include reduced volatility, higher price floors during corrections, extended bull market duration, changed correction dynamics, and altered miner economics due to reduced coin distribution. Q5: How does Bitcoin holder behavior compare to traditional asset classes? Bitcoin shows parallels to store of value assets like gold in terms of long-term holding during appreciation, but differs through blockchain transparency enabling precise measurement, global accessibility, unique demographic concentration, exceptional volatility tolerance, and greater dependence on technological and monetary narratives.

For some analysts, this move represents a constructive breakout that confirms underlying strength after weeks of consolidation. For others, the rally is viewed with caution, framed as a classic relief move occurring within a broader corrective or bearish structure. With sentiment split and volatility compressed, the market is once again searching for confirmation rather than direction alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTH SOPR Signals Early Capitulation, But Selling Pressure Remains Contained Adding an important layer to this discussion, an analysis by Darkfost highlights a notable shift beneath the surface: OG Bitcoin activity has dropped sharply. OGs—holders whose coins have remained dormant for several years—have historically played a key role during major cycle transitions, often distributing aggressively near macro tops. During this cycle, their activity surged earlier, coinciding with strong institutional demand and elevated prices. However, recent data shows that this selling pressure has slowed significantly. This decline in OG spending suggests that long-dormant holders are no longer actively distributing into strength, reducing a major source of structural sell pressure. While this does not guarantee immediate upside continuation, it changes the risk profile of the current move. With fewer legacy holders selling, price action above $95K is now being shaped more by marginal demand and derivatives positioning than by long-term distribution, making the next phase especially critical to monitor. OG Selling Pressure Fades as Long-Dormant Coins Go Quiet Darkfost’s analysis uses UTXO behavior to understand how long-term holders are acting beneath the surface. UTXOs, which track when and how previously unspent Bitcoin is moved, provide a reliable way to identify activity from OG holders—coins that have remained dormant for several years. When these coins move, it usually signals intentional distribution rather than short-term speculation. Earlier in this cycle, OG activity was unusually elevated. Long-held coins were spent at levels well above those seen in the previous cycle, coinciding with a favorable environment for distribution. Institutional inflows, spot ETFs, and even government-linked demand created deep liquidity conditions that allowed legacy holders to sell without destabilizing the price. That window appears to be closing. Recent data shows a clear shift. Spikes in OG spending during local price peaks have become smaller and less frequent. The rolling average of spent older outputs has fallen materially from prior highs, indicating that the heaviest phase of long-term distribution is likely behind us. This does not imply that OGs have turned aggressively bullish, but it does suggest reduced urgency to sell. From a market structure perspective, declining OG selling pressure removes a major overhead supply source. With fewer long-dormant coins entering circulation, price action becomes increasingly dependent on short-term demand dynamics and derivatives positioning. This transition often precedes either consolidation or trend continuation, making OG inactivity a quietly constructive signal rather than an outright bullish trigger.

On this daily chart, price has reclaimed the descending short-term moving average and is now testing a former resistance zone that previously acted as support during September and October. This area around $95K–$96K is technically significant, as it coincides with prior range lows and a visible supply cluster. The rebound follows a sharp corrective phase in November, where BTC printed a local bottom near the mid-$80,000 region. Since then, price action has formed a series of higher lows, suggesting an improving short-term structure. Volume remains moderate, indicating that this move is not driven by aggressive speculation, but rather by steady spot demand and short covering. Related Reading: Trump-Powell Conflict Fuels Volatility While Retail Sells Bitcoin At A Loss – Details However, Bitcoin still trades below its longer-term moving averages, which continue to slope downward. This implies that, despite the recent strength, the broader trend has not yet fully flipped bullish. A sustained hold above $95,000 would take it into the $98,000–$100,000 zone. A level where stronger resistance and prior breakdown zones sit. Failure to consolidate above current levels could result in another retest of the $90,000–$92,000 support range. The chart reflects a transition phase: momentum is improving, but confirmation will depend on follow-through and acceptance above this critical resistance area.

57175151,657799,1768446023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57175151.jpeg,What The Digital Clarity ACT Means For The Likes Of Dogecoin And XRP,https://bitcoinist.com/digital-clarity-act-dogecoin-xrp/,"Dogecoin and XRP have come under heightened regulatory scrutiny following the release of new draft language in the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which proposes a framework that could classify them alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Rather than relying on subjective debates over network decentralization or token utility, the draft ties legal treatment to whether an asset underpins a listed exchange-traded product . This represents a significant shift in how major altcoins may be handled moving forward. What The Latest Draft Signals For Dogecoin And XRP On January 13, 2026, journalist Eleanor Terrett highlighted a section of the latest Digital Asset Market Clarity Act draft that sets a clear rule for “network tokens.” It states that a token will not be classified as an ancillary asset or considered a security if, by January 1, 2026, it serves as the primary asset of an exchange-traded product listed on a US national securities exchange. This condition is critical because it directly affects compliance obligations. Tokens that qualify under this standard would not be required to file the disclosures mandated for other digital assets under the bill. In effect, the draft establishes a regulatory shortcut for tokens that achieve a defined level of institutional recognition through listed exchange-traded products registered under Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under this structure, assets such as XRP , Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, Hedera, and Chainlink would enter the framework on the same footing as Bitcoin and Ethereum from day one, provided the exchange-traded product requirement is met. For Dogecoin and XRP specifically, this represents a tangible route out of prolonged legal uncertainty. Their legal status would hinge on verifiable market structure rather than subjective regulatory interpretation, giving investors, exchanges, and institutional participants a clearer standard for compliance and market engagement. How The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act Took Shape The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act was introduced in the US House of Representatives in 2025 as lawmakers sought to address years of fragmented crypto oversight. The bill was developed under the leadership of the House Financial Services Committee. Throughout 2025, lawmakers circulated multiple discussion drafts to regulators , industry groups, and legal experts. These drafts aimed to replace enforcement-driven policy with statutory definitions, including the concept of “network tokens,” which form the backbone of the current proposal. The January 2026 draft reflects a later stage in that process, focusing on implementation thresholds rather than broad regulatory theory. While the Act has not yet been passed into law, it has advanced through committee review and remains a central reference point in ongoing market-structure negotiations. Its significance lies in the predictability it introduces. For Dogecoin and XRP, the bill does not promise immediate relief, but it sets a transparent standard for achieving regulatory parity. That shift alone alters how these assets are evaluated by exchanges, institutional issuers, and investors navigating the US digital asset landscape.",Dogecoin|XRP|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-15 03:00:23

This potential expansion signals a pivotal moment for institutional crypto adoption, particularly within specialized sectors like intellectual property tokenization and novel blockchain ecosystems. The announcement, made via the company’s official X account, immediately captured market attention and sparked analysis across financial sectors. Grayscale Investment Products: Analyzing the New Frontier Grayscale currently manages approximately $40 billion in assets across its existing product suite, which includes the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). The firm’s potential expansion into ARIAIP, GEOD, Playtron, Poseidon, and Nous Research tokens represents a calculated diversification strategy. This move follows increasing institutional demand for exposure to blockchain applications beyond mainstream cryptocurrencies. Consequently, Grayscale appears positioned to capitalize on emerging digital asset categories that demonstrate real-world utility and sustainable growth potential. Market analysts immediately noted the announcement’s timing. The crypto investment landscape has matured significantly since 2023’s regulatory developments. Institutional investors now seek structured products offering exposure to specialized blockchain use cases. Grayscale’s exploration directly addresses this demand shift. Furthermore, the company maintains a rigorous due diligence process for all potential additions to its product lineup. Each candidate asset undergoes extensive evaluation for regulatory compliance, market liquidity, technological robustness, and long-term viability. Understanding ARIAIP: The Intellectual Property Tokenization Pioneer ARIAIP functions as the governance token for the Aria ecosystem, a blockchain platform specifically designed for the on-chain tokenization and distribution of intellectual property. This includes creative works like music, digital art, patents, and literary content. The Aria protocol enables creators to fractionalize ownership of their IP, creating new revenue streams and investment opportunities. ARIAIP holders participate in governance decisions, protocol upgrades, and fee distribution mechanisms within this ecosystem. The intellectual property tokenization market has shown remarkable growth since 2023. Industry reports indicate a compound annual growth rate exceeding 45% in the digital IP sector. Music royalties alone represent a multi-billion dollar asset class increasingly moving on-chain. Aria’s technology allows for transparent royalty distribution, immutable ownership records, and global liquidity for previously illiquid assets. Grayscale’s interest in ARIAIP suggests institutional recognition of this sector’s transformative potential. Several major entertainment companies have already begun experimenting with similar tokenization models. Comparative Analysis of Tokenized IP Platforms Platform Primary Focus Governance Token Notable Partnerships Aria Ecosystem Music & Creative IP ARIAIP Major label pilots (2024) Other Protocol A Digital Art & Patents TOKEN-A University tech transfer Other Protocol B Literary & Film Rights TOKEN-B Streaming platform trials Tokenization offers creators several distinct advantages: Direct monetization: Artists bypass traditional intermediaries Fractional ownership: Enables micro-investments in creative works Automated royalties: Smart contracts ensure transparent payments Global accessibility: Investors worldwide can participate Examining GEOD and Other Candidate Assets While ARIAIP represents the IP tokenization sector, GEOD originates from a different blockchain niche. GEOD typically functions within geospatial data marketplaces or decentralized mapping protocols. These platforms reward users for contributing location data while maintaining privacy controls. The geospatial data market exceeds $200 billion globally, with blockchain solutions addressing critical concerns about data ownership and monetization. Grayscale’s consideration of GEOD indicates interest in the convergence of physical world data with decentralized networks. The other mentioned assets—Playtron, Poseidon, and Nous Research—represent additional specialized sectors: Playtron: Likely relates to gaming ecosystems or play-to-earn economies Poseidon: Possibly connects to climate or ocean conservation blockchain applications Nous Research: May involve decentralized AI or collective intelligence platforms This diverse selection reveals Grayscale’s comprehensive approach to sector analysis. The firm appears to evaluate assets across multiple high-growth verticals simultaneously. This strategy mitigates sector-specific risks while positioning the company as a broad-based digital asset manager. Each potential product would undergo the same regulatory scrutiny and structural development as Grayscale’s existing offerings. The company has historically maintained several months between exploration announcements and actual product launches. Institutional Adoption Timeline and Market Impact Grayscale’s product development follows a recognizable pattern based on historical launches. The firm typically announces exploratory phases, followed by regulatory filings, then finally product offerings. This process ensures compliance with SEC regulations and investor protection standards. Previous products have taken 6-12 months from initial exploration to market availability. The market impact of such announcements often includes increased visibility and trading volume for the underlying assets, though Grayscale consistently emphasizes that exploration does not guarantee product launches. Industry experts note several implications of this development. First, Grayscale’s interest validates the underlying technology of these projects. Second, institutional capital inflows could enhance liquidity and stability for these emerging assets. Third, competing asset managers may accelerate their own evaluation processes for similar tokens. The broader cryptocurrency market often experiences positive sentiment spillover when major institutions expand their digital asset offerings. This effect particularly benefits sectors adjacent to those receiving institutional attention. Regulatory Landscape and Compliance Considerations The regulatory environment for digital assets continues evolving in 2025. Grayscale operates within strict compliance frameworks established by multiple regulatory bodies. Any new investment products must satisfy requirements from the SEC, CFTC, and state-level regulators. The firm’s legal team specializes in navigating these complex requirements, particularly for novel asset classes like tokenized intellectual property. Recent regulatory clarity around certain digital asset categories has created more predictable pathways for product development. Key regulatory considerations for ARIAIP and similar tokens include: Securities classification determinations Custody and security requirements Investor accreditation standards Reporting and transparency mandates Anti-money laundering protocols Grayscale has established strong precedents through previous product approvals. The company’s experience with regulatory engagement provides valuable insights for these new explorations. Market observers will monitor regulatory comments and filings for indications of progress. The approval of similar products by other asset managers in recent months suggests a gradually opening regulatory pathway for specialized digital assets. Conclusion Grayscale’s exploration of new investment products for ARIAIP, GEOD, and other tokens represents a strategic expansion in digital asset management. This move acknowledges the growing institutional interest in blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrency trading. The ARIAIP token, in particular, highlights the convergence of creative industries with decentralized technology through intellectual property tokenization. Grayscale investment products have historically served as gateways for traditional capital to access digital assets, and this potential expansion continues that tradition. The coming months will reveal whether these explorations materialize into concrete offerings, but the announcement alone signifies important validation for these emerging sectors. FAQs Q1: What are Grayscale investment products? Grayscale investment products are publicly quoted securities that provide investors with exposure to digital currencies and blockchain assets without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping the underlying tokens directly. Q2: What is ARIAIP used for in the Aria ecosystem? ARIAIP serves as the governance token for the Aria ecosystem, enabling holders to participate in decision-making for a platform that tokenizes and distributes intellectual property like music and creative works on the blockchain. Q3: Has Grayscale confirmed it will launch products for these assets? No, Grayscale has only announced it is “considering” launching products for these assets. The company typically explores multiple options before filing for regulatory approval, and not all explored assets become investment products. Q4: How might Grayscale products affect ARIAIP’s market value? While Grayscale exploration often increases visibility and trading interest, the company’s announcements specifically avoid commenting on asset valuations. Any market impact would depend on multiple factors including broader market conditions and eventual product launch decisions. Q5: What distinguishes tokenized intellectual property from traditional IP ownership? Tokenized intellectual property uses blockchain technology to create fractional, tradable ownership units with automated royalty distribution through smart contracts, offering greater liquidity, transparency, and accessibility compared to traditional IP ownership structures.

The move higher reflects a firmer risk on tone tied to stable US inflation and a resilient job market, creating what QCP describes as a “Goldilocks environment ” where investors are piling into everything from stocks to precious metals and now crypto. Lukman Otunuga, a senior market analyst at FXTM, said investor sentiment is being tugged in different directions as geopolitical risks, trade policy uncertainty and worries about central bank independence weigh on markets. “While risk assets remain fragile, safe havens like gold and silver continue to shine,” he said. “With key legal and political decisions looming, volatility is likely to remain elevated, creating both risks and opportunities for traders in the week ahead.” Macro And Political Risks Continue To Steer Markets Oil helped set the tone for cross-asset trading. Prices fell for the first time in six days after President Donald Trump signaled he may hold off on attacking Iran for now, and traders trimmed some of the geopolitical premium that had built into crude. Gold and silver also cooled after pushing to record highs in the prior session, as traders took stock of the latest headlines and shifted back toward risk assets in parts of the market. Policy uncertainty stayed in the background. The US Supreme Court did not issue a ruling on challenges to Trump’s global tariffs on Wednesday, leaving markets waiting until at least next week for clarity on one of the administration’s signature economic policies. FX traders in Asia also watched South Korea’s won after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the currency’s slide did not match the country’s fundamentals, comments that offered rare verbal support as volatility picked up. Japan’s politics remained a live variable too. Reports and subsequent confirmation that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans a snap election have kept the yen under pressure at points, and that currency swing has fed into daily moves in Japanese equities.

This strategic move represents Binance’s ongoing commitment to providing diverse trading instruments for its global user base, particularly as margin trading continues to gain popularity among sophisticated cryptocurrency investors seeking leveraged positions in emerging digital assets. Binance margin trading receives major U token expansion Binance’s margin trading platform will officially support U/USDT and U/USDC pairs starting today, according to the exchange’s official announcement. The listing occurs precisely at 10:00 a.m. UTC, enabling traders to immediately access leveraged positions on these newly available trading pairs. This development follows Binance’s established pattern of gradually expanding its margin offerings in response to market demand and token performance metrics. Margin trading allows users to borrow funds to amplify their trading positions, potentially increasing both profits and losses through leverage mechanisms that the exchange carefully monitors and regulates. Industry analysts note that margin pair listings typically follow careful evaluation processes by exchange teams. These evaluations consider trading volume, liquidity, community interest, and technical stability factors. The U token’s inclusion in Binance’s margin ecosystem suggests the asset has met these rigorous criteria, potentially indicating growing institutional and retail interest. Furthermore, the simultaneous listing of both USDT and USDC pairs provides traders with flexibility in their stablecoin preferences, accommodating different risk profiles and regional accessibility considerations. Understanding margin trading mechanics on cryptocurrency exchanges Margin trading represents a sophisticated financial instrument within cryptocurrency markets, allowing traders to open positions larger than their account balances would normally permit. Essentially, exchanges like Binance lend traders additional capital, creating leveraged positions that can magnify both gains and losses. The newly listed U/USDT and U/USDC pairs will operate under Binance’s established margin framework, which includes specific rules regarding leverage ratios, liquidation thresholds, and interest rates for borrowed funds. Several key components define margin trading on platforms like Binance: Leverage ratios : Typically ranging from 2x to 10x on major exchanges Collateral requirements : Initial and maintenance margin percentages that must be maintained Liquidation mechanisms : Automatic position closures when collateral falls below required levels Interest rates : Costs associated with borrowing funds for leveraged positions These mechanisms create a complex trading environment that requires careful risk management. Consequently, Binance implements educational resources and risk warnings for margin trading participants. The exchange’s decision to add U token margin pairs indicates confidence in the asset’s liquidity and volatility characteristics, as insufficient liquidity can exacerbate risks in leveraged trading environments. Market context and historical listing patterns Binance’s margin pair listings typically follow observable patterns within the cryptocurrency industry. Historically, the exchange has introduced margin trading for assets demonstrating sustained trading volume, developer activity, and community engagement. The U token’s progression from spot trading to margin availability mirrors this established trajectory. Market data from previous quarters reveals that margin listing announcements often precede increased trading activity, though this correlation doesn’t imply causation. Comparative analysis with similar listings reveals important context. For instance, when Binance added margin trading for other mid-capitalization tokens in 2024, average daily trading volumes increased by approximately 40-60% in the subsequent month. However, volatility metrics also showed temporary increases during the initial adjustment period. These historical patterns provide valuable reference points for understanding potential market impacts following today’s U/USDT and U/USDC margin pair listings. Technical implementation and trading parameters Binance has specified technical details for the new margin pairs in its official communications. The U/USDT and U/USDC pairs will be available on both isolated and cross margin modes, providing traders with flexibility in their risk management approaches. Isolated margin allows users to allocate specific collateral amounts to individual positions, while cross margin utilizes the entire account balance as collateral for all open positions. This dual-availability approach accommodates different trading strategies and risk tolerance levels. The exchange has established specific trading parameters for these new pairs: Parameter U/USDT U/USDC Maximum Leverage 10x 10x Initial Margin 10% 10% Maintenance Margin 5% 5% Interest Rate (Hourly) 0.0025% 0.0025% These parameters align with Binance’s standard margin offerings for similar cryptocurrency pairs. The consistency in leverage ratios and margin requirements across both stablecoin pairs simplifies the trading experience for users who might utilize both instruments. Additionally, the identical interest rates prevent arbitrage complications that could arise from differential borrowing costs between the two pairs. Regulatory considerations and compliance framework Margin trading products operate within complex regulatory environments across different jurisdictions. Binance’s implementation of U/USDT and U/USDC margin pairs necessarily considers varying regional regulations governing leveraged cryptocurrency products. The exchange employs geofencing and compliance measures to restrict access in jurisdictions where margin trading faces regulatory limitations or outright prohibitions. This approach reflects the cryptocurrency industry’s evolving relationship with financial regulators worldwide. Recent regulatory developments have influenced how exchanges structure margin products. For example, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, scheduled for full implementation in 2025, establish specific requirements for leveraged cryptocurrency products. Similarly, United States regulations continue evolving through SEC guidance and legislative developments. Binance’s margin offerings, including the newly listed U token pairs, must navigate this complex landscape while maintaining operational consistency across global markets. Risk management protocols and investor protection Margin trading introduces amplified risks that require robust protective measures. Binance implements multiple safeguards for margin traders, including position size limits, liquidation buffers, and real-time risk monitoring systems. The exchange’s risk engine automatically calculates margin ratios and triggers warnings when positions approach liquidation thresholds. These automated systems help prevent cascading liquidations that could destabilize markets during periods of high volatility. Educational initiatives complement these technical safeguards. Binance provides comprehensive learning materials about margin trading mechanics, risk factors, and strategy development. The exchange emphasizes that margin trading suits experienced investors who understand leveraged position risks. This educational focus aligns with industry best practices for complex financial products in cryptocurrency markets. The listing of U/USDT and U/USDC margin pairs extends these educational resources to cover the specific characteristics and trading considerations for the U token. Market impact and liquidity considerations The introduction of margin trading typically affects underlying asset liquidity and price discovery mechanisms. Historical data from similar listings suggests several potential outcomes for the U token following today’s announcement. First, trading volumes often increase as margin traders enter the market, potentially improving liquidity depth across order books. Second, volatility patterns may shift as leveraged positions introduce additional buying and selling pressure during market movements. Liquidity providers and market makers typically adjust their strategies following margin pair listings. These professional participants often increase their presence in newly margin-enabled markets, providing tighter spreads and deeper order books. This response generally benefits all market participants through improved execution quality. However, during extreme volatility events, margin liquidations can temporarily exacerbate price movements, creating challenging conditions for all traders. Conclusion Binance’s listing of U/USDT and U/USDC margin pairs represents a significant development for cryptocurrency traders seeking leveraged exposure to the U token. The 10:00 a.m. UTC launch provides immediate access to these new trading instruments under Binance’s established margin framework. This expansion reflects the exchange’s ongoing efforts to diversify its product offerings while maintaining rigorous risk management standards. As margin trading continues evolving within regulatory frameworks, today’s listing contributes to the broader maturation of cryptocurrency markets and their associated financial instruments. The U token’s inclusion in Binance’s margin ecosystem signals growing institutional recognition while providing traders with additional tools for implementing sophisticated market strategies. FAQs Q1: What time exactly will Binance list the U/USDT and U/USDC margin pairs? The listing occurs precisely at 10:00 a.m. UTC today, according to Binance’s official announcement. The exchange typically enables trading exactly at the specified time, though users should refresh their interfaces if pairs don’t immediately appear. Q2: What leverage ratios will be available for these new margin pairs? Binance will offer maximum leverage of 10x for both U/USDT and U/USDC margin pairs. However, available leverage may vary by user tier and jurisdiction due to regulatory requirements and risk management policies. Q3: Will these margin pairs be available in all countries where Binance operates? No, margin trading availability varies by jurisdiction due to regulatory differences. Binance employs geofencing to restrict access in regions where margin products face regulatory limitations. Users should consult Binance’s regional restrictions page for specific information about their location. Q4: What are the main risks associated with trading these new margin pairs? Margin trading amplifies both potential profits and losses. Key risks include liquidation if positions move against traders, interest costs on borrowed funds, and increased volatility exposure. Traders can lose more than their initial investment in leveraged positions. Q5: How does margin trading differ from regular spot trading on Binance? Margin trading allows borrowing funds to open larger positions than account balances would permit, while spot trading involves direct purchases with available funds. Margin trading introduces leverage, interest costs, and liquidation risks not present in spot trading.

Market data reveals a striking pattern where traders betting against price increases faced disproportionate liquidation pressure, particularly in Bitcoin perpetual futures markets where short positions accounted for nearly 87% of forced closures. This liquidation event provides crucial insights into current market sentiment and leverage positioning as institutional and retail traders navigate evolving regulatory landscapes and macroeconomic conditions. Crypto Futures Liquidations Analysis Reveals Short Position Vulnerability Recent volatility in digital asset markets triggered substantial forced liquidations across cryptocurrency derivatives platforms. According to aggregated exchange data from leading analytics providers, Bitcoin perpetual futures experienced $178 million in forced liquidations during the 24-hour period ending Thursday morning. Remarkably, short positions represented 86.79% of these liquidations, indicating that traders anticipating price declines faced significant losses as market conditions shifted. This pattern suggests either unexpected upward price pressure or excessive leverage among bearish traders who positioned themselves against prevailing market trends. Ethereum markets followed a similar though less pronounced pattern, with $82.11 million in forced liquidations. Short positions accounted for 64.45% of Ethereum liquidations, demonstrating that bearish sentiment extended beyond Bitcoin markets. Meanwhile, the RIVER token experienced $10.05 million in liquidations with short positions representing 76.92% of forced closures. These statistics collectively paint a picture of market dynamics where short sellers faced mounting pressure as liquidation cascades amplified price movements across multiple timeframes. Understanding Forced Liquidations in Perpetual Futures Markets Perpetual futures represent sophisticated financial instruments that allow traders to speculate on cryptocurrency price movements without expiration dates. These derivatives incorporate funding rate mechanisms that periodically transfer payments between long and short positions to maintain contract prices near underlying spot prices. When market volatility increases significantly, traders with insufficient margin face forced liquidations where their positions automatically close to prevent negative balances. Mechanics of Margin Calls and Liquidation Triggers Cryptocurrency exchanges employ complex risk management systems that monitor position margins in real-time. When a trader’s margin ratio falls below maintenance requirements, platforms typically issue margin calls requesting additional collateral. Failure to meet these requirements triggers automatic liquidation at prevailing market prices. The recent data indicates that short positions faced particularly severe margin pressure, suggesting either rapid price increases or excessive leverage among bearish traders who underestimated market resilience. Liquidation events often create cascading effects as forced selling or buying pressure exacerbates price movements. When numerous short positions liquidate simultaneously, the resulting buy orders can accelerate upward price momentum, potentially triggering additional liquidations in a feedback loop. Market analysts refer to this phenomenon as a “short squeeze,” where rising prices force bearish traders to cover positions through purchases, further driving prices upward. Historical Context and Market Cycle Comparisons Current liquidation patterns echo previous market cycles where excessive leverage preceded significant volatility events. During the 2021 bull market, similar short-dominated liquidations frequently occurred during rapid price appreciation phases. However, the 2025 market environment differs substantially due to increased institutional participation, enhanced regulatory frameworks, and more sophisticated risk management tools available to traders. Historical data from cryptocurrency analytics firms reveals several notable patterns: 2021 Comparison: Similar short-dominated liquidations occurred during April 2021’s price surge, though absolute values were higher due to different market capitalization levels Leverage Ratios: Current estimated leverage across major exchanges appears more conservative than 2021 peaks, suggesting improved risk management Institutional Impact: Increased institutional participation may have altered liquidation dynamics through more sophisticated hedging strategies Market structure evolution since 2021 includes the proliferation of options markets, improved collateral management systems, and cross-margin capabilities that potentially mitigate cascading liquidation risks. Despite these advancements, recent events demonstrate that leverage remains a double-edged sword capable of amplifying both gains and losses during volatile periods. Expert Analysis of Current Market Conditions Financial analysts specializing in cryptocurrency derivatives highlight several factors contributing to recent liquidation patterns. Market microstructure experts note that funding rate differentials between exchanges created arbitrage opportunities that may have influenced positioning. Additionally, macroeconomic developments including central bank policy announcements and traditional market correlations likely affected trader sentiment and positioning decisions. Risk Management Perspectives from Industry Professionals Derivatives trading desks at regulated cryptocurrency exchanges emphasize the importance of position sizing and stop-loss orders during volatile conditions. Professional traders typically employ sophisticated risk management strategies including: Portfolio Margin Requirements: Maintaining collateral above minimum thresholds with buffer for volatility Correlation Hedging: Using options or other derivatives to offset directional risks Liquidity Assessment: Monitoring order book depth before entering large positions Scenario Analysis: Stress testing positions against historical volatility patterns These professional practices contrast with retail trader behavior that sometimes involves excessive leverage without adequate risk controls. The disproportionate short position liquidations suggest that retail traders may have been overly bearish relative to institutional positioning, creating vulnerability during unexpected price movements. Regulatory Developments Affecting Derivatives Markets Evolving regulatory frameworks significantly impact cryptocurrency derivatives trading globally. Jurisdictions including the European Union, United Kingdom, and United States have implemented or proposed regulations governing leverage limits, investor protections, and exchange requirements. These developments influence available trading products, margin requirements, and reporting obligations that collectively shape market dynamics. Recent regulatory proposals focus on several key areas relevant to liquidation events: Leverage Limits: Proposed restrictions on maximum leverage available to retail traders Transparency Requirements: Enhanced reporting of large positions and liquidation events Risk Disclosure: Mandatory explanations of liquidation risks and margin requirements Exchange Oversight: Increased monitoring of platform risk management systems These regulatory developments may reduce extreme liquidation events by limiting excessive leverage while potentially decreasing market liquidity during normal conditions. Market participants must navigate evolving requirements while maintaining effective trading strategies. Market Impact and Future Implications The recent liquidation event provides valuable signals about market structure and participant behavior. High short position liquidations typically indicate either excessive bearish sentiment or unexpected positive catalysts that forced position unwinding. Market technicians analyze such events for clues about potential trend continuations or reversals based on the magnitude and composition of liquidations. Several potential implications emerge from current data: Sentiment Indicators: Extreme short liquidations sometimes precede extended bullish periods as bearish positions reset Volatility Expectations: Elevated liquidation activity often correlates with increased near-term volatility Liquidity Effects: Large liquidations can temporarily distort price discovery mechanisms Risk Premium Adjustments: Derivatives pricing may incorporate higher risk premiums following significant events Market participants will monitor whether recent patterns represent isolated events or the beginning of broader trend changes. Historical analysis suggests that extreme liquidation clusters often occur at potential turning points, though confirmation requires additional price action and volume analysis. Conclusion The recent crypto futures liquidations data reveals significant vulnerability among short positions, particularly in Bitcoin markets where bearish traders faced substantial losses. These forced liquidations provide important insights into current market dynamics, leverage levels, and participant positioning. As cryptocurrency derivatives markets continue evolving alongside regulatory frameworks and institutional participation, understanding liquidation patterns becomes increasingly crucial for risk management and strategic positioning. Market participants should carefully monitor margin requirements, position sizing, and broader market conditions to navigate volatile periods effectively while regulatory developments reshape the trading landscape for digital asset derivatives. FAQs Q1: What causes forced liquidations in cryptocurrency futures markets? Forced liquidations occur when traders’ margin balances fall below maintenance requirements due to adverse price movements. Exchanges automatically close positions to prevent negative account balances, creating selling pressure for long positions or buying pressure for short positions. Q2: Why were short positions disproportionately affected in recent liquidations? Short positions faced greater liquidation pressure likely due to unexpected price increases that moved against bearish traders. This could result from positive market catalysts, excessive leverage among short sellers, or coordinated buying pressure that triggered cascading liquidations. Q3: How do perpetual futures differ from traditional futures contracts? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and utilize funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with underlying assets. Traditional futures have set expiration dates and settle based on predetermined settlement procedures at contract maturity. Q4: What is a short squeeze in cryptocurrency markets? A short squeeze occurs when rising prices force traders with short positions to buy assets to cover their positions, creating additional upward price pressure. This can trigger cascading liquidations as margin calls force further position closures. Q5: How can traders manage liquidation risks in volatile markets? Traders can mitigate liquidation risks through conservative leverage, adequate margin buffers, stop-loss orders, portfolio diversification, and continuous monitoring of position margins relative to volatility conditions.

This declaration, made via social media platform X, underscores a critical tension between consumer demand for innovative financial products and the current, fragmented state of American digital asset regulation. The situation highlights how regulatory uncertainty continues to stifle product development and limit consumer choice in the rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem. Crypto Market Structure Bill: The Core Demand from Robinhood’s CEO Vlad Tenev’s statement directly links the future of consumer-facing crypto services to specific legislative progress. He argues that a clear crypto market structure bill would establish necessary guardrails, thereby enabling platforms like Robinhood to safely innovate. Currently, the absence of federal legislation creates a patchwork of state-level regulations and enforcement actions from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Consequently, companies face significant legal risk when launching new features. Tenev emphasized that crypto staking remains one of the most requested features by Robinhood’s user base. However, the company explicitly blocks access to this service for residents in four U.S. states due to the existing regulatory environment. This gap between user demand and permissible service illustrates the practical impact of the legislative stalemate. The Staking Feature and Regulatory Paralysis Crypto staking allows users to earn rewards by participating in the validation of transactions on proof-of-stake blockchain networks, such as Ethereum. For many investors, it represents a core utility of holding certain digital assets. Despite its popularity, the regulatory classification of staking services in the U.S. remains ambiguous. The SEC has previously indicated that some staking programs may constitute the offering of unregistered securities. This stance has led to enforcement actions against other crypto firms, creating a chilling effect across the industry. Robinhood’s decision to withhold the staking feature in specific states is a direct, preemptive response to this uncertainty. The company aims to avoid potential legal repercussions while advocating for a legislative solution that would provide clear rules of the road. Expert Analysis on the Legislative Landscape Financial regulation experts note that Tenev’s comments arrive during a pivotal moment for crypto legislation. Several market structure bills have circulated in Congress, including proposals like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. These bills generally seek to clarify the jurisdictional divide between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding digital assets. Proponents argue that such clarity is foundational for both consumer protection and maintaining U.S. competitiveness in financial technology. Conversely, critics caution against creating overly permissive frameworks that could undermine investor safeguards. Tenev’s public stance aligns Robinhood with a growing cohort of fintech leaders who are pushing for a balanced regulatory approach that does not force innovation offshore. The Transatlantic Disparity: EU vs. U.S. Crypto Product Availability Further illustrating the regulatory divergence, Tenev pointed to the availability of stock tokens in the European Union, a product Robinhood cannot offer in the United States. Stock tokens are digital representations of equities that can be traded in fractional shares, often using blockchain technology. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides a harmonized framework for such assets, giving companies legal certainty to develop and launch products. In contrast, the U.S. lacks an equivalent comprehensive regime. This disparity creates a tangible competitive disadvantage for American consumers and businesses. Analysts frequently cite this gap as a driver for talent and capital migration to jurisdictions with clearer digital asset laws. Key Regulatory Challenges Cited by Industry Leaders: Jurisdictional Overlap: Multiple federal and state agencies claim authority over crypto assets. Enforcement-by-Guidance: Rules are often established through lawsuits rather than published frameworks. Product Pre-approval: The lack of a clear path to legally launch new features like staking. State-Level Fragmentation: Complying with 50 different state money transmitter licenses. Historical Context and the Path to Legislation The call for a crypto market structure bill follows over a decade of regulatory evolution. After the initial rise of Bitcoin, U.S. regulators primarily applied existing securities and commodities laws by analogy. However, as the technology matured with smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi), these existing frameworks showed significant strain. The 2022 collapse of several major crypto firms intensified congressional focus on consumer protection, making comprehensive legislation a higher priority. The current legislative efforts aim to address custody requirements, disclosure standards, and the classification of various digital assets. The outcome of these debates will likely shape the American crypto landscape for the next decade, influencing everything from brokerage services to blockchain infrastructure development. Potential Impact on Consumers and the Market The passage of a market structure bill would have immediate and long-term effects. For consumers, it could mean faster access to products like staking and stock tokens, alongside stronger protections against fraud and platform insolvency. For the market, regulatory clarity could reduce volatility driven by regulatory news and attract more institutional investment. A standardized framework would also allow companies like Robinhood to allocate resources toward product development rather than legal defense. However, the specific provisions of any bill will determine its ultimate impact. Regulations that are too restrictive could still limit innovation, while overly lenient rules might fail to prevent the misconduct seen in previous market cycles. Conclusion Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev’s public advocacy for a crypto market structure bill underscores a critical inflection point for the digital asset industry in the United States. The regulatory deadlock he describes has real-world consequences, preventing millions of users from accessing popular features like staking and creating a transatlantic innovation gap. The urgent need for legislative clarity balances the dual mandates of fostering technological advancement and ensuring robust consumer protection. As debates continue in Congress, the outcome will fundamentally determine whether U.S.-based companies can compete globally in providing the next generation of financial services. The call for a coherent crypto market structure bill is, therefore, not just about a single feature but about defining the future of finance. FAQs Q1: What is a crypto market structure bill? A crypto market structure bill is proposed legislation aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. It typically seeks to define which agencies have jurisdiction, classify different types of crypto assets, and establish rules for trading, custody, and disclosure to protect consumers and ensure market integrity. Q2: Why can’t Robinhood offer crypto staking in some U.S. states? Robinhood restricts staking in certain states due to regulatory uncertainty and the lack of clear federal guidelines. State regulators or the SEC may view certain staking services as unregistered securities offerings. To avoid potential legal action, Robinhood has preemptively limited access until clearer regulations are established. Q3: What are stock tokens, and why are they available in the EU but not the U.S.? Stock tokens are digital assets that represent ownership in a traditional stock, often enabling fractional share trading on a blockchain. They are available in the EU due to the comprehensive MiCA regulation, which provides legal certainty. The U.S. lacks an equivalent federal framework, leaving their status ambiguous and risky for companies to offer. Q4: How would a market structure bill protect consumers? A well-designed bill would protect consumers by mandating clear disclosures about risks, requiring platforms to segregate customer assets, enforcing standards against fraud and manipulation, and ensuring companies maintain adequate reserves. This creates a safer environment compared to the current unregulated or lightly regulated spaces. Q5: What is the current status of crypto market structure legislation in Congress? As of 2025, several bills have been introduced and are undergoing committee review and debate. Bipartisan support exists for certain principles, but consensus on specific details—such as the division of authority between the SEC and CFTC—remains a key hurdle to final passage. The legislative process is ongoing but active.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC was trading at $95,986.19 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market, marking a notable retreat from recent highs. This price movement triggers immediate analysis of market structure, liquidity conditions, and broader financial sentiment. Bitcoin Price Drop: The Immediate Market Context The descent below $96,000 represents a key psychological and technical level for traders. Market analysts immediately scrutinized order book data from major exchanges. They observed substantial sell-side liquidity clustering just above the $96,500 mark throughout the Asian trading session. Consequently, a series of leveraged long positions faced liquidation as price action breached several short-term support zones. This created a cascading effect that accelerated the decline. Historical data from CoinMetrics indicates similar retracements have occurred during previous bull market cycles. For instance, the 2021 cycle saw multiple corrections exceeding 20% before resuming an upward trajectory. The current volatility aligns with established patterns of market consolidation after rapid appreciation. Furthermore, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reports that the proportion of Bitcoin supply in profit remains historically high, which often precedes periods of distribution. Technical and Fundamental Drivers Behind the Decline Several concurrent factors contributed to the selling pressure. First, macroeconomic indicators released earlier in the week showed unexpected strength in the U.S. dollar index (DXY). A stronger dollar typically creates headwinds for dollar-denominated risk assets like Bitcoin. Second, network data reveals a slight increase in exchange inflows from long-term holder wallets, suggesting some profit-taking activity. Key technical levels breached during the move included: The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) near $97,200 The weekly pivot point support at $96,450 The high-volume node from the previous consolidation range Simultaneously, funding rates across perpetual swap markets had turned excessively positive, indicating overcrowded long positioning. Markets often correct to reset these derivatives metrics. The table below summarizes key market metrics before and after the drop: Bitcoin Market Metrics Comparison Metric 24 Hours Prior At Time of Report Price (Binance USDT) $98,450.75 $95,986.19 24-Hour Trading Volume $42.8B $68.3B Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) 64 (Greed) Open Interest (Aggregate) $38.2B $36.7B Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Liquidity Seasoned market strategists emphasize the health of such corrections. “Liquidations of over-leveraged positions are a necessary market-clearing mechanism,” notes Dr. Lena Vance, a former CFTC economist and current research head at Digital Asset Analytics. “The underlying network fundamentals—hash rate, active addresses, and institutional adoption flows—remain robust. This appears to be a technical correction within a larger macro trend, not a fundamental breakdown.” Data from blockchain intelligence platforms supports this view. Despite the price drop, the net transfer volume from miner wallets to exchanges remains negative, indicating miners are not engaging in panic selling. Additionally, the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR), which measures buying power on the sidelines, continues to hover near yearly highs, suggesting ample dry powder exists to absorb selling and potentially support prices. Historical Precedents and Cycle Comparisons Examining past Bitcoin cycles provides crucial context. The 2016-2017 bull market witnessed thirteen separate drawdowns of 10% or more. The 2020-2021 cycle had at least nine similar corrections. Current market participants, therefore, may view this move as a standard volatility event. Analysts at ARK Invest published research in Q4 2024 highlighting that drawdowns of 5-15% are statistically normal during periods of price discovery, which Bitcoin entered after surpassing its previous all-time high. Moreover, the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization often mirrors Bitcoin’s movements. Altcoins typically experience higher beta moves, meaning they fall further during BTC declines but also rally more aggressively during recoveries. This relationship held true during the recent sell-off, with the total crypto market cap declining approximately 5.2% compared to Bitcoin’s 2.5% drop over the same 24-hour window. Institutional Response and On-Chain Signals Institutional activity, monitored through products like CME Bitcoin futures and publicly traded company balance sheets, shows a mixed but measured response. There were no reports of major corporate entities divesting their Bitcoin treasury holdings. MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder, has a publicly stated long-term strategy unaffected by short-term volatility. Meanwhile, flows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, a critical gauge of institutional and retail demand, turned slightly negative for the session but remain net positive for the week. On-chain metrics offer a longer-term perspective. The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-Score, which identifies periods when Bitcoin is significantly over or undervalued relative to its historical norm, had recently entered a zone associated with medium-term risk. The correction helps moderate this reading. Similarly, the Puell Multiple, which tracks miner revenue, had also climbed, indicating a pullback could restore balance to miner economics. Conclusion The Bitcoin price drop below $96,000 serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. However, analysis of technical indicators, on-chain data, and historical patterns suggests this is a routine correction within a complex market structure. The move alleviated excessive leverage, tested key support levels, and reset overbought conditions. Market participants will now watch for consolidation above the $95,000 support zone and subsequent signals of accumulation. The fundamental thesis for Bitcoin, built on digital scarcity and its role as a hedge against monetary debasement, remains untested by this single price movement. Ultimately, the Bitcoin price drop provides a valuable stress test for market infrastructure and investor conviction. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $96,000? The decline resulted from a combination of technical selling after failing to hold support, liquidations of over-leveraged long positions, and a slight strengthening of the U.S. dollar. It represents a normal correction within a bullish trend. Q2: Is this a sign the bull market is over? Historical data suggests not. Previous Bitcoin bull markets have experienced numerous similar or deeper corrections. Underlying network fundamentals and institutional adoption trends have not shown bearish reversals. Q3: What is the most important support level to watch now? Traders are closely monitoring the $95,000 level, which aligns with the 50-day moving average and a previous consolidation range. A sustained break below could signal a deeper correction toward $90,000. Q4: How do altcoins typically react when Bitcoin drops? Altcoins generally exhibit higher volatility. They often decline by a greater percentage than Bitcoin during market downturns but may also recover more sharply if Bitcoin stabilizes. Q5: Should long-term investors be concerned about this price movement? Long-term investment strategies based on Bitcoin’s fundamental properties are typically designed to withstand short-term volatility. Analysts advise against making portfolio decisions based solely on single-day price action.

This significant movement, equivalent to approximately 6,647 BTC according to data from analytics firm TraderT, arrives at a critical juncture for cryptocurrency adoption within traditional finance. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing this surge for clues about broader investor sentiment and the evolving role of regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles. Analyzing BlackRock’s Monumental IBIT Inflow The reported $646.6 million inflow represents a decisive uptick for the IBIT fund. To provide essential context, this single-day figure surpasses the average weekly inflows observed for many spot Bitcoin ETFs throughout late 2024. Data from TraderT and other financial analytics platforms indicates this is the largest daily net positive flow for IBIT since mid-October of the previous year. Furthermore, this substantial capital movement translates directly into Bitcoin acquisition, with the trust adding over 6,600 BTC to its holdings in one 24-hour period. Several key factors likely contributed to this notable event. Primarily, shifting macroeconomic indicators in early 2025 may have prompted institutional portfolio rebalancing. Additionally, recent regulatory clarifications from governing bodies have provided a more stable framework for digital asset investments. Market technicians also point to Bitcoin’s price consolidation above key support levels as a potential trigger for renewed accumulation by large-scale investors seeking exposure through trusted, regulated channels like the IBIT ETF. The Mechanics of Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows Understanding this inflow requires a grasp of how spot Bitcoin ETFs operate. Unlike futures-based products, a spot ETF holds the actual underlying asset. When investors purchase shares, the ETF’s authorized participants create new shares by depositing cash. The ETF sponsor, like BlackRock, then uses that cash to purchase an equivalent amount of Bitcoin, which a custodian securely holds. Therefore, a net inflow directly increases the fund’s Bitcoin reserves and represents fresh capital entering the Bitcoin market. Comparative Landscape of Bitcoin ETF Performance While comprehensive data for all spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 14 is still being compiled, the IBIT surge invites comparison with its peers. Since their landmark approvals, these funds have competed for assets under management (AUM), with flows often acting as a barometer for institutional preference. The following table illustrates the competitive environment among leading funds prior to this event, based on publicly available trailing data. ETF Ticker Sponsor Approx. AUM (Pre-Inflow) Notable Characteristics IBIT BlackRock ~$12.5 Billion Largest AUM, strong brand recognition FBTC Fidelity ~$9.8 Billion Competitive fee structure, trusted name ARKB ARK Invest/21Shares ~$3.2 Billion Early advocate, lower fee option BITB Bitwise ~$2.5 Billion Transparency-focused, frequent on-chain reporting This competitive dynamic is crucial. Historically, large inflows into one fund, especially a market leader like IBIT, can create a halo effect, boosting sentiment across the entire ETF category. Analysts will watch closely to see if other major funds report correlated positive flows, which would suggest a broad-based institutional move rather than capital rotation between products. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets The scale of this inflow carries significant implications beyond a single fund’s balance sheet. Firstly, it represents substantial direct buying pressure on the Bitcoin network. Purchases of this magnitude, executed through OTC desks and exchanges by authorized participants, can reduce immediately available supply, a fundamental factor supporting asset prices. Secondly, consistent inflows into regulated vehicles validate the Bitcoin ETF structure as a successful conduit for traditional capital. Key impacts for the wider market include: Price Discovery: Large, transparent inflows provide clear data points for assessing institutional demand, leading to more efficient price discovery. Market Maturation: Sustained activity in regulated products further integrates Bitcoin into the global financial system, potentially reducing volatility over the long term. Regulatory Dialogue: Strong performance and investor adoption provide tangible evidence used in ongoing regulatory discussions concerning digital assets. Corporate Treasury Consideration: High-profile inflows reinforce the model for other corporations considering Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Expert Perspectives on Institutional Behavior Financial analysts specializing in fund flows interpret this data cautiously but optimistically. James Carter, a senior ETF strategist at Horizon Analytics, notes, “Single-day records are attention-grabbing, but the trend is more important. A spike of this size after a period of quieter flows suggests pent-up demand or a specific catalyst. The critical question is whether this marks the beginning of a new inflow cycle or remains an isolated event.” This perspective underscores the need to monitor subsequent daily flow data from TraderT and other sources to establish a pattern. Historical Context and Future Trajectory The journey to this point began with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. That event unlocked a new era of accessible Bitcoin investment for registered investment advisors (RIAs), pension funds, and other institutional entities prohibited from direct cryptocurrency purchases. Since launch, cumulative net inflows into all spot Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded $30 billion, a testament to the product-market fit. Looking forward, the market will assess whether this IBIT inflow signals a resurgence of the aggressive accumulation phase seen in the first quarter of 2024 or if it reflects a more measured, sustained allocation. Upcoming economic data, particularly regarding interest rates and inflation, will heavily influence institutional asset allocation decisions. Moreover, technological developments on the Bitcoin network, such as scaling improvements, could enhance its investment thesis for long-term holders. Conclusion BlackRock’s IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF achieving a $646.6 million net inflow, its largest in three months, serves as a potent indicator of enduring institutional interest in cryptocurrency. This event, meticulously tracked by data providers like TraderT, highlights the critical role regulated investment vehicles now play in channeling traditional finance into digital assets. While the immediate impact provides a bullish signal for Bitcoin markets, the long-term significance lies in the continued normalization and maturation of Bitcoin as an institutional-grade asset class. Consequently, future flow data will be paramount in determining if this marks a pivotal turning point or a standout moment in the ongoing integration of Bitcoin into global portfolios. FAQs Q1: What does a ‘net inflow’ mean for a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT? A1: A net inflow occurs when the amount of new money invested into the ETF (creating new shares) exceeds the amount withdrawn (redeeming shares). This requires the ETF to purchase more of the underlying asset—in this case, Bitcoin—thereby increasing its total holdings and exerting direct buying pressure on the market. Q2: Why is the source of data (TraderT) important? A2: TraderT is a recognized analytics firm that aggregates and verifies flow data from multiple sources. Its reporting provides an early, reliable snapshot of ETF activity before official numbers are released by the fund sponsors, making it a key resource for traders and analysts. Q3: How does this large inflow affect the price of Bitcoin? A3: Large inflows can positively impact Bitcoin’s price. The ETF’s authorized participants must buy Bitcoin to back the newly created shares. This creates direct demand, which can reduce available supply on exchanges and, all else being equal, provide upward price support. Q4: Are inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs the same as direct Bitcoin purchases? A4: In economic effect, they are very similar, as the ETF must buy spot Bitcoin. However, the purchase is made by the fund’s agents on behalf of shareholders. For the investor, it provides Bitcoin price exposure through a traditional brokerage account without the technical complexities of direct ownership, like private key management. Q5: What could cause such a large single-day inflow after three months? A5: Potential catalysts include a positive shift in macroeconomic outlook (e.g., expectations of lower interest rates), a technical breakout in Bitcoin’s price chart triggering algorithmic buying, a major institutional client allocating funds, or a period of accumulation finally manifesting in a large, reported transaction.

57176302,657697,1768449604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57176302.jpeg,Ethereum Open Interest Breaks October 9 Threshold: Traders Return Post-Shakeout,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-open-interest-breaks-october-9-threshold/,"Ethereum is showing tentative signs of relief after weeks of downside pressure, but the recovery remains fragile. The price is currently struggling to push decisively above the $3,400 level, a zone that has repeatedly acted as resistance during recent attempts to rebound. While short-term sentiment has improved alongside broader market stabilization, risks remain elevated. Several analysts warn that Ethereum could still face further declines in the coming weeks if momentum fades and macro or liquidity conditions deteriorate again. Adding complexity to the picture, derivatives data suggest a renewed buildup of risk. A report from Arab Chain highlights that Ethereum’s open interest on Binance has climbed to approximately $8.6 billion, its highest level since October 9. This marks a notable shift after a prolonged period of contraction following the sharp liquidation event in October, when open interest collapsed from above $10 billion to below $7 billion in a matter of days. That episode flushed excessive leverage from the market and forced traders into a defensive stance. The current rise in open interest signals that traders are gradually returning and rebuilding positions at lower price levels. However, this also increases the price’s sensitivity to sudden moves. Ethereum Derivatives Activity Rebuilds Confidence Ethereum is currently testing a key structural resistance zone around $3,400, and the latest derivatives data adds important context to this price behavior. According to the CryptoQuant report by Arab Chain, the rise in open interest on Binance reflects renewed activity in the derivatives market and a clear return of traders’ appetite for leverage. This is a notable shift from the defensive posture seen after the October liquidation wave. What stands out is that this increase in open interest is occurring while ETH trades near the $3,300–$3,400 area, well below its previous cycle highs. This suggests that traders are not chasing price at extremes, but instead building positions at relatively discounted levels. Historically, this type of positioning often reflects expectations of a medium-term upside move rather than short-term speculation. At the same time, the fact that open interest has reached its highest level since October 9 without returning to prior overheated extremes points to a more balanced recovery. If this growth is driven by steady inflows rather than aggressive leverage, it supports the idea of a healthier market structure forming after the post-liquidation contraction phase. However, risks remain asymmetric near resistance. A continued and rapid expansion in open interest while price stalls below $3,400 could increase vulnerability to sharp volatility. For Ethereum to sustain momentum, price and open interest must remain aligned, confirming that confidence is rebuilding rather than overstretching. Price Faces Key Resistance Level Ethereum price action on the daily chart shows a market attempting to recover, but still constrained by heavy structural resistance near the $3,400 region. After a sharp decline from the October highs, ETH established a local bottom below $2,900 and has since been forming higher lows, suggesting short-term stabilization rather than a confirmed trend reversal. Price is currently trading near $3,300, where multiple technical factors converge. The descending 200-day moving average and prior horizontal support-turned-resistance are capping upside momentum. Each rally into this zone has met selling pressure, highlighting that this area remains a critical supply region. The inability to reclaim $3,400 decisively keeps the broader structure neutral-to-bearish. On the downside, the rising short-term moving average and recent higher lows around $3,000–$3,050 provide initial support. As long as ETH holds above this range, the market maintains a constructive consolidation structure rather than resuming the prior impulsive downtrend. Volume has remained moderate during the recovery, indicating controlled participation rather than aggressive speculative buying. ETH is compressing between rising short-term support and declining long-term resistance. This type of price behavior often precedes a directional move. A clean daily close above $3,400 would signal a shift in market control and open the door for a broader recovery.

Although XRP experienced a brief rally from around $1.90 to over $2 in January 2026, the upward momentum appears to have stalled at that point. A crypto analyst has shared insights into why XRP may be failing to sustain a breakout, noting that the biggest enemy of XRP investors is not price action. XRP Investors Face Biggest Enemy Beyond Price Market analyst Cryptollica has pointed to “time,” rather than price, as the biggest enemy of XRP investors, as the token continues to consolidate near the $2 mark. In a detailed analysis shared on X, he connected XRP’s current consolidation to a recurring historical pattern visible on the two-week price chart. Related Reading: This Ethereum Triangle Breakout Puts Price Above $24,000, Here’s The Path Cryptollica explained that XRP is moving through a phase labeled “Part 3” on the chart, designed to shake out holders experiencing boredom. In the past, this stage usually followed Part 4, when price expansion became visible and widely noticed. The chart maps a structure from the 2014 to 2017 cycle, in which Parts 1, 2, and 3 played out before a sharp rally followed. The same structural sequence is overlaid on the 2021 to 2026 period, with Parts 1 and 2 already completed and Part 3 currently unfolding. XRP’s price action on the chart shows it is moving sideways slightly above the $2 region after reclaiming the $1.95 area, which is a key breakout level. The consolidation is occurring above a rising long-term trendline, suggesting the overall uptrend is still holding, even if momentum is slow. Cryptollica also noted that the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reset, shown in the lower part of the chart, where momentum has eased but not collapsed. He sees this reset as a necessary step that clears the way for XRP’s next move, and not a sign of weakness. The chart further highlights that previous cycles rewarded patience once this consolidation phase ended, reinforcing the analyst’s belief that time is the biggest enemy of holders.

He called Part 1 a multi-year accumulation phase and Part 2, the first impulse and liquidity grab. As mentioned earlier, both phases have been completed in this cycle, according to the analyst. With XRP now in Part 3, the shakeout stage to test long-term holders, Cryptollica explains that once this is completed, the cryptocurrency is on its way to a vertical price discovery, which marks Part 4. He highlighted the reliability of this decade-long fractal, suggesting that XRP’s spring is currently loaded and ready for a potential expansion phase.

In 2029, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.0001160. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.0001740 and an average trading price of $0.0001165 in 2032. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Short-term bias remains bearish unless $0.000054 is reclaimed. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the daily chart for January 15, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000513 after a clear rejection from the upper Bollinger Band near $0.000062. The prior impulsive rally has transitioned into a controlled pullback, with price now compressing toward the mid-band around $0.0000495. This area is critical: holding above it keeps the broader higher-low structure intact, while a daily close below exposes downside toward $0.000045. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram has been contracting for several sessions, signaling a decelerating bullish momentum rather than an outright trend reversal, while the RSI slipping toward the low 50s confirms a cooling of strength without entering oversold territory. This reads as consolidation after expansion, but pressure is building. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI has decisively lost short-term structure, breaking below the Alligator averages and printing a strong bearish candle toward $0.000051. The failure to hold above $0.000054–$0.000055 confirms lower highs and gives sellers control in the near term. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The OBV rolling over and CMF drifting down toward neutral suggest distribution rather than aggressive accumulation, indicating weak dip-buying conviction. As long as the price remains below $0.0000535, bounces are corrective, with downside risk toward $0.000049–$0.000050 before meaningful demand is expected.

A clean hold above $0.000049 could reset the trend, while a breakdown would deepen the correction. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~18.6x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade. Recent news/opinion on FLOKI Floki intends to be the one wearing the crown of the “meme king” through innovations and ecosystem developments. Every cycle crowns a ""meme king"".

This figure, compiled by industry data tracker Trader T, not only represents the highest single-day influx in three months but also marks the third consecutive day of positive net flows, solidifying a bullish trend for cryptocurrency investment vehicles. The substantial movement of capital underscores a significant shift in asset allocation strategies among major financial players. Breaking Down the Record Bitcoin ETF Inflows The data reveals a clear hierarchy of demand among the approved funds. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the activity, capturing a commanding $646.62 million of the total inflow. Consequently, this single fund accounted for over 77% of the day’s net new capital. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed as a distant but significant second, securing $125.39 million. Other funds contributing to the historic tally included: ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB): $27.04 million Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB): $10.60 million VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL): $8.28 million Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC): $5.64 million Notably, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which had experienced substantial outflows following its conversion to an ETF, recorded a positive inflow of $15.25 million. This reversal is a critical data point for market analysts, potentially indicating the stabilization of the fund’s investor base. Contextualizing the Surge in Cryptocurrency Investment This record-breaking day did not occur in a vacuum. It builds upon a growing trend of institutional adoption since the landmark Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approvals in January 2024. These regulated products provide traditional investors with a familiar, secure, and liquid avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of direct custody. The consecutive days of inflows suggest a structured accumulation strategy rather than speculative, one-off bets. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors often influence such movements. For instance, analysts frequently correlate increased Bitcoin ETF activity with periods of dollar weakness, inflationary hedging concerns, or search for non-correlated assets during equity market volatility. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Impact Market structure experts point to the concentration of flows into IBIT and FBTC as evidence of a “flight to quality” and brand recognition within the ETF wrapper. Large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity bring immense distribution networks and established trust with financial advisors. The cumulative net assets of these funds now represent a substantial and growing portion of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization, increasing their influence on price discovery and liquidity. According to standard economic theory, sustained ETF inflows require the fund issuers to purchase equivalent amounts of underlying Bitcoin, creating consistent buy-side pressure on the spot market. The following table contrasts this record day with recent weekly averages to illustrate the scale of the January 14 event: Metric January 14, 2025 Prior 7-Day Average (Est.) Net Inflow $838.82M $220M IBIT Share 77.1% ~65% Consecutive Inflow Days 3 N/A This purchasing activity has tangible effects on blockchain metrics. On-chain data often shows corresponding movements of Bitcoin into known custodian wallets, such as Coinbase Custody, which serves multiple ETF providers. The transparency of both ETF flows and blockchain settlements provides a unique, verifiable window into institutional capital movements. The Regulatory Landscape and Future Trajectory The robust health of the spot Bitcoin ETF market is a focal point for regulators. The SEC monitors these products for compliance, market manipulation, and investor protection. Strong, consistent inflows demonstrate product viability and investor demand, which could influence future regulatory decisions regarding other cryptocurrency-based ETPs, such as those for Ethereum. The success of these funds also pressures global financial hubs to develop competitive frameworks. Jurisdictions like the European Union and the United Kingdom are closely observing US market dynamics. For financial advisors, the growing asset base and trading volume of these ETFs enhance their legitimacy as a portfolio allocation tool for a broader client demographic, moving from niche to mainstream consideration. Conclusion The record $838.8 million inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 14, 2025, is a definitive milestone for cryptocurrency integration into traditional finance. Led by industry titans BlackRock and Fidelity, this capital movement signals deep and sustained institutional confidence. The trend of consecutive inflow days, coupled with a reversal for Grayscale’s GBTC, paints a picture of a maturing and stabilizing market. As these regulated vehicles continue to accumulate assets, their role in global Bitcoin price formation and their acceptance as a standard financial instrument will only intensify. The performance of these Bitcoin ETFs remains a critical barometer for institutional sentiment toward digital assets. FAQs Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Bitcoin as its underlying asset. It allows investors to buy shares that track the live market price of Bitcoin without needing to directly purchase, store, or secure the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs important? Net inflows indicate that more new money is entering the ETF than leaving it. For spot Bitcoin ETFs, this typically requires the issuer to buy more Bitcoin to back the new shares, creating direct buy-side pressure on the Bitcoin market and reflecting growing investor demand. Q3: What caused the record inflow on January 14, 2025? While specific catalysts vary, large inflows often coincide with macroeconomic shifts, positive Bitcoin price momentum, institutional rebalancing, or strategic accumulation by large wealth managers. The third consecutive day of inflows suggests a deliberate, sustained investment trend. Q4: How does GBTC seeing an inflow differ from its past activity? After converting to an ETF, GBTC experienced massive outflows as investors sold shares that traded at a discount for years. A positive inflow suggests this selling pressure may be subsiding and new investors are finding value, which is a positive sign for overall market equilibrium. Q5: Do these ETF flows directly impact Bitcoin’s price? Yes, there is a strong correlation. Because spot ETFs must purchase physical Bitcoin to cover new shares, large net inflows directly increase demand on cryptocurrency exchanges, which can positively influence Bitcoin’s market price, all else being equal.

This consistent positive momentum, occurring without a single fund experiencing outflows, marks a pivotal phase for cryptocurrency investment vehicles in the American market. The data reveals a clear preference for major asset managers, setting a significant precedent for digital asset adoption within regulated finance. Ethereum ETF Inflows Detail a Broad-Based Institutional Embrace The January 14th data provides a granular look at capital allocation. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) dominated the activity, attracting a commanding $81.65 million. Consequently, Grayscale’s converted Ethereum Trust (ETH) followed with a strong $43.47 million, while its Ethereum Mini Trust (ETHE) added $32.35 million. Other providers also contributed to the total. For instance, Bitwise Ethereum Fund (ETHW) gathered $7.97 million, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) saw $5.89 million, and VanEck’s Ethereum Trust (ETHV) recorded $3.70 million. This distribution indicates demand is not concentrated but spread across multiple established financial brands. This three-day inflow streak follows the landmark regulatory approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in late 2024. The approval process, which involved rigorous scrutiny of custody, creation/redemption mechanisms, and market surveillance, established a new framework for crypto exposure. Unlike futures-based products, these spot ETFs hold physical ether, providing direct asset ownership for shareholders and reducing tracking error. The immediate and sustained inflows suggest the product structure successfully meets institutional and accredited investor requirements for security, liquidity, and transparency. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Sustained Cryptocurrency ETF Demand Several concurrent macroeconomic and sector-specific factors are fueling this demand. Firstly, a shifting interest rate environment in early 2025 has prompted investors to re-evaluate alternative asset allocations. Secondly, Ethereum’s ongoing network upgrades, particularly the full implementation of proto-danksharding to enhance scalability, have improved its fundamental investment thesis. Thirdly, the successful precedent set by spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over $50 billion in assets, has paved a familiar and trusted path for institutional capital into Ethereum. Key factors driving Ethereum ETF adoption include: Regulatory Clarity: A defined SEC framework reduces legal uncertainty for large institutions. Portfolio Diversification: ETH offers a non-correlated asset class distinct from traditional stocks and bonds. Convenient Access: ETFs provide exposure without the complexities of direct crypto custody. Market Maturity: Ethereum’s established developer ecosystem and enterprise use cases bolster its long-term viability. Expert Perspective on Market Structure and Future Trajectory Market analysts point to the absence of daily outflows as a critical bullish signal. It suggests that early investors are not taking quick profits but are likely establishing longer-term positions. Furthermore, the volume is not merely shifting between competing funds but represents net new capital entering the ecosystem. This pattern mirrors the early accumulation phase observed in Bitcoin ETFs before their exponential growth. The involvement of titans like BlackRock and Fidelity also provides a stamp of legitimacy, encouraging participation from more conservative institutional pools like pension funds and endowments that previously avoided direct crypto markets. The impact extends beyond simple price appreciation for ether. Sustained ETF inflows increase the float of ETH held in regulated custody, effectively reducing circulating supply on exchanges. This can create a structural supply shock, potentially leading to increased price volatility and upward pressure. Moreover, the daily creation of new ETF shares requires authorized participants to purchase ether in the open market, creating a consistent, institutional-grade buy-side pressure that did not exist at this scale prior to 2025. Comparative Performance and Broader Market Implications The following table contrasts the inflow performance of major spot Ethereum ETF issuers for January 14, 2025, highlighting the competitive landscape: Issuer Fund Ticker Net Inflows (Jan 14) Market Position BlackRock ETHA $81.65M Leader Grayscale ETH $43.47M Established Player Grayscale ETHE $32.35M Lower-Fee Option Bitwise ETHW $7.97M Specialist Provider Fidelity FETH $5.89M Full-Service Giant VanEck ETHV $3.70M Niche Innovator This activity has a ripple effect across the digital asset sector. Positive flows for Ethereum ETFs often correlate with increased developer activity and venture capital funding for projects built on the Ethereum network. They also set a regulatory and financial template that other jurisdictions may follow, promoting global standardization. However, analysts caution that inflows are not guaranteed indefinitely; factors like renewed regulatory scrutiny, macroeconomic downturns, or technological setbacks on the Ethereum network could affect future demand. The current trend, nevertheless, establishes a robust foundation for the asset class within mainstream finance. Conclusion The third consecutive day of inflows, totaling $175 million into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, underscores a decisive and growing institutional commitment to Ethereum. This trend, led by BlackRock’s ETHA and supported across multiple issuers, validates the product’s market fit and reflects broader acceptance of core digital assets. The sustained demand, devoid of outflows, suggests a strategic accumulation phase is underway. As the 2025 financial landscape evolves, the performance of these Ethereum ETF products will serve as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency’s integration into the global institutional portfolio. FAQs Q1: What are spot Ethereum ETFs? A1: Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold physical ether (ETH). They trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why is a third day of consecutive inflows significant? A2: Consecutive inflow days indicate sustained, rather than one-off, demand. The lack of simultaneous outflows shows investors are holding their positions, which is typically interpreted as a sign of longer-term conviction rather than short-term speculation. Q3: How do these ETFs impact the price of Ethereum? A3: ETFs create consistent buying pressure. To issue new shares, authorized participants must purchase ether on the open market. This can reduce readily available supply on exchanges, potentially creating upward price pressure, especially if demand for ETF shares remains high. Q4: What is the difference between Grayscale’s ETH and ETHE funds? A4: Grayscale’s ETH is the original Grayscale Ethereum Trust, recently converted to an ETF, often carrying a higher fee. ETHE is a newer “Mini Trust” launched with a competitively lower fee structure to attract cost-conscious investors. Q5: Are Ethereum ETFs a safe investment? A5: “Safe” is relative. While ETFs offer regulatory oversight, custody by major institutions, and familiar brokerage access, they are still subject to Ethereum’s high price volatility. They are considered safer than unregulated exchanges for obtaining exposure but remain a high-risk asset class compared to traditional equities or bonds.

The technology giant now mandates Virtual Asset Service Provider registration for all crypto exchange applications on the Google Play Store. This regulatory enforcement creates immediate compliance challenges for global exchanges operating in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. Google’s VASP Registration Requirement Explained Google’s new policy requires cryptocurrency exchange applications to submit documented proof of their VASP registration with South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit. This documentation must demonstrate full compliance with the country’s financial regulations. Consequently, applications failing to meet this requirement will become unavailable for new installations starting January 28, 2025. The Financial Intelligence Unit serves as South Korea’s primary anti-money laundering authority for virtual assets. Moreover, the FIU operates under the Financial Services Commission, which oversees the nation’s entire financial sector. VASP registration represents a comprehensive regulatory framework that exchanges must complete to operate legally within South Korea. This regulatory framework includes several critical components: Anti-Money Laundering Compliance: Exchanges must implement robust AML systems Customer Verification: Strict Know-Your-Customer procedures are mandatory Transaction Monitoring: Systems must detect and report suspicious activities Capital Requirements: Minimum capital thresholds ensure operational stability Local Incorporation: Foreign exchanges must establish domestic entities South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Regulatory Landscape South Korea has progressively strengthened its cryptocurrency regulations following several high-profile incidents. The country’s regulatory approach reflects growing global concerns about consumer protection and financial stability. Additionally, South Korean authorities have prioritized preventing money laundering and illegal capital outflows through virtual assets. The regulatory timeline demonstrates this evolving approach: Year Regulatory Development Impact 2021 Travel Rule Implementation Exchanges must share sender/receiver information 2022 VASP Registration Mandate All exchanges must register with FIU 2023 Enhanced AML Requirements Stricter monitoring and reporting standards 2024 Google Play Store Policy App distribution tied to regulatory compliance South Korea represents one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets. The country’s trading volume frequently ranks among global leaders. Furthermore, retail participation remains exceptionally high compared to other developed economies. This market significance explains why regulatory developments attract international attention. Global Exchange Compliance Challenges Major global cryptocurrency exchanges face significant hurdles under Google’s new policy. Platforms including Binance, OKX, and Bybit have not completed their VASP registration in South Korea. These exchanges now confront potential disruption to their mobile application accessibility for South Korean users. Binance’s response to inquiries about VASP registration plans revealed internal uncertainty. The exchange stated the matter “has not been discussed internally,” suggesting potential strategic oversight. This response contrasts with the proactive compliance approaches of domestic South Korean exchanges. Domestic exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb have already completed their VASP registration processes. These platforms maintain full compliance with South Korean regulations. Consequently, they face no disruption from Google’s policy implementation. This regulatory divide creates competitive advantages for compliant domestic operators. Technical Implementation and User Impact Google will implement this policy through its standard app review processes. Exchange applications must submit compliance documentation through developer consoles. The technology company will verify submissions against official FIU records. Applications lacking proper documentation will receive rejection notices. Existing users of non-compliant applications face specific limitations. While they can continue using installed applications, they cannot download updates or reinstall after removal. This creates potential security vulnerabilities over time. Additionally, new users cannot access these applications through official channels. The policy affects only new installations and updates, not existing installations. However, security updates represent critical maintenance for cryptocurrency applications. Without regular updates, applications become increasingly vulnerable to security threats. This creates difficult choices for users of affected exchanges. Market Implications and Competitive Dynamics Google’s policy accelerates regulatory consolidation within South Korea’s cryptocurrency sector. Compliant exchanges gain significant competitive advantages. They maintain full access to the Android user base through official channels. Meanwhile, non-compliant exchanges face distribution limitations. Android devices dominate South Korea’s smartphone market with approximately 70% market share. This makes Google Play Store accessibility crucial for user acquisition. Excluding applications from this platform severely restricts growth potential. The policy therefore creates powerful incentives for regulatory compliance. The regulatory environment favors established domestic exchanges with existing compliance. These platforms understand local requirements and maintain relationships with regulators. International exchanges face steeper learning curves regarding South Korea’s specific regulatory expectations. This knowledge gap creates implementation challenges. Global Regulatory Context and Precedents Google’s policy aligns with broader global trends in cryptocurrency regulation. Technology platforms increasingly serve as regulatory enforcement points. App stores represent controlled distribution channels where compliance verification occurs efficiently. This approach mirrors financial sector practices where intermediaries enforce regulations. Other jurisdictions have implemented similar requirements through different mechanisms. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation establishes comprehensive standards. Japan’s Financial Services Agency maintains strict exchange licensing requirements. Singapore’s Monetary Authority implements progressive regulatory frameworks. South Korea’s approach combines elements from these international models. The country emphasizes consumer protection and financial integrity. Additionally, authorities prioritize preventing cryptocurrency-related fraud and market manipulation. These concerns reflect lessons from previous incidents within South Korea’s crypto ecosystem. Conclusion Google’s VASP registration requirement represents a significant development for South Korea’s cryptocurrency sector. The policy creates immediate compliance pressures for global exchanges operating in the market. Furthermore, it accelerates regulatory consolidation favoring domestic platforms. This development underscores the growing importance of regulatory compliance in cryptocurrency markets worldwide. The January 28 implementation date creates urgent timelines for affected exchanges. Ultimately, Google’s policy reinforces South Korea’s position as a jurisdiction with stringent but structured cryptocurrency regulations. FAQs Q1: What is VASP registration in South Korea? VASP registration refers to the mandatory licensing process for Virtual Asset Service Providers with South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit. This process ensures exchanges comply with anti-money laundering regulations and consumer protection standards. Q2: Which exchanges are affected by Google’s new policy? Exchanges lacking completed VASP registration face potential removal from the Google Play Store. Global platforms including Binance, OKX, and Bybit may experience disruptions if they don’t complete registration before the January 28 deadline. Q3: Can existing users still use non-compliant exchange apps? Existing installations will continue functioning, but users cannot download updates or reinstall applications after removal. This creates potential security concerns over time as applications become outdated. Q4: How does this affect South Korea’s cryptocurrency market? The policy strengthens compliant domestic exchanges while creating barriers for non-compliant international platforms. This may reduce competition but increase regulatory oversight and consumer protection within the market. Q5: What are the requirements for VASP registration in South Korea? Requirements include establishing a local corporate entity, implementing robust AML/KYC systems, maintaining minimum capital reserves, appointing compliance officers, and undergoing regular audits by financial authorities.

The land acquisition, part of a definitive agreement announced on Wednesday, complements a long-term extension of transmission facilities that will enable 300 megawatts (MW) of immediate power demand, with expansion options up to 600 MW. Together with CleanSpark’s existing Austin County site and power assets, the company is building a regional compute hub in the greater Houston area, with nearly 1 gigawatt of potential capacity, positioning itself as a major supplier of infrastructure for AI workloads. CleanSpark is adding more power so it can serve more customers who use AI CleanSpark acquired land near Houston due to the strong grid and large energy supply from the nearby ERCOT power market. The region has a high demand for AI computing and can supply electricity at a scale that many other markets can’t offer, which is a big advantage for the company. AI and HPC data centers operate continuously, requiring a substantial amount of electricity every hour. For this reason, CleanSpark has signed long-term agreements that enable it to connect directly to high-voltage power lines, ensuring its machines receive the optimal amount of energy to maintain operations. The company can now create campuses for data centers that expand without requiring renegotiation of access to power or rebuilding of infrastructure later. Access to direct transmission also reduces the risks of power limits, grid congestion, and delays that small local connections often face. CleanSpark also wants its data centers to be located close together, allowing them to share resources easily. And since they already have another development site nearby, in Austin County, they can quickly achieve their goals and become more efficient than if each project were spread across different states. Large AI customers require consistent power, predictable costs, and ample space to grow over the long term. The Houston-area and Austin County sites, combined, could provide up to 890 megawatts of power to help customers expand without disruption. Some customers require direct grid access, while others prefer dedicated on-site power solutions close to their computing operations, so CleanSpark plans to support both front-of-the-meter and behind-the-meter power setups across its developments in Texas. The data center developer wants customers to view it as a long-term partner in a market where reliable power is one of the most valuable resources. Harder Bitcoin mining is pushing miners toward AI and faster computing Bitcoin mining has become extremely expensive, and profit margins have shrunk even further due to increased competition in 2025, as more miners joined the market. Companies had no choice but to use more resources to maintain the same margins they had before. Companies began seeking alternative sources of income, and since most large-scale miners operate sites with robust grid connections, they opted for AI and HPC. Unlike Bitcoin mining, whose profit margins have become unpredictable due to intense competition, AI and HPC have long-term agreements with steady payments, allowing miners to predict future revenue better. Companies like CleanSpark can quickly integrate AI and HPC operations with minimal limitations on new construction, as the company has already been handling large amounts of power efficiently. The firm can now continue mining BTC where it makes sense and accommodate other projects that support long-term planning. Miners now want to reduce their dependence on Bitcoin because the prices are unstable and competition is high. Several firms have already modified parts of their operations to incorporate AI or computing, while others have announced plans to do so in the near future. Texas has become a favorite for miners making this transition because it has large amounts of available power, strong transmission infrastructure, and an increasing demand for computing services. CleanSpark aims to leverage its mining roots by transforming them into computing platforms and will continue to expand its portfolio in Texas, negotiating with potential partners who require co-location and large-scale compute campuses.

Alchemy Pay’s Strategic Regulatory Milestone in South Dakota Alchemy Pay, a leading provider of hybrid crypto-fiat payment solutions, announced this critical regulatory achievement. Consequently, the company now holds active Money Transmitter Licenses in 13 U.S. states. This expansion provides a more robust and legally sound framework for its services. Moreover, South Dakota’s license represents a key piece in a complex national puzzle. The state maintains a progressive stance toward financial innovation. Therefore, this approval signals regulatory confidence in Alchemy Pay’s operational models. Money Transmitter Licenses are non-negotiable for any entity moving value on behalf of the public. Specifically, they mandate strict compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols. Alchemy Pay’s growing portfolio directly addresses a major industry pain point: regulatory uncertainty. For users and merchants, this translates to greater trust and reliability. The company systematically pursues state-level approvals to build a nationwide network. The Expanding Map of Crypto Payment Compliance Alchemy Pay’s methodical state-by-state approach mirrors a broader industry trend. Traditional payment giants and crypto-native firms alike must navigate this fragmented landscape. Each state functions as its own regulatory domain. For instance, New York requires a separate, rigorous BitLicense. Conversely, Texas integrates money transmission into its currency exchange statutes. Alchemy Pay’s progress to 13 states demonstrates substantial commitment and resource allocation. The table below illustrates the scope of Alchemy Pay’s U.S. regulatory progress: License Type Jurisdiction Level Core Requirement Money Transmitter License (MTL) State-by-State AML/KYC Compliance, Bonding, Reporting Number of States Secured by Alchemy Pay 13 (including SD) Enables legal operation for residents This patchwork system creates significant hurdles. However, it also establishes high barriers to entry. Firms with extensive licenses possess a durable competitive advantage. Alchemy Pay’s strategy clearly focuses on establishing that advantage early. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Trajectory Financial technology analysts highlight the practical implications of this expansion. “Each new state license is not just a permit; it’s a building block for scalability,” notes a fintech regulatory advisor familiar with the space. “South Dakota, while less populous, is part of a crucial contiguous bloc for payment routing efficiency.” Furthermore, this growth enhances the utility of the native ACH token within the ecosystem. The token facilitates network operations and settlements. Evidence from the company’s growth in other licensed states shows a clear pattern. Following previous MTL approvals, merchant onboarding rates typically increased. User transaction volumes also saw correlated lifts. This data-driven outcome underscores the tangible value of regulatory clarity. The South Dakota approval is expected to follow a similar trajectory. It paves the way for deeper integration with regional financial institutions and businesses. Contextualizing the Broader Payment Revolution This news arrives amid a global shift toward integrated digital asset payments. Major card networks are actively exploring crypto settlement. Meanwhile, central banks develop digital currencies. Alchemy Pay positions itself at the convergence of these trends. Its technology allows traditional point-of-sale systems to accept cryptocurrency. The system then settles in local fiat currency for the merchant. This removes volatility risk and technical complexity. The company’s progress is measurable against several key industry benchmarks: Regulatory Coverage: 13 states provide access to a substantial portion of the U.S. consumer market. Technical Integration: Partnerships with giants like Shopify, QFPay, and Binance demonstrate real-world application. Global Footprint: Licenses and operations extend beyond the U.S. to over 70 countries, offering a comparative framework. Therefore, the South Dakota license is a incremental yet vital step. It reinforces a narrative of disciplined, compliant growth. This approach is increasingly rewarded by both the market and regulators. Conclusion Alchemy Pay’s acquisition of a South Dakota Money Transmitter License marks another calculated advance in its mission to bridge cryptocurrency and traditional finance. By securing its 13th state license, the firm not only expands its operational territory but also solidifies its reputation as a compliant and persistent player in the fintech arena. This regulatory milestone provides a clearer path for the adoption of seamless crypto payments across the United States, reinforcing the foundational trust required for mainstream acceptance. FAQs Q1: What is a Money Transmitter License (MTL)? A Money Transmitter License is a state-issued permit legally required for any business that transfers or transmits money or monetary value on behalf of the public. It ensures compliance with financial regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. Q2: Why is South Dakota’s license important for Alchemy Pay? While South Dakota has a smaller population, its license contributes to building a contiguous and comprehensive national network. It also signals regulatory approval from a state with a historically innovative financial services sector, adding credibility. Q3: How many U.S. states does Alchemy Pay now operate in with an MTL? With the addition of South Dakota, Alchemy Pay now holds active Money Transmitter Licenses in 13 U.S. states. The company continues to pursue applications in other states to expand its coverage.

The cryptocurrency industry stands at a pivotal legislative juncture as White House adviser David Sacks issues a compelling call for unity regarding the contentious crypto market structure bill. This urgent plea follows Coinbase’s significant withdrawal of support, which subsequently triggered the postponement of a crucial Senate markup session. Consequently, the path forward for comprehensive digital asset regulation in the United States now hinges on resolving deep-seated industry disagreements. Crypto Market Structure Bill Reaches Critical Impasse David Sacks, who serves as a White House adviser on both artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency policy, recently took to social media platform X to address the industry directly. He emphasized that the passage of the comprehensive crypto market structure legislation is “near,” but its success depends on collective action. “Now is the time to secure the industry’s future and establish a clear path forward,” Sacks stated, framing the moment as decisive for regulatory clarity. His intervention highlights the Biden administration’s active engagement with the complex challenge of digital asset governance. Furthermore, this call to action arrives amid increasing global competition for cryptocurrency innovation and investment. The proposed legislation aims to create a foundational regulatory framework for digital assets, delineating roles between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Historically, jurisdictional ambiguity between these agencies has created a challenging environment for crypto businesses. The bill seeks to classify digital assets more clearly, establish rules for trading platforms, and provide guidelines for stablecoin issuance. However, specific provisions within the latest draft have sparked intense debate and division among key industry stakeholders. Coinbase Withdrawal Exposes Deep Industry Rifts The immediate catalyst for the current stalemate was Coinbase’s public decision to withdraw its support for the bill. As one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, Coinbase’s stance carries considerable weight. The company cited several fundamental issues with the legislation’s current form. These objections include: A de facto ban on tokenized stocks: Provisions that could severely restrict or prohibit the trading of digital tokens representing traditional equities. Provisions blocking DeFi: Regulatory language perceived as overly broad, potentially stifling innovation in decentralized finance protocols. Weakening CFTC authority: A shift in regulatory oversight that favors the SEC’s jurisdiction, which the crypto industry often views as less accommodating. Potential stablecoin reward ban: Clauses that could outlaw features allowing users to earn rewards or interest on stablecoin holdings. This withdrawal had an immediate procedural impact. The Senate committee promptly postponed a markup session scheduled for January 15, 2025. Markup sessions are critical legislative steps where lawmakers debate, amend, and finalize bill language before a committee vote. This delay signals that lawmakers recognize the need for broader consensus before advancing the legislation. Regulatory Tug-of-War: SEC vs. CFTC The debate over regulatory jurisdiction represents a long-standing conflict in U.S. crypto policy. The SEC typically asserts that most digital assets are securities, falling under its strict disclosure and registration rules. Conversely, the CFTC classifies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities, advocating for a more flexible oversight framework focused on market integrity and anti-fraud. The current bill’s perceived tilt toward SEC authority worries many industry participants who fear it could impose traditional securities laws on novel digital asset ecosystems ill-suited for such a model. This tension underscores a fundamental question: should crypto regulation adapt existing frameworks or build entirely new ones? Key Provisions at Issue in the Crypto Market Structure Bill Provision Industry Concern Potential Impact Tokenized Securities De facto ban on digital stock tokens Limits innovation in asset tokenization DeFi Regulation Overly broad language could block protocols Threatens decentralized finance growth Agency Jurisdiction Strengthens SEC, weakens CFTC role Could impose unsuitable securities rules Stablecoin Features Ban on reward or interest features Reduces utility and adoption of stablecoins The Global Context and Competitive Pressure The urgency conveyed by White House adviser David Sacks does not exist in a vacuum. Major financial hubs like the European Union, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates have all moved forward with clearer crypto regulatory regimes. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, now in its implementation phase, provides a comprehensive rulebook for the 27-nation bloc. This global race for regulatory clarity places significant pressure on the United States. Prolonged legislative uncertainty risks driving innovation, talent, and capital to more predictable jurisdictions. Sacks’s message implicitly acknowledges this competitive landscape, urging domestic stakeholders to find common ground to ensure the U.S. remains a leader in the digital asset space. Industry reactions to Sacks’s call have been mixed. Some trade associations and blockchain advocates echo the need for compromise to achieve long-sought regulatory certainty. Others, however, stand firmly with Coinbase’s position, arguing that a flawed bill could be more damaging than no bill at all. This division presents a complex challenge for lawmakers who must balance consumer protection, financial stability, and technological innovation. The postponed markup session provides a temporary window for renewed negotiation and drafting, but the clock is ticking on the current congressional calendar. Historical Precedent and the Path to Compromise Previous attempts at comprehensive crypto legislation have repeatedly stalled in Congress due to similar disagreements. The current bill, known formally as the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, represents the most serious effort in years to break the logjam. Its progression has been closely watched by financial institutions, technology firms, and investors worldwide. The involvement of a White House adviser at this stage signals high-level executive branch interest in finding a workable solution. Potential areas for compromise may include more precise definitions for DeFi, a recalibrated balance between the SEC and CFTC, and tailored rules for stablecoins that address regulatory concerns without eliminating beneficial features. Conclusion The fate of the U.S. crypto market structure bill now rests on the industry’s ability to bridge internal divides following White House adviser David Sacks’s direct appeal for unity. Coinbase’s withdrawal of support and the subsequent Senate delay underscore the high stakes of this legislative effort. Achieving a consensus will require difficult compromises on issues ranging from DeFi regulation to agency jurisdiction. Ultimately, the outcome will shape the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States for years to come, determining whether the nation fosters innovation or cedes leadership to global competitors. The coming weeks of negotiation will be critical for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. FAQs Q1: Who is David Sacks and what is his role? David Sacks is a White House adviser focusing on policy related to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. He acts as a liaison between the Biden administration and the technology industry on these complex issues. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the crypto bill? Coinbase withdrew support due to several concerns, including provisions it believes would effectively ban tokenized stocks, block DeFi innovation, weaken the CFTC’s authority, and potentially ban reward features on stablecoins. Q3: What is a Senate markup session and why was it postponed? A markup session is a meeting where a congressional committee debates, amends, and rewrites proposed legislation. The session for this bill was postponed because key industry support fractured, indicating a need for further negotiation before the committee can proceed. Q4: What are the main regulatory agencies involved in U.S. crypto policy? The primary agencies are the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates securities, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates commodities and derivatives. The bill addresses how digital assets are classified under their jurisdictions. Q5: How does U.S. crypto regulation compare to other countries? The U.S. has been slower to establish comprehensive federal crypto rules compared to jurisdictions like the European Union, which has implemented its MiCA framework. This delay creates competitive pressure for the U.S. to act to retain innovation and capital.

According to blockchain analyst The Data Nerd, these transactions occurred approximately seven hours before reporting, coinciding with contrasting activity from Arrington Capital, which withdrew a substantial $18.51 million in ETH from Coinbase. These movements provide valuable insights into institutional cryptocurrency strategies during a period of notable market evolution. Analyzing the Amber Group and Ethena Foundation ETH Transactions The blockchain data reveals two anonymous addresses, presumably controlled by prominent crypto market maker Amber Group and the Ethena (ENA) Foundation, transferred a combined 3,956 ETH to Coinbase and Binance. Consequently, this substantial deposit represents one of the more significant institutional movements observed in recent weeks. Typically, exchange deposits suggest potential selling intentions, while withdrawals indicate accumulation or holding strategies. Therefore, these contrasting actions between depositing and withdrawing entities create a fascinating market dynamic that warrants careful examination. Market analysts consistently monitor such large-scale transactions because they often precede price movements. Specifically, the timing of these transfers coincides with broader market conditions that have seen increased institutional participation throughout 2025. Furthermore, the transparency of blockchain technology enables real-time tracking of these substantial movements, providing market participants with unprecedented visibility into institutional behavior patterns. Understanding Institutional Crypto Trading Patterns Institutional cryptocurrency trading follows distinct patterns that differ significantly from retail investor behavior. Market makers like Amber Group typically engage in high-volume transactions to provide liquidity across multiple trading platforms. Their activities often involve complex strategies including arbitrage, market making, and portfolio rebalancing. Meanwhile, foundations like Ethena manage treasury assets and development funds, making their transactions particularly noteworthy for long-term project sustainability signals. Expert Analysis of Exchange Flow Dynamics Blockchain analysts emphasize that exchange net flow—the difference between deposits and withdrawals—serves as a crucial market sentiment indicator. According to established on-chain analysis principles, sustained exchange inflows often correlate with increased selling pressure, while outflows typically suggest accumulation phases. The current data shows a nuanced picture: while Amber Group and Ethena Foundation deposited $13.24 million, Arrington Capital simultaneously withdrew $18.51 million, creating a net outflow of approximately $5.27 million from these specific transactions. This contrasting activity highlights the diverse strategies institutional players employ in cryptocurrency markets. Some entities may be taking profits or reallocating assets, while others position for anticipated market movements. The transparency of these blockchain transactions enables market participants to make more informed decisions based on observable institutional behavior rather than speculation alone. Historical Context of Similar Institutional Movements Previous instances of large-scale institutional transfers provide valuable context for understanding current market dynamics. Throughout 2024 and early 2025, similar patterns emerged during key market inflection points. For example, substantial exchange deposits frequently preceded short-term price corrections, while sustained withdrawal periods often coincided with accumulation before upward price movements. However, each situation contains unique elements that require individual analysis rather than direct historical comparison. The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly since earlier cycles, with institutional participation reaching unprecedented levels. Consequently, the impact of individual large transactions has diminished relative to overall market depth, though they remain important sentiment indicators. Current market conditions feature increased regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, enhanced institutional infrastructure, and growing mainstream adoption—all factors that influence how these transactions affect broader market dynamics. Technical Analysis of Ethereum Market Conditions Ethereum’s market structure presents specific considerations for analyzing these institutional movements. The network continues to evolve with ongoing protocol improvements, including enhancements to scalability and security. Additionally, Ethereum’s position as the primary platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts creates unique value propositions that influence institutional allocation decisions. Market participants must consider these technical fundamentals alongside transactional data for comprehensive analysis. Current Ethereum network metrics show healthy activity levels with sustained transaction volume and robust decentralized finance participation. The network’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus has altered its economic model, potentially influencing long-term holding strategies among institutional participants. These technical considerations provide essential context for understanding why institutions might adjust their Ethereum positions at specific times. Comparative Analysis of Involved Entities The entities involved in these transactions represent distinct segments of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Amber Group operates as a global digital asset market maker with substantial trading volume across multiple exchanges. Their activities typically focus on liquidity provision and algorithmic trading strategies. Conversely, the Ethena Foundation manages resources for protocol development and ecosystem growth, making their transactions potentially indicative of treasury management decisions rather than purely trading activities. Arrington Capital, which withdrew ETH from Coinbase simultaneously, represents the venture capital segment of cryptocurrency investment. Their activities often reflect longer-term investment horizons compared to market makers. This diversity of participants illustrates the multifaceted nature of institutional cryptocurrency engagement, where different entities operate with varying objectives, time horizons, and strategic considerations. Transaction Comparison: Deposits vs. Withdrawals Entity Action Amount (ETH) Value (USD) Exchange Amber Group/Ethena Deposit 3,956 $13.24M Coinbase/Binance Arrington Capital Withdrawal 5,500 $18.51M Coinbase Net Flow Withdrawal 1,544 $5.27M Multiple Market Impact and Broader Implications These transactions occur within a broader market context characterized by several key developments. Regulatory frameworks continue evolving across major jurisdictions, potentially influencing institutional behavior. Additionally, macroeconomic factors including interest rate policies and traditional market correlations may affect cryptocurrency allocation decisions. The transparent nature of blockchain transactions enables market participants to observe these institutional movements directly, reducing information asymmetry compared to traditional financial markets. The immediate market impact of these specific transactions appears limited given current market depth and volume. However, they contribute to cumulative data points that analysts monitor for emerging trends. Sustained patterns of exchange inflows or outflows often provide more reliable signals than individual transactions. Therefore, market participants typically await confirmation through subsequent data before drawing definitive conclusions about market direction. On-Chain Analytics Methodology and Reliability On-chain analysis has evolved into a sophisticated discipline combining blockchain data with traditional financial analysis techniques. Analysts like The Data Nerd employ multiple verification methods to associate addresses with specific entities, including: Pattern recognition: Identifying transaction patterns consistent with known entity behavior Address clustering: Grouping addresses likely controlled by the same entity External verification: Correlating blockchain data with publicly available information Historical analysis: Comparing current transactions with established entity patterns While address attribution always contains some uncertainty, reputable analysts employ conservative methodologies and clearly communicate probability levels. The transparency of blockchain data enables independent verification by multiple analysts, enhancing overall reliability through consensus mechanisms within the analytical community. Conclusion The Amber Group and Ethena Foundation ETH deposit totaling $13.2 million, alongside Arrington Capital’s contrasting withdrawal, provides valuable insights into institutional cryptocurrency strategies during 2025. These transactions highlight the diverse approaches different entities employ in digital asset markets, from market making and liquidity provision to treasury management and long-term investment. While individual transactions rarely determine market direction alone, they contribute to cumulative data points that informed participants monitor for emerging trends. The transparency enabled by blockchain technology continues revolutionizing market analysis, providing unprecedented visibility into institutional behavior and creating more informed, efficient cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What do exchange deposits typically indicate in cryptocurrency markets? Exchange deposits often signal potential selling intentions, as traders commonly move assets to exchanges when preparing to execute trades. However, institutional entities sometimes use exchanges for other purposes including liquidity provision, collateral management, or platform-specific activities. Q2: How reliable are address attributions in on-chain analysis? Address attributions involve probability assessments based on transaction patterns, publicly available information, and historical behavior. Reputable analysts employ conservative methodologies and transparently communicate confidence levels, but some uncertainty always exists in address attribution. Q3: Why do different institutions have contrasting strategies regarding exchange movements? Institutions operate with diverse objectives, time horizons, and mandates. Market makers focus on liquidity and short-term opportunities, while venture capital firms often pursue long-term investments. Foundations manage treasury assets for ecosystem development, creating natural variations in exchange flow behavior. Q4: How significant is $13.2 million in the context of overall Ethereum market volume? While substantial as an individual transaction, $13.2 million represents a small percentage of Ethereum’s daily trading volume, which typically measures in the billions. The significance lies more in behavioral signals and pattern recognition than direct market impact. Q5: What other data points should investors consider alongside exchange flows? Comprehensive analysis should include network fundamentals, developer activity, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and broader market sentiment. Exchange flows provide one valuable data point within a multifaceted analytical framework for cryptocurrency markets.

Following a volatile end to last year, price action has gradually improved, with buyers regaining control and forcing Bitcoin back into a range that had previously acted as resistance. While skepticism remains high and many analysts continue to warn of a broader corrective phase, recent derivatives and positioning data suggest that market behavior may be shifting beneath the surface. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTH SOPR Signals Early Capitulation, But Selling Pressure Remains Contained According to an analysis shared by Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s Positioning Index SMA-30d has climbed to 3.5, marking the first sustained breakout above the 3.0 level since October 6, 2025. That previous breakout occurred during the rally that ultimately carried BTC toward the $125,000 peak, making the current move particularly notable from a historical perspective. The positioning index reflects aggregated futures market dynamics, including open interest, funding behavior, and long-short activity, and is often used to identify regime changes in trader sentiment. This renewed strength in positioning does not guarantee immediate upside continuation, but it does indicate that futures traders are once again willing to take directional exposure after months of defensive positioning. As Bitcoin holds above $95K, the coming sessions will be critical in determining whether this move develops into a broader trend or remains a temporary relief rally. Futures Positioning Signals a Shift Toward a Bullish Regime According to Axel Adler Jr., the recent breakout of the Positioning Index SMA-30d above the 3.0 level marks an important local shift in Bitcoin’s futures market structure. After spending nearly three months oscillating within the 0 ± 2 range, this move signals that traders are transitioning from neutral or defensive positioning into a more directional stance. Adler notes that confirmation now depends on persistence rather than speed. The key continuation trigger is the SMA holding above the 2.0 level for at least one week, which would validate that the shift is not a short-lived reaction. This view is reinforced by developments in the Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index. While sentiment briefly peaked at 93.15% when BTC traded near $95,061, it has since cooled to roughly 70%. Importantly, this pullback has occurred without a breakdown in price structure. The index remains well above the neutral 50% threshold and above its 30-day average near 62.9%, indicating that bullish conditions still dominate the futures market. Adler interprets the roughly 23-percentage-point decline in sentiment as a healthy release of short-term overheating rather than a trend reversal. Historically, such resets often strengthen trend durability. Risk emerges if sentiment falls below 50% alongside a price drop under $92,000. Conversely, holding sentiment above 60% during short consolidation phases would support further upside continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Near A Profit Flip: A Key Level Comes Into Focus Bitcoin Price Action Details Bitcoin price action on the daily chart shows a clear attempt to regain control after a prolonged consolidation phase. Following the sharp November sell-off that pushed BTC into the low $80K region, price has gradually formed a higher-low structure, signaling stabilization rather than continued capitulation. The recent push above $95,000 marks the highest daily close since mid-November and places Bitcoin back above its short-term moving average, a level that had capped upside throughout December. However, the broader trend remains mixed. The 50-day moving average is still sloping downward and sits above the current price, acting as near-term dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the 200-day moving average continues to trend higher well below price, confirming that the broader market structure remains intact despite recent volatility. This positioning reflects a market transitioning from corrective pressure into a potential recovery phase, rather than a clean trend reversal. Related Reading: XRP Consolidates Above $2 As Volume Z-Score Signals A Quiet Market The recent advance toward $95K occurred without a significant volume spike, suggesting reduced selling pressure rather than aggressive new demand. This is consistent with a relief-driven move fueled by short covering and position rebalancing. For bulls, holding above the $93K–$95K range is critical to maintain momentum and build a base for continuation. Failure to consolidate above this zone would increase the risk of renewed range-bound trading or a pullback toward the $90K support area.

The BitMEX co-founder’s detailed analysis connects macroeconomic shifts with cryptocurrency market movements, providing investors with crucial insights for navigating volatile digital asset landscapes. His perspective emerges from decades of market experience and deep understanding of global financial systems. Bitcoin Rally Fundamentals: Understanding Liquidity Dynamics Arthur Hayes presents a compelling argument about Bitcoin’s price trajectory. He specifically attributes last year’s cryptocurrency stagnation to dollar liquidity contraction. Conversely, he predicts renewed momentum from current expansionary policies. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expansion provides concrete evidence supporting this analysis. Market data shows a clear correlation between liquidity measures and Bitcoin performance over multiple cycles. Historical patterns demonstrate that increased dollar liquidity typically precedes cryptocurrency appreciation. The quantitative easing periods following 2008 and 2020 crises produced substantial Bitcoin rallies. Current economic indicators suggest similar conditions may be developing. Treasury Department actions and Federal Reserve policies create the monetary environment Hayes references in his prediction. Comparative Asset Analysis: Gold, Nasdaq, and Cryptocurrency Performance Hayes provides nuanced comparisons between different asset classes under current economic conditions. Gold experienced remarkable strength despite broader market challenges. Central bank purchasing behavior explains much of this divergence. Following geopolitical developments, numerous nations diversified reserves away from traditional instruments. The Nasdaq Composite demonstrated resilience through artificial intelligence sector designation. Government prioritization of strategic technologies supported technology stocks. This policy-driven support created market conditions favoring specific equity segments. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency markets lacked similar institutional backing during the analyzed period. Asset Performance Comparison Under Current Economic Conditions Asset Class 2024 Performance Primary Driver Liquidity Sensitivity Gold Strong Central Bank Purchases Moderate Nasdaq Resilient AI Sector Support Low Bitcoin Stagnant Liquidity Contraction High U.S. Treasuries Variable Policy Shifts Very High Expert Market Perspective: Policy Impacts on Digital Assets Economic stimulus measures preceding election cycles create predictable market patterns. Historical data shows administrations frequently implement expansionary policies during these periods. The current administration’s approach aligns with established political-economic behavior. Federal Reserve actions complement fiscal measures through balance sheet management. Cryptocurrency markets respond particularly strongly to dollar liquidity changes. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it sensitive to monetary policy shifts. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrency lacks centralized support mechanisms. This characteristic creates both vulnerability and opportunity during policy transitions. Investment Strategy Insights: Hayes’ Personal Portfolio Moves The analyst reveals specific investment decisions based on his market analysis. He increased positions in Strategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet stocks. These companies maintain significant Bitcoin exposure through corporate treasury strategies. Their equity performance often amplifies Bitcoin price movements through leverage effects. Hayes identifies several key factors supporting these investment choices: Corporate Bitcoin adoption creates structural demand beyond retail speculation Regulatory developments increasingly favor institutional participation Market infrastructure improvements enhance accessibility and security Macroeconomic conditions support alternative asset allocation Additionally, Hayes views recent Zcash (ZEC) developer issues as a buying opportunity. He acknowledges the cryptocurrency’s technical challenges while recognizing its privacy-focused value proposition. This contrarian approach reflects his experience navigating cryptocurrency market cycles. Market Context: Historical Precedents and Current Indicators Previous liquidity expansion periods provide valuable context for current predictions. The 2017 cryptocurrency bull market coincided with global quantitative easing measures. Similarly, 2020-2021 market movements followed unprecedented monetary stimulus. Current economic indicators suggest potential repetition of these patterns. Several measurable factors support the liquidity expansion thesis: Federal Reserve balance sheet growth exceeding $200 billion quarterly Treasury Department debt issuance patterns indicating fiscal expansion Banking sector liquidity provisions increasing system-wide monetary base International dollar flows showing increased global liquidity distribution Risk Assessment: Potential Challenges to the Rally Thesis While Hayes presents a compelling bullish case, several factors could disrupt the predicted rally. Regulatory developments remain unpredictable across major jurisdictions. Technological challenges, including scalability and security concerns, persist within cryptocurrency ecosystems. Market sentiment shifts rapidly based on external economic developments. Investors should consider multiple scenarios when evaluating cryptocurrency allocations. Diversification across asset classes provides protection against thesis invalidation. Risk management strategies should account for cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility. Professional financial advice remains essential for individual investment decisions. Conclusion Arthur Hayes’ Bitcoin rally prediction rests on sophisticated analysis of liquidity dynamics and policy impacts. His perspective combines macroeconomic understanding with cryptocurrency market expertise. The potential connection between dollar liquidity expansion and digital asset appreciation warrants serious consideration from market participants. While predictions involve inherent uncertainty, Hayes’ track record and analytical framework provide valuable insights for navigating 2025 cryptocurrency markets. Investors should monitor liquidity indicators while maintaining balanced portfolio approaches appropriate to individual risk profiles. FAQs Q1: What specific policy changes does Arthur Hayes reference in his Bitcoin prediction? Hayes focuses on U.S. dollar liquidity expansion through Federal Reserve balance sheet growth and Treasury Department actions. He connects these monetary policy developments to potential cryptocurrency market impacts based on historical correlations. Q2: How does gold performance relate to Bitcoin’s potential rally? Hayes notes gold’s strong performance despite liquidity contraction, attributing it to central bank diversification. He suggests Bitcoin could follow a different trajectory as liquidity expands, potentially outperforming traditional safe-haven assets under specific conditions. Q3: What investment vehicles does Hayes recommend beyond direct Bitcoin exposure? The analyst mentions increasing positions in Strategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet stocks, which provide leveraged Bitcoin exposure through corporate holdings. He also views Zcash (ZEC) technical issues as a buying opportunity for the privacy-focused cryptocurrency. Q4: How reliable are liquidity-based cryptocurrency predictions? Historical data shows strong correlations between dollar liquidity measures and Bitcoin performance, though correlation doesn’t guarantee future outcomes. Multiple factors influence cryptocurrency markets, making comprehensive analysis essential for investment decisions. Q5: What time frame does Hayes suggest for the predicted Bitcoin rally? While specific timing remains uncertain, Hayes connects the potential rally to ongoing liquidity expansion throughout 2025. Market responses typically follow policy implementations with variable lag periods depending on multiple economic factors.

BVNK Will Power Visa Direct’s Stablecoin Infrastructure As announced in a Wednesday press release , BVNK and Visa have formed a strategic partnership to enable stablecoin payments on the latter’s Visa Direct platform. Based in the US, Visa is the second-largest card payment organization globally, behind only China’s UnionPay. In fact, when excluding China, the firm is the single largest, making up for 50% of total card payments. Lately, Visa has been exploring digital asset payments, particularly those involving stablecoins, in a bid to modernize money movement. In 2025, the payments giant ran multiple stablecoin pilots related to Visa Direct, its $1.7 trillion real-time global payouts platform. Now, it seems Visa has taken the next step by partnering with BVNK, a stablecoin infrastructure provider processing over $30 billion in payments annually. Mark Nelsen, Visa’s head of product, commercial, and money movement, said: Stablecoins are an exciting opportunity for global payments, with enormous potential to reduce friction and expand access to faster, more efficient payment options – including during weekends, holidays and when banks are closed. Starting with markets with strong demand for digital payments, BVNK will power a few different Visa Direct services, including stablecoin pre-funding and payouts. Visa’s new deal with BVNK hasn’t come out of the blue. Back in May 2025, Visa Ventures made an investment in the digital asset payments rail company. Jesse Hemson-Struthers, BVNK CEO, noted: Visa and BVNK both believe in the transformational potential of stablecoin technology, not just as a payment method, but as a powerful layer of payments infrastructure. Following the initial rollout, a broader global expansion of the service is planned, but so far, it’s unconfirmed which markets will be included, only that Visa will decide it based on “customer needs.” Stablecoins have witnessed growing adoption during the past year, as multiple countries have pushed on with legislation related to the sector. Among the most notable developments was the signing of the GENIUS Act by US President Donald Trump. According to a report from Bloomberg, total stablecoin transaction volume rose 72% to $33 trillion in 2025, a new record. Tether’s USDT is the largest fiat-tied cryptocurrency based on market cap, with a valuation that’s more than double Circle’s USDC, but the latter still dominated in transactions during 2025. USDC made up for $18.3 trillion of the total volume, while USDT accounted for $13.3 trillion. Together, the two tokens covered an extreme majority of the total volume last year, suggesting that activity related to other dollar-pegged tokens and non-USD stablecoins remained low.

57177640,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261730,1768453811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tokenization Breakthrough: GSN Pursues $200M Digital Transformation of Southeast Asian Water Infrastructure,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gsn-tokenization-southeast-asia-water/,"BitcoinWorld Tokenization Breakthrough: GSN Pursues $200M Digital Transformation of Southeast Asian Water Infrastructure In a landmark move for both infrastructure finance and blockchain adoption, the Global Settlement Network (GSN) has unveiled a pioneering initiative to tokenize water purification facilities across Southeast Asia, targeting a total value of $200 million. This ambitious project, announced in Jakarta, Indonesia, in early 2025, represents one of the most significant real-world asset (RWA) tokenization efforts in the region’s history, beginning with an initial $35 million phase involving eight government-contracted facilities. GSN’s Tokenization Strategy for Critical Infrastructure The Global Settlement Network plans to digitize ownership stakes in essential water infrastructure through blockchain-based tokens. Consequently, this approach aims to unlock new capital streams for public utilities. The initial pilot focuses on eight specific purification plants in Jakarta. Each facility will undergo a detailed valuation and legal structuring process. Following this, digital tokens representing fractional ownership or revenue rights will be issued on GSN’s proprietary blockchain infrastructure. This model offers several immediate advantages. Primarily, it enables broader investor participation in essential infrastructure projects. Traditionally, such investments required massive capital outlays. Now, tokenization allows for fractional ownership. Furthermore, blockchain technology provides transparent, immutable records of ownership and transactions. This transparency can build greater trust among investors and regulatory bodies alike. The Southeast Asian Context for Asset Tokenization Southeast Asia presents a unique and compelling landscape for infrastructure tokenization. The region faces a substantial infrastructure funding gap, estimated by the Asian Development Bank to exceed hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Simultaneously, Southeast Asia boasts a rapidly growing digital economy and high cryptocurrency adoption rates. Nations like Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines consistently rank high in global crypto adoption indexes. GSN’s project directly addresses this convergence of need and technological readiness. By targeting water facilities, the firm selects a critical, tangible asset class. Water security remains a paramount concern for governments across the archipelago. Therefore, modernizing this sector attracts both public and private interest. The tokenization of these assets could establish a blueprint for other essential sectors, including energy, transportation, and telecommunications. Expert Analysis on the Rupiah Stablecoin Pilot Integral to GSN’s 12-month roadmap is the pilot of a rupiah-based stablecoin payment system. This component addresses a major hurdle in crypto-based finance: volatility. A stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Indonesian rupiah would facilitate seamless transactions for dividend payments, token trades, and potentially even utility bill payments. Financial technology analysts view this as a strategic masterstroke. “A local currency stablecoin embedded within a regulated infrastructure project significantly de-risks the proposition for both regulators and institutional investors,” explains Dr. Anya Sharma, a fintech researcher at the Singapore Institute of Technology. “It demonstrates a commitment to operating within the existing monetary framework while leveraging blockchain’s efficiency. This dual approach of tokenizing a real asset and creating a compliant payment rail is what sets GSN’s proposal apart from more speculative crypto ventures.” Technical and Regulatory Framework Successful execution requires navigating complex technical and regulatory environments. GSN’s infrastructure must ensure enterprise-grade security, scalability, and interoperability with traditional finance systems. The firm has indicated its blockchain will utilize a permissioned or hybrid model, allowing for necessary oversight by Indonesian financial authorities, including Bank Indonesia and the Financial Services Authority (OJK). Key technical components include: Asset Registry: A digital ledger for recording the legal ownership and characteristics of each tokenized facility. Compliance Layer: Embedded tools for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks on all participants. Oracle Network: Secure data feeds to provide real-world performance data (e.g., water output, revenue) to the blockchain. Stablecoin Issuance: A fully collateralized and audited system for minting and redeeming the rupiah stablecoin. Regulatory engagement will be continuous. The project’s initial phase involves government-contracted facilities, implying a degree of official cooperation. Observers note that a successful pilot could inform broader national policy on digital assets and infrastructure investment. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The implications of GSN’s project extend far beyond its $200 million target. Firstly, it provides a test case for tokenizing illiquid, real-world assets at scale. Success could catalyze a wave of similar projects across emerging markets. Secondly, it bridges the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional project finance, potentially attracting a new class of institutional capital to the crypto ecosystem. Comparative Table: Traditional vs. Tokenized Infrastructure Finance Aspect Traditional Model Tokenized Model (GSN) Investor Access Limited to large institutions, banks, funds Open to accredited and potentially retail investors Liquidity Low; assets are held long-term, difficult to sell Potentially higher via secondary trading on digital exchanges Settlement Time Days or weeks for transactions and dividends Near-instantaneous on the blockchain Transparency Opaque; limited reporting to investors High; real-time data and immutable transaction history Minimum Investment Often millions of dollars Could be fractionally small Moreover, the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) angle is significant. Direct investment into water purification directly contributes to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation). Blockchain’s transparency can also ensure that capital flows and impacts are easily tracked and reported, appealing to the growing cohort of impact investors. Conclusion The Global Settlement Network’s pursuit of a $200 million tokenization initiative for Southeast Asian water facilities marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of blockchain technology and real-world infrastructure. By starting with a tangible, critical asset class in Jakarta and integrating a local currency stablecoin, GSN is constructing a model that emphasizes utility, compliance, and sustainability. This project’s progress throughout 2025 will be closely watched as a bellwether for the future of asset tokenization, potentially unlocking vast pools of capital for essential development while bringing unprecedented transparency and efficiency to infrastructure finance. FAQs Q1: What does ‘tokenization’ mean in this context? A1: Tokenization refers to the process of converting ownership rights to a physical asset—in this case, water purification facilities—into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents a fractional share of the asset or its revenue stream, making investment more accessible and liquid. Q2: Why start with water facilities in Southeast Asia? A2: Southeast Asia has a critical need for infrastructure investment, particularly in water security. The region also has high crypto adoption rates, creating a receptive environment. Water facilities are essential, revenue-generating assets, making them a stable and impactful starting point for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Q3: What is the purpose of the rupiah stablecoin? A3: The planned rupiah-based stablecoin will act as a compliant digital payment rail within the ecosystem. It will allow for efficient distribution of dividends, easy trading of tokens, and lower transaction costs without exposing participants to the price volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies. Q4: How will this project be regulated? A4: GSN is engaging with Indonesian financial regulators like Bank Indonesia and the OJK. The use of government-contracted facilities suggests operational cooperation. The blockchain is expected to be a permissioned or hybrid model with built-in KYC/AML checks to ensure full regulatory compliance. Q5: What are the main risks associated with this tokenization project? A5: Key risks include regulatory changes, technological challenges in scaling the blockchain, cybersecurity threats, and market acceptance. The success of the pilot phase will be crucial in mitigating these risks by demonstrating security, utility, and regulatory alignment.

Against a backdrop of relatively modest market-wide gains, several sector-specific assets listed on HTX posted notable weekly advances between January 5 and January 11, led by the BSC-based Chinese memecoin project Binance Life and the privacy-focused protocol ZKP. Global leading exchange HTX once again demonstrated its explosive potential for listing assets in their early stages by identifying strong narratives early. DeFi and Privacy Take the Lead: FXS Rebounds Strongly as ZKP Drives Narrative Expansion This week, privacy and DeFi infrastructure emerged as the strongest-performing sectors. Privacy tokens ZKP and XMR advanced in tandem, as the narrative around financial privacy continued to gain momentum, making it one of the few segments showing a clear directional trend. FXS (Frax Finance) : +110%, topping the weekly leaderboard. Frax Finance is a DeFi protocol offering three core products, FRAX, FPI, and frxETH, designed for yield generation, liquidity provision, and staking within the DeFi ecosystem. ZKP (zkPass) : +90%. As a leading project in the privacy computing space, zkPass leverages the zero-knowledge proof technology to address identity verification challenges in Web3. HTX’s early listing enabled users to fully capture the inflection point as the privacy narrative shifted from stagnation to renewed growth. XMR (Monero) : +36%. As a long-established privacy asset, XMP’s steady appreciation reinforces the market’s renewed focus on financial privacy. Capital flows are shifting from isolated speculation toward sector-wide revaluation. BSC-Based Chinese Memecoins: Binance Life Breaks Out and Early Positioning Pays Off Within the memecoin segment, Binance Life emerged as the clear standout this week. As activity on the BSC ecosystem recovered and Chinese-language meme narratives gained traction, capital increasingly flowed toward assets with early community recognition and strong cultural resonance. Notably, HTX was among the first platforms to list and support Binance Life, identifying its viral potential and providing liquidity at an early stage. Binance Life : +63%. Unlike traditional animal-themed memecoins, Binance Life, deeply rooted in the Chinese crypto community culture, originated from shared experiences around life in the crypto industry. The token has a strong community cohesion in the BSC ecosystem. Building on this momentum, HTX has initially launched several popular Chinese memecoins on BSC, including “ 我踏马来了（(Wo Ta Ma Lai Le)） “, “ 人生K线（Ren Sheng K Xian） “, and “ 老子（Lao Zi） “. The platform has also introduced isolated-margin trading for select pairs, 我踏马来了/USDT (10X) and 老子/USDT (10X), further strengthening support for the narratives in the BSC ecosystem. To reward community participation, HTX has simultaneously rolled out a Chinese Asset campaign , running through January 19, with a total prize pool of up to $200,000. Moreover, B (BUILDon) gained 28%, further confirming structural opportunities within the BSC memecoin sector. Meanwhile, Solana-based memecoins remained active, with CHILLGUY (Just a Chill Guy) rising 33%. These assets offer HTX users diversified exposure across ecosystems. AI Sector: Narrative Persists as Capital Becomes More Selective The AI sector could remain one of the defining long-term narratives for 2026. This week, AI-related assets continued a consolidation-driven recovery, with speculative fervor cooling and capital increasingly favoring projects featuring clearer positioning and real-world applicability. ARC (AI Rig Complex) : +42%. Positioned as an “AI + Memecoin” hybrid within the Solana ecosystem, ARC attracted attention through its cross-narrative appeal. The project is a basic AI infrastructure built on RIG, a Rust-based LLM framework designed for AI agent development. AIC (AI Companions) : +53%. AI Companions aims to integrate AI, VR/AR, and blockchain technologies to create personalized digital companions, offering immersive virtual interaction experiences. RENDER (Render Token) : +23%. Render is a relatively mature AI infrastructure project, with its token demonstrating more stable price movement. The protocol operates as a decentralized GPU rendering network built on Ethereum. Initial Listings Become a Source of Return “Certainty” in Volatile Markets Looking ahead, HTX will continue to rely on forward-looking, multi-sector trend analysis to identify and support high-potential assets. As market structure evolves, the value of early positioning is once again being validated.

This compelling contrarian signal emerges as Bitcoin demonstrates notable price resilience despite a surge in negative social media sentiment, presenting a classic case where crowd psychology may precede a significant market reversal. Santiment’s data-driven observation underscores a fundamental principle in digital asset markets: prices often move opposite to prevailing retail sentiment at key inflection points. Santiment Analysis Reveals Bitcoin FUD at Peak Levels Santiment, a prominent blockchain intelligence platform, identified the most intense wave of Bitcoin-related pessimism across social platforms in the past ten days. The firm made this assessment public via a detailed post on the social media platform X. Interestingly, this surge in negative sentiment occurred concurrently with a measurable rebound in Bitcoin’s market price, creating a notable divergence between perception and price action. Santiment’s analytical framework specializes in quantifying social sentiment and correlating it with on-chain behavioral metrics. Historically, the firm has documented that cryptocurrency markets frequently move contrary to the dominant mood of retail investors. This phenomenon is not unique to crypto; it echoes established behavioral finance principles observed in traditional markets. When fear peaks and becomes overwhelmingly consensus, it often indicates that potential sellers have largely exited the market, reducing downward pressure and setting the stage for a rally fueled by surprise and short covering. Contrarian Indicator: Extreme social media FUD often signals a local price bottom. Data Source: Santiment aggregates sentiment from hundreds of crypto-focused forums, news outlets, and social channels. Recent Context: The current FUD spike is the most pronounced in over a week, according to the firm’s metrics. The Mechanics of Market Sentiment and Price Discovery Understanding why pessimism can precede a rally requires examining market microstructure. When negative sentiment becomes extreme, several mechanical and psychological factors converge. Firstly, traders holding leveraged long positions may be forced to sell (liquidated) during fear-driven dips, flushing out weak hands. Subsequently, this selling pressure exhausts itself. Secondly, large-scale investors, often called “whales” or “smart money,” may accumulate assets when retail sentiment is bleak, anticipating a future reversal. Santiment’s tools track not just sentiment but also on-chain movements between wallets, exchange inflows and outflows, and holding patterns of different investor cohorts. This multi-dimensional analysis provides a more robust picture than price alone. For instance, if social FUD is high but large wallets are moving Bitcoin off exchanges (a sign of accumulation for long-term holding), the contrarian bullish case strengthens significantly. The firm’s suggestion of a $100,000 target is implicitly tied to these underlying behavioral and on-chain data points, not merely sentiment in isolation. Key Market Sentiment Scenarios and Typical Outcomes Sentiment Condition Typical Retail Behavior Common Price Trajectory Extreme FUD (Fear) Panic selling, capitulation Potential local bottom, followed by rebound Extreme Greed FOMO buying, leverage buildup Potential local top, risk of correction Neutral/Apathetic Low trading volume, indecision Consolidation, awaiting a catalyst Expert Perspective on Contrarian Signals Market analysts frequently reference the “Crypto Fear and Greed Index,” a similar sentiment gauge, which has historically proven effective at identifying extremes. Santiment’s analysis adds a deeper, data-rich layer by incorporating specific social media mentions and on-chain activity. The prediction for Bitcoin to reclaim $100,000 connects this sentiment extreme to a broader macro narrative for the asset, including the sustained institutional adoption via spot Bitcoin ETFs, the recent Bitcoin halving event’s supply shock, and evolving regulatory clarity in major economies. The $100,000 level itself is a significant psychological and technical benchmark that was briefly approached in late 2023 before a market pullback. Historical Precedents and the Path to $100,000 Bitcoin’s journey has been punctuated by repeated cycles of euphoria and despair. Previous instances of peak FUD, such as during the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 or the FTX collapse fallout in late 2022, were subsequently followed by powerful, sustained recoveries. The current sentiment pattern fits this historical mold. Reaching $100,000 would represent an approximate 50% increase from price levels observed during the sentiment data collection period, a move that is substantial but not unprecedented in Bitcoin’s volatile history. The necessary catalysts for such a move would likely extend beyond sentiment alone. They would include continued positive net flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, a stabilizing macroeconomic environment for risk assets, and no major negative regulatory developments. Santiment’s analysis provides the sentiment piece of the puzzle, suggesting the crowd is positioned on the wrong side of the trade. If traditional buy-the-dip and contrarian investment theses hold, the capital waiting on the sidelines could flood back in once a clear upward trend is re-established, creating a self-reinforcing cycle toward higher price targets. Conclusion Santiment’s identification of extreme Bitcoin FUD presents a compelling, data-backed contrarian case for a significant price appreciation, with a specific target of $100,000. This analysis hinges on the well-documented market principle that prices often reverse when sentiment reaches an extreme. While sentiment is just one factor in a complex market, its current divergence from price action, as highlighted by Santiment, offers a noteworthy signal for investors and analysts. The coming weeks will test this thesis, as Bitcoin attempts to transform widespread doubt into a remarkable rebound, potentially etching a new chapter in its volatile history. FAQs Q1: What does FUD mean in cryptocurrency? A1: FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. It describes the spread of negative, often misleading, information that can cause investors to sell assets based on emotion rather than fact. Q2: How does Santiment measure Bitcoin sentiment? A2: Santiment uses natural language processing and AI to analyze millions of social media posts, news articles, and forum discussions across platforms. It quantifies the positive and negative context of mentions related to Bitcoin and other assets. Q3: Is extreme FUD always a reliable buy signal for Bitcoin? A3: While a powerful historical indicator, extreme FUD is not a guaranteed timing tool. It should be used in conjunction with other analyses like on-chain data, technical patterns, and macroeconomic factors to assess overall market health. Q4: When did Bitcoin last trade near $100,000? A4: Bitcoin approached but did not conclusively break the $100,000 level. Its all-time high, as of this analysis, remains approximately $73,800, reached in March 2024. The $100,000 mark is a widely watched future psychological and technical resistance level. Q5: What other tools do analysts use alongside sentiment data? A5: Analysts typically combine sentiment data with on-chain metrics (exchange flows, wallet activity), technical analysis (chart patterns, moving averages), and fundamental developments (regulatory news, ETF flows, protocol upgrades) for a comprehensive market view.

Concerning the president’s order released on Wednesday, January 14, sources close to the situation, who wished to maintain anonymity due to the confidential nature of the matter, noted that the government was instructed to tax the chips immediately upon arrival in the US before being sent to clients based in China and other nations. Trump participates in the Nvidia-China deal, with the imposition of a 25% tariff Nvidia, which designs the H200 processor, depends on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for its production and received approval from the Trump administration in December to sell the chip to China. Speaking at a signing event on Wednesday, President Trump said the 25% tariff was “not the highest level, but a very good level,” adding that strong demand from China and other markets would allow the US to capture a share of the sales. Trump has delayed tariffs on a broader range of imported chips after a Section 232 investigation found they could pose national security risks. In his proclamation, he directed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to negotiate import agreements and report back within 90 days, while a White House fact sheet signaled that new tariff rates and incentives for domestic chip manufacturing could be announced soon. At this point, a White House fact sheet was released, hinting at the possibility of Trump adopting new tariff rates and a program to foster domestic manufacturing very soon. On the other hand, Trump admitted in the proclamation that, “The 25% tariff affects a very specific group of semiconductors that are crucial to my administration’s AI and technology plans.” Following his statement, the fact sheet highlighted that this group consists of the H2 00 and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s MI325X. However, analysts conducted research and discovered that Trump had granted an exemption for chips imported to support the development of the country’s technology supply chain. Negotiations between Taiwan and leading tech firms hit up Trump’s recent move in the tech ecosystem comes a day after reports revealed that the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security eased its established regulations for issuing licenses to export H200 chips to China. Following this news update, analysts weighed in on the situation. They alleged that Trump demanded an extra fee in return for permitting Nvidia to export its products to China. Nonetheless, sources mentioned that the US is still required to implement further action before the tech giant can effectively send the chips to the Asian country. Some of these efforts include securing export permits from BIS. This approval process is expected to take weeks or even months. Surprisingly, it is unclear when this process will be completed. Currently, goods produced in Taiwan are subject to a 20% tariff, imposed in August last year, when imported to the United States. For semiconductors, they are exempt from this tariff rate as Commerce officials investigate some of the national security concerns raised, which demand an answer on whether newly imposed tariff rates should be applied throughout the chip industry. So far, the president has delayed the imposition of tariffs as negotiations between Taiwan and leading tech firms have stalled.

In contrast, real-world asset-focused blockchain Mantra is facing a deeper reckoning after announcing job cuts and a strategic restructuring after its OM token collapsed sharply from early 2025 highs. Sui Network Restored After Outage The layer-1 Sui blockchain has returned to normal operations after a nearly six-hour network outage temporarily halted transactions and disrupted activity across the network. The interruption was attributed to a consensus-related issue. It effectively froze more than $1 billion in value on-chain and left users unable to transact during the downtime. The Sui Foundation confirmed the outage on Wednesday afternoon by informing its followers on X that core developers were actively working to diagnose and resolve the issue. According to the foundation, the problem was first identified at 2:52 pm UTC, and public confirmation followed shortly after at 3:24 pm UTC. Network functionality was fully restored at 8:44 pm UTC, bringing the total downtime to approximately five hours and 52 minutes. After service resumed , the foundation said transactions were once again flowing normally and advised users still encountering problems to refresh their applications or browser sessions. However, the organization has not yet provided a detailed explanation of what caused the consensus failure, leaving some questions unanswered around the technical root of the disruption and whether more safeguards will be introduced. This incident is the second major outage for Sui since the network launched in May of 2023. The blockchain previously experienced a big disruption in November of 2024. While outages are not uncommon in early-stage blockchain ecosystems, repeated incidents can test user confidence, particularly as decentralized finance and on-chain applications grow more capital-intensive. Comparisons quickly emerged with Solana, another high-throughput blockchain that has faced its own history of network outages. However, Solana has not experienced a full network halt in the past 18 months, after a series of improvements to validator coordination and emergency response mechanisms. As recently as last week, the Solana Status X account urged validators to upgrade to a new release containing critical patches. Despite the operational disruption, market reaction to the outage was quite muted. Sui’s native token, SUI , briefly jumped about 4% after confirmation of the incident before retracing its gains and stabilizing close to previous levels. However, at press time, SUI was down by more than 4% to trade hands at $1.78. SUI’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex) Mantra Restructures After Brutal Year While the Sui Foundation was able to quickly recover after the outage, other projects are not as lucky with regards to their own setbacks. Mantra, a blockchain project focused on real-world assets, is restructuring its operations after a year its leadership described as the most challenging in the company’s history, following a sharp collapse in its native token and sustained market pressure. In a statement that was shared on Wednesday, John Patrick Mullin, the CEO of Mantra, announced that the company will shift to a leaner and more capital-efficient structure. The changes include job cuts across multiple teams and a streamlining of operations after a period of expansion. Mullin said the decision followed deep internal reflection and acknowledged the personal impact on employees affected by the downsizing. Mullin took responsibility for the path that led to the restructuring, and described the situation as difficult for staff and their families. He explained however, that the move was not solely about cutting costs, but rather part of a strategic reset aimed at improving execution and aligning resources with what Mantra sees as its strongest long-term opportunities. According to Mullin, Mantra is doubling down on its foundational priorities, including its layer-1 blockchain, mantraUSD, and Mantra Finance. He said the company believes these areas offer the clearest path forward despite the ongoing volatility in the wider crypto market, and that the restructuring is intended to sharpen focus rather than retreat from ambition. The operational changes follow a dramatic decline in Mantra’s OM token, which began earlier last year. Data from CoinCodex shows that OM reached an all-time high of $9.01 in late February 2025 before plunging to $0.59 by mid-April. The token is still roughly 90% below its pre-collapse peak. OM price action over the past year (Source: CoinCodex) Mantra previously attributed the crash to aggressive leverage policies on centralized exchanges, and warned that forced liquidations and cascading margin calls can create systemic risks for crypto projects. At the time, Mullin argued that the issue extended beyond Mantra itself and called on exchanges to rethink how leverage is applied to native tokens. In response to the crash, the project introduced several governance and transparency initiatives, including efforts to further decentralize validators, the rollout of a real-time tokenomics dashboard, and the burning of 150 million staked OM tokens to reduce supply. Despite these steps, the prolonged market slump continued to strain Mantra’s finances.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SUI|OM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-15 05:30:00

Against a backdrop of relatively modest market-wide gains, several sector-specific assets listed on HTX posted notable weekly advances between January 5 and January 11, led by the BSC-based Chinese memecoin project Binance Life and the privacy-focused protocol ZKP. Global leading exchange HTX once again demonstrated its explosive potential for listing assets in their early stages by identifying strong narratives early. DeFi and Privacy Take the Lead: FXS Rebounds Strongly as ZKP Drives Narrative Expansion This week, privacy and DeFi infrastructure emerged as the strongest-performing sectors. Privacy tokens ZKP and XMR advanced in tandem, as the narrative around financial privacy continued to gain momentum, making it one of the few segments showing a clear directional trend. ● FXS (Frax Finance) : +110%, topping the weekly leaderboard. Frax Finance is a DeFi protocol offering three core products, FRAX, FPI, and frxETH, designed for yield generation, liquidity provision, and staking within the DeFi ecosystem. ● ZKP (zkPass) : +90%. As a leading project in the privacy computing space, zkPass leverages the zero-knowledge proof technology to address identity verification challenges in Web3. HTX’s early listing enabled users to fully capture the inflection point as the privacy narrative shifted from stagnation to renewed growth. ● XMR (Monero) : +36%. As a long-established privacy asset, XMP’s steady appreciation reinforces the market’s renewed focus on financial privacy. Capital flows are shifting from isolated speculation toward sector-wide revaluation. BSC-Based Chinese Memecoins: Binance Life Breaks Out and Early Positioning Pays Off Within the memecoin segment, Binance Life emerged as the clear standout this week. As activity on the BSC ecosystem recovered and Chinese-language meme narratives gained traction, capital increasingly flowed toward assets with early community recognition and strong cultural resonance. Notably, HTX was among the first platforms to list and support Binance Life, identifying its viral potential and providing liquidity at an early stage. ● Binance Life : +63%. Unlike traditional animal-themed memecoins, Binance Life, deeply rooted in the Chinese crypto community culture, originated from shared experiences around life in the crypto industry. The token has a strong community cohesion in the BSC ecosystem. Building on this momentum, HTX has initially launched several popular Chinese memecoins on BSC, including “ 我踏马来了（(Wo Ta Ma Lai Le)） “, “ 人生K线（Ren Sheng K Xian） “, and “ 老子（Lao Zi） “. The platform has also introduced isolated-margin trading for select pairs, 我踏马来了/USDT (10X) and 老子/USDT (10X), further strengthening support for the narratives in the BSC ecosystem. To reward community participation, HTX has simultaneously rolled out a Chinese Asset campaign , running through January 19, with a total prize pool of up to $200,000. Moreover, B (BUILDon) gained 28%, further confirming structural opportunities within the BSC memecoin sector. Meanwhile, Solana-based memecoins remained active, with CHILLGUY (Just a Chill Guy) rising 33%. These assets offer HTX users diversified exposure across ecosystems. AI Sector: Narrative Persists as Capital Becomes More Selective The AI sector could remain one of the defining long-term narratives for 2026. This week, AI-related assets continued a consolidation-driven recovery, with speculative fervor cooling and capital increasingly favoring projects featuring clearer positioning and real-world applicability. ● ARC (AI Rig Complex) : +42%. Positioned as an “AI + Memecoin” hybrid within the Solana ecosystem, ARC attracted attention through its cross-narrative appeal. The project is a basic AI infrastructure built on RIG, a Rust-based LLM framework designed for AI agent development. ● AIC (AI Companions) : +53%. AI Companions aims to integrate AI, VR/AR, and blockchain technologies to create personalized digital companions, offering immersive virtual interaction experiences. ● RENDER (Render Token) : +23%. Render is a relatively mature AI infrastructure project, with its token demonstrating more stable price movement. The protocol operates as a decentralized GPU rendering network built on Ethereum. Initial Listings Become a Source of Return “Certainty” in Volatile Markets Looking ahead, HTX will continue to rely on forward-looking, multi-sector trend analysis to identify and support high-potential assets. As market structure evolves, the value of early positioning is once again being validated.

This innovative financial product, confirmed through industry reports from Wu Blockchain, represents Argentina’s first BTC-backed credit card solution. Consequently, it enables users to leverage their long-term Bitcoin investments for everyday transactions without traditional banking infrastructure. The launch arrives during a period of profound financial transformation within Argentina’s economy. Lemon’s BTC-Backed Visa Card: Technical Mechanics and Market Context Lemon’s newly launched card operates on a collateralized debt position model, similar to mechanisms in decentralized finance. Users allocate Bitcoin from their Lemon exchange wallets as collateral. Subsequently, the platform extends a credit line in Argentine pesos based on the BTC’s value. This process occurs without selling the underlying Bitcoin. Therefore, users maintain their cryptocurrency exposure while accessing liquid funds. The card integrates directly with Argentina’s extensive Visa payment network. As a result, it functions at millions of merchants nationwide. This development addresses specific pain points within Argentina’s financial ecosystem. Notably, the country has experienced persistent inflation exceeding 100% annually in recent years. Many Argentinians have turned to Bitcoin as a store of value. However, converting crypto to cash often involved complex processes. Lemon’s solution bridges this gap effectively. The exchange reports that approval requires no traditional credit checks. Instead, the system relies on the collateralized Bitcoin’s value and account history. Argentina’s Cryptocurrency Landscape and Regulatory Environment Argentina represents one of Latin America’s most active cryptocurrency markets. Chainalysis’ 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index ranked Argentina among the top 15 nations worldwide. This adoption stems from several economic factors. First, currency devaluation has eroded purchasing power. Second, capital controls limit access to foreign currencies. Third, a large unbanked population seeks financial alternatives. The government has taken measured steps toward crypto regulation. For instance, the National Securities Commission (CNV) now registers crypto service providers. However, comprehensive legislation remains under development. Lemon operates within this evolving regulatory framework. The exchange obtained necessary approvals from Argentina’s central bank. Furthermore, it partnered with established financial institutions for card issuance. This compliance distinguishes Lemon from purely decentralized offerings. Industry analysts note that regulatory alignment may encourage wider adoption. Meanwhile, traditional banks observe these developments closely. Several major Argentine banks have begun exploring digital asset services themselves. Comparative Analysis: BTC-Backed Cards in Global Markets Lemon’s product enters a growing global market for cryptocurrency payment cards. However, its collateralized credit model differs significantly from most offerings. The table below illustrates key distinctions: Provider Country Model Bank Account Required Lemon Argentina BTC-collateralized credit No Coinbase Card United States/Europe Direct crypto debit Yes Crypto.com Global Prepaid debit with rewards Yes Block (formerly Square) United States Traditional banking integration Yes This comparison reveals Lemon’s unique positioning. Unlike debit models that spend crypto directly, Lemon’s credit approach preserves Bitcoin holdings. Additionally, the absence of bank account requirements expands accessibility. This feature proves particularly valuable in Argentina. According to World Bank data, approximately 50% of Argentine adults lack full banking access. Lemon potentially serves this substantial market segment. Technical Implementation and Security Protocols Lemon employs multiple security layers for its BTC-backed Visa card. The exchange uses cold storage for the majority of collateralized Bitcoin. Only a small percentage remains in hot wallets for liquidity. All transactions undergo real-time monitoring for suspicious activity. Furthermore, the platform implements multi-signature authorization for significant movements. Users receive immediate notifications for all card transactions. They can also freeze cards instantly through Lemon’s mobile application. The technical architecture connects several systems seamlessly. Lemon’s exchange platform communicates with banking partners through encrypted APIs. Simultaneously, it maintains constant valuation of collateralized Bitcoin. If BTC prices decline significantly, the system issues margin calls. Users must then add more collateral or reduce their credit balance. This mechanism protects against undercollateralization. Industry experts consider this approach prudent given cryptocurrency volatility. Economic Implications for Argentine Users and Businesses Lemon’s BTC-backed Visa card carries substantial economic implications. For individual users, it creates new financial possibilities. Argentinians can now access credit without traditional banking relationships. Moreover, they can utilize Bitcoin’s value without triggering taxable events. This aspect proves crucial under Argentina’s complex tax regulations. The card also facilitates everyday transactions during banking disruptions. Argentina has experienced periodic bank strikes and limitations. For merchants, acceptance remains straightforward. The card functions identically to any Visa credit card. Consequently, businesses receive Argentine pesos without cryptocurrency exposure. This simplicity encourages wider merchant adoption. Additionally, transaction volumes may increase as more users access credit. Small businesses particularly benefit from expanded customer purchasing power. The Argentine Chamber of Commerce has noted growing interest in cryptocurrency payment solutions. Macroeconomic effects warrant observation as well. Increased Bitcoin collateralization could influence local cryptocurrency liquidity. Some analysts suggest reduced selling pressure during market downturns. Users might prefer collateralizing rather than selling Bitcoin. This behavior could potentially stabilize local Bitcoin markets. However, substantial data remains necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Central bank officials monitor these developments for monetary policy considerations. User Experience and Adoption Metrics Early user reports describe straightforward onboarding processes. Prospective users download Lemon’s application, complete identity verification, then transfer Bitcoin to designated collateral wallets. Credit limits typically range from 50% to 70% of collateral value. This conservative ratio accounts for Bitcoin’s volatility. Users report transaction approval within seconds at retail locations. The card also supports online purchases and international transactions. Lemon has not disclosed specific adoption numbers yet. However, industry observers note strong initial interest. Waiting lists formed within hours of the announcement. The exchange plans gradual rollout to manage operational capacity. Priority access goes to existing Lemon users with verified accounts. New user registrations increased significantly following the announcement. This response suggests substantial market demand for such products. Future Developments and Industry Trajectory The launch likely signals broader industry movements. Several Argentine fintech companies reportedly explore similar products. International providers may also enter the market. Regulatory developments will shape this expansion. Argentina’s congress considers comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation. Proposed bills address consumer protection and financial stability. Industry participants generally welcome clear regulatory frameworks. Technological advancements may enhance future offerings. Integration with layer-2 Bitcoin solutions could reduce transaction costs. Smart contract automation might improve collateral management. Additionally, multi-asset collateralization could emerge. Users might eventually pledge various cryptocurrencies. Lemon’s leadership indicates ongoing product development. The exchange researches additional financial services leveraging cryptocurrency collateral. Global implications deserve attention as well. Other inflation-affected economies may observe Argentina’s experience. Countries like Turkey and Venezuela face similar economic challenges. Successful implementation could inspire comparable solutions elsewhere. International financial institutions study these developments too. The World Bank and IMF monitor cryptocurrency integration in emerging economies. Conclusion Lemon’s BTC-backed Visa credit card represents a landmark innovation in Argentina’s financial technology landscape. This product successfully bridges cryptocurrency holdings with everyday economic activity. It addresses specific needs within Argentina’s unique economic context. The collateralized credit model preserves Bitcoin exposure while providing peso liquidity. Furthermore, it expands financial access beyond traditional banking systems. Regulatory compliance and security measures appear robust in initial assessments. The launch reflects broader cryptocurrency integration into mainstream finance. Consequently, it may influence similar developments across Latin America and other emerging markets. As adoption progresses, monitoring economic impacts and user experiences will prove valuable. This BTC-backed Visa card could potentially reshape how Argentinians interact with both traditional and digital finance. FAQs Q1: How does Lemon’s BTC-backed Visa card actually work? The card operates using Bitcoin as collateral. Users lock Bitcoin in their Lemon account, then receive a credit line in Argentine pesos based on that collateral’s value. They can spend this credit anywhere Visa is accepted without selling their Bitcoin. Q2: What happens if Bitcoin’s price drops significantly while I’m using the card? Lemon’s system monitors collateral values continuously. If your Bitcoin value declines too much relative to your credit balance, you’ll receive a margin call. You must then add more Bitcoin collateral or repay part of your balance to maintain the required collateral ratio. Q3: Do I need a traditional bank account to get Lemon’s BTC-backed Visa card? No, that’s one of the product’s key innovations. The card requires only a Lemon cryptocurrency account with verified identity and sufficient Bitcoin collateral. No traditional banking relationship is necessary. Q4: How does this differ from other cryptocurrency debit cards available globally? Most crypto cards are debit cards that spend your cryptocurrency directly. Lemon’s is a credit card that uses Bitcoin as collateral without selling it. This means you maintain exposure to potential Bitcoin price appreciation while accessing credit. Q5: Is this BTC-backed Visa card available to foreigners living in Argentina? Currently, the card requires Argentine tax identification (CUIL/CUIT) and local address verification. Lemon may expand to foreign residents in future phases, but initial rollout focuses on Argentine citizens and residents with proper documentation.

This of course is part of Xi Jinping’s mission to support state-backed chipmakers over American ones since Trump started a tech and trade war no one wanted. Demand for Nvidia inside China is still high, especially from large platforms that rely on heavy computing power to run AI models at scale. Chinese companies have placed orders for more than two million H200 chips, each priced at roughly $27,000. That figure far exceeds available supply. Nvidia is estimated to have around 700,000 units in inventory, creating a large gap between orders and deliverable stock. Earlier, the U.S. government confirmed it will allow sales of H200 AI computing chips into China, reopening the door for limited exports after months of uncertainty. Chinese regulators, however, are not leaving this unchecked. The draft rules are designed to cap volumes instead of blocking sales outright, giving Beijing tighter control over how foreign hardware is used inside the country. Beijing prepares quotas and approval process for H200 imports Nikkei claims that Jinping is creating a system that will regulate the total number of high-end AI chips Chinese firms can purchase. Initial approvals for specific H200 quantities could arrive before the end of the month. Companies will not receive automatic clearance, as each buyer must explain why the chips are needed and why local alternatives cannot handle the same workload. Government agencies have held repeated meetings with leading technology firms to review current use of foreign chips. Officials have focused heavily on inferencing workloads, which involve running trained AI models rather than building them. Reportedly, the process is also looking at purchase ratios. Under this approach, companies may face limits on how many foreign AI chips they can buy compared to domestic ones. This framework is still being finalized. At the same time, officials have begun asking companies about expected demand for Nvidia Blackwell chips, even though those products have not been approved by Washington for export. The policy effort has already caused confusion on the ground. Chinese customs authorities told agents this week that Nvidia H200 chips are not permitted to enter the country. That guidance conflicted with other signals coming from Beijing. Separately, some tech firms were informed that approvals would only be granted under special conditions, mainly for research and development projects tied to universities. Allowing renewed access to the Chinese market will generate revenue of up to $50 billion for Nvidia and for the U.S. government, which plans to collect a 25% fee on chip sales. David Sacks, the White House AI czar, had earlier said :- “The question of what we sell China will always be complicated, and there’s room for a wide range of opinions on that. But the question of whether we sell to the rest of the world, especially our friends and allies, should be an easy one. The hawkish position with respect to China is to help American companies win the AI race, not to help Huawei create a Digital Silk Road.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Regulation|Nvidia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|RESEARCH|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-15 05:31:30

After months of consolidation, SHIB price action is flashing early bullish signals. Some believe a 3x rally is back on the table. Others argue capital is rotating toward utility-driven alternatives. This analysis breaks down Shiba Inu price prediction scenarios and explores where smarter risk-adjusted opportunities may now exist for investors today. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Tests Resistance Near Critical Levels The focus is now on Shiba Inu, with traders arguing whether the meme coin has any substantial upside left. According to the latest SHIB news, the token is holding above the vital support levels. The technical indicators are also turning cautiously bullish. Can Shiba Inu price prediction models support a 3x rally or is capital better deployed elsewhere as market conditions evolve? SHIB price today trades around the $0.000087 region after reclaiming levels above $0.0000810. This move followed a bullish crossover where the 23-day moving average pushed above the 50-day average. This is typically a signal traders associate with early trend shifts. Similar setups in late 2024 preceded sharp upside moves. This has kept optimism alive for possible short-term momentum. From a technical perspective , Shiba Inu price now faces a major test near $0.0000900. A clean break above this level could open a path toward the 200-day EMA near $0.0001054. Failure to clear resistance, however, risks another pullback into consolidation. For now, SHIB price prediction scenarios remain bullish only while price holds above the $0.0000810 support band. Supply dynamics add another layer. Recent Shiba Inu news highlights that roughly 289 trillion SHIB sit off exchanges, reducing immediate sell pressure. With large holders controlling liquidity, even modest demand could amplify price moves. That said, SHIB still relies heavily on sentiment and volume, making sustained rallies harder without broader market strength. Why Remittix Is Attracting Investors Tired Of Meme Cycles While traders debate if a Shiba Inu price prediction can realistically support a clean 3x move, a growing group of analysts believe the smarter play may sit elsewhere. Capital is starting to rotate away from meme-driven narratives toward projects with working products and clear demand. That shift is exactly where Remittix is gaining ground and why many now rank it as the best crypto to buy now instead of betting on another SHIB cycle. Remittix is not competing with Shiba Inu on hype or community buzz. It is competing on utility. Priced at $0.123, RTX is a sub-$1 token already processing real-world payment use cases. Users can send crypto that converts directly into fiat and settles into bank accounts within minutes. No exchanges. No wire delays. No surprise FX fees. That is a sharp contrast to meme coins, where price action often depends entirely on sentiment. This practical focus explains why Remittix has already raised over $28.8 million and sold more than 701 million tokens. Investors are treating RTX less like a gamble and more like early exposure to global payments infrastructure. As questions grow around how far Shiba Inu price can realistically stretch from here, Remittix is being positioned as the alternative with asymmetric upside. Why Investors Are Choosing Remittix Over Meme Coins Crypto-to-fiat payments that land directly in bank accounts Audited by CertiK with a fully verified team and smart contracts First CEX listing confirmed on BitMart with LBank also announced Built to target the $19 trillion global payments market Momentum is accelerating. Remittix has crossed the $20M mark, unlocked major exchange listings and launched a live wallet on the App Store. A 15% USDT referral reward now pays out daily and a very limited 200% bonus is running with only 5 million tokens available. As Shiba Inu holders ask if another rally is left, Remittix is quietly answering a different question. Where does real adoption drive long-term value? For many analysts, that answer is increasingly RTX.

The competition, scheduled to run from January 22 to January 29, 2025, on the ASTER Chain testnet, represents a significant evolution in how trading skill is measured and challenged within the crypto ecosystem. This announcement follows a groundbreaking first season where AI teams collectively outperformed their human counterparts, sparking intense debate and anticipation for a rematch. ASTER Trading Competition Details and Structure The ASTER trading competition is meticulously structured to create a balanced and high-stakes environment. The exchange confirmed the event details via its official X account, outlining a clear timeline and participant selection process. Applications for one of the 30 open human trader slots will close at 11:59 p.m. UTC on January 18, with final selections announced on the ASTER platform by January 20. The competitive trading window then opens for one week of intense activity. The total participant pool will consist of 100 entities: 40 pre-invited professional traders, 30 selected applicants, and 30 AI trading agents or algorithms. This structure ensures a diverse mix of strategies and experience levels, from seasoned professionals to emerging talent and purely algorithmic systems. Key competition parameters include: Platform: ASTER Chain testnet, allowing risk-free, high-speed trading with test assets. Prize Pool: $150,000 distributed across multiple categories, including net profit and team performance. Duration: A concentrated seven-day sprint from January 22 to January 29, 2025. Goal: To achieve the highest net profit through perpetual futures trading on the provided testnet environment. The Strategic Impact of Human vs AI Trading This competition transcends a simple contest for prizes; it serves as a live, large-scale experiment in market dynamics. The concept of Human vs AI trading probes fundamental questions about the future of financial markets. Can human intuition, experience, and discretionary judgment compete against AI’s capacity for speed, pattern recognition, and emotionless execution? The first season of the ASTER competition provided compelling, albeit preliminary, data. While an individual human trader, known as ProMint, secured the top spot in the net profit category, the collective performance told a different story. The AI team achieved a total return on investment (ROI) of -4.48%, significantly outperforming the human team’s aggregate ROI of -32.22% in the same volatile test environment. This result underscores a critical insight: AI systems may excel at risk management and consistency in downturns, potentially avoiding the emotional pitfalls that can exacerbate human losses. However, the victory of a single human trader highlights that exceptional individual skill can still reach peaks that generalized algorithms may not. Season 2 is poised to refine this data set, offering a larger sample size and the opportunity for both sides to adapt their strategies based on past outcomes. The event provides invaluable, real-world context for developers, quantitative analysts, and traditional traders observing the integration of AI into decentralized finance (DeFi). Expert Analysis: A Testing Ground for DeFi Innovation Industry observers note that hosting the competition on the ASTER Chain testnet is a strategic masterstroke. Firstly, it eliminates financial risk for participants, encouraging aggressive and innovative trading strategies that might be too risky on a mainnet with real capital. Secondly, it serves as a massive stress test and visibility campaign for ASTER’s underlying technology. Thousands of trades executed by 100 highly motivated entities will generate significant data on network throughput, latency, and the user experience of the perpetual futures trading interface. This real-world testing under competitive pressure is far more valuable than controlled internal tests, providing the ASTER development team with actionable insights to optimize their protocol before wider mainnet adoption. Furthermore, the competition acts as a powerful talent discovery mechanism. For the selected applicants and even the AI developers, strong performance can lead to career opportunities, funding, or reputation building within the crypto trading community. The event timeline is concise, creating a sense of urgency and spectacle. The week-long format mirrors the fast-paced nature of crypto markets, requiring participants to adapt quickly to simulated market conditions without the benefit of long-term positioning. This structure tests not just strategy, but endurance and decision-making under pressure. Broader Context and Future of Algorithmic DeFi The ASTER Human vs. AI event is part of a broader, accelerating trend toward the automation of DeFi activities. Algorithmic trading, liquidity provision, and yield optimization are increasingly dominated by bots and smart contracts. Competitions like this one serve as public showcases for the capabilities of these systems, driving innovation and adoption. They also democratize access to advanced trading concepts, allowing a global audience to witness and learn from the strategies employed by both top human traders and sophisticated AI. The $150,000 prize pool, while substantial, also represents an investment in marketing and community engagement for ASTER, positioning the exchange as a forward-thinking hub at the intersection of finance and technology. The historical data from Season 1 offers a fascinating baseline. The fact that both teams posted negative ROIs highlights the challenging, simulated market conditions, likely designed to test risk management as much as profit generation. The stark difference in performance (-4.48% vs. -32.22%) suggests AI systems were better equipped to minimize losses—a crucial skill in actual trading. As the technology matures, future iterations may see AI teams collaborating with human overseers, creating hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both approaches. The outcomes of Season 2 will be closely analyzed by hedge funds, crypto VCs, and academic researchers studying market behavior and automation.

Chairman Tim Scott said late Wednesday the committee would delay the markup as bipartisan negotiations continue, but did not set a new date. The delay came after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong publicly withdrew support for the draft bill, which aims to clarify how crypto tokens are classified and place spot market oversight with the CFTC. Armstrong wrote, “After reviewing the Senate Banking draft text over the last 48hrs, Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written.” I’ve spoken with leaders across the crypto industry, the financial sector, and my Democratic and Republican colleagues, and everyone remains at the table working in good faith. As we take a brief pause before moving to a markup, this market structure bill reflects months of… — Senator Tim Scott (@SenatorTimScott) January 15, 2026 Scott Signals Ongoing Talks Despite Industry Pushback Coinbase’s objections landed in the middle of a fast-moving lobbying fight over stablecoin rewards, with banks pressing lawmakers to prevent crypto platforms from offering yield-like incentives that can look and feel like interest on deposits. The banking industry says Congress already drew that line in the GENIUS Act, which prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest or yield simply for holding a payment stablecoin, and it argues the market structure bill should close what it calls an end run via exchange rewards. Scott said he has spoken with stakeholders and signaled negotiations continue. “This bill reflects months of serious bipartisan negotiations and real input from innovators, investors and law enforcement,” he said. “The goal is to deliver clear rules of the road that protect consumers, strengthen our national security, and ensure the future of finance is built in the United States.” Markup Delay Extends Wait For Clear Crypto Framework The draft in play would restrict paying interest solely for holding a stablecoin, and it would still allow rewards tied to activities such as payments or loyalty programs, with the SEC and CFTC tasked with setting disclosure rules. The committee had aimed to take up the bill in a Thursday session originally set for 10 am ET, and the delay leaves the industry waiting again for a legislative path that could replace years of case by case enforcement with a single framework. The Senate’s broader crypto calendar is already shifting. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman has also pushed his committee’s markup deeper into January, saying lawmakers need more time to lock down remaining policy details and build broad support.

This analysis for March 2025 examines the technical and fundamental drivers that could shape the DOT price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, specifically evaluating the feasibility of reaching the $60 threshold. Market data from CoinMarketCap and on-chain metrics from Messari provide the foundation for this exploration. Polkadot Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026-2030 Horizon Polkadot’s unique value proposition centers on its heterogeneous multi-chain framework. Consequently, its native DOT token’s valuation is intrinsically linked to parachain adoption and network utility. The transition to Polkadot 2.0, with its Agile Coretime model, represents a fundamental shift in resource allocation. This upgrade aims to enhance scalability and developer accessibility, potentially driving new demand cycles. Historical volatility patterns from 2021-2024 show DOT often reacts strongly to broader market cycles and specific ecosystem announcements. Furthermore, the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) sectors within the Polkadot ecosystem provides tangible utility. Projects like Acala and Moonbeam have established substantial total value locked (TVL). Analysts from firms like Messari frequently highlight parachain slot auctions and treasury spending as key metrics for network health. Therefore, any long-term price prediction must weigh these technological milestones against macroeconomic factors influencing the entire crypto asset class. Fundamental Drivers for DOT Valuation Several core fundamentals will dictate Polkadot’s price path. First, the rate of parachain deployment and their individual user bases create direct demand for DOT’s staking and governance functions. Second, the implementation of Polkadot 2.0 is expected to streamline core resource access, potentially lowering barriers for new projects. Third, the network’s treasury, one of the largest in crypto, funds ecosystem development through a transparent governance process. Expert Perspectives on Network Growth Blockchain analysts emphasize staking participation rates and cross-chain message volume as critical health indicators. For instance, a report from the Web3 Foundation in late 2024 noted a consistent increase in cross-chain transactions. Meanwhile, development activity on GitHub remains among the highest in the industry, signaling ongoing innovation. These factors contribute to the network’s security and attractiveness, which theoretically supports token value over the long term. However, experts caution that competition from other layer-0 and modular blockchain solutions remains intense. Scenarios for the $60 Price Target Reaching a $60 DOT price implies a market capitalization significantly higher than current levels. This scenario likely requires a combination of bullish conditions. A substantial increase in total parachains, coupled with a major bull run in the broader cryptocurrency market, would be primary catalysts. Additionally, widespread institutional adoption of Polkadot’s technology for enterprise solutions could drive unprecedented demand. The table below outlines simplified scenario analysis based on different adoption rates. Scenario Key Drivers Potential Timeline Conservative Growth Steady parachain growth, moderate crypto bull market. Post-2027 Accelerated Adoption Polkadot 2.0 success, major enterprise partnership. 2026-2027 Mass Market Breakthrough Dominant role in Web3 infrastructure, trillion-dollar crypto market. 2029-2030 It is crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Regulatory developments, technological breakthroughs by competitors, and shifts in global monetary policy present substantial risks. Therefore, any long-term prediction serves as a framework for understanding possibilities, not a financial guarantee. Comparative Analysis and Market Position Polkadot operates in the competitive blockchain interoperability sector. Its architecture differs markedly from atomic swap bridges and other layer-0 protocols like Cosmos. This distinction means its adoption curve may not mirror general market trends. Key differentiators include: Shared Security: Parachains leverage the main Relay Chain’s security. On-Chain Governance: DOT holders actively vote on network upgrades. Forkless Upgrades: The network can evolve without disruptive hard forks. These features aim to create a stable yet adaptable environment for developers. As the industry matures, the market’s valuation of these technical attributes will become clearer. Current data suggests a strong correlation between DOT price and the growth of the decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem built across its parachains. Conclusion The path for Polkadot (DOT) toward a $60 price point by 2030 is complex and multifaceted. It hinges not on speculation, but on the successful execution of its technological roadmap and the tangible adoption of its parachain ecosystem. While the $60 milestone is mathematically possible within a sustained bull market and accelerated network growth, investors should prioritize understanding Polkadot’s fundamental drivers—parachain activity, governance participation, and treasury deployment. This Polkadot price prediction analysis underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain metrics and development progress rather than short-term price fluctuations. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Polkadot can secure a dominant position in the interoperable future of blockchains. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for Polkadot’s price growth? The primary factor is the rate of real, sustainable adoption of its parachains. Increased usage, developer activity, and total value locked on parachains create fundamental demand for DOT’s staking, governance, and bonding functions. Q2: How does Polkadot 2.0 affect the price prediction? The Agile Coretime model in Polkadot 2.0 aims to make resource access more flexible and efficient. If successful, it could lower entry barriers for new projects, potentially accelerating ecosystem growth and positively impacting long-term DOT valuation. Q3: What are the biggest risks to this Polkadot price prediction? Key risks include intensified competition from other interoperability solutions, adverse global cryptocurrency regulations, failure of major parachain projects, and a prolonged downturn in the broader digital asset market. Q4: How does staking impact DOT’s price? Staking locks up a portion of the DOT supply, reducing circulating liquidity. High staking participation rates can decrease selling pressure and increase network security, which are generally viewed as positive fundamental indicators for long-term price stability and growth. Q5: Can DOT reach $60 before 2030? While possible, it would require an optimal convergence of factors: a major cryptocurrency bull market, surpassing success of Polkadot 2.0, and significant adoption of parachains for high-demand use cases like DeFi or RWAs. A more conservative estimate might place such a target in the later years of the 2026-2030 window.

Shares of Toyota Industries itself rallied by nearly 6% to 19,080 yen, going even higher than the new offer price of 18,800 yen. Late Wednesday, Toyota said it would pay 18,800 yen per share (about $118.11) to buy out the rest of Toyota Industries. That’s a 15%+ increase from the earlier 16,300 yen per share offer it made last June. The goal is to fully privatize the company. Toyota Industries says raised buyout price is still not enough Let’s back up. Last year, Toyota tried to buy the entire Toyota Group, a corporate giant in Japan, for 4.7 trillion yen. Part of that deal included 1 billion yen from Chairman Akio Toyoda’s own pocket and 700 billion yen in non-voting preferred shares. But by December, Toyota Industries pushed back. They said the deal wasn’t good enough and asked for more money. That move now looks like it worked. But there’s still some pushback. The new price is still under the middle of the range suggested by an independent adviser. That suggests Toyota Industries might still be undervalued, even with the increased offer. And the fact that the stock price has already jumped beyond the revised offer only adds to that. Toyota Industries, which started the Toyota brand decades ago, isn’t just some side business. It builds forklifts, engines, electronic parts, and metal stamping tools. It’s got its own weight, and the board clearly knows it. On the operations side, Toyota isn’t having the easiest time. Its latest report showed global production dropped 5.5% in November, down to 821,723 vehicles. That was the first year-on-year decline in half a year. Global sales also fell 2.2%, with the Chinese market slipping after the government pulled back subsidies. To make things worse, Toyota said U.S. tariffs are going to hit hard. They estimate a 1.45 trillion yen (over $9 billion) dent to their current fiscal year, which ends in March. That’s not pocket change. Even with the hits, they’re still spending. Back in November, Toyota said it would invest $912 million across five factories in the Southern U.S. states. That’s part of a wider plan to sink up to $10 billion into U.S. operations by 2030. In Europe, Toyota sold 1,143,963 cars in 2025, holding its spot as the second best-selling passenger car brand across the continent. Its electrified mix hit 77%, a 5% increase from the previous year. Inside that number, battery electric vehicles rose 46%, plug-in hybrids jumped 76%, and hybrid models went up 3%. Commercial vans are doing well too. The Toyota Professional light van range hit 158,270 units, a record, and a 19% rise from the previous year. Sales boss Till Conrad said, “We are very proud to deliver another strong sales performance in Europe during 2025… We have continued to introduce new, exciting models to our line-up, among them the Aygo X Hybrid, new RAV4, and battery electric Toyota C-HR+ and Urban Cruiser, with more new products coming in 2026.” And the EV push continues. Plug-in hybrid sales hit 71,845, up 91% year-on-year. Battery electric vehicles sold 51,919 units, a 53% increase. Big growth came from strong demand for the new C-HR plug-in hybrid.

57178635,657767,1768456808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57178635.jpeg,Institutions Are Positioning Ahead Of US Crypto Market Structure Shift – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/institutions-are-positioning-ahead-us-crypto-market/,"The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of short-term relief as Bitcoin and major altcoins attempt to stabilize after weeks of sustained selling pressure. Prices have rebounded modestly across the board, easing some of the recent bearish momentum. However, sentiment remains fragile. Many analysts argue that this move fits the profile of a relief rally rather than the start of a durable trend reversal, pointing to still-weak market structure and unresolved macro and regulatory risks. Against this backdrop, a draft market structure bill released by the US Senate is drawing significant attention. The proposed framework represents a potential structural shift in how crypto assets are treated within the US financial system. The bill aims to clearly differentiate which crypto assets fall under the definition of commodities and which qualify as securities, while assigning regulatory oversight accordingly. Until now, the US regulatory approach has largely relied on enforcement actions, creating uncertainty for investors, developers, and institutions alike. By outlining classification criteria in advance, the proposal seeks to reduce ambiguity and provide a cleaner operating environment. As markets digest this information, the focus is shifting from headline-driven volatility toward longer-term structural implications. Whether this regulatory clarity translates into sustained confidence remains an open question. Regulatory Clarity Signals a Shift A report from XWIN Research Japan highlights a critical nuance in the latest US market structure proposal: fully decentralized networks and DeFi protocols are not treated as traditional financial intermediaries. Developers, validators, and node operators are not automatically classified as regulated entities, signaling a formal recognition of decentralization as a core structural attribute rather than a loophole to be closed. This distinction is meaningful, as it reduces legal uncertainty for open-source contributors and preserves the permissionless nature of decentralized infrastructure. In contrast, centralized entities face a more clearly defined regulatory perimeter. Exchanges, brokers, and custodians are expected to comply with stricter rules on registration, asset segregation, and disclosure. Rather than targeting innovation, these requirements appear designed to professionalize market infrastructure and align centralized crypto businesses with existing financial standards. Within this framework, Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and spot ETFs are implicitly assumed to remain integrated into the US financial system, reinforcing their status as legitimate financial instruments. On-chain data already reflects this transition. Metrics from CryptoQuant show that near the $90,000 Bitcoin level, retail activity remains muted while mid- and large-sized spot orders dominate. This pattern suggests neither speculative excess nor panic-driven exits, but measured positioning by larger investors. Taken together, these signals imply a market gradually shifting from reactive, headline-driven behavior toward a more structure-driven phase. Regulatory clarity may not spark immediate price moves, but it is already influencing how capital positions itself across the crypto landscape. Total Crypto Market Cap Enters Consolidation Phase The total cryptocurrency market capitalization chart shows a market in consolidation after an aggressive multi-quarter expansion. Following the strong advance from late 2023 into mid-2025, total market cap peaked near the $3.8–$4.0 trillion zone before entering a corrective phase. Since then, price action has transitioned into a broad range, with higher volatility compressing into a more orderly structure. Currently, the total market cap is hovering around the $3.2 trillion level, which aligns with a key former resistance zone that has now acted as support multiple times. The weekly structure suggests a cooling phase rather than a breakdown. Price remains above the rising 200-week moving average, which continues to slope upward and reinforces the idea that the primary market trend is still constructive. Shorter-term moving averages have flattened, reflecting indecision and reduced momentum after the earlier impulsive move. Volume has declined from peak levels, indicating that aggressive distribution pressure has eased, but strong expansion demand has not yet returned. This combination is typical of mid-cycle consolidation rather than terminal weakness. From a structural perspective, the market is digesting prior gains while maintaining a higher-low framework relative to previous cycles. A sustained hold above the $3.0 trillion region keeps the broader bullish structure intact. However, failure to defend this zone would expose the market to deeper retracements toward long-term trend support.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced According to the bank’s digital assets team, growing demand from corporate treasury buyers and spot ETH products has driven the change in outlook. Bank Raises Ethereum Target The bank’s lead analyst expects fee growth on the Ethereum network and stronger institutional adoption to be key drivers for the move higher. The bank also revised its longer-term numbers, lifting its 2028 target to $25,000 and laying out scenarios that push toward $40,000 by 2030. These wider targets reflect models where stablecoins and tokenized assets expand on Ethereum’s chain. Institutional Buying Drives Demand Data cited by market researchers points to heavy accumulation since June, with spot ETF flows and treasury firms together taking close to 4% of Ether’s circulating supply over that period. ETHEREUM SEEN OUTPERFORMING BITCOIN Standard Chartered says Ethereum’s outlook has improved and it is likely to outperform bitcoin. While weak bitcoin performance has weighed on the broader crypto market, rising institutional demand for ethereum and its dominance in stablecoins,… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 13, 2026 Treasury firms alone reportedly bought about 2.3 million ETH in just over two months, a pace that Standard Chartered says outstrips some previous accumulation phases seen in Bitcoin. Ethereum Vs. Bitcoin Standard Chartered’s note also argues that Ether could outperform Bitcoin, raising the possibility of the ETH/BTC ratio returning toward levels last seen during 2021’s run-up. Based on the bank’s scenarios, weaker Bitcoin momentum combined with stronger real-world use of Ethereum might lift Ether’s price faster than Bitcoin’s in the months ahead. Long-Term Upside Scenarios Some headlines have pointed to even bigger long-range targets produced by the same models, including forecasts of $30,000 by 2029 and $40,000 by 2030 under more bullish assumptions. These outcomes rely on a substantial expansion of stablecoin use, tokenized real-world assets, and continued staking demand that would remove supply from the market. Independent forecasters remain split, and other banks have offered lower year-end projections, offering a reminder that expert views differ. Meanwhile, market watchers caution, though, that relative moves depend heavily on ETF flows and corporate balance-sheet decisions.

TSMC’s net income came in at NT$505.74 billion, beating the NT$478.37 billion expected by analysts tracked by LSEG SmartEstimates. The company’s eevenue reached NT$1.046 trillion, or $33.09 billion, also ahead of the NT$1.034 trillion forecast. The company has now delivered eight straight quarters of year over year profit growth. December quarter revenue rose 20.5% from a year earlier and crossed NT$1 trillion for the first time. AI and high performance chips drive quarterly results TSMC continues to benefit from the surge in artificial intelligence hardware spending. The company produces advanced processors used by major clients such as Nvidia and AMD, and this work is now the main engine of its business. Its high performance computing unit, which includes AI and 5G products, made up the largest share of sales in the October to December period. Advanced chips sized 7 nanometers or smaller accounted for 77% of total wafer revenue during the quarter. Smaller chip sizes allow faster speeds and better energy use, which is why customers keep ordering more of them. “The demand for AI remains very strong, driving overall chip demand across the entire server industry,” Counterpoint Research senior analyst Jake Lai said. With TSMC’s ongoing 2nm capacity expansion and new production contributing to revenue, along with continuous expansion of advanced packaging… TSMC is expected to maintain strong performance in 2026.” TSMC’s relationship with Apple, Qualcomm, and Nvidia TSMC still gets a big share of its business from Apple’s iPhone and smartphones that run on Qualcomm’s high-end processors. That exposure matters because the memory shortage is expected to hit phone sales hard in 2026, with Macquarie Capital predicting that global smartphone shipments will fall 11.6% year over year, which could weigh on volumes tied to mobile devices. TSMC is also expected to play a central role in a coming US–Taiwan trade deal. As part of that process, the company is likely to commit to building more chip fabrication plants on American soil. That would add to its existing plan to invest up to $165 billion in the US, one of the largest overseas manufacturing pushes in the semiconductor industry. Outside the United States, TSMC is moving ahead with new factories in Japan and Germany. These projects are part of a broader push to spread production across key regions while keeping its most advanced chip development anchored in Taiwan. On the demand side, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said this month that appetite for AI accelerators remains strong. His view lines up with comments from AMD CEO Lisa Su, who said demand for AI computing power and the number of users are still climbing.

This crucial restoration of functionality follows a scheduled period of system maintenance, directly impacting traders’ access to several prominent tokens. Consequently, market participants can now freely move assets including Sui (SUI), DeepBook (DEEP), and Haedal Protocol (HAEDAL). This resumption marks a pivotal moment for liquidity and operational continuity on one of Asia’s most regulated trading platforms. Upbit SUI Deposits: A Detailed Restoration Announcement Upbit formally communicated the completion of its network maintenance and the subsequent reactivation of services for SUI-based assets. The exchange, operated by Dunamu Inc., is renowned for its stringent compliance with South Korea’s financial regulations. The maintenance period, a standard procedure for network upgrades and security enhancements, temporarily halted transaction capabilities for a specific suite of tokens. The affected assets, now fully operational, include: Sui (SUI): The native token of the Sui Layer 1 blockchain. DeepBook (DEEP): A core decentralized liquidity protocol on the Sui network. Haedal Protocol (HAEDAL): A leading liquid staking derivative platform within the Sui ecosystem. LumiWave (LWA), Momentum (MMT), Walrus (WAL): Additional ecosystem projects built on the Sui infrastructure. This procedural pause, while routine, underscores the exchange’s commitment to system integrity and user fund security. Moreover, it highlights the growing integration of the Sui network within major centralized exchange frameworks. Understanding the SUI Network and Its Market Context The Sui blockchain, developed by Mysten Labs, represents a modern Layer 1 platform designed for high-throughput and low-latency digital asset transactions. Its architecture distinguishes itself through parallel transaction processing. For context, here is a brief comparison of key metrics among recent Layer 1 blockchains as referenced in industry reports: Blockchain Primary Innovation Transaction Finality Sui (SUI) Parallel Execution & Move Language Sub-second Aptos (APT) Move Language, Diem-Born ~1-2 seconds Solana (SOL) Proof of History ~400-800 ms Upbit’s support for the SUI network and its associated assets signals strong institutional validation within the APAC region. Furthermore, the resumption of services alleviates potential liquidity fragmentation that can occur during maintenance windows, especially for decentralized finance (DeFi) assets like HAEDAL and DEEP which rely on seamless cross-platform arbitrage. Expert Analysis on Exchange Maintenance and Ecosystem Health Industry analysts consistently note that planned maintenance by top-tier exchanges like Upbit, while temporarily disruptive, serves a vital long-term function. “Scheduled upgrades are a hallmark of a mature and security-focused trading platform,” explains a fintech researcher from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), whose team publishes quarterly reports on exchange robustness. “The swift and transparent resumption of services for an entire network like Sui demonstrates operational excellence and minimizes market impact. It also reinforces the exchange’s role as critical infrastructure, not just a trading venue.” Data from blockchain analytics firms typically shows a normalization of trading volume and on-chain transfer activity for affected assets within 24-48 hours post-resumption. The Regulatory Landscape for South Korean Crypto Exchanges Upbit operates under the vigilant oversight of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). All exchange activities, including network maintenance and service changes, comply with the Specific Financial Information Act. This regulatory framework mandates strict real-name account verification, robust anti-money laundering (AML) protocols, and transparent communication with users. Therefore, the announcement regarding SUI-based assets follows a established protocol of user protection and regulatory adherence. The exchange’s decision to list and support these specific tokens also implies a thorough due diligence process, assessing each project’s technical merits and compliance posture. Potential Impact on Traders and the SUI Ecosystem The immediate effect of service resumption is the restoration of full asset control for Upbit users. Traders can now deposit tokens from external Sui network wallets and withdraw holdings to participate in other ecosystem activities like staking or DeFi protocols. Historically, similar service restorations have led to a short-term increase in transfer activity as portfolios are rebalanced. For the broader SUI ecosystem, sustained support from a major liquidity gateway like Upbit is essential for fostering developer confidence and attracting new users. It ensures a reliable fiat on-ramp and off-ramp for the network’s native and application tokens, contributing directly to its economic security and growth. Conclusion Upbit’s successful resumption of deposit and withdrawal services for SUI-based assets concludes a routine but critical maintenance period. This action reinforces the exchange’s operational reliability and its significant role in bridging the Sui network with the South Korean and global cryptocurrency markets. The move provides crucial relief for traders and strengthens the infrastructure supporting assets like Sui (SUI), DeepBook (DEEP), and Haedal Protocol (HAEDAL). As the digital asset landscape evolves, the seamless integration and maintenance of emerging blockchain networks by regulated exchanges remain a key indicator of ecosystem maturity and stability. FAQs Q1: Which specific assets were affected by the Upbit maintenance? A1: The maintenance impacted deposits and withdrawals for Sui (SUI), DeepBook (DEEP), Haedal Protocol (HAEDAL), LumiWave (LWA), Momentum (MMT), and Walrus (WAL)—all digital assets operating on the SUI network. Q2: Why do exchanges like Upbit perform network maintenance? A2: Exchanges conduct scheduled maintenance to implement essential system upgrades, enhance security protocols, perform backend optimizations, and ensure compatibility with blockchain network updates, all to safeguard user funds and improve service stability. Q3: Could users trade these SUI-based assets on Upbit during the maintenance? A3: Typically, trading (buying and selling) for listed assets often remains active on the exchange’s internal order book during deposit/withdrawal maintenance. However, moving assets on or off the exchange platform is suspended until services are fully restored. Q4: How does this affect the price of SUI and other listed tokens? A4: While temporary service halts can sometimes cause minor liquidity premiums or discounts, the resumption usually normalizes prices. The long-term price is driven by broader market forces, network adoption, and project fundamentals, not short-term access changes on a single exchange. Q5: Is the Sui network itself different from other blockchains? A5: Yes, the Sui network is a distinct Layer 1 blockchain that uses the Move programming language and emphasizes parallel transaction execution for high speed and scalability, setting it apart from networks like Ethereum or Bitcoin in its core technical design.

According to recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Darkpost, this substantial reduction in Bitcoin open interest represents healthy deleveraging that historically precedes market rebounds. The current market conditions present a complex picture where technical indicators and on-chain metrics converge to suggest potential turning points. Bitcoin Open Interest Decline Signals Market Maturation Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that market participants have not yet settled. When Bitcoin open interest decreases significantly, it typically indicates that traders are closing their positions and reducing their exposure to the market. This reduction often occurs during periods of market uncertainty or after significant price movements. The current 31% decline in Bitcoin open interest since October 2024 represents one of the most substantial deleveraging events in recent cryptocurrency history. Market analysts monitor Bitcoin open interest closely because it provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price direction. High open interest during market peaks often signals excessive speculation and leverage, while declining open interest during market corrections suggests healthier market conditions. The current reduction in Bitcoin derivatives exposure indicates that speculative excess is being systematically removed from the market structure. Historical Context of Derivatives Market Signals Historical analysis reveals consistent patterns between Bitcoin open interest movements and subsequent price action. During previous market cycles, significant declines in open interest have frequently coincided with major market bottoms. For instance, the 2018-2019 bear market concluded with a 40% reduction in Bitcoin open interest before the subsequent bull market began. Similarly, the March 2020 market crash saw open interest drop by approximately 35% before Bitcoin’s remarkable recovery. The relationship between Bitcoin open interest and price movements follows identifiable patterns: Peak Open Interest: Typically occurs near market tops when speculation reaches maximum levels Declining Open Interest: Often signals deleveraging and potential market bottom formation Rebuilding Open Interest: Usually accompanies sustainable price recoveries and renewed market confidence Stable Open Interest: Suggests balanced market conditions with reduced speculative pressure Expert Analysis and Market Implications CryptoQuant contributor Darkpost provides crucial context for understanding the current Bitcoin open interest situation. Their analysis emphasizes that while declining open interest generally represents positive deleveraging, the market context determines its ultimate significance. The current 31% reduction in Bitcoin derivatives exposure suggests that excessive leverage is being systematically removed from the market. This process creates healthier conditions for sustainable price appreciation. However, Darkpost cautions that further Bitcoin price declines could extend the open interest reduction period. If Bitcoin enters a full bear market phase, open interest might continue declining as market participants reduce their exposure. This scenario could prolong the current market correction. The critical distinction lies in whether the open interest decline represents voluntary position closing or forced liquidations. Derivatives Market Structure and Risk Assessment The Bitcoin derivatives market has evolved significantly since its inception, with multiple exchanges offering sophisticated trading products. This market structure includes perpetual contracts, futures, and options that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin price movements without owning the underlying asset. The current open interest reduction affects all these product types, suggesting broad-based deleveraging across the derivatives ecosystem. Market participants should consider several factors when evaluating Bitcoin open interest data: Factor Bullish Interpretation Bearish Interpretation Open Interest Decline Healthy deleveraging, reduced systemic risk Declining market interest, reduced liquidity Funding Rates Neutral funding suggests balanced markets Consistently negative funding indicates bearish sentiment Liquidations Reduced liquidations suggest stable positions Mass liquidations indicate forced deleveraging Volume/Open Interest Ratio High ratio suggests active position management Low ratio indicates declining market participation Current Market Conditions and Technical Analysis The Bitcoin market currently presents mixed signals that require careful interpretation. While the open interest decline suggests deleveraging, other indicators provide additional context. Bitcoin’s price action, trading volume, and on-chain metrics all contribute to the complete market picture. Technical analysts note that Bitcoin has tested several key support levels during the recent correction, with varying degrees of success. Market structure analysis reveals several important developments: Exchange reserves have decreased significantly, suggesting reduced selling pressure Long-term holder metrics indicate accumulation patterns among experienced investors Network activity remains robust despite price volatility Institutional interest continues through regulated investment products Risk Factors and Market Scenarios While declining Bitcoin open interest generally signals positive market developments, several risk factors could alter this interpretation. Regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and technological advancements all influence cryptocurrency markets. The potential for further market declines remains present, particularly if broader financial markets experience turbulence. Market participants should monitor several key indicators alongside Bitcoin open interest: Traditional financial market correlations and decoupling patterns Regulatory developments in major cryptocurrency markets Adoption metrics and network growth statistics Technological developments and protocol upgrades Institutional participation through traditional financial channels Conclusion The significant decline in Bitcoin open interest represents a potentially bullish development for cryptocurrency markets. This 31% reduction since October 2024 suggests healthy deleveraging that historically precedes market rebounds. While caution remains necessary given ongoing market uncertainties, the current Bitcoin open interest patterns align with previous market bottom formations. Market participants should continue monitoring derivatives metrics alongside other indicators to confirm potential trend reversals. The gradual removal of excessive leverage creates healthier conditions for sustainable Bitcoin price appreciation, though the timing and magnitude of any recovery remain uncertain. FAQs Q1: What exactly is Bitcoin open interest and why does it matter? Bitcoin open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that haven’t been settled. It matters because it indicates market participation levels, leverage in the system, and potential price volatility. Declining open interest often signals reduced speculation and healthier market conditions. Q2: How does the current 31% decline in Bitcoin open interest compare to historical patterns? The current decline aligns with historical patterns observed before previous market bottoms. During the 2018-2019 bear market, open interest dropped approximately 40% before recovery. Similar patterns occurred in March 2020 when open interest declined about 35% before Bitcoin’s significant price rebound. Q3: Can declining Bitcoin open interest ever be a negative signal for markets? Yes, if open interest declines alongside deteriorating fundamentals or during periods of forced liquidations, it can signal weakening market structure. The context matters significantly—voluntary position closing suggests deleveraging, while forced liquidations indicate market stress. Q4: What other indicators should investors monitor alongside Bitcoin open interest? Investors should monitor funding rates, liquidation levels, trading volume, exchange reserves, and on-chain metrics. These indicators provide complementary information about market sentiment, risk levels, and potential price direction when analyzed alongside open interest data. Q5: How long do open interest declines typically last before market rebounds occur? Historical patterns show varying timeframes, typically ranging from several weeks to multiple months. The duration depends on market conditions, the magnitude of previous speculation, and broader financial market trends. The current decline began in October 2024 and continues to evolve based on market developments.

Banks want the “affiliate loophole” closed, while exchanges argue this would instantly turn lawful loyalty incentives into an illegal end-run overnight. As regulatory pressure builds, attention is rotating toward the best new meme coins , where early access still exists. Apeing is entering conversations as traders look beyond yield incentives toward narrative-driven positioning during uncertainty. Market history shows regulatory noise rarely kills demand, but it does redirect it. During moments like this, traders shift from reward-based strategies to conviction-based plays rooted in community momentum. That shift explains why meme assets regain attention when traditional incentives face pressure. Cheems and Pepe already demonstrate how belief-driven markets behave under stress. Apeing is now being discussed within the same context, as participants anticipate where attention migrates when rules tighten elsewhere. Apeing Joins the Best New Meme Coins as Market Interest Surges Apeing is being discussed as part of the best new meme coins rotation because it aligns with how meme markets historically reward early decisiveness. The structure emphasizes controlled access, limited early supply, and pricing tiers that favor participants before public momentum forms. Analysts tracking behavioral flows note that meme assets often perform best when broader markets feel constrained. Apeing enters during this exact phase, where conviction matters more than confirmation and timing outweighs technical perfection. From a macro perspective, Apeing reflects how newer meme projects are designed after observing prior cycles. Developers prioritize simplicity, accessibility, and clear stages instead of complex incentives. This approach mirrors successful launches studied by blockchain research firms analyzing meme liquidity dynamics. Within the best new meme coins discussion, Apeing is framed as a vehicle built for early movers, not late chasers, during periods when regulatory uncertainty reshapes capital behavior. Crypto Rewards the Quick, Not the Hesitant Early access has become the silent divider between leadership and regret in meme markets. Controlled entry systems protect participants from public-sale volatility while locking pricing at the lowest tiers. In Apeing’s structure, Stage 1 access remains the only path to initial allocation, with pricing beginning at $0.0001 and future listing set at $0.001. This creates an automatic 10× gap before broader participation even begins, reshaping risk-reward dynamics. Market studies on token launches consistently show early-stage participants capture disproportionate upside. By limiting supply and pacing distribution, early access reduces emotional trading and enhances positioning clarity. Analysts often compare this to private rounds in traditional markets, where entry timing defines outcomes. Within meme ecosystems, this structure amplifies conviction-based strategies, favoring those who act during uncertainty rather than waiting for confirmation later. Get Ahead of the Crowd: $APEING Whitelist Access Joining the Apeing whitelist follows a streamlined process designed to eliminate confusion and congestion. Interested participants visit the official website and navigate directly to the whitelist section. There, users submit their email address to register interest. Confirmation is then delivered through email, securing eligibility for Stage 1 access. This controlled system ensures fair distribution while preventing last-minute network overload common in public launches. From a security standpoint, this approach reduces phishing risks and misinformation. Analysts often recommend whitelist systems because they centralize communication and maintain transparency. By avoiding rushed public participation, projects preserve allocation integrity and participant confidence. For those tracking the best new meme coins, simple onboarding processes signal organizational maturity. This clarity strengthens trust during early phases when narratives are still forming. Cheems Shows How Community Outlives Market Cycles Cheems represents a legacy meme asset that demonstrates community persistence despite muted liquidity. Trading near $0.000073 with a market cap of around $186K, Cheems maintains over 11,000 holders. Daily volume remains low near $80, signaling limited short-term speculation. Yet the holder distribution remains relatively decentralized, with the top ten wallets controlling roughly 29% of supply. This structure highlights how belief sustains meme coins long after hype fades. Historically, Cheems illustrates how meme assets survive downturns through cultural relevance rather than price momentum. Despite remaining over 99% below its 2021 peak, the token rebounded roughly 36% from its December 2025 low. Analysts studying meme longevity often reference Cheems as proof that community-driven assets can remain dormant before reactivation phases. Its behavior offers context for evaluating newer meme narratives entering similar psychological territory. Pepe Reflects Liquidity Power at Scale Pepe operates on the opposite end of the meme spectrum, showcasing how attention scales rapidly. Trading near $0.0000068, Pepe recently surged around 19% within 24 hours. Market capitalization sits near $2.86B, supported by daily trading volume exceeding $1B. With over 506,000 holders and a volume-to-market-cap ratio around 35%, Pepe demonstrates how speculative demand accelerates once momentum ignites across exchanges. From an analytical standpoint, Pepe confirms that meme coins function as liquidity magnets during risk-on rotations. Despite remaining roughly 76% below its December 2024 peak, renewed activity signals how quickly narratives revive. Researchers from crypto analytics platforms highlight Pepe as an example of how meme assets respond faster than fundamentals. This behavior helps contextualize why traders monitor emerging meme projects before volume explodes. US Lawmakers Target a Crypto Rewards Loophole, and the Stakes Are Massive The US Senate could wipe out $6B in crypto rewards this week by moving to close a single regulatory gap known as the affiliate loophole. Banks argue that this structure allows exchanges to sidestep existing financial rules, while exchanges counter that it simply supports lawful loyalty incentives used by millions of users. According to reporting from major crypto policy outlets, shutting this channel could reshape how rewards, referrals, and participation models operate across the market, adding fresh uncertainty during an already fragile sentiment cycle. Final Thoughts: Regulation Shakes Rewards, Memes Rewrite Strategy The Senate’s $6B crypto rewards threat highlights how quickly market incentives can change. When reward structures face disruption, attention often pivots toward conviction-driven assets. Apeing is entering that rotation as part of the best new meme coins discussion, while Cheems and Pepe provide historical context across different liquidity scales. Together, they show how meme markets respond to pressure by rewarding decisiveness over hesitation. Insights referenced throughout this analysis align with broader market rankings tracked by Best Crypto To Buy Now , which monitors how regulatory shifts influence capital flow during uncertainty. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About Best New Meme Coins Why is early whitelist access important when evaluating meme coins? Early whitelist access matters because it provides controlled entry before broader market participation. According to Messari, structured early allocation reduces slippage and emotional trading. For projects like Apeing, whitelist access determines Stage 1 availability, offering fixed pricing before public market dynamics apply. This structure helps participants avoid high gas fees, sudden price spikes, and rushed decision-making common during open launches. What should readers do before joining any crypto whitelist? Readers should verify official websites, review smart contract details, and understand entry conditions.

57179057,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261754,1768458010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bank of England’s Crucial Move: Deposit-Like Protection for Stablecoins Signals Regulatory Revolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bank-england-stablecoin-deposit-protection/,"BitcoinWorld Bank of England’s Crucial Move: Deposit-Like Protection for Stablecoins Signals Regulatory Revolution LONDON, March 2025 – In a landmark development for the global digital asset landscape, the Bank of England is actively exploring a regulatory framework that would grant stablecoins protections strikingly similar to those covering traditional commercial bank deposits. This pivotal consideration, confirmed by Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden, represents a potential paradigm shift in how national authorities approach systemic cryptocurrency risks. The central bank’s review focuses explicitly on preparing for the potential failure of systemically important stablecoins, a scenario that could ripple through modern financial networks. Bank of England’s Stablecoin Protection Framework Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden outlined the central bank’s current position in a detailed briefing reported by Bloomberg. He stated that maintaining long-term public trust in these digital assets may necessitate mechanisms directly analogous to existing depositor insurance schemes. Furthermore, Ramsden highlighted that specific legal procedures, which would designate stablecoin holders as priority creditors during a bankruptcy, might also become essential. Consequently, the Bank of England is conducting a comprehensive review to determine the precise actions required to safeguard financial stability. This review occurs against a backdrop of rapid stablecoin adoption. For instance, major payment processors and financial technology firms increasingly integrate these digital currencies. The potential designation of certain stablecoins as “systemically important” mirrors the approach taken with large, traditional banks after the 2008 financial crisis. Therefore, the bank’s deliberations carry significant weight for both the cryptocurrency industry and the broader economy. The Evolution of Digital Asset Regulation The Bank of England’s deliberations did not emerge in a vacuum. They follow years of global regulatory scrutiny and several high-profile incidents within the crypto sector. Notably, the collapse of the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin in 2022 demonstrated the profound market volatility and consumer harm possible when a prominent digital asset fails. Subsequently, regulators worldwide accelerated their efforts to understand and mitigate risks associated with stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to reserves like fiat currency. In the United Kingdom, this process aligns with the government’s broader ambition to establish the country as a global hub for crypto-asset technology. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 already granted regulators explicit powers to oversee the promotion and trading of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of England’s current focus on failure preparedness and consumer protection represents the next logical, and arguably most critical, phase of this regulatory journey. It signals a move from observation to the construction of a resilient safety net. Expert Analysis on Systemic Risk and Consumer Safeguards Financial policy experts note that the core issue revolves around contagion risk. A systemically important stablecoin, one with massive adoption and deep integration into payment systems, could trigger a liquidity crisis if it were to collapse. The proposed protections aim to prevent a digital bank run. By exploring deposit-like insurance, the Bank of England is essentially considering extending the financial safety net that has underpinned public confidence in traditional banking for decades into the digital realm. This approach involves significant complexity. For example, regulators must define which stablecoins qualify for protection and what specific reserve or collateral requirements issuers must meet. The table below outlines a potential comparison between existing bank deposit safeguards and the proposed stablecoin framework: Protection Feature Commercial Bank Deposits (FSCS) Proposed Stablecoin Framework Insurance Limit Up to £85,000 per person, per bank Limit under consideration (potentially tiered) Coverage Trigger Bank failure Stablecoin issuer insolvency/break of peg Funding Source Levies on the banking industry Likely levies on stablecoin issuers/transactions Priority in Bankruptcy Depositors are preferential creditors Stablecoin holders could become preferential creditors Implementing such a system requires careful legislative drafting. The legal concept of designating holders as priority creditors would fundamentally alter the risk profile for investors and users. It would provide a clear hierarchy for asset distribution if an issuer becomes insolvent, potentially making stablecoins a more attractive and secure vehicle for everyday transactions and savings. Global Implications and Market Impact The Bank of England’s stance will inevitably influence regulatory discussions in other major economies, including the European Union and the United States. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, fully applicable in 2025, already imposes strict requirements on stablecoin issuers but does not currently mandate a deposit insurance-style scheme. Similarly, U.S. regulatory bodies have debated various approaches but lack a unified federal framework. Therefore, the UK’s proactive steps could set a new international benchmark for consumer protection in digital finance. Market reaction to this news has been cautiously optimistic. Industry advocates argue that clear, robust regulation legitimizes stablecoins as a payment tool and store of value. However, they also warn that overly burdensome requirements could stifle innovation or push development to less regulated jurisdictions. The central bank must balance several key objectives: Financial Stability: Preventing systemic risk from crypto-asset failures. Consumer Protection: Ensuring users are not exposed to uncompensated loss. Innovation Facilitation: Allowing beneficial fintech development within safe boundaries. Competitiveness: Maintaining the UK’s position as a leading financial center. This balancing act will define the final shape of the policy. The bank’s review will likely involve extensive consultation with issuers, technology firms, consumer groups, and other regulators. The outcome will determine whether stablecoins evolve into a mainstream, trusted component of the financial system or remain a niche, higher-risk asset class. Conclusion The Bank of England’s consideration of deposit-like protection for stablecoins marks a crucial moment in the maturation of digital asset regulation. By directly addressing the nightmare scenario of a systemic stablecoin failure, the central bank is working to future-proof the financial system. This move towards formal safeguards, including potential insurance schemes and creditor priority, aims to build the long-term trust necessary for these instruments to achieve widespread adoption. The final framework will significantly influence the global trajectory of cryptocurrency integration, potentially making stablecoins as secure and familiar as a traditional bank account for millions of users. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a “systemically important” stablecoin? A systemically important stablecoin is one whose failure or disruption, due to its large size, high number of users, or deep integration into critical payment and financial infrastructures, could cause significant damage to the broader financial system and economy. Q2: How does the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) currently work for bank deposits? The FSCS protects deposits held at UK-authorised banks, building societies, and credit unions. It automatically covers up to £85,000 per person, per institution. If an institution fails, the FSCS aims to pay depositors within seven working days. Q3: Would all stablecoins qualify for this proposed protection? No. The protection would likely apply only to stablecoins that meet specific regulatory criteria, such as those issued by authorised entities, holding sufficient high-quality reserves, and being deemed significant enough to pose a systemic risk. Smaller or non-compliant stablecoins might not be covered. Q4: What are the main challenges in creating a deposit insurance scheme for stablecoins? Key challenges include defining the scope of coverage, determining appropriate funding mechanisms (e.g., levies on issuers), accurately valuing and securing the underlying reserves, and creating a legal structure that clearly establishes holder claims in the event of issuer insolvency. Q5: How does this UK proposal compare to stablecoin regulation in other countries? The UK’s approach appears more directly focused on explicit consumer protection via insurance-like mechanisms. Other regimes, like the EU’s MiCA, focus heavily on issuer authorization, reserve composition, and redemption rights, but do not yet mandate a comparable deposit guarantee scheme, making the UK’s potential path more analogous to traditional banking safeguards.

57179119,https://cryptonews.com/?p=474836,1768458215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57179119.jpeg,Eric Adams Rejects “Rug Pull” Claims Tied to NYC Token Despite Big Losses,https://cryptonews.com/news/eric-adams-rejects-rug-pull-claims-tied-to-nyc-token-despite-big-losses/,"Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams has rejected allegations that his newly launched meme coin, NYC Token, was linked to suspicious liquidity withdrawals that left investors facing heavy losses. Key Takeaways: Eric Adams denies moving funds, blaming NYC Token losses on early market volatility. The project admits to temporary liquidity rebalancing during the launch. Onchain data flagged large withdrawals, sustaining rug pull concerns. In a statement posted Tuesday to Adams’ X account, spokesperson Todd Shapiro said reports suggesting Adams moved money out of the NYC Token were “false and unsupported by any evidence.” The statement added that Adams neither touched investor funds nor profited from the token’s launch, insisting that “no funds were removed from the NYC Token.” NYC Token Team Blames Early Volatility for Post-Launch Price Drop Shapiro characterized the token’s sharp price swings as a familiar feature of early-stage crypto projects. “Like many newly launched digital assets, the NYC Token experienced market volatility,” he said, framing the turbulence as a market-driven event rather than a coordinated withdrawal. The response followed heightened scrutiny of onchain activity surrounding NYC Token , which suffered a steep drawdown shortly after launch. The project itself acknowledged liquidity adjustments, saying it had to “rebalance” amid strong demand. In a post on X, the team said its partners temporarily removed funds for time-weighted average price execution and later added additional capital back into the liquidity pool. Statement from Todd Shapiro, spokesperson for former NYC Mayor Eric Adams: pic.twitter.com/kza4UGvApJ — Eric Adams (@ericadamsfornyc) January 14, 2026 Those explanations have done little to calm critics. Independent analysts flagged transactions that appeared to drain liquidity near peak prices, triggering concerns among traders. One of the earliest warnings came from Rune Crypto, which alleged that roughly $3.4 million in liquidity was withdrawn shortly after launch and accused the project of operating like a rug pull. Onchain visualization platform Bubblemaps also highlighted unusual patterns. According to its analysis, a wallet connected to the token deployer removed around $2.5 million in USDC near the market top and later added back approximately $1.5 million after the token’s price had fallen more than 60%. Bubblemaps: 60% of NYC Token Traders Lost Money After Launch Bubblemaps further detailed the scope of trader losses. Of roughly 4,300 participants, an estimated 60% ended the token’s first hours in the red. Most losses were under $1,000, but about 200 traders lost between $1,000 and $10,000. A smaller group suffered losses in the tens of thousands, while at least fifteen traders lost more than $100,000. https://twitter.com/bubblemaps/status/2011465515148218478?s=20 Adams’ camp has emphasized that the NYC Token was pitched as a vehicle to support nonprofit initiatives and community education, not as a speculative investment. Still, the episode has fueled transparency concerns, particularly around governance and liquidity management. The project’s website states that the token is deployed on Solana with a total supply of one billion tokens, 70% of which are allocated to a reserve excluded from circulating supply. While the team has cited unnamed partners in its liquidity actions, it has yet to publish a detailed breakdown, leaving questions about oversight and accountability unresolved.

These simultaneous movements highlight the complex interplay between domestic politics, global investor sentiment, and monetary policy across Asia’s major economies. Market analysts now closely monitor potential intervention signals from regional central banks as currency fluctuations threaten export competitiveness and economic stability. Japanese Yen Approaches Critical 18-Month Low The Japanese yen continued its downward trajectory this week, trading near 156 against the U.S. dollar for the first time since November 2023. This represents the currency’s weakest position in approximately 18 months. Several interconnected factors drive this sustained depreciation. First, the Bank of Japan maintains its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance despite global tightening trends. Second, widening interest rate differentials with the United States make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors. Third, rising energy import costs continue to pressure Japan’s current account balance. Market participants particularly note the timing of this weakness. The yen’s decline accelerates amid speculation about potential early elections in Japan. Political uncertainty typically increases currency volatility as investors assess potential policy shifts. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance faces mounting pressure to address the yen’s rapid depreciation. Historically, Japanese authorities have intervened when movements become “disorderly” or threaten economic stability. However, current intervention thresholds remain unclear to market observers. Election Speculation Amplifies Currency Pressures Political developments significantly influence currency markets this week. Rumors about potential snap elections in Japan create uncertainty about future economic policies. Investors generally dislike uncertainty, which often leads to capital outflows from affected currencies. The yen traditionally serves as a safe-haven asset during global turmoil, but domestic political concerns currently override this characteristic. Analysts at Nomura Securities note that election timing could determine short-term currency direction. Early elections might signal policy continuity, while delayed elections could suggest internal political challenges. Japan’s economic fundamentals present a mixed picture for currency valuation. The country maintains a substantial current account surplus, which typically supports currency strength. However, this surplus has narrowed considerably due to elevated energy import costs. Additionally, Japan’s inflation remains above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target, creating policy dilemmas. The central bank must balance currency stability with domestic price objectives. Market participants increasingly question how long the Bank of Japan can maintain its yield curve control policy amid these competing pressures. South Korean Won Reverses Bessent-Backed Gains Meanwhile, the South Korean won experienced dramatic volatility following comments from Key Square Capital Management founder Scott Bessent. The currency initially surged after Bessent expressed bullish views on Korean assets during a financial conference in Singapore. His endorsement triggered substantial foreign buying of Korean stocks and bonds, which naturally boosted demand for the won. However, these gains proved short-lived as profit-taking and broader market concerns triggered a sharp reversal. Several technical and fundamental factors explain this reversal pattern. First, the won had already appreciated significantly against the dollar throughout early 2025, creating overbought conditions. Second, renewed concerns about China’s economic slowdown negatively affect regional currencies. Third, the Bank of Korea faces its own policy challenges as it attempts to balance inflation control with export competitiveness. The following table illustrates key currency movements across Asian markets this week: Currency Change vs USD Key Driver Japanese Yen -1.8% Election speculation, policy divergence South Korean Won +0.3% (reversed from +1.2%) Investor sentiment shift, regional concerns Chinese Yuan -0.5% Economic data, property sector worries Indian Rupee -0.2% Oil prices, capital flows The won’s volatility highlights several important market dynamics: Foreign investor influence: Global fund managers significantly impact emerging market currencies Sentiment sensitivity: Asian currencies remain particularly responsive to prominent investor commentary Technical factors: Overbought conditions often trigger rapid corrections regardless of fundamentals Regional linkages: Currency movements frequently correlate across Asian markets Central Bank Responses and Market Implications Asian central banks now face complex policy decisions amid these currency fluctuations. The Bank of Japan must decide whether to defend the yen’s current levels or allow further depreciation to support exports. Historically, Japanese authorities have intervened verbally before taking direct market action. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki recently stated that authorities “are watching currency moves with a high sense of urgency,” a phrase markets interpret as intervention warning. Similarly, the Bank of Korea monitors won volatility carefully. While a weaker won benefits Korean exporters, excessive depreciation could trigger capital outflows and imported inflation. Korean officials typically express concern about “herd behavior” in currency markets. The country maintains substantial foreign exchange reserves exceeding $400 billion, providing intervention capacity if needed. However, direct intervention remains relatively rare in modern Korean policy. These currency movements carry significant economic implications: Export competitiveness: Weaker currencies benefit export-oriented economies like Japan and Korea Inflation pressures: Currency depreciation increases import costs, potentially fueling inflation Corporate hedging: Multinational corporations face increased currency risk management challenges Tourism flows: Exchange rate movements affect regional travel patterns and tourism revenues Broader Asian Currency Market Context The yen and won movements occur within a broader Asian currency landscape experiencing multiple pressures. The Chinese yuan faces its own challenges amid property sector concerns and moderate economic growth. Meanwhile, Southeast Asian currencies contend with divergent monetary policies across developed markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions particularly influence regional capital flows and currency valuations. Market analysts identify several structural factors affecting Asian currencies in 2025: Interest rate differentials: Continued policy divergence between the Fed and Asian central banks Commodity prices: Energy and food import costs for resource-deficient Asian economies Geopolitical factors: Regional tensions and global trade patterns Technological shifts: Digital currency developments and payment system innovations Historical data reveals that Asian currencies often move in correlated patterns during periods of global financial stress. However, individual currency performance increasingly diverges based on domestic economic conditions and policy responses. The current environment demonstrates this divergence clearly, with political factors uniquely affecting the yen while investor sentiment drives won volatility. Expert Perspectives on Market Direction Currency strategists at major financial institutions offer nuanced views on Asian FX markets. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest the yen may face continued pressure until the Bank of Japan signals policy normalization. They note that real yield differentials fundamentally drive currency valuations, and Japan’s negative real rates disadvantage the yen. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley strategists highlight Korea’s strong fundamentals despite won volatility. They point to robust semiconductor exports and fiscal discipline as longer-term won supports. Regional economists emphasize the importance of monitoring several key indicators: Trade balance data: Monthly export and import figures for Japan and Korea Inflation metrics: Consumer price indices and producer price indices Central bank communications: Official statements and meeting minutes Foreign reserve levels: Changes in official foreign exchange holdings Capital flow data: Portfolio investment and direct investment patterns Market participants generally expect continued volatility in Asian currency markets. The combination of political uncertainty, policy divergence, and global economic concerns creates a challenging environment for currency forecasting. Most analysts recommend careful risk management and diversified exposure rather than directional currency bets in current conditions. Conclusion Asian currency markets demonstrate significant sensitivity to both domestic developments and global investor sentiment. The Japanese yen approaches an 18-month low primarily due to election speculation and monetary policy divergence. Simultaneously, the South Korean won reverses earlier gains following influential investor commentary. These movements highlight the complex dynamics affecting Asian FX markets in 2025. Market participants must monitor political developments, central bank communications, and economic indicators to navigate this volatile environment successfully. The Japanese yen’s trajectory will particularly influence regional currency patterns and export competitiveness in coming months. FAQs Q1: Why is the Japanese yen falling to an 18-month low? The yen declines due to multiple factors including Bank of Japan’s accommodative policy, interest rate differentials with the U.S., rising import costs, and political uncertainty surrounding potential elections. Q2: What caused the South Korean won to reverse its gains? The won reversed after initial strength driven by positive investor comments. Profit-taking, overbought conditions, and broader regional concerns triggered the correction despite fundamentally strong Korean economic indicators. Q3: How do Asian central banks typically respond to currency volatility? Central banks use verbal intervention, interest rate adjustments, and direct market intervention in extreme cases. They balance currency stability with other policy objectives like inflation control and economic growth. Q4: What are the economic implications of a weaker Japanese yen? A weaker yen boosts Japanese export competitiveness but increases import costs and inflation pressures. It affects corporate earnings, tourism flows, and regional trade dynamics across Asia. Q5: How do political developments affect currency markets? Political uncertainty typically increases currency volatility as investors assess potential policy changes. Election timing, leadership transitions, and policy direction all influence investor confidence and capital flows.

This follows on the heels of a similar license and Crypto asset Registration given by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) last Friday. EU Regulatory Progress In its press release , Ripple emphasized that these new licenses contribute to its extensive portfolio, now exceeding 75 regulatory approvals worldwide, positioning Ripple as one of the most licensed cryptocurrency companies globally. Monica Long, President of Ripple, remarked on the significance of the European Union’s evolving stance regarding digital assets: The EU was among the first major jurisdictions to introduce comprehensive digital assets regulation, which provides the certainty that financial institutions need to transition from pilot programs to large-scale commercial operations. By expanding its licensing capabilities and refining its payment solutions , the crypto giant aims to facilitate the movement of value and unlock what it describes as “trillions of dollars in dormant capital,” pushing legacy financial systems into a digital era. Cassie Craddock, Managing Director for the UK and Europe at Ripple, echoed this sentiment, praising Luxembourg’s progressive regulatory environment toward digital assets stating: Thanks to the CSSF’s sophisticated supervisory approach, Luxembourg is establishing itself as a hub for financial innovation by delivering the harmonized framework and legal certainty that our industry requires. She highlighted that this preliminary approval is a crucial milestone, enabling Ripple to offer essential blockchain infrastructure to clients throughout the European Union. The preliminary approval, which arrives in the form of a ‘Green Light Letter’ from the CSSF, represents a vital step towards Ripple securing its full EMI authorization, contingent upon meeting specific conditions. Ripple Highlights UK As Key Market In its recent announcement regarding the UK, Ripple underscored the importance of the country in its broader global strategy, noting that London houses its largest office outside the United States since 2016. Notably, the company has demonstrated its commitment to the UK market through ongoing investments, which include a growing workforce and support for the local blockchain and developer ecosystem . Additionally, Ripple has contributed significantly to UK-based blockchain developers and startups, as well as committing over £5 million to UK universities through its flagship University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) program. In a statement addressing these developments, Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer at Ripple, expressed pride in the progress made with the EMI license and Cryptoasset Registration from the FCA: This is yet another major step forward, and it signals positive momentum for the UK’s digital assets industry, underscoring Ripple’s licensing achievements globally. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.1485, up slightly more than 3% in the past 24 hours as the broader crypto market has recovered since the start of the year.

Lighter launched LIT tokens last month, staking 50% of its supply, including airdrops and funding for future incentive programs. Perpetual futures trading and the Ethereum-based DEX announced that they have introduced LIT staking as a core utility feature for accessing their tools and features, beginning with the Lighter Liquidity Pool (LLP). Staking LIT is now mandatory, and depositing into the LLP unlocks a 1:10 deposit ratio, meaning one stacked LIT unlocks deposits of up to 10 USDC. The rollout is mandatory for new users. Existing LIT holders get a two-week grace period to begin staking According to the Lighter DEX, existing members have a two-week window ending on January 28 to maintain access to LLP without staking. After the deadline, all participants will be required to stake their LIT tokens in the liquidity pools. The Perpetual futures trading DEX noted that the introduction of mandatory staking for LIT will lead to greater alignment between LIT holders and LLP holders, thereby improving LLP risk-adjusted returns. The platform promised to replicate similar mechanisms across public pools to align with the vision of democratizing on-chain hedge funds. We are rolling out staking of LIT on Lighter! Here we will describe the initial utility from staking and how it will affect the Lighter ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/5NC8b4utuv — Lighter (@Lighter_xyz) January 14, 2026 Lighter noted that accessing liquidity pools (LPs) is vital across DEX ecosystems, as they provide insurance against liquidations and offer rewards to participants. The DEX platform announced that it will adjust premium fees for market makers and high-frequency traders in the next two weeks. According to the DEX platform, overall fees will increase, and staking LIT will introduce fee discounts, noting that current fee levels will be marked as the lowest fee tiers. Staking 100 LIT will unlock zero fees for withdrawals and transfers in addition to the existing features. Staking is also being rolled out to mobile users in the coming days, according to Lighter’s statement. According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , Lighter launched its native token, LIT, at the end of last month, just two months after its public mainnet launch in October. The platform distributed 25% of the supply to users via airdrops, with the remaining 75% fully unlocked and ready for trading. Additionally, 50% of the supply was allocated to the team and the ecosystem. 75% of the LIT tokens are to be vested over time through buybacks, staking, and incentives for growth and governance. Lighter to detail premium fee tiers for trading firms to adjust algorithms Lighter plans to roll out the exact details of the premium fee tiers soon so that trading firms can adjust their current algorithms accordingly. The DEX confirmed that retail trading will remain free on the platform. Importantly, staking LIT on Lighter will unlock yields, with the firm set to begin publishing the APR once it goes live. Based on the previous mechanism, yields were generated from staking rights granted to premium users. The perpetual futures trading DEX platform gained popularity after launching its public mainnet in October and reported approximately $200 billion in trading volume in December, according to DeFiLlama data . The platform outperformed other Perp rivals such as Aster, which registered $177.5 billion in December, and Hyperliquid, which recorded $169.3 billion during the same period. Lighter has so far achieved $54.9 billion in trading volume this month, against Hyperliquid’s $81.4 billion. The LIT token price was down approximately 12% at the time of publication, trading at $1.88, with a market cap of $469 million. The launch of LIT in December saw the price surge to $2.62 before dropping to $2.30 later. The token reached an ATH of $4.04 24 hours later, but has since been in a downward trajectory.

That’s how narratives are born in digital finance—through momentum, community belief, and projects that feel timed just right. Today’s conversation brings together Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Sui, Monero, World Liberty Financial, Polkadot, and a rising meme-powered contender that is beginning to dominate attention in serious circles. Among them, APEMARS is quickly emerging as a name that refuses to stay in the background. Without diving into mechanics just yet, its growing presence, branding, and community energy have positioned it alongside some of the top altcoin picks conversations happening right now. As one of the top crypto discussions gaining traction, APEMARS brings a bold tone that contrasts sharply with traditional projects while still aiming for long-term relevance. 1. APEMARS – High-Impact Meme Utility with Explosive Upside As the marketing lead at APEMARS , I can say this clearly: Stage 3 is officially live, and it’s moving fast. This is Operation Banana Boost, and it’s not waiting for hesitation. With only limited allocation per stage and a live countdown that updates automatically once tokens sell out, momentum is everything. Stage 3 has already raised $79,347, attracted 350+ holders, and sold 3.8B tokens, and this is just the beginning. The appeal is simple and powerful: this stage offers the lowest possible entry before the next automatic price jump, with an estimated upside reaching 22,300% ROI. Miss this stage, and the numbers change instantly. The timer doesn’t pause, and once the allocation is gone, the next stage launches at a higher price. This is why APEMARS is being discussed as one of the best altcoins to invest for those who understand timing and positioning within big crypto cycles. Investment Scenario: Presale Timing With Bigger Token Control Investing this amount at 1 during the APEMARS presale is about getting a foothold early and watching the project build. This entry secures roughly 40,850 tokens and ties into a listing return near 224.67, giving a clear picture of how presale access works. That same presale advantage extends with investing this amount at 2500, securing around 102,124,183 tokens before later stages shift attention. At listing, this aligns with a return close to 561,683.01, continuing the same early story with heavier commitment. How to Buy APEMARS Tokens Getting started is straightforward and designed for ease. First, connect your supported wallet directly on the APEMARS platform. Next, select your preferred crypto for purchase and enter the amount you wish to allocate. If you have a referral or bonus code, enter it at this stage to unlock additional benefits. Once completed, your tokens will be instantly visible in your dashboard, giving you full transparency from day one. 2. Bitcoin Cash – Fast Payments Focus Bitcoin Cash continues to emphasize usability as a digital cash system designed for fast, low-fee transactions. According to the best crypto to buy now , its larger block sizes allow higher throughput, making it suitable for peer-to-peer payments and everyday transfers without network congestion. As market volatility pushes users to explore alternatives, Bitcoin Cash stands out for its simplicity and proven track record. While not a presale asset, its established infrastructure appeals to those balancing exposure between emerging narratives and functional payment-focused networks. 3. Chainlink – Decentralized Data Backbone Chainlink plays a critical role by connecting smart contracts with real-world data through decentralized oracles. This function supports countless decentralized applications across multiple blockchains, making it foundational rather than speculative. Its steady integration across ecosystems highlights how infrastructure projects can quietly compound value.

Sui – High-Speed Layer-One Design Sui is engineered for scalability, using parallel transaction processing to deliver high performance without sacrificing decentralization. This architecture supports gaming, DeFi, and NFT applications that demand speed and responsiveness. As newer networks compete for developer attention, Sui’s design-first approach keeps it relevant. It represents how technical differentiation can coexist with narrative-driven opportunities emerging across the market. 5. Monero – Privacy-Centric Digital Cash Monero remains the benchmark for privacy-focused transactions, offering untraceable transfers by default. Its strong community and consistent development keep it relevant despite regulatory conversations. For users prioritizing financial privacy, Monero offers a distinct value proposition. It often complements exposure to newer assets by addressing a fundamental use case that remains in demand regardless of market cycles. 6. World Liberty Financial – Governance-Led Innovation World Liberty Financial centers on community governance and financial empowerment through decentralized tools. Its model emphasizes participation and transparency, aligning incentives between users and protocol direction. Projects like this highlight how governance-focused platforms continue to evolve, offering alternatives to traditional finance structures while existing alongside faster-moving speculative opportunities. 7. Polkadot – Interoperability at Scale Polkadot enables different blockchains to communicate seamlessly, solving fragmentation across ecosystems. Its parachain model allows specialized networks to operate efficiently while sharing security. As interoperability becomes increasingly important, Polkadot’s vision remains relevant. It represents long-term infrastructure thinking that complements attention on early-stage, high-upside entries elsewhere. Final Words Each project in this article serves a distinct purpose. Bitcoin Cash focuses on payments, Chainlink on data, Sui on speed, Monero on privacy, World Liberty Financial on governance, and Polkadot on interoperability. Together, they frame the diversity behind today’s big crypto landscape. What sets APEMARS apart is timing, structure, and community-driven momentum.

Through this integration, TRON’s reliable and accessible blockchain infrastructure becomes available within MetaMask’s multichain self-custody experience, enabling users to seamlessly manage digital assets on the TRON network and interact with native TRON dApps all within one of the most widely used crypto wallets developed by Consensys . The native TRON support delivers a unified experience that allows seamless swaps between TRON, EVM, Solana, and Bitcoin networks within the MetaMask wallet. Users can connect directly to their favorite TRON dApps, send USDT seamlessly, stake TRX and manage digital assets with fast, secure, and low-cost transactions without the need for additional wallets or complex workflows. With TRON’s high-performance blockchain now available on MetaMask, users gain a more flexible, intuitive gateway to Web3 that reduces the friction of connecting to the networks they rely on most. “The TRON native integration into MetaMask significantly broadens access to a blockchain that processes more than $21 billion in daily stablecoin transfer volume,” said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson at the TRON DAO. “This integration empowers more users worldwide to interact with TRON’s growing ecosystem directly through a familiar wallet environment, supporting real-world payment and DeFi use cases at scale.” “As we continue expanding MetaMask’s multichain capabilities, native TRON integration represents another milestone in our multichain expansion strategy, joining Solana and Bitcoin as non-EVM networks now accessible through a unified interface.” said Rizvi Haider, Staff Product Manager at MetaMask. “This integration meets users where they are as we continue to move closer to delivering a truly universal gateway to the decentralized economy.” TRON has emerged as a core settlement layer for global stablecoin activity, with millions of active accounts and daily transactions across high-growth regions including Asia, Latin America, Africa and more. By combining TRON’s proven blockchain infrastructure and stablecoin user base with MetaMask’s industry-leading wallet technology, this collaboration lowers barriers of entry and puts decentralized finance within reach across emerging and established markets worldwide.

The exchange also filed an amended notice with the Bankruptcy Court to cut the disputed claims reserve by $2.2 billion, which is subject to the Court’s approval. If approved, the disputed claims reserve will be reduced from $4.6 billion to $2.4 billion, after which cash will be released for distribution to holders of allowed claims in the next distribution. FTX’s Distribution Service Providers (DSPs), Kraken, Payoneer, and BitGo, will be in charge of making the next distribution. FTX notified all holders of allowed claims that distributions will only be made to holders who have met pre-distribution requirements. Additionally, distributions for transferred claims will only be made to the transferee holder of an allowed claim that is processed and reflected on the official register of claims maintained by the Notice and Claims Agent. The 21-day notice period must pass without objections for the claim to be considered valid. FTX requests creditors to complete KYC with selected DSPs FTX is urging all customers and creditors to continue completing their Know Your Customer (KYC) verifications and submit their relevant tax forms to onboard with Kraken, Payoneer, or BitGo, in order to receive a distribution. Transferees will also receive their distributions if they are reflected on the official register of claims as of the February 14 record date. The 21-day notice period must also have elapsed without objection. The exchange has also cautioned all customers to remain aware of phishing email scams as distributions begin. The exchange is warning holders of allowed claims to be on the lookout for emails from scam sites that appear to be received from the FTX Recovery Trust or the Customer Portal. The phishing advisory notice clarified that the Recovery Trust will never request that customers connect their wallets to any external service. Meanwhile, FTX will be represented by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP as legal counsel. The legal team will also be assisted by Alvarez & Marsal North America LLC as financial advisor, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP as special counsel, and Landis Rath & Cobb LLP as Delaware counsel. The exchange previously received approval from the Bankruptcy Court to reduce the disputed claims reserve by $1.9 billion, from $6.5 billion to $4.3 billion, releasing cash for distribution on the scheduled date (September 30, 2025). FTX pursues over $1B lawsuit against Genesis Digital Reports on January 13 suggest that FTX is still pursuing the lawsuit against Bitcoin miner Genesis Digital to recover $1.15 billion as part of its clawback strategy. However, the Bitcoin miner has moved to dismiss the lawsuit seeking the funds invested by Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund before the FTX empire collapsed. Genesis Digital emphasized that the claims are misguided and jurisdictionally barred. According to Genesis Digital, the Cypriot company, headquartered in Dubai, does not have a U.S. office and should, therefore, not be required to defend claims asserted in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware by a trust for FTX. However, the FTX Recovery Trust is attempting to circumvent the jurisdictional issue. The Recovery Trust sued Genesis Digital, claiming that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried used misappropriated funds from his Alameda Research hedge fund to invest in the mining company ahead of FTX’s collapse. The trust described it as one of Bankman-Fried’s most reckless investments, involving “commingled” funds. It also claimed that the former FTX CEO paid far higher prices than what the company was actually worth. The purchases took place between August 2021 and April 2022, and the funds allegedly came directly from FTX user accounts. The trust specifically names Genesis Digital’s founders, Marco Krohn and Rashit Makhat, in the complaint. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The delay landed hours after Coinbase withdrew its backing for the latest draft, escalating tension over provisions that would curb certain stablecoin rewards and set new oversight lines for market regulators. Senate postpones markup amid bipartisan talks Committee Chairman Tim Scott said late Wednesday that the panel would delay consideration of the bill to allow more time for negotiations. He did not provide a new date for when the markup would be rescheduled. “I’ve spoken with leaders across the crypto industry, the financial sector, and my Democratic and Republican colleagues, and everyone remains at the table working in good faith,” Scott said in an emailed statement. “This bill reflects months of serious bipartisan negotiations and real input from innovators, investors, and law enforcement,” he added. “The goal is to deliver clear rules of the road that protect consumers, strengthen our national security, and ensure the future of finance is built in the United States.” The delay followed a similar move by the Senate Agriculture Committee, which on Monday postponed its own markup of the bill to Jan. 27. That committee also had originally planned to take up the legislation on Thursday. Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman said lawmakers had “made meaningful progress and had constructive discussions,” but needed more time to “finalize the remaining details and ensure the broad support this legislation requires.” Both committees must advance the legislation because they oversee the two key regulators that would police the crypto market: the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Stablecoin rewards at center of lobbying fight The postponement follows an intense lobbying battle focused on stablecoin incentives. Banks have urged Congress to prevent crypto platforms from offering yield-like rewards that resemble interest on deposits. They argue Congress set a baseline in the GENIUS Act, which bars stablecoin issuers from paying interest simply for holding a payment stablecoin, and want to close what they see as a loophole via exchange rewards. The Banking Committee’s draft would limit certain stablecoin yield payments by third-party platforms. Coinbase pulled support on Wednesday, with CEO Brian Armstrong saying the bill “would be materially worse than the current status quo” and that the company would prefer “no bill than a bad bill.” He argued it imposes a “de facto ban” on tokenized equities, adds heavy restrictions on decentralized finance, and grants the government “unlimited access” to financial records. Not all firms agree. Coin Center, a16z, The Digital Chamber, Kraken, and Ripple have backed the Senate’s effort, reflecting a split within the industry over how far Congress should go on rewards, privacy, and compliance. What the draft would do, and what comes next The draft aims to clarify how tokens are classified and would place spot market oversight with the CFTC. It would restrict paying interest solely for holding a stablecoin, while allowing rewards tied to activities such as payments or loyalty programs. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC would set disclosure rules. The House passed a related measure, the CLARITY Act, in July. Procedurally, both the Senate Banking and Agriculture committees must advance legislation because they oversee the SEC and CFTC, respectively. The latest delay extends the wait for a unified framework that could replace case-by-case enforcement with a single set of rules. For now, Scott signaled talks will continue. The timetable is unclear, but both committees say they want to finalize details and line up broad support before moving ahead.

In a post on X, Mullin confirmed that the company behind the real-world asset-focused Layer 1 blockchain will cut staff across multiple teams as it seeks to reset its cost structure after “the most challenging year” in the firm’s history. The decision to reduce headcount followed months of internal deliberation and came after efforts to curb spending and streamline operations proved insufficient to match near-term market realities. As per the announcement, the layoffs will affect teams across the organization, including business development, marketing, human resources, and other support functions, among the hardest hit. Mass Layoffs for “Leaner” MANTRA Mullin said the staff reductions were not a reflection of individual performance, while describing those impacted as talented contributors who helped build the ecosystem. The exec added that the Layer 1 blockchain had expanded aggressively throughout 2024 and into the first quarter of 2025 in an attempt to scale quickly within the RWA tokenization sector, investing heavily in its blockchain infrastructure, ecosystem development, and go-to-market efforts. However, a combination of factors, such as the long crypto market downturn, intense competition, and “unfortunate and unfair” events in April 2025, left the company with a cost base that was no longer sustainable. As a result, management concluded that deeper cuts were necessary to preserve runway and refocus the business. Mullin said the restructuring is intended to make MANTRA significantly “leaner” this year. This is expected to allow the company to concentrate resources on a narrower set of high-priority initiatives while executing with greater discipline. “I take full accountability for these decisions and for the path that led us here. I know this is an incredibly challenging situation, particularly for those directly impacted, for their families, and for everyone at MANTRA. I’m especially sorry to those leaving us.” OM Token Crash MANTRA’s struggles trace back to April 2025, when its native token OM plummeted nearly 90% in a single day. The event triggered massive liquidations and investor panic. In response, Mullin pledged to burn the team’s 300 million OM tokens. This move was aimed at restoring trust. The burn was executed in late April, which permanently reduced the circulating supply, lowered staking ratios, and sought to stabilize the ecosystem amid intense scrutiny over alleged insider activity and governance concerns.

The current price of XRP has plummeted, falling by as much as 15% in one week, although it is heartening that some devoted investors have chosen this time to invest in XRP, it is clear that this is not yet a positive trend on the market. XRP needs to break through many critical points just to halt its depreciation, and its future prospects in terms of growth in 2026 are far from clear, which is leaving many investors wondering if XRP is still the best cryptocurrency on which to invest. At the same time, there is a shift in focus to new crypto coins with excellent plans and development activities in place. One such project that has caught the attention of many people is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is considered the best cheapest crypto to buy today because of its presale price and the growth strategy in place. Instead of waiting for other assets to recover in value, MUTM provides an opportunity to earn when looking for the best crypto to buy today. The Uphill Battle Facing XRP The current decline in the price of XRP is a continuation of its struggles, given that the token has fallen below a number of key technical support levels that previously helped to support the price. Some holders of the token believe that a recovery is possible, and therefore they have continued to accumulate the token. If XRP wishes to regain momentum in 2026, it has to overcome significant resistance levels, apart from the uncertainties associated with market sentiment and legal issues, without depending on new mechanisms for the generation of income. Since XRP, at the moment, lacks the mechanism for the generation of yield or passive income, the speculative nature associated with XRP makes it difficult to be perceived as the next big thing in the crypto market for steady growth. Mutuum Finance Presale Opportunity Another project that is getting popularity among the best cryptos to buy now is Mutuum Finance. The project is at Phase 7 in its presale stage, with token costs set at only $0.04. It is the most affordable option in the cryptos to buy now list, with the last opportunity to invest at this low price. It costs only $200 to buy 5,000 MUTM tokens. However, once the phase is complete, the price of the token begins to appreciate to $0.06 at launch, causing the $200 to instantly escalate to $300, which marks a $100 profit. According to market analysts, the increasing demand may drive the price up to $0.10, increasing the value of the same investment to $500. This straightforward trajectory makes MUTM one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy for short-term returns and the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now. Flexibility of Peer-to-Peer Lending In addition to presale functionality, Mutuum Finance has a real-world use case for Peer-to-Peer lending, enabling lending and borrowing of digital assets based on customized terms, which can be particularly useful for investors who hold assets that require customized terms for lending. For instance, an investor with $5,000 worth of Shiba Inu could use the money to lend at an annual rate of 12%, thus accumulating $600 within the first year without selling the investment. This addresses the question of what crypto to invest in when considering passive income and proves the point that the next big cryptocurrency could be MUTM. Stablecoin Issuance for Safe Income Mutuum Finance will also be launching an over-collateralized stable coin. This is yet another revenue stream. Users can lock more valuable assets as collateral, like locking $15,000 of ETH to mint $10,000 of stablecoins. These stablecoins can be lent out to generate returns, and with an annual return of 10%, an investor would be able to generate $1,000 in returns per annum. This further enhances the position of MUTM as a new crypto coin with long-term value and also one of the best crypto to buy. Your Chance for Major Growth Whereas XRP struggles with achieving stability, Mutuum Finance is moving with its functional model and multiple profit-making features that appeal to today’s investors. The presale stage of Mutuum Finance represents an early entry opportunity, while its lending and stablecoin models represent ways to accumulate profits. For those looking for the best crypto to invest in, the fact that MUTM is very inexpensive to enter and offers ways to earn and obvious growth potential makes it the best crypto to invest in as the markets change.

In the clip, Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson spoke candidly about Donald Trump’s decision to announce a U.S. crypto reserve that included XRP, ADA, and SOL. Trump announced the reserve in early 2025, shortly after his inauguration. While it was initially received well, Xaif presented the video as an example of why the process behind the announcement matters as much as the assets named. His point was simple. When decisions lack structure, markets react in predictable ways, and retail participants often pay the price. Charles Hoskinson criticizes Donald Trump’s crypto reserve move, alleging: • Altcoins like $XRP , $ADA , and $SOL were added without clear criteria • No transparent framework or weighting methodology • Insiders positioned early • Announcement triggered a pump • Followed by… pic.twitter.com/siVcECSrVt — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) January 13, 2026 Hoskinson Criticizes the Process, Not the Assets In the video, Hoskinson focused on the absence of objective standards. He said, “What you do is just create objective standards.” He made clear that none were presented. According to him, the decision appeared arbitrary. He referenced the moment XRP, ADA, and Solana were named, saying, “And I was just like, okay, well shit, I’m just going to get subpoenaed now when the Democrats get back in power.” Hoskinson also addressed market behavior around the announcement. He said, “People took positions before it went up and then short-sold it when it went down.” He called the sequence “extractive” and said it placed an unnecessary burden on the industry. His criticism centered on trust. He questioned why some large assets were included while others with similar rankings were not. These comments reinforced Xaif’s position. The issue was not XRP’s presence in the announcement , but the lack of a clear framework. Why XRP Still Stands Apart While Hoskinson criticized the execution, his comments indirectly highlighted why XRP continues to separate itself from the field. XRP does not rely on announcements or political gestures to justify its relevance. Its value proposition already exists. XRP’s role in cross-border settlement did not change because of the reserve headline. Banks and institutions are already using the technology , and liquidity corridors remain. These factors do not depend on who holds office or who makes an announcement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Progress After the Announcement Despite the issues from the announcement, the Trump administration has made notable progress in cryptocurrency regulation. The Genius Act was signed into law in 2025. Most enforcement actions against cryptocurrency companies were dropped, including the long-running lawsuit against Ripple. This move paved the way for spot XRP ETFs in the U.S., and the mention of XRP in these products has put it on the same level as Bitcoin and Ethereum . While the announcement may have caused some issues, the administration has followed sound structural principles that will bring significant benefits as the crypto industry grows.

The 1-day chart shows sellers rejecting moves near $0.104–$0.105, while buyers keep stepping in on dips toward $0.101. On the 4-hour chart, rallies keep stalling below $0.1039; holding $0.101 keeps a rebound possible, but a break risks more downside. On 15 January 2026, Cronos (CRO) trades near $0.1017–$0.1018 in the provided chart. The snapshot shows +4.85% on the described move and 1.68% (24h) on the panel, reflecting different time windows. Resistance stands at $0.1047 and support at $0.101, with a 24-hour range of $0.101–$0.1047. Cronos 1-day price chart: CRO holds the range while $0.1047 rejects breakout On the 1-day chart, CRO holds a clear range between $0.101 and $0.1047. Price tested the $0.104–$0.105 area earlier today but failed to stay there, then slipped back under $0.104, which continues to cap rebounds. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The main daily signal is the retest of $0.101 support. CRO drops toward that level, then stabilizes and bounces, showing buyers are still defending the floor. The bullish momentum will improve if CRO reclaims $0.1039 and breaks $0.1047 with follow-through. However, repeated failures near $0.1039 will suggest that selling remains heavy. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO buyers defend $0.101 while sellers cap rallies On the 4-hour chart, CRO made several pushes toward the upper band before a sharp selloff drove price back to the range base. On the 4-hour chart, the speed of the drop points to aggressive selling, but buyers stepped in quickly near $0.101, keeping that level as the short-term floor. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The next move depends on whether CRO can hold above $0.101 and form higher lows. That would support a rotation back toward the mid-range, with $0.1039 as the first key hurdle. If rebounds keep failing below $0.1039, a bullish rally will stay capped. On the other hand, a clean break below $0.101 would weaken the setup and open the door to further downside. Cronos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.1846 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.1570 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.09305 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.09465 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.09792 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.1256 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.1370 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.09974 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.1066 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.1303 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.1572 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.1591 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.1428 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.1271 SELL What to expect from Cronos? CRO is trading inside a tight range today, so the next move largely depends on how price behaves around the key levels on the chart. If support at $0.101 continues to hold, CRO is likely to keep fluctuating within the $0.101–$0.1047 band, with $0.1039 acting as the main pivot that decides whether rebounds gain traction. A move back above $0.1039 can open the way for another test of $0.1047, and a clean break with follow-through would improve the upside case. However, if CRO slips below $0.101 and fails to recover quickly, it would weaken the structure and increase the risk of further downside, since the range floor would no longer be intact. Is Cronos a good investment? CRO may look attractive if you expect the Cronos network to grow and token demand to rise with more real user activity, useful apps, and stronger ecosystem participation. At the same time, CRO remains a volatile asset, often driven by broader market moves, so it helps to weigh competition, ecosystem strength, and manage risk with clear rules and sensible sizing. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? CRO is down today mainly because it fails to hold gains near $0.104–$0.105 and gets rejected at $0.1047 resistance. After that, price drops fast back toward $0.101 support, which pulls the 24-hour reading lower even if there are brief intraday rebounds. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $0.50 by 2030, potentially increasing its market capitalization as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization, surpassing the current CRO coin price prediction for the cryptocurrency sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility. These strategic initiatives, along with CRO’s liquidity, staking rewards, and network governance, position it as a solid investment for those with a long-term perspective, especially considering institutional adoption.

The statements come amid legislative efforts to achieve that, which have resulted in a new draft law that will be reviewed in parliament this next spring. Russian crypto exchanges must be legalized, lawmaker insists Authorities need to develop rules allowing the legal operation of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, according to Anton Gorelkin, first deputy chairman of the Committee on Information Technology and Communications at the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian legislature. He took to Telegram on Wednesday to make his case, highlighting that fraudulent schemes are now utilizing foreign coin trading infrastructure to launder proceeds from their activities in Russia, which makes it difficult to investigate such crimes. He pointed to cases of fraudsters using Belarusian crypto exchanges to defraud Russian citizens, making millions of dollars in turnover in the neighboring country. From a legal standpoint, the crimes are thus committed in Belarus, which significantly complicates things for Russian law enforcement agencies that are trying to identify the perpetrators. Quoted by the Interfax news agency, Gorelkin stated in his post : “This is precisely why it is necessary to regulate crypto exchanges and create conditions for them to operate legally in Russia.” He also reminded that the new regulatory concept , an excerpt of which was released recently by the Central Bank of Russia, features a 300,000 ruble ($3,800) annual limit for the digital asset purchases of non-qualified investors. “Since victims of such schemes typically have a rather superficial understanding of the crypto market, this threshold will help mitigate the damage caused by fraudsters,” the lawmaker explained. Sberbank calls for proper legal framework for cryptocurrencies Meanwhile, Russia’s largest bank joined calls for introducing proper crypto rules, too. It’s impossible to effectively fight fraud without comprehensive regulation of this space, a high-ranking representative of the institution warned. According to Stanislav Kuznetsov, deputy chairman of the Management Board of Sberbank, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by criminals as a tool to convert and withdraw stolen funds. The absence of clear legislation limits actions against these crimes to merely addressing the consequences rather than the causes, he remarked this week. In an interview with the RIA Novosti news agency, also quoted by Gazeta.ru, the executive of the majority state-owned giant insisted: “To combat illegal schemes, it is necessary to create a modern legal framework and a system of transparent standards and rules for participants in the cryptocurrency sector.” Kuznetsov emphasized crypto exchanges and other platforms should be involved in efforts to prevent trading through money mules, including by participating in data exchange within the national “Antifraud” information system. The Sber official highlighted that without regulating the cryptocurrency market, it is impossible to block withdrawal channels for stolen funds, which results in less effective measures to stop fraud. He referred to the experience of Belarus in this area, noting that cryptocurrency transactions in the jurisdiction of Russia’s closest ally are permitted only through platforms registered in the country, allowing for stricter control and the freezing of suspicious transactions. The banker elaborated further: “The timely establishment of balanced regulation will not only effectively combat fraud but will also become another driver for the development of a modern and secure digital economy in Russia.” Stanislav Kuznetsov also revealed that financial pyramid schemes active in the Russian Federation, which are increasingly posing as crypto brokers, defraud citizens of 1 billion rubles on average, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Russian lawmakers have already drafted a bill to implement the policy proposed by the Bank of Russia, the head of the Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, unveiled at the start of the week. The legislation is expected to be adopted by July 1, 2026. Get seen where it counts.

This strategic listing directly bridges a leading algorithmic stablecoin ecosystem with the vast liquidity and sophisticated trading instruments of the world’s largest crypto exchange. Consequently, it marks a pivotal moment for institutional and retail access to DeFi-native assets. The decision reflects Binance’s ongoing commitment to diversifying its derivatives offerings while responding to clear market demand for structured products around innovative stablecoin protocols. Binance FRAX Futures: Details and Trading Mechanics Binance will list the FRAX/USDT perpetual contract with up to 50x leverage, providing traders with a familiar instrument to gain exposure to FRAX price movements. The exchange will employ its standard multi-asset mode for the margin, allowing users to collateralize positions with various cryptocurrencies. This listing follows a meticulous review process by Binance’s listing team, which evaluates projects based on liquidity, network security, and public demand. Notably, the FRAX contract joins a select group of stablecoin-related perpetuals on the platform, highlighting its unique hybrid nature. Perpetual futures, or “perps,” differ from traditional futures because they lack an expiry date. Traders maintain positions indefinitely, funding rates periodically exchanged between long and short positions to tether the contract price to the underlying asset’s spot price. The introduction of FRAX perps enables sophisticated strategies like cash-and-carry arbitrage, hedging for liquidity providers, and pure directional speculation on the stablecoin’s peg stability and adoption metrics. Understanding Frax Finance and the FRAX Stablecoin To grasp the importance of this listing, one must understand Frax Finance. Launched in 2020, Frax is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. Unlike purely collateralized stablecoins like USDC or purely algorithmic ones, FRAX maintains its peg through a hybrid model. The system dynamically adjusts its collateral ratio based on market conditions, blending crypto collateral (primarily USDC) with an algorithmic, protocol-controlled value (PCV) component. The Frax ecosystem has expanded far beyond its core stablecoin. It now includes: Frax Price Index Share (FPIS): The governance token, accruing fees and protocol revenue. Frax Ether (frxETH): A liquid staking derivative for Ethereum. Fraxswap: An automated market maker (AMM) with time-weighted average market making (TWAMM). This multi-faceted ecosystem positions FRAX not just as a payment stablecoin but as a foundational asset within a broader DeFi monetary system. The Binance listing, therefore, provides a gateway to this entire ecosystem through a derivatives lens. Market Context and Expert Analysis The listing occurs during a period of maturation for both the stablecoin and derivatives markets. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the total stablecoin market capitalization holding steady above $150 billion, with FRAX consistently ranking among the top ten. Meanwhile, the crypto derivatives market continues to outpace spot trading in volume, indicating strong trader preference for leveraged products. “Exchange listings of DeFi-native assets, especially for derivatives, are a key indicator of mainstream financial infrastructure catching up with innovation,” notes a report from blockchain analytics firm Kaiko. “They provide necessary liquidity bridges and risk management tools for larger capital allocators.” Historically, similar perpetual futures listings for assets like MakerDAO’s MKR or Aave’s AAVE have led to increased spot market liquidity and heightened visibility for the underlying protocols. Potential Impacts on Liquidity and DeFi Integration The immediate effect of this Binance listing is a substantial influx of liquidity and attention toward FRAX. The exchange’s massive user base, which spans millions of active traders, now has direct, leveraged exposure to the asset. This visibility often translates into increased trading volume on spot markets and deeper liquidity across all trading venues. Furthermore, arbitrageurs will actively work to keep the perpetual futures price aligned with the spot price of FRAX across DeFi and centralized exchanges, enhancing overall market efficiency. For the Frax Finance protocol itself, the listing serves as a powerful validation. It signals to the market that the asset meets the stringent compliance, security, and liquidity thresholds of a top-tier exchange. This can bolster confidence among existing users and attract new participants to the ecosystem. Moreover, it provides Frax governance (FPIS holders) with a more transparent price discovery mechanism for the stablecoin’s market perception, separate from its direct peg to the US dollar. Comparison of Major Stablecoin Perpetual Futures Listings (2024-2025) Stablecoin Protocol Type Exchange Listed Listing Date Max Leverage FRAX Fractional-Algorithmic Binance Mar 2025 50x USDC Fiat-Collateralized Binance, Bybit 2023 20x DAI Crypto-Collateralized Bybit, OKX 2022 50x Risk Considerations and Regulatory Landscape While the listing expands opportunities, it also introduces specific risks. Perpetual futures trading is inherently high-risk due to leverage, which can amplify losses. Traders must understand the unique mechanics of FRAX, particularly its fractional-algorithmic design. Although historically stable, its peg maintenance mechanism differs from fiat-backed stablecoins, presenting a distinct risk profile. Additionally, the broader regulatory environment for stablecoins and derivatives remains in flux across key jurisdictions like the United States and the European Union, which could impact future trading conditions. Binance mitigates some risks through its risk management framework, including auto-deleveraging (ADL) and insurance fund mechanisms. However, users should conduct thorough research, as emphasized in all official exchange communications. The listing does not constitute an endorsement of FRAX’s future value but rather provides a tool for trading its perceived market price. Conclusion The Binance FRAX perpetual futures listing represents a meaningful convergence of centralized exchange infrastructure and decentralized financial innovation. By providing a leveraged derivative for a leading hybrid stablecoin, Binance enhances market depth, offers new trading strategies, and validates the growing institutional relevance of the Frax Finance ecosystem. This development underscores the ongoing evolution of crypto markets, where complex DeFi primitives become accessible through familiar CEX-based instruments. As the landscape matures, such integrations will likely become more commonplace, further blurring the lines between decentralized protocols and traditional trading venues. FAQs Q1: What are FRAX perpetual futures on Binance? FRAX perpetual futures are derivative contracts on Binance that track the price of the Frax Finance stablecoin (FRAX). They have no expiry date and use a funding rate mechanism to align with the spot price, allowing traders to speculate on FRAX’s price with leverage. Q2: Why is the Binance FRAX listing significant? This listing is significant because it provides massive liquidity and access to a sophisticated DeFi-native asset. It validates the Frax protocol’s stability and integrates a hybrid stablecoin into mainstream crypto trading tools, potentially increasing its adoption and utility. Q3: How does FRAX differ from USDT or USDC? Unlike the fully collateralized USDT and USDC, FRAX uses a fractional-algorithmic model. It is partially backed by collateral like USDC and partially stabilized by an algorithmic mechanism that adjusts supply based on demand, aiming for a more capital-efficient stablecoin. Q4: What risks are involved in trading FRAX perpetuals? Key risks include high leverage magnifying losses, potential de-pegging events specific to FRAX’s algorithmic component, general cryptocurrency market volatility, and the complexities of perpetual funding rates. Traders should understand these before participating. Q5: Can I use the FRAX perpetual to hedge other DeFi positions? Yes, theoretically. Liquidity providers in Frax Finance pools or holders of FPIS governance tokens could use short positions in FRAX perpetuals to hedge against downside risk related to the protocol’s stability or overall DeFi market downturns.

57181011,https://cryptonews.com/?p=474857,1768464000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57181011.jpeg,New York Prosecutor Pushes to Criminalize Unlicensed Crypto Operations,https://cryptonews.com/news/new-york-prosecutor-pushes-to-criminalize-unlicensed-crypto-operations/,"A senior New York prosecutor is urging state lawmakers to take a tougher stance on cryptocurrency crime, warning that regulatory gaps are allowing billions of dollars in illicit activity to flow through unlicensed platforms with little consequence. Key Takeaways: New York prosecutors warn unlicensed crypto platforms enable a $51 billion criminal economy. High-fee crypto ATMs are being used to launder illicit cash with minimal oversight. Lawmakers are being urged to mandate licensing and KYC for all crypto businesses. Speaking at New York Law School on Wednesday , Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, called on legislators to criminalize unlicensed crypto operations, describing a “$51 billion criminal economy” that exploits weak oversight to launder proceeds from guns, drugs, fraud, and terrorism financing. Bragg said closing those gaps has become a core priority alongside enforcement efforts targeting gun violence and organized retail theft. New York Prosecutor Warns Unlicensed Crypto ATMs Fuel Money Laundering Bragg focused heavily on unlicensed crypto kiosks and ATMs , which he said often charge fees as high as 20% to convert cash into digital assets while asking few questions about the source of funds. According to Bragg, these machines have become a preferred tool for criminals seeking to move dirty money into crypto without interacting with regulated financial institutions. “They know you’re laundering gun proceeds,” Bragg said during his remarks. “And they do it without necessarily asking you.” While Manhattan prosecutors have successfully brought cases involving unlicensed Bitcoin ATM operations and terror financing schemes, Bragg warned that current laws force investigators to rely too often on criminals making mistakes. He argued that enforcement should not depend on someone accidentally touching the traditional banking system or boasting about their crimes online. “We shouldn’t need someone to slip up,” he said. “There are people far wiser than that.” Bragg proposed mandatory licensing and know-your-customer requirements for all crypto businesses operating in New York, backed by criminal penalties for violations. Any company involved in transferring, trading, or facilitating the movement of digital assets should be subject to the same baseline oversight, he said. “If you are operating a crypto business, you should be licensed,” Bragg said. “It’s that simple.” If adopted, the measure would make New York the 19th U.S. state to criminalize unlicensed crypto operations, according to Bragg. Supporters argue such a move would strengthen consumer protections and give prosecutors clearer authority to pursue cases tied to fraud and money laundering. New York Lawmakers Target “Pig-Butchering” Crypto Scams During a question-and-answer session, concerns were raised about elderly New Yorkers who have lost life savings to so-called “pig-butchering” scams, where victims are groomed online before being convinced to send crypto to fraudulent addresses. Bragg acknowledged the difficulty of recovering stolen funds and pointed to proposed legislation, including Senator Zellnor Myrie’s R.I.P.O.F.F. Act, as a way to expand recovery tools. The push in New York comes as federal authorities also escalate enforcement. Earlier this week, US prosecutors in Massachusetts sought the forfeiture of $200,000 in USDT linked to a romance-based crypto scam. As reported, crypto scammers defrauded victims of at least $9.9 billion in 2024, marking one of the most significant financial crimes of the year.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Pointing At ‘Neutral’ The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. It determines the investor mentality using the data of five factors: market cap dominance, trading volume, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the sentiment, the index makes use of a numerical scale running from 0 to 100. All values below 47 correspond to fear among the investors, while those above 53 reflect the dominance of greed. The metric being between the two cutoffs suggests a net neutral sentiment. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Activity Spikes To 5-Week High: Reversal Or Continuation Signal? Now, here is how the current market sentiment is like, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the index has a value of 48 right now, indicating that sentiment around Bitcoin is neutral. This is a sharp change from how the market mood looked just yesterday. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index had a value of 26 on Tuesday, which means that the investor sentiment was deep inside the fear zone. The reason behind the turnaround in trader mood has been the coin’s recovery rally, which has now taken its price beyond the $97,000 level. Since the Fear & Greed Index hasn’t made it into the greed zone yet, investors still look to be hesitant about embracing the bullish price action. In the past, the cryptocurrency market has often tended to move against the expectations of the majority, so the fact that traders aren’t outright greedy yet could actually be a positive sign for the rally’s sustainability. That said, the latest jump in sentiment has been a rapid one, so the indicator could be to keep an eye on in the coming days, as a venture into the greed zone could very well be next. The current break into the neutral zone reflects the first time since late October that the Fear & Greed Index has surged into the region. A greedy sentiment hasn’t been witnessed since the first half of October, more than three months ago.

Pakistan To Explore USD1 For Cross-Border Payments On Wednesday, Pakistan announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a crypto firm linked to the Trump Family’s main crypto business, World Liberty Financial. According to a report by Reuters, the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA) entered an agreement with SC Financial Technologies, a firm described as an affiliated entity of WLFI, to explore the use of its USD1 stablecoin for cross-border payments. The memorandum is set to enable “dialogue and technical understanding around emerging digital payment architectures,” and was announced during WLFI founder and CEO Zach Witkoff’s visit to Pakistan. Notably, Witkoff is also the CEO of SC Financial Technologies, which co-owns the USD1 stablecoin brand alongside World Liberty Financial, according to documentation on the stablecoin’s reserves reviewed by the news media outlet. Under the agreement, the WLFI-linked company will collaborate with Pakistan’s central bank to integrate its USD 1 stablecoin into a regulated digital payments structure. A source involved in the deal detailed that this would allow the token to operate alongside Pakistan’s own digital currency infrastructure. It’s worth noting that PVARA officials have previously affirmed that the country will launch a national stablecoin as part of its strategy to modernize payments and support tokenized debt. Additionally, the central bank is developing a pilot for a central bank digital currency (CBDC). “Our focus is to stay ahead of the curve by engaging with credible global players, understanding new financial models, and ensuring that innovation, where explored, is aligned with regulation, stability, and national interest,” said Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. WLFI Faces New Conflict Of Interest Concerns The news comes as WLFI faces some scrutiny in the US. On Tuesday, US Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Jonathan Gould, pressing the agency to halt its review of the bank charter application submitted by the Trump-linked company. On January 7, World Liberty Financial applied with the OCC to operate as a national trust bank purpose-built for stablecoin services in the US. The move is intended to facilitate the issuance of WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin. Moreover, it would allow the crypto company to provide custodial banking services and gain access to national payment networks under the OCC’s supervision. The democratic senator cited fears she expressed in July, when she told newly appointed Jonathan Gould that “the OCC may soon be in the position where it has to review a stablecoin issuer application submitted by a company directly tied to President Trump and his family and to draft regulations that clearly influence the President’s finances.” Unlike most of his predecessors, President Trump has not put his crypto ventures in a trust managed by an independent party, an October investigation stated, pointing out that instead, most of his businesses are owned by a revocable trust, of which he is the sole beneficiary, and managed by his son Donald Trump Jr. According to the Tuesday letter, Warren’s concerns have gone from being “hypothetical,” as Gould reportedly called them, to being a reality. The senator argued that if the application is approved, the OCC would promulgate rules that “influence the profitability of the President’s company” and would also be responsible for “directly supervising and enforcing the law against the President’s company—and its competitors.” Therefore, Warren requested that the OCC delay World Liberty Financial’s review until US President Donald Trump divests and eliminates all financial conflicts of interest involving himself or his family members and the company.",Crypto News|OCC|Pakista stablecoin|pakistan crypto|Senator elizabeth Warren|Trump Fammily|US President Donald Trump|USD1|USD1 stablecoin|WLFI|WLFIUSDT|World Liberty Financial|Zach Witkoff,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-15 08:00:51

Many assets claim relevance without meeting the operational standards required by global finance. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) cut through that noise with a direct assertion, stating, “Yes, XRP meets all three requirements to be a global bridge currency .” His post was an update to a previous comment highlighting the three important dimensions of cross-border payments. This framework treats cross-border payments as a systems problem, not a narrative one. That framing matters because global settlement depends on execution, scale, and compliance. Yes, XRP meets all three requirements to be a global bridge currency. https://t.co/ZNSyIfLP85 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 12, 2026 Dimensions of a Bridge Currency SMQKE identified “technical interoperability among domestic payment systems,” “adequate liquidity,” and “regulatory interoperability across various jurisdictions.” These are not abstract goals. Each reflects a condition that must exist before institutions can move value across borders reliably . A bridge currency must function inside existing systems, not outside them. XRP fits that role because it was designed to transfer value between payment networks, not compete with them. Technical Interoperability Positions XRP at the Center Technical interoperability determines whether different payment systems can communicate without friction . XRP enables that connection by acting as a neutral settlement asset between domestic rails. Transactions settle quickly and reach finality without dependency on correspondent banking chains. This allows payment systems to link directly while keeping their internal structures intact. SMQKE’s emphasis on interoperability points to XRP’s ability to operate where other assets struggle to integrate. Liquidity Enables Continuous Global Use Liquidity determines whether a bridge currency can support real volume. XRP maintains deep liquidity across multiple markets and corridors. This allows large transfers to execute without destabilizing its price action. Institutions require that stability. A bridge asset must remain usable during peak demand and across time zones. SMQKE’s reference to adequate liquidity highlights XRP’s readiness for sustained transactional use rather than episodic activity. Regulatory Interoperability Supports Institutional Scale Regulatory interoperability defines whether an asset can operate across jurisdictions without conflict. XRP has reached a level of legal clarity that enables regulated entities to engage with certainty. This interoperability supports adoption across borders where compliance standards differ. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Drives Price Expansion A bridge currency derives value from usage. Every settlement requires the asset itself. As cross-border payment volume grows, demand for XRP increases directly. Supply does not expand to meet that demand. This creates sustained upward price pressure driven by utility. When institutions adopt a bridge asset , they create recurring demand rather than speculative spikes. XRP’s alignment with all three requirements positions it for that outcome. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

These most recent data are already being examined by Federal Reserve experts to forecast potential price changes through 2026. Throughout the present year, this information will serve as the main basis for their interest rate determinations. The Labor Department released a delayed report on Wednesday that showed a 3% increase in wholesale prices in November. This came after a rise of 2.8% in October. A spike in energy costs played a large role in driving these numbers up. However, even when stripping out volatile categories like food, energy, and trade services, wholesale prices rose 3.5% for the year ending in November. This matches the 3.5% increase seen back in March, marking the highest level in months. Stephen Brown, an economist with Capital Economics, noted that the impact of tariffs on these numbers seemed minimal for now. Consumer costs and the Fed’s goal Data released on Tuesday regarding consumer prices for December showed a similar trend of “sticky” inflation. The “core” Consumer Price Index, which does not include food or energy, landed at 2.6%. While this was slightly lower than the 2.7% experts predicted, it is the same rate seen since September. Most importantly, it remains above the Federal Reserve’s official 2% target. Brown predicts that the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed’s favored metric, may rise to 3% based on these combined statistics. For the past three months, it had remained stable at about 2.8%. Tariffs were a big worry in early January, according to the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book,” which compiles reports from companies all throughout the nation. While some companies initially tried to pay for these extra costs, many are now starting to raise customer prices to protect their earnings. However, certain sectors have been less willing to shift such costs, such as restaurants and retail businesses. Businesses generally expect prices to stay high as they deal with these increased expenses. The economy as a whole has shown signs of strength in spite of these pricing restrictions. Compared to the previous four months, when most locations saw little to no increase in activity, eight of the twelve Fed districts reported a minor improvement. Diverse views among fed leaders The implications of the statistics for the future are seen differently by various Federal Reserve executives. The Philadelphia Fed’s president, Anna Paulson, stated on Wednesday that she believes tariff-related price increases are primarily restricted to tangible items rather than services. She does not think that it will result in long-term inflation as a result. She anticipates that goods inflation will revert to the 2% target by the end of 2026, with the most impact occurring in the first half of the year. Paulson stated, “I am feeling cautiously optimistic,” implying that the short-term trend would reach the 2% barrier by December, even though the full-year figure might appear excessive. She anticipates some “modest” rate reductions later this year if inflation slows down and the labor market remains stable. Fed Governor Stephen Miran is even more aggressive. He predicts that falling prices in services and housing will balance out the rise in goods. Miran has penciled in 150 basis points of rate cuts for 2026, significantly more than the single 25-basis-point cut predicted by most of his colleagues. Miran argues that interest rates should come down because the “neutral rate”, the level where the Fed is neither helping nor hurting the economy, has dropped. He believes lower population growth due to immigration changes will eventually bring inflation down. He added that it is still an “open question” as to what is driving up goods prices if not tariffs, citing possible lingering effects from the pandemic or tech export restrictions. Caution regarding lower-income families Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, is less certain about the timeline. While he believes inflation is falling, he isn’t sure if it will reach 2.5% or stay higher by year’s end. Kashkari noted that while high-income families are doing well, lower-income Americans are struggling. However, he clarified that their struggle is due to the high cost of living, not a lack of work. He warned that cutting interest rates too quickly to help the job market could actually backfire by making inflation worse for those same families. “Overall, the economy seems quite resilient,” Kashkari said. He noted that strong consumer spending and new investments in Artificial Intelligence are keeping the economy moving. The fact that the economy hasn’t slowed down more despite high rates has led him to wonder if current policies are actually as “tight” as they seem. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates exactly where they are, between 3.5% and 3.75%, at their meeting later this month. This follows a period last autumn when the central bank cut rates three times. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

That is exactly what Fundera Network is building: a platform designed to turn DeFi from chaos into navigation. And right now, Fundera’s $FDR presale is live , offering early access to the ecosystem at a stage where the best “asymmetric” opportunities usually exist. DeFi Got Too Big — and It’s Breaking Users DeFi started as freedom: permissionless markets, global liquidity, unlimited composability. But as the industry expanded, it created a new hidden cost: decision overload . Today the average user is forced to juggle: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, Arbitrum, Solana DEXs, lending, farming, restaking, points campaigns “new seasons”, “new metas”, “new launches” every week dashboards, scanners, bots, threads, alpha groups On paper, it’s infinite opportunity. In reality, most users feel one thing: fatigue . The biggest DeFi paradox of 2026 is this: There are more opportunities than ever — but it’s harder to use them effectively. The Real Scarcity Isn’t Yield — It’s Attention Most platforms keep competing by offering “more”: more charts, more metrics, more tabs, more tools. But the real scarce resource in DeFi isn’t information. It’s attention . Because attention is where the most expensive mistakes come from: picking the wrong chain using the wrong address rushing execution missing a key risk detail making decisions while distracted or tired This isn’t just a beginner problem. In 2026, attention is the true bottleneck — even for experienced users. When Information Stops Being Power There was a time when simply having better data meant having an edge. Early dashboards and analytics tools provided real advantage because most users couldn’t see what was happening. That era is over. Today: analytics are mainstream news spreads instantly the same market data is visible to everyone noise has multiplied So the key question has changed. It’s no longer: “Who can gather the most information?” It’s: “Who can ignore what doesn’t matter — and stay disciplined?” Alpha has shifted: from speed to selection. More Decisions = More Risk Every extra decision in DeFi creates another risk layer: emotional bias rushed execution technical mistakes fatigue-driven judgement errors And DeFi amplifies all of this because: markets never sleep, liquidity moves fast, contracts evolve, and one overlooked detail can erase weeks of effort. That’s why the smarter DeFi question in 2026 becomes: How do users build a workflow that minimizes decisions — while maximizing strategic clarity? Fundera Network: From Noise to Navigation Fundera Network is built around a simple but powerful belief: In the next era of DeFi, clarity is the real competitive edge. Not more dashboards. Not more signals. Not more tabs. Clarity. Fundera integrates DeFi actions into one ecosystem: trading, staking and farming in a single non-custodial environment multichain connectivity across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, Arbitrum and Solana an AI layer designed to filter noise and highlight what actually matters The AI is not positioned as a “magic signal generator”. It works as a system that helps users reduce distractions and focus on fewer, higher-quality decisions. Official Website: https://fundera.io Documentation: https://fundera.gitbook.io/docs Project X (Twitter): https://x.com/fundera_x Multichain — Without the Manual Work For most users, multichain DeFi still feels like an IT project: choose a network pick a route bridge assets check contract addresses estimate fees hope conditions don’t shift mid-transaction One mistake — and it gets expensive. Fundera’s approach is different: push complexity into infrastructure , not onto the user. A clear example: the $FDR presale (live now) Users can: purchase directly through the official website pay from multiple supported networks receive $FDR instantly on BNB Chain No manual bridging. No routing confusion. No extra tools. From the user perspective: choose the amount select the network confirm That’s it. And this simplicity isn’t a cosmetic feature — it’s risk reduction. Why Early Stages Matter Crypto has one repeatable pattern: The strongest growth often happens before the market fully prices a project. That is why early phases are where “asymmetry” exists — the stage where upside can significantly outweigh downside if the project executes . Historically, major DeFi winners followed a familiar trajectory: early adoption community expansion growing volume and liquidity broader attention and listings market repricing through price discovery Many users remember what happened with well-known DeFi names such as Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), Synthetix (SNX), GMX and others. To be clear: Fundera does not promise to repeat those outcomes. That would be irresponsible. But Fundera sits in a zone where those multi-cycle growth paths often begin: early stage ecosystem infrastructure direction (not a short-term farming product) alignment with powerful 2026 narratives: AI + multichain simplification + workflow automation This is why many early participants consider Fundera’s current phase worth attention. Because if product execution and adoption align, high-growth scenarios — including 10x, 50x, or even 100x outcomes — are not guarantees, but they become a realistic type of market trajectory that early-stage DeFi infrastructure projects have historically been capable of generating. And one thing remains true: Those scenarios are only possible early. Later, the asymmetry disappears. $FDR: Utility Built Into the Ecosystem $FDR is designed to function inside the Fundera system — not as a disconnected speculative asset. Access Holders unlock enhanced AI tools, analytics and platform capabilities. Participation Staking and farming incentives connect to real ecosystem activity and usage. Growth A referral and partner layer allows creators and community members to earn from 10% and above , paid in USDT or $FDR. In other words, the token supports the ecosystem — and the ecosystem supports demand for the token through utility. What Users Actually Get The value isn’t in complexity. It’s in what gets removed. Fundera users are meant to experience: one interface instead of endless tabs multichain capability without constant manual steps fewer prompts — but more meaningful ones AI acting like a silent co-pilot focused on clarity and risk The result: Less stress. Less confusion. Fewer mistakes. More control. In 2026, alpha isn’t just about finding opportunities. It’s about protecting yourself from unnecessary decisions — and the risk they create.

Most of these privacy tokens focus on concealing wallet addresses, providing transaction anonymity, and enabling sender-receiver identity features that regular blockchains cannot provide. Top performers in 2026 include Zcash, Decred, and Dash, which have attracted investor interest alongside the established Monero token, recognized as one of the best coins of 2026. These projects aim to address the growing concern about digital monitoring across blockchains amid tight regulations. Users now seek privacy-focused blockchain solutions. Pirate Chain token ARRR posts 168% jump this week In 2026, privacy coins are posting results that have never been seen before. For instance, Monero just posted 58% this week, Dash posted 109% in the same period, and Decred recorded 65% this week. The token movements have sparked a rally across multiple privacy-focused tokens, pushing their market caps to over $100 million and outperforming other niche cryptos. 80% of privacy tokens are up in 2026 As privacy meta continues to shine, many tokens are reaching new highs. Our data shows that 14 out of 18 privacy tokens with a $100M+ market cap have grown since January 1. Top gainers: $XNC +102% $DASH +74% $XMR +60% pic.twitter.com/eTRzwMEBGN — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 14, 2026 According to CoinMarketCap data , Monero dominates the privacy niche with a market cap of approximately $12.9 billion, followed by Zcash at $7.1 billion. Litecoin trails in third place with an approximate market cap of $5.7 billion. At the time of publication, Monero was up 0.56%, trading at $699.58, while Zcash was $431.2, representing a 0.26% growth on the 24-hour chart. Litecoin token LTC was down 0.27%,% trading at $74.4 during the same period. Among the top gainers this week is the Pirate Chain token ARRR, which has posted roughly 168% growth over the past seven days, with a 28% increase on a single day. ARRR was trading at $0.664 at the time of publication. Pirate Chain’s rebound after losing almost 98% of its value from 2021’s ATH of $16.9 reflects a significant shift across the privacy-focused crypto niche. Dash, on the other hand, shook the market this week after posting a 107% jump and the third-largest single-day rally of 32%, behind Mind Network FHE and Decred DCR, with roughly 52% and 36%, respectively. Dash, which launched almost 13 years ago, has also rebounded after losing roughly 95% of its value from an ATH of $1,642 in 2017 to the current value of $83.3. Dash peaked this week, rallying 107% and reaching a market cap of $1.02 billion. The crypto market’s attention shifted to privacy-focused tokens, particularly Zcash, with notable trades involving ZEC. These privacy-focused projects make it impossible to trace individual transactions and the source of funds for accounts, unlike other transparent blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. AngelList founder says Zcash is insurance against Bitcoin Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, posted in October that Bitcoin is insurance against fiat and Zcash is insurance against Bitcoin. This suggested that privacy and transparency had become major concerns across the industry. The developments sparked a rally across privacy-niche tokens, with the ZEC token nearly breaking its eight-year high of $703 set in 2018. ZEC recorded a high of $698 in November before dropping to $540 by the end of December. The EU’s DAC8 directive, which became effective on January 1 2026, requiring all crypto service providers to collect user tax data based on the Cryptopolitan report , reignited the rally across the privacy niche. The Dubai Financial Services Authority added to the rally by enforcing the updated regulatory framework for crypto in the Dubai International Financial Centre, which bans privacy tokens across trading, promotions, fund activity, and derivatives. The framework further bars regulated firms from using mixers, tumblers, and other forms of obfuscation services. According to research , privacy-focused tokens utilize advanced cryptographic tools to conceal data while ensuring that transactions across blockchains remain valid and verifiable. Tools such as Ring Signatures help conceal the true signer by blending with decoys. Other tools include Stealth Addresses, which generate one-time addresses for enhanced privacy and anonymity. zk-SNARKs, on the other hand, verify transactions without exposing underlying data, and MimbleWimble compresses data and hides transaction details for maximum anonymity. Collectively, these tools form the foundation of modern privacy technologies, strengthening anonymity across blockchains. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

57182048,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261785,1768467311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,DeFi Discord Exodus: Critical Security Failures Force Protocols to Flee Phishing Nightmare,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-discord-phishing-security-exodus/,"BitcoinWorld DeFi Discord Exodus: Critical Security Failures Force Protocols to Flee Phishing Nightmare The decentralized finance ecosystem faces a critical communication crisis as major protocols initiate a dramatic exodus from Discord, the popular platform now plagued by relentless phishing attacks that threaten user funds and protocol integrity. This security-driven migration represents a watershed moment for blockchain community management, forcing projects to prioritize security over convenience in their user engagement strategies. The recent decisions by Morpho and DefiLlama to minimize or eliminate Discord presence signal a broader industry reckoning with platform vulnerabilities that have persisted for years despite repeated warnings from security experts. DeFi Discord Phishing Epidemic Reaches Breaking Point Discord’s transformation from gaming communication tool to crypto community hub has exposed fundamental security flaws that malicious actors systematically exploit. The platform’s architecture, originally designed for casual gaming communities, lacks the robust security features necessary for protecting financial discussions and sensitive protocol communications. Consequently, phishing schemes have evolved into sophisticated operations targeting cryptocurrency users through multiple vectors including: Compromised moderator accounts that distribute malicious links Fake announcement channels mimicking official protocol communications Direct message phishing campaigns from hacked community members Malicious bot integrations that harvest wallet information These security failures have created what blockchain security analyst Maria Chen describes as “an untenable risk environment for financial applications.” Chen’s 2024 research documented over 300 major phishing incidents across DeFi Discord servers, resulting in estimated losses exceeding $50 million. The platform’s permission system, while adequate for gaming communities, proves insufficient for protecting against the financial incentives driving cryptocurrency phishing operations. Protocol Responses and Migration Patterns DeFi protocols have adopted varied strategies in response to Discord’s security shortcomings, with Morpho’s complete channel lockdown representing the most drastic approach. The lending protocol announced its transition to read-only mode on February 15, 2025, citing “the platform’s demonstrated inability to address systemic security issues that directly endanger our community.” This decision followed a sophisticated phishing attack that compromised multiple moderator accounts, though Morpho’s quick response prevented user fund losses. Similarly, DefiLlama has significantly reduced its Discord activity while expanding its presence on alternative platforms. The data aggregator now directs users to its verified Telegram channels and dedicated forum for critical discussions, reserving Discord primarily for archival purposes. This phased migration approach allows communities to transition gradually while maintaining essential communication channels. Other protocols have implemented hybrid solutions including: Protocol Discord Status Primary Alternative Security Measures Uniswap Limited announcements only Governance forum Two-factor authentication required Aave Read-only with bot monitoring Discourse forum 24/7 security bot surveillance Compound Minimal activity Telegram + GitHub Verification badge system These migration patterns reveal an industry-wide shift toward platform diversification, reducing reliance on any single communication channel vulnerable to systemic security failures. Historical Context and Platform Evolution Discord’s journey from gaming chat application to crypto community staple began around 2017, coinciding with the initial coin offering boom. The platform’s free accessibility, voice capabilities, and channel organization features made it ideal for rapidly growing blockchain communities. However, security considerations remained secondary to functionality during this adoption phase. By 2021, phishing incidents had become sufficiently frequent that major protocols began implementing basic security measures including verification systems and bot monitoring. Despite these efforts, the fundamental architecture issues persisted. A 2023 security audit by Blockchain Intelligence Group identified three core vulnerabilities: Inadequate account recovery protocols enabling SIM-swapping attacks Limited moderation tool sophistication compared to financial security needs API vulnerabilities allowing mass scraping of community member data These structural limitations have created what former Discord security engineer James Park calls “an arms race where defenders must be perfect while attackers need only succeed once.” The platform’s business model, prioritizing user growth and engagement metrics, has historically deprioritized the costly security overhauls necessary for financial applications. Alternative Platform Landscape and Security Considerations The DeFi communication migration has accelerated development of specialized platforms designed specifically for blockchain communities. These alternatives prioritize security features including end-to-end encryption, multi-signature moderation, and on-chain verification systems. Leading contenders in this emerging space include: Telegram : While offering superior encryption, Telegram faces its own challenges with phishing bots and fake channels. The platform’s anonymity features complicate user verification processes essential for financial communications. Discourse and Forums : Traditional web forums provide greater control and archival capabilities but sacrifice real-time interaction. Their asynchronous nature reduces phishing urgency but may slow community responsiveness. Specialized Blockchain Platforms : New entrants like Guild and Collab.Land integrate directly with wallet verification, creating cryptographically secure environments. These platforms verify user identities through blockchain signatures rather than traditional authentication methods. Matrix Protocol (via Element): This open-source, decentralized alternative offers end-to-end encryption and self-hosting capabilities, though with steeper technical requirements for community management. Each alternative presents trade-offs between security, accessibility, and functionality that protocols must carefully evaluate based on their specific community needs and risk profiles. Economic Impact and Industry Implications The migration from Discord carries significant economic implications beyond immediate security improvements. Community engagement directly influences protocol adoption, governance participation, and ultimately token valuation. Platforms that successfully balance security with usability may gain substantial competitive advantages in the evolving DeFi landscape. Furthermore, this shift may accelerate broader industry trends including: Increased emphasis on decentralized communication protocols Greater integration between communication platforms and on-chain identity systems Standardization of security protocols across blockchain communities Development of cross-platform verification systems reducing migration friction These developments could fundamentally reshape how blockchain communities organize and communicate, potentially reducing platform dependency while increasing security standardization across the industry. Conclusion The DeFi Discord exodus represents a necessary evolution in blockchain community management, prioritizing user protection over platform convenience. As protocols like Morpho and DefiLlama lead this migration, they establish new security standards that will likely define communication practices for years. This transition, while challenging, addresses fundamental vulnerabilities that have plagued cryptocurrency communities since their inception. The resulting platform diversification and security innovation may ultimately strengthen the entire DeFi ecosystem against evolving threats. The DeFi Discord phishing crisis has therefore catalyzed positive change, forcing the industry to confront communication security with the same rigor applied to smart contract development and protocol design. FAQs Q1: Why are DeFi protocols leaving Discord? DeFi protocols are abandoning Discord due to persistent phishing attacks that compromise user security. The platform’s architecture lacks sufficient safeguards for financial communications, leading to frequent compromises of moderator accounts and distribution of malicious links that threaten user funds. Q2: What specific incidents triggered Morpho’s Discord shutdown? Morpho transitioned its Discord to read-only mode following a sophisticated phishing campaign that compromised multiple moderator accounts. While quick intervention prevented fund losses, the incident demonstrated the platform’s vulnerability to coordinated attacks targeting DeFi communities. Q3: What alternatives are protocols using instead of Discord? Protocols are migrating to various platforms including Telegram (with enhanced verification), specialized forums like Discourse, and emerging blockchain-native platforms that integrate wallet-based authentication. Many protocols use multiple platforms simultaneously to reduce single-point vulnerabilities. Q4: How does Discord’s security compare to other communication platforms? Discord’s security was designed for gaming communities rather than financial applications. While it offers basic protections, it lacks the robust authentication, encryption, and moderation tools necessary for safeguarding cryptocurrency communications compared to more specialized alternatives. Q5: Will this migration affect ordinary cryptocurrency users? Yes, ordinary users will experience changes in how they interact with DeFi protocols. They may need to verify identities through new systems, adapt to different platform interfaces, and exercise increased caution during platform transitions. However, these changes should ultimately provide greater security for their interactions.

57183278,657868,1768467620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57183278.jpeg,Boycott Urged For CLARITY Act Draft: Expert Raises Concerns Over Banks Manipulation,https://bitcoinist.com/boycott-urged-for-clarity-act-draft-expert/,"As the anticipated markup of the CLARITY Act approaches, supporters of the digital asset market are raising alarms over the latest draft of the bill. They claim that the revisions pushed by banking lobbyists threaten to undermine the principles of the cryptocurrency industry. Ban On Yield Payments In CLARITY Act In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), market expert Nick Cash vocalized his strong opposition, stating that the current iteration of the CLARITY Act must be boycotted. He described it as a mechanism for banks to manipulate the future of cryptocurrencies, portraying their influence as a detrimental force for innovation in the sector. The revised version of the CLARITY Act, which serves as a comprehensive crypto market structure bill, introduces significant restrictions on stablecoin issuers like Circle and Ripple. Notably, these firms will be prohibited from offering yield back to passive token holders. Title IV of the Digital Asset Market Consumer Protection Act (DAMCA) outlines how regulated banking institutions can interact with digital assets, mandating that stablecoin issuers—defined by the GENIUS Act—cannot make interest payments to holders. Under the proposed changes, while stablecoin issuers would still be able to provide rewards tied to specific actions (such as account openings and cashback), the ban on yield payments poses a serious concern for the crypto industry, which has consistently viewed yield protection as a non-negotiable issue. Cash argues that the modifications may leave crypto-native issuers positioned at a competitive disadvantage against traditional banks. He warned that such restrictions could severely impact decentralized finance (DeFi) and the overall cryptocurrency landscape. Expressing his frustration, Cash stated that those supporting the revised bill are essentially siding with banks and undermining the crypto movement. Strong Public Support For Stablecoin Rewards Banking institutions have argued that allowing these interest payments could lead to a significant outflow of deposits from insured banks, threatening overall financial stability. In contrast, crypto advocates counter that blocking crypto exchanges from paying interest on stablecoins is anti-competitive and detrimental to innovation. Summer Mersinger, CEO of the Blockchain Association, articulated her stance, asserting: What is threatening progress is not a lack of policymaker engagement, but the relentless pressure campaign by the Big Banks to rewrite this bill to protect their own incumbency. She highlighted that the demand to eliminate stablecoin rewards aims to restrict consumer choice and stifle innovative financial products before they have the chance to compete. Amid this ongoing CLARITY Act debate, Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer at Ripple, weighed in, emphasizing that American consumers value their freedom to choose. He referenced new data from The National Cryptocurrency Association, which indicates a strong public preference—nearly 4-to-1—in favor of allowing stablecoin rewards, along with little appetite for government intervention to curb them. Ultimately, the future of the CLARITY Act remains uncertain as stakeholders continue to voice their concerns about the implications of increased banking oversight on the cryptocurrency market.

Some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is ready to continue its bullish momentum, arguing that the biggest rotation in years is coming. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears ‘Historic’ Technical Test As Price Eyes $93,500 Barrier – What’s Next? Ethereum Challenges Key Resistance Area On Wednesday, Ethereum broke past a crucial area and retested the $3,400 level for the first time in over a month. The king of altcoins has seen a 6% increase in the daily timeframe, jumping from the $3,100 level to the current levels. Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $3,000-$3,300 area since the start of the year rally, but failed to break the local range’s upper boundary during last week’s attempt. Now, the cryptocurrency has daily closed above this barrier and is testing this area as support. Amid this performance, analyst Michaël van de Poppe affirmed that “it’s ETH season” as the leading altcoin has held above the 21-day Moving Average (MA) since January 1. He explained that this level, officially lost during the early Q4 2025 corrections, is crucial for the price to hold onto to strengthen the momentum. To the market observer, Ethereum is “ready to make new highs and continue the uptrend,” and based on this structure, his main scenario is that the cryptocurrency will likely retest the $3,800 area soon. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that ETH is currently facing a “big test.” The trader noted that the altcoin has been moving within its $2,600-$3,300 price range over the past two months, adding that a breakout from this range is necessary to define the direction of its next move. Per the chart, Ethereum must reclaim the $3,350 level, where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) is located. This indicator has served as a key rejection area since November, and breaking above it “should lead to a move higher to catch the Daily 200MA next,” currently located around the $3,600 area. ETH To Follow Its 2018 Playbook? Crypto Jelle also shared an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency, asserting that Ethereum “looks better than it has looked in years” against both Bitcoin (BTC) and the US Dollar. He argued that both charts are poised to move higher since ETH’s downtrend against BTC is over, and its USD chart looks ready to push towards the $4,000 barrier again. He added that the ETH/BTC anticipated rally means “ETHUSD could see price move a lot higher over the coming months.” Similarly, Alex Wacy recently explained that the “biggest ETH rotation in 8 years [is] forming right now.” The analyst highlighted that the king of altcoins is repeating the same playbook that led to its 2018 breakout against BTC, but with “bigger players” and “more capital entering.” Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Hits New $610 All-Time High – Veteran Trader Shares Silver-Like Setup According to the chart, ETH saw a multi-year accumulation against Bitcoin between 2015 and 2017, leading to its massive expansion in 2018. After an initial breakout, the cryptocurrency re-accumulated for an extended period inside a falling wedge pattern, which resulted in a 50x pump from this structure. This time, Ethereum’s trading pair against BTC moved within a multi-year falling wedge pattern again, which was broken out of in Q4 2025. If history repeats itself, the altcoin could see a new massive surge against the flagship crypto over the coming months. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,375, a 5% increase in the weekly timeframe.

However, HYPE, the native coin of the Hyperliquid DEX, has dropped below $25 after losing 3% of its value in the last 24 hours. Its bearish performance comes as HYPE fails to rebound despite improved on-chain metrics and growing derivatives market activity. Hyperliquid’s DeFi growth could push prices higher HYPE is trading below $25 after losing 3% of its value. However, the coin could recover soon amid improved on-chain data. Hyperliquid’s staking activity increased by nearly 6% to reach $1.37 billion on Wednesday, suggesting that long-term holders have confidence in the project. The increase in staking also affected the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the network’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The TVL had declined to $1.3 billion as of Tuesday, down from a record high of $2.79 billion on September 19. This isn’t a surprise as investors lock their holdings in smart contracts when they intend to hold a token for the long term. This increases the staking balance on the network, which often has a bullish effect on prices, as the available supply in the open market decreases. In addition to the growing staking balance, the Hyperliquid derivatives market reflects investors’ optimism for a price recovery. According to CoinGlass , the futures Open Interest (OI) has dropped to $1.3 billion from $1.41 billion recorded on Wednesday. The decline in OI over the last 24 hours suggests that the retail demand has cooled down despite the broader cryptocurrency market’s rally. HYPE poised for a breakout despite recent pullback The HYPE/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient, with the market shift suggesting that the price could soar higher in the near term. At press time, HYPE is trading at $24.95, down 3% in the last 24 hours. The technical indicators suggest that HYPE could rally higher over the next few hours or days. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 55 is above the neutral 50, indicating that the pair has switched bullish in recent days. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the 4-hour chart is also close to crossing the neutral zone, suggesting traders should lean into risk. If the bullish trend resumes, HYPE could regain momentum and break out above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $28.22. An extended bullish run would bring other resistance levels into focus, with the 100-day EMA at $32.13 and the 200-day EMA at $33.25 close targets. A daily candle close above the $28.22 moving average could allow HYPE to rally higher. However, if the bearish trend continues, HYPE could retest the Monday low and resistance level at $23.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-most-xrp-holders-will-sell-between-5-and-10-heres-why/,"Crypto influencer JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) issued a clear warning to XRP investors about the price levels likely to trigger significant selling. According to his post, most holders will exit their positions when XRP reaches between $5 and $10. Only a small fraction (0.1% of holders) is expected to retain their XRP beyond this point. This warning suggests the $5 to $10 range will act as a critical test for the market. Investors who maintain positions through this period may be positioned to benefit from future gains. JackTheRippler’s post shows the importance of patience and conviction during this stage of the market cycle. WARNING: The majority of #XRP holders will sell their holdings between $5 and $10. Only 0.1% of all holders will retain their XRP. The price range of $5 to $10 will be the next shake out. Be part of the 0.1% XRP club. You have been warned! — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) January 13, 2026 Understanding the Shakeout The comments highlight a phenomenon often seen in markets with concentrated ownership. A large portion of retail investors tends to sell during periods of price acceleration. JackTheRippler’s post signals that the bulk of XRP holders will likely liquidate within the $5 to $10 range. However, many analysts see this range as the beginning of XRP’s next move , and only a small minority will hold through the shakeout. XRP Herald (@xrp_herald), another well-known figure in the community, reinforced this point, noting , “$5–$10 isn’t a top—it’s the liquidity trap. Only the 0.1% who hold through the shakeout see the real upside.” This perspective confirms that the majority of selling may be driven by short-term holders rather than long-term investors . A Strategy for Investors JackTheRippler’s post serves as a caution and a guide. It encourages XRP holders to evaluate their positions against expected market behavior. Investors may consider maintaining positions through the $5 to $10 phase to participate in the potential gains that follow. Those who exit early risk missing significant growth opportunities.

In a Jan. 14 statement shared on X , Adams’ spokesperson Todd Shapiro dismissed allegations that the former New York City mayor had removed investor funds or profited from the project’s early trading activity. “Recent reports alleging that Eric Adams moved money out of the NYC Token are false and unsupported by any evidence,” Shapiro said. The token, introduced by Adams as a way to promote civic engagement and combat antisemitism and anti-American sentiment, saw a surge in value shortly after going live on Tuesday. It peaked at a market capitalisation of $580 million, fueled by early trading enthusiasm. But within an hour, it collapsed by more than 80%, prompting swift backlash and speculation of a potential rug pull . PeckShieldAlert @PeckShieldAlert · Follow #PeckShieldAlert #RugPull Former NYC Mayor Eric Adams @ericadamsfornyc has reportedly executed a rugpull on his newly launched memecoin, $NYC . After the token was promoted on his personal social media, its liquidity was abruptly removed only 30 minutes post-launch, resulting in 2:35 PM · Jan 13, 2026 94 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies Much of the concern stemmed from blockchain data circulated by crypto analysts. Bubblemaps, a blockchain analytics platform, revealed that a wallet tied to the token’s deployer had removed $2.5 million in USDC liquidity at the peak of trading activity. Despite this, Shapiro stood by Adams’ position, attributing the token’s volatility to normal market behavior and emphasizing that Adams had no financial motive in the venture. “His involvement was never intended for personal or financial gain,” Shapiro said. Questions deepened after the NYC Token’s official X account posted shortly after the crash, stating that the team had “rebalanced the liquidity” using a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) mechanism. It also said that additional funds had been added to the liquidity pool over time, rather than all at once, to help stabilise price movements in the wake of intense launch volatility. As of the latest data, the NYC token is trading at approximately $0.138, with a market cap of a little over $40 million, where it has remained since the dramatic early correction. What is the NYC token? In a Fox Business interview appearance following the launch, Adams explained the project’s core mission. He said that proceeds from the token would be funneled toward nonprofit initiatives aimed at addressing antisemitism and anti-Americanism through educational programs. Further, he mentioned plans to use funds to expand blockchain literacy and offer scholarships to students from underserved communities in New York City. On the project’s website, however, not much information was found regarding the token’s future direction, other than plans to create “a decentralized financial ecosystem that’s as ambitious as the city itself.” Shapiro reiterated those goals in his closing remarks. “The NYC Token is designed as a free, voluntary way to support educational and nonprofit efforts. Claims suggesting otherwise are inaccurate,” he said. Adams, he added, “remains committed to responsible innovation and to using emerging technologies to strengthen trust, education, and shared civic values.” Adams was one of the most vocal political supporters of cryptocurrency during his time in office and led several major initiatives to integrate blockchain into the city’s ecosystem. During his tenure, Adams established the Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology and later formulated the NYC Blockchain Plan to promote responsible innovation and attract Web3 businesses to New York City.

This analysis, rooted in macroeconomic data, hinges on the inverse relationship between bond stability and investor appetite for digital assets. Consequently, the current financial climate presents a uniquely favorable setup for Bitcoin’s next major rally. Bitcoin Price Prediction Tied to Treasury Stability The core thesis connecting Bitcoin’s potential surge to Treasury markets is straightforward. Stable government bond prices facilitate easier credit creation and lower perceived risk in the traditional financial system. When this happens, investors and institutions often seek higher returns. They systematically increase their exposure to risk assets. Historically, this category includes technology stocks and, more recently, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The current period of exceptional calm in the $25 trillion U.S. Treasury market, therefore, acts as a potential launchpad for digital asset appreciation. This relationship is quantified by the ICE BofA MOVE Index (Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate). This critical gauge measures expected volatility in U.S. Treasurys over the coming month. As of this week, the MOVE Index registered at 58. This figure marks its lowest level since October 2021. For context, the index spiked above 200 during the March 2023 banking turmoil. The sustained decline signals a market expecting minimal interest rate surprises and stable economic policy from the Federal Reserve. The Historical Correlation: BTC, Nasdaq, and the MOVE Index Market analysts consistently observe a clear pattern in Bitcoin’s price behavior. BTC maintains a strong positive correlation with the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Simultaneously, it exhibits a notable negative correlation with the MOVE Index. When Treasury volatility falls, Bitcoin has frequently risen. The following table illustrates key historical periods of this inverse relationship: Period MOVE Index Trend Bitcoin Price Trend Key Macro Context Late 2020 – Early 2021 Declining from highs Bull run to ~$64,000 Post-pandemic stimulus, low rates October 2021 Near current lows (~60) All-time high near $69,000 Peak liquidity, low volatility 2022 Bear Market Sharply rising Steep decline to ~$16,000 Aggressive Fed rate hikes, high volatility Current (March 2025) 4-year low at 58 Consolidating, eyeing breakout Stable rate outlook, normalized inflation This historical precedent provides a data-backed framework for the current Bitcoin price prediction. The environment today mirrors the low-volatility conditions that preceded previous all-time highs. Mechanics of the Treasury-to-Crypto Flow Understanding this market dynamic requires examining the mechanics of institutional capital allocation. Pension funds, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries manage vast portfolios against benchmarks. Stable Treasury yields reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income ‘safe havens.’ Portfolio managers must then look elsewhere to meet return targets. This search for yield naturally flows into alternative asset classes. The process unfolds through several channels: Risk Budget Re-allocation: Lower perceived market risk frees up ‘risk budget’ for allocators to deploy into higher-volatility assets. Liquidity Conditions: A stable yield curve encourages lending and leverage, increasing the liquidity available for speculative investments. Sentiment Shift: Calm in the bond market fosters overall investor confidence, reducing the fear that typically triggers flights to safety. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s maturation as an institutional asset class strengthens this channel. It is no longer a fringe speculation but a recognized component of diversified portfolios. Major asset managers now offer spot Bitcoin ETFs. These products provide a regulated, familiar conduit for traditional finance capital to enter the crypto space. This infrastructure was not as robust during previous cycles, potentially amplifying the effect of current Treasury stability. Expert Analysis and Market Psychology Financial strategists point to the psychological impact of the MOVE Index level. A reading below 60 is historically rare and indicates extreme complacency in the bond market. While this can signal overconfidence, it also creates a tangible window for risk assets to perform. “When the bond market sleeps, the crypto market often leaps,” noted a veteran macro trader from a leading investment bank. This trader emphasized that the correlation is not immediate but unfolds over weeks and months as capital slowly repositions. Another critical factor is the Federal Reserve’s current policy stance. After an aggressive hiking cycle to combat inflation, the Fed has signaled a prolonged pause. Markets now price in stability, with no immediate cuts or hikes anticipated. This ‘Goldilocks’ scenario—not too hot to cause inflation panic, not too cold to trigger recession fears—is ideal for speculative growth assets. Bitcoin thrives in environments of monetary stability with easy financial conditions, which low Treasury volatility exemplifies. Potential Roadblocks and Counterarguments While the Bitcoin price prediction to $100,000 is compelling, a rigorous analysis must consider contrary views. The primary risk is that current Treasury calm is a calm before a storm. An unexpected geopolitical event, a resurgence of inflation, or a sudden shift in Fed rhetoric could spike the MOVE Index rapidly. Such a spike would likely trigger a broad sell-off in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Bitcoin faces unique headwinds: Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving digital asset regulations in the U.S. and globally could impact market structure. On-Chain Metrics: Analyst scrutiny of exchange reserves, miner activity, and wallet movements must support the macro thesis. Technical Resistance: Bitcoin must decisively break through key resistance levels near its previous all-time high to pave a clear path to $100,000. However, proponents argue that Bitcoin’s increasing adoption as a macro hedge and its fixed supply schedule provide a fundamental floor. The upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024, which reduces new supply, has historically catalyzed major bull markets. The current macro setup could amplify the halving’s effects well into 2025. Conclusion The Bitcoin price prediction of a surge beyond $100,000 finds strong support in the unprecedented stability of the U.S. Treasury market. The MOVE Index at a four-year low creates a textbook macroeconomic environment for capital to flow into risk assets like cryptocurrency. Historical correlations, improved institutional infrastructure, and a stable monetary policy backdrop converge to make this a highly plausible scenario. While external shocks remain a constant risk, the current data-driven analysis suggests the path is clear for Bitcoin to attempt its historic breakthrough. Market participants will watch the MOVE Index and Treasury yields closely, as their continued stability may well be the key that unlocks Bitcoin’s next legendary price chapter. FAQs Q1: What is the MOVE Index and why does it matter for Bitcoin? The MOVE Index measures expected volatility in U.S. Treasury bonds over the next 30 days. It matters for Bitcoin because a low MOVE Index (indicating bond market calm) historically correlates with increased investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, often preceding Bitcoin price rallies. Q2: How does low Treasury volatility lead to higher Bitcoin prices? Low volatility in Treasurys suggests stable interest rates and economic policy. This stability encourages lending, increases liquidity, and reduces the appeal of safe-haven bonds. Consequently, investors reallocate capital to higher-return assets, including Bitcoin, driving up its price. Q3: Has Bitcoin ever reached $100,000 before? No, Bitcoin has never reached $100,000. Its all-time high, set in November 2021, was approximately $69,000. The current analysis suggests that specific macroeconomic conditions, including the low MOVE Index, could provide the catalyst needed to break this record and reach the six-figure threshold. Q4: What are the main risks to this Bitcoin price prediction? The main risks include a sudden spike in Treasury volatility due to unforeseen economic data or geopolitical events, tighter-than-expected cryptocurrency regulations, or a failure of Bitcoin to overcome key technical resistance levels near its previous all-time high. Q5: How long might it take for Bitcoin to react to low Treasury volatility? Market reactions are not instantaneous. Historical patterns suggest capital reallocation based on macro conditions like Treasury volatility can take several weeks to months to fully manifest in Bitcoin’s price. The effect is more of a sustained tailwind than an immediate trigger.

Rather than vote, lawmakers cited the need for more bipartisan negotiations, after sharp opposition from Coinbase reignited divisions. At stake is one of the most consequential crypto bills ever proposed. The market structure legislation aims to draw clear regulatory lines for digital assets, defining agency oversight and delivering the legal clarity institutional investors and crypto firms have long demanded. After years of regulatory uncertainty, the bill is widely viewed as a potential turning point for the U.S. crypto industry. Well, momentum abruptly stalled after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong publicly rejected the latest Senate Banking Committee draft. After a 48-hour review, Armstrong said Coinbase “can’t support the bill as written,” warning that it would leave the crypto industry worse off than today’s already murky regulatory status quo. Armstrong warned that the draft bill is riddled with structural flaws that could set U.S. crypto innovation back years. He flagged provisions that amount to a de facto ban on tokenized equities, one of the most promising use cases for modernizing capital markets by bringing stocks on-chain. He also cautioned that broad DeFi restrictions could give the government sweeping access to users’ financial data, eroding privacy and violating core principles of decentralization. The bill’s regulatory balance is equally contentious. Armstrong argues it sidelines the CFTC while further empowering the SEC, reinforcing a regulation-by-enforcement model that discourages innovation. He also criticized proposed stablecoin amendments, warning they could eliminate reward mechanisms and give traditional banks the ability to block crypto-native competitors from the market. Although Armstrong acknowledged the bill’s bipartisan origins, his message was unequivocal: “We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill.” That warning appears to have landed in Washington. Instead of pushing through a divisive vote, Senate Banking leaders hit pause, opting to reopen negotiations rather than risk cementing flawed policy. For the broader crypto market, the delay is a double-edged sword. In the near term, it extends regulatory uncertainty. But in the long run, it may avert legislation that would entrench restrictive rules for years. The pause highlights a core truth that regulatory clarity is only valuable if it protects innovation, competition, and financial freedom. Therefore, the next few weeks will be decisive, either lawmakers craft a framework that puts crypto on equal footing with traditional finance, or the battle for fair regulation continues. Conclusion The Senate’s pause highlights a key reality that in crypto regulation, substance outweighs speed. A market structure bill that sacrifices innovation, privacy, or fair competition could cripple an industry still finding its footing. Notably, Coinbase’s pushback has forced lawmakers to confront these trade-offs, reopening negotiations that could determine whether the U.S. leads in digital finance, or pushes innovation abroad. The next revisions will test whether Washington can balance oversight with openness, or leave regulatory uncertainty intact a while longer.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-15 09:17:05

In its latest market structure bill, unveiled on Tuesday, the Senate Banking Committee discussed restrictions on stablecoin yields. Moynihan, speaking on the competitive impact of stablecoins, said Bank of America would adapt regardless of regulatory outcomes, although he insists the banking system would face a liquidity crunch. “So I think I would not, look, we’ll be fine. We’ll have the product. We’ll meet customer demand, whatever may surface. And so I don’t worry about it,” Moynihan surmised, before citing a US Treasury-commissioned research of how dire deposit migration could be. According to those studies, as explained by the BOA CEO, as much as $6 trillion in deposits could flow off bank balance sheets into stablecoin vehicles if consumers see themselves taking higher yields outside the regulated banking system. Banking deposits are already low US banks are trying to reconcile the gap between what they pay depositors and what they earn on government securities, and the battle seems almost lost. Per Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data, the national average savings accounts paying about 0.39%, checking accounts around 0.07%, and money market a meagre 0.58%, while Treasury yields stood at about 3.89% as of mid-December. Screenshot of Bank of America Q4 earnings. Source: X . The difference is a spread of about 3.82 percentage points, which is a major source of bank profitability. The traditional financial institutions could be looking to protect that margin by fighting what could help consumers count returns on their cash-like holdings. On page 189 of the Senate’s market structure bill, companies are barred from paying interest simply for holding stablecoin balances, though they may issue rewards only when linked to specific actions like opening accounts, making transactions, staking assets, providing liquidity, posting collateral, or network governance. “And the key of that is to think that the restrictions to be a stablecoin is basically think of it as a money market mutual fund concept,” Moynihan explained, adding that stablecoin reserves would be limited to deposits, central bank accounts, or short-term Treasuries, not deployed into lending. “And so when you think about that, that takes lending capacity out of the system.” The impact, according to the banking executive, would fall disproportionately on small and medium-sized businesses, which use bank credit more than capital markets. “So I think in the end of the day, at the margin, the industry gets loaned up. And if you take out deposits, they’re not going to — they’re either not going to be able to loan or they’re going to have to get wholesale funding and that wholesale funding will come at a cost that will increase the cost of borrowing.” Congress is ‘threatening’ banks with proposed stablecoin law Moynihan is among the trading groups that are pressing legislators to account for the risks stablecoins come with for banking institutions, and he admitted that the lobbyists are uncertain what changes might be made if the bill goes through Congress unopposed. Opponents of the banking sector on social media have accused lenders of wanting to “preserve profits” at the expense of consumers. Some users on X blasted the industry’s grievances and accused banks of taking advantage of depositors. “They basically steal all the yield YOUR money earns.. giving you pennies on the dollar. Then they find a laundry list of stupid fees to charge you… Overdraft fees? Yea you got a pay them for being poor. If we draw the line against the bank lobby. Stablecoin yield is where to do it,” said one commenter responding to the BOA head’s sentiments. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the legislation was initially expected to be marked up today, but has now been pushed to the final week of January. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman confirmed that a scheduled markup meeting was postponed, saying lawmakers had made progress but needed more time. “I am committed to advancing bipartisan crypto market structure legislation. We have made meaningful progress and had constructive discussions as we work toward this goal,” Boozman said, thanking Senator Cory Booker’s camp for being open to discussing the unresolved policy issues.

Lemon is the second-largest crypto exchange in Argentina, serving over 5.5 million users. The new Bitcoin-backed Visa credit card allows access to financing in pesos without having to sell or convert their BTC holdings. “We created a simple way to access credit in pesos using Bitcoin as collateral, without needing a credit history,” said Marcelo Cavazzoli, founder and CEO of Lemon, in an official statement . The rollout is the first stage in the product development, with simple mechanisms and a fixed amount. How Does Lemon BTC-Backed Credit Card Work? Per the exchange website, the user deposits 0.01 bitcoin as collateral – currently over $900 in value – and gets a credit card in pesos with a pre-assigned limit of $1,000,000. This way, Bitcoin is only held as collateral, and is neither sold nor converted. “Bitcoin is the best store of value created in the history of humanity and the fundamental piece for the new digital economy,” Cavazzoli added. Further, in the next phase of the project, users will be able to configure their own backup and credit limit. Additionally, Lemon is developing a solution to allow dollar-denominated purchases to be paid directly in digital dollars such as USDT and USDC stablecoins, the announcement read. User Benefits Lemon highlighted that users of the credit card will have commission-free purchases of digital dollars, Bitcoin, Ethereum and over 30 cryptos. Besides, exclusive benefits include early access to new features, newsletter with market info and portfolio summary. In the initial three months, the card’s maintenance will be waived by Rootstock, the company noted, following which, 7,500 pesos per month ($5) will be waived for users who purchase over $150 worth of cryptocurrency per month. “In Argentina, Bitcoin is the most held asset by Lemon users, above the crypto dollar and the peso,” it added. “With this card, Lemon seeks to transform those savings into an everyday tool.” The post Argentinian Crypto App Lemon Launches Bitcoin-Backed Credit Card appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Argentina|Bitcoin|CARDS,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2026-01-15 09:22:36

Interestingly, on-chain data showed large holders increasing accumulation while smaller retail wallets reduced exposure. Whales Are Back According to the latest analysis shared by Santiment, whale and shark wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have collectively accumulated a net 32,693 Bitcoin since January 10. In the process, these players have raised their combined holdings by 0.24%. This level of accumulation is the highest seen in approximately two months, based on its findings. However, the same cannot be said for shrimp wallets that hold less than 0.01 BTC. This cohort has collectively sold 149 BTC over the same period, which resulted in a 0.30% decline in their aggregate balances. Hence, there is significant divergence in behavior as accumulation remains concentrated among higher-balance wallets while micro holders reduce positions. This pattern has continued through recent trading sessions and coincided with BTC’s advance toward the recent uptick. Santiment said that this is the ideal setup for a bull run. The analytics firm also added that how long it lasts depends on how long retail traders continue to doubt the emerging mini rally. Additionally, social media data shows that sentiment toward Bitcoin has turned increasingly bearish this week despite a price rebound. In fact, negative commentary has reached its highest level in 10 days. Such a change historically is in line with upward price movement, as markets often move against retail sentiment. Hence, the rise in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) has raised the possibility of the crypto asset revisiting the $100,000 level for the first time since November 13. BTC Derivatives Flip Bullish On the derivatives side of things, BTC futures have moved into a bullish, risk-on phase for the first time in three months, according to analyst Axel Adler Jr. The Bitcoin Positioning Index climbed to 3.5 this week, which is its first break above the key 3 level since October. The index, which tracks open interest, funding rates, and long-short activity, indicates that bullish positions are building steadily rather than spiking suddenly.

Announced in London on November 15, 2024, this open platform fundamentally reimagines settlement by supporting real-time, programmable payments across an independent hybrid network. Consequently, the launch signals a pivotal shift in how institutions will handle transactions involving both foreign currencies and digital assets like cryptocurrency. LSEG DiSH Platform Architecture and Core Functionality The LSEG DiSH platform operates on a sophisticated hybrid architecture. This system seamlessly integrates both on-chain and off-chain transaction layers. Therefore, it provides unprecedented flexibility for financial institutions. The platform’s open design encourages third-party developer participation. Moreover, its programmable payment feature allows for the automation of complex financial agreements. These smart contracts can execute automatically when pre-set conditions are met. For instance, a cross-border trade payment could release funds instantly upon verified delivery. Key technical components of the platform include: Independent Network: Operates separately from LSEG’s existing trading infrastructure to ensure resilience and dedicated performance for payments. Real-Time Settlement: Finalizes transactions within seconds, a dramatic improvement over traditional multi-day settlement cycles. Multi-Asset Support: Natively processes major foreign currencies (FX) alongside a range of regulated digital assets and cryptocurrencies. The Strategic Context Behind LSEG’s Foray into Digital Payments This initiative is not an isolated development but a strategic response to evolving market demands. The global payments landscape is undergoing rapid digitization. Furthermore, institutional demand for digital asset utility has surged since 2020. Major financial entities now seek efficient pathways to tokenize and settle real-world assets (RWAs). LSEG, with its 300-year history operating the London Stock Exchange, possesses deep institutional trust and regulatory expertise. The group is leveraging this authority to build a compliant bridge between legacy finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Comparatively, other traditional financial giants have made similar exploratory moves. For example, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) in the United States has advanced its own digital asset projects. However, LSEG DiSH distinguishes itself through its explicit support for a broader range of digital assets from launch and its focus on being an open, programmable platform rather than a closed system. Comparison of Institutional Digital Payment Initiatives (2023-2024) Institution Project Name Key Focus Status London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) LSEG DiSH Open platform for FX & digital assets Launched DTCC Project Ion / Smart Settlement Digital settlement for traditional securities Pilot Phase SWIFT CBDC Connector Cross-border CBDC interoperability Experimental J.P. Morgan JPM Coin Internal blockchain-based payments Live for wholesale clients Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Regulatory Considerations Financial technology analysts view LSEG DiSH as a validation of blockchain’s utility in wholesale finance. Sarah Chen, a lead fintech analyst at Greenwich Associates, stated in a recent industry report, “The entry of a systemically important market infrastructure provider like LSEG provides a crucial layer of institutional credibility. Their platform directly addresses the twin challenges of interoperability and finality that have hindered broader digital asset adoption.” Chen’s analysis highlights how the platform could reduce counterparty risk and operational costs for banks and asset managers. From a regulatory standpoint, the platform launch follows extensive engagement with UK regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England. The UK’s Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 created a framework for recognizing digital assets as regulated financial instruments. LSEG DiSH is engineered to comply with these evolving standards from day one. This includes robust anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols embedded within the transaction flow. Practical Applications and Future Roadmap for the Platform The immediate use cases for LSEG DiSH are concentrated in wholesale banking and institutional finance. Primarily, the platform will facilitate cross-border payments and multi-currency settlements. Additionally, it enables the atomic delivery-versus-payment (DvP) of tokenized securities. For example, a bond traded on one venue could be settled instantly with a digital currency payment on LSEG DiSH. This eliminates settlement lag and associated credit risk. Looking ahead, LSEG has outlined a phased roadmap for the platform. The initial phase focuses on onboarding select banking partners and establishing core currency corridors. Subsequently, phase two will expand digital asset support and introduce more advanced programmable finance tools. The long-term vision includes potential integration with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as they develop. This forward-looking approach ensures the platform remains relevant amid rapid monetary innovation. Conclusion The launch of the LSEG DiSH digital payment platform represents a seminal moment in the convergence of traditional and digital finance. By providing a trusted, regulated, and open infrastructure for real-time multi-asset payments, LSEG is addressing a critical market need. The platform’s hybrid architecture and support for cryptocurrencies position it as a foundational piece of future financial market infrastructure. Ultimately, its success will depend on widespread institutional adoption, but its launch undeniably accelerates the maturation of the entire digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What is LSEG DiSH? LSEG DiSH is a new digital payment platform launched by the London Stock Exchange Group. It is an open, independent network that supports real-time, programmable payments using both traditional foreign currencies and various digital assets. Q2: Can individuals use the LSEG DiSH platform? No, the platform is designed primarily for institutional clients, including banks, asset managers, and other financial institutions. It is a wholesale financial market infrastructure solution, not a retail consumer payment app. Q3: How does the platform’s “hybrid” network work? The hybrid network operates both on-chain (using distributed ledger technology) and off-chain (using traditional database systems). This allows it to choose the most efficient and compliant settlement path for each transaction, balancing speed, cost, and regulatory requirements. Q4: What cryptocurrencies does LSEG DiSH support? While LSEG has not published an exhaustive public list, announcements indicate support for major, highly liquid, and regulated digital assets. The specific assets available will likely depend on institutional client demand and regulatory approvals in different jurisdictions. Q5: How does this affect traditional stock trading on the London Stock Exchange? Initially, LSEG DiSH operates as a separate system from the equity trading platforms. Its primary function is payment and settlement. However, in the future, the technology could be integrated to enable faster, more efficient settlement of traditional stock trades, potentially moving from a T+2 cycle to instantaneous settlement.

Most of these investors are now taking a keen interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto that has entered Phase 7 of its presale and is valued at $0.04. MUTM is developing a lending and borrowing platform that aims to create actual on-chain demand through the use of borrowing and staking functionality. It is being considered the top crypto to buy by many investors who are looking to capture the same kind of asymmetric upside as SHIB and DOGE when they first launched. From Meme Coin Millionaires to Utility Hunters In 2021, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) increased by over 1,000,000% while Dogecoin (DOGE) pumped 10,000%. But in both instances, the underlying assets had no real-world use cases, and once the hype died down, SHIB fell by well over 95% from its peak while DOGE fell by more than 80%. Investors who bought these tokens early still managed to make millions. These investors are now turning to Mutuum Finance as the DeFi crypto shows similar potential but with a utility focus. Presale Phase Rewards Early Adopters Mutuum Finance has structured their presale in an approach, whereby the plan benefits those who participate earlier in the presale. From the presale prices of $0.01 to the current price of Phase 4, priced at $0.04, MUTM has recorded 300% growth. The presale will usher in higher prices in the upcoming phases, which makes buying today important for investors seeking huge returns. The project has raised over $19.8 million and attracted more than 18,800 different investors. Market Interest & Whale Activity The presale has also attracted the attention of retail participants, as well as large accounts, which goes to prove that the level of confidence in the project remains high. One whale who was early in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has for instance put $105,000 into the presale. This is a strong vote of confidence in Mutuum Finance as the 2026 bull run draws closer. It also indicates that MUTM has gotten more visibility, which is why it has been identified as one of the cryptos to buy now. MUTM has a fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens. There will be no minting of new tokens to dilute the market, thus giving MUTM a degree of scarcity. Of the 4 billion tokens, 1.82 billion has been set aside for early investors via the ongoing presale. Over 850 million of these tokens have already been bought up by investors. Infrastructure & Price Discovery For the prices to be accurate and updated, the Mutuum Finance system makes use of Chainlink oracles, which validate the prices of the tokens in highly liquid currencies such as USD, ETH, and AVAX. For example, a user can deposit 10 ETH as collateral when ETH is $2,000, giving $20,000 in total value. Using Chainlink’s price feeds, Mutuum Finance could then allow this investor to borrow $14,000 at a 70% LTV ratio. If ETH drops to $1,500, the collateral falls to $15,000, raising the loan-to-value ratio. Accurate, real-time pricing is essential to prevent risk, especially during volatile markets. Mutuum Finance works with fallback oracles, aggregation feeds, and on-chain data to ensure that the prices are always updated regarding the assets’ collateral, risk management, and liquidation. This makes Mutuum Finance the best cryptocurrency to buy now. Why Investors Are Taking Notice With its early-stage presale investment model, functional DeFi crypto platform, concept of scarcity, and comprehensive infrastructure, Mutuum Finance has tremendous ROI potential. Unlike Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, the new DeFi crypto offers a strong utility focus and sustainable price drivers. Whale participation further cements the token as the best crypto to buy now.

Institutional market makers warn that crypto’s next major recovery in 2026 will depend on deeper shifts in liquidity and participation, while fresh policy initiatives in the US are quietly pushing Bitcoin closer to everyday use. At the same time, large traders are adjusting risk ahead of key legal decisions, adding a layer of short-term volatility to an otherwise steady market. On the charts, Bitcoin reflects this balance, consolidating after a strong breakout, with technical signals pointing to controlled, constructive price action rather than stress. Crypto’s 2026 Comeback Depends on Key Shifts, Wintermute Says According to cryptocurrency market creator Wintermute, significant adjustments in market structure following a poor 2025 will be necessary for a significant comeback in 2026. The typical four-year cycle for Bitcoin only saw a slight increase, and gains did not transfer to other cryptocurrencies, indicating that the cycle may be becoming less significant. Wintermute claims that last year’s liquidity remained concentrated in Bitcoin and Ether due to institutional inflows and spot ETFs. As a result, the market’s breadth was diminished and altcoin rallies were curtailed since investors stopped rotating throughout the market and instead became more picky. According to Wintermute cryptocurrency needs at least one of three things in 2026, institutions growing beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum a significant increase in large assets that generates a broader wealth effect or a return of retail investors. Reduced interest rates may encourage a renewed desire for risk.

Although this restricts the potential of altcoins it upholds Bitcoin’s hegemony. Bitcoin is likely going to spearhead any wider cryptocurrency rebound in 2026 if rate reductions and retail engagement rise. Rhode Island Reintroduces Bitcoin Tax Exemption Bill A plan that would temporarily remove minor Bitcoin transactions from state taxes has been presented by Rhode Island lawmakers for the second consecutive year. Instead than viewing Bitcoin as purely an investment the measure seeks to lower tax barriers and promote regular use of the cryptocurrency. According to the plan state income and capital gains taxes would not apply to Bitcoin transactions up to $5,000 per month with a $20,000 annual ceiling. Both private citizens and Rhode Island-based companies would be eligible for the exemption. This effort which is going to be a pilot experiment will start in 2027 and terminate in 2028 unless it is extended. Additionally, the law would make it easier for taxpayers to self-certify their status using simple documentation.

Mysterious Crypto Trader Bets Big Ahead of Supreme Court Tariff Ruling Ahead of the US Supreme Court’s judgment on President Trump’s tariffs which might have a significant impact on international markets an enigmatic cryptocurrency trader has taken significant action. The court is examining Trump’s legal authority to enact broad tariffs without the consent of Congress. The United States may be required to reimburse more than $130 billion in duties collected if the government loses the case. The trader closed almost $400 million in long positions before to the decision locking in about $14.5 million in profit when cryptocurrency prices increased following weaker US inflation statistics. The trader quickly switched to short positions speculating that the judgment may cause cryptocurrency prices to decline. WARNING: A BIG MARKET STORM IN 1 HOUR!!! – Supreme Court ruling on Trump tariffs – Starts in 58 minutes Polymarket is pricing around a 73% chance that the court rules Trump tariffs illegal.

News about tariffs and policies frequently causes Bitcoin to respond dramatically. A bad decision can raise market uncertainty and cause short-term Bitcoin volatility. Longer-term policy unpredictability however might still make Bitcoin more appealing as a risk hedge for the economy and politics. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Outlook: Technical Signals Point to Controlled Consolidation From a technical perspective, Bitcoin remains constructive. Price continues to form higher lows above the rising 50-EMA, while the 200-EMA trends upward below $94,000, reinforcing medium-term support. Pullbacks have been shallow and corrective, marked by small-bodied candles and brief Doji pauses rather than aggressive selling. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators support this view. The RSI has cooled into the 55–60 zone, a healthy reset following overbought conditions, with no bearish divergence visible. As long as Bitcoin holds the $95,700–$95,200 demand zone, the bullish structure remains intact. $100,000 Back in Focus if Resistance Breaks The current range resembles a bullish consolidation flag, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. A brief dip toward support followed by a higher low could set the stage for another push above $97,600. A confirmed break would expose $98,800, with extension potential toward the psychological $100,000 level. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $30.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013575 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

At the start of 2026, around 15,800 BTC were sent to the exchange, signalling a slower pace of deposits. Binance data shows that since the beginning of 2026, whales have slowed down the rate of transfers to the platform. For December, whales transferred a total of 37,133 BTC. To date, transfers to Binance are around 42.5% slower. The whale’s approach may signal a wait-and-see strategy. Whale inflows also dominated over retail deposits, increasing the average size of transfers to Binance. However, even whale deposits could abruptly slow down, signalling a shift in market sentiment. For now, BTC indicators are not yet bullish, but may signal a market bottom. Whale movements are closely watched for signals on a potential price recovery for BTC. The recent slowdown coincided with a BTC recovery to over $97,000. BTC retreated to $95,449.56, with predictions for regaining the $100,000 level soon. The most recent price upturn also did not lead to immediate selling, as holders did not rush to liquidate at the higher price. Mean inflows remain whale-sized Mean inflows to Binance remain near all-time highs. The mean deposit is over 20 BTC. Whales make up around 20.85% of total inflows, but are more influential on the size of deposits. Daily whale transfers are at around 2,200 BTC, a moderate level that can easily be absorbed by the market. Binance deposits remain larger on average, although whales have held onto their coins. The centralized exchange absorbed around 2,200 BTC daily as whale activity slowed down in January. | Source: CryptoQuant . The recent activity shows that the potential for capitulation is lower. BTC sentiment returned to neutral based on trader activity, and only retail remains bearish. The December downturn also coincided with a rotation into stocks and precious metals. However, the liquidity did not entirely abandon crypto assets, leading to a price recovery. Whale transfers may accelerate with more dramatic price moves. If BTC rises with a new rally, deposits may be an attempt to take profits. Whale transfers also happen during downturns, as a way to cut losses. BTC is 101 days from its all-time high The recent market downturn has continued for 101 days since the all-time high above $126,000. The current market cycle took only 236 days to achieve a new all-time high. During the past three months, BTC turned more volatile, ranging from its peak to lows just under $80,000. Historically, big liquidation events take between 3 and 6 months to rebuild liquidity . For now, the market is still affected by last October’s downturn. BTC open interest is back down to $30B, and is yet to recover reliably. The market still awaits signs of a direction, instead of a range-bound liquidation of short and long positions. At the current price range, over 77% of BTC supply is held in profit, up from 62% in November. The improved market price may mean some whales will be ready to hold onto their assets.

This convergence of economic factors is creating a more favorable environment for both buyers and sellers, marking a potential inflection point after a period of uncertainty. Consequently, analysts are observing increased transaction inquiries and a stabilization in price trends across several regions. UK Housing Market Shows Signs of Resilient Recovery The UK housing market is demonstrating notable resilience, with key indicators pointing toward a gradual recovery. According to the latest data from HM Land Registry, average property prices have stabilized after a period of adjustment. Furthermore, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) reports a consistent increase in new buyer inquiries over the past three months. This trend suggests a restoration of confidence among potential homeowners. Importantly, transaction volumes, while not at historic peaks, are showing a steady month-on-month improvement. This activity is particularly evident in the Southeast and Midlands, where affordability has seen the most significant relative improvement. The market’s foundation appears firmer as it moves beyond the reactive phase of the previous economic cycle. The Sterling Correction: A Key Economic Driver Concurrently, the British pound has undergone a measured correction against major currencies like the US dollar and the euro. This adjustment, while reflecting broader global monetary policy shifts, has direct implications for the domestic economy. A relatively weaker sterling typically exerts upward pressure on import costs and inflation. However, in the current context, the Bank of England’s successful management of inflationary pressures has mitigated this effect. The primary impact on the housing market is channeled through monetary policy. Specifically, the correction has alleviated some pressure on the Bank to maintain aggressively high interest rates. As a result, financial markets are now pricing in a clearer path toward potential rate reductions in the coming quarters. Mortgage Rates Decline, Improving Affordability The most immediate and tangible effect for consumers is the decline in mortgage rates. Major lenders, including HSBC, NatWest, and Nationwide, have recently announced reductions in their fixed-rate mortgage products. For example, the average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage has fallen below 5% for the first time in over a year. This development directly improves housing affordability for millions. To illustrate the change, consider the following comparison of monthly repayments on a £250,000 mortgage: Period Average Rate Monthly Repayment Q4 2023 6.2% £1,530 Q1 2025 4.8% £1,310 This reduction of over £200 per month represents a substantial increase in disposable income and borrowing capacity. Consequently, first-time buyers, who were previously sidelined, are re-entering the market. Mortgage approval figures from UK Finance support this observation, showing a consecutive monthly rise. Expert Analysis on Market Dynamics Sarah Chen, Chief Economist at the Oxford Economic Research Institute, provides context for this shift. “The interplay between currency valuation and domestic interest rates is complex,” Chen explains. “The recent sterling movement, coupled with contained inflation, has given the Monetary Policy Committee more flexibility. The resulting dip in mortgage costs is acting as a catalyst. It’s important to view this not as a speculative boom, but as a normalization of activity based on improved fundamentals.” This expert perspective underscores the data-driven nature of the current optimism. Additionally, estate agency groups report that realistic pricing from sellers is meeting renewed demand, creating a more balanced and sustainable market environment. Regional Variations and Buyer Sentiment The recovery is not uniform across the United Kingdom. Regional analysis reveals distinct patterns: London & Southeast: Leading the rebound in buyer interest due to high pent-up demand and significant salary growth in professional sectors. Midlands & North: Showing the strongest price stability, as affordability remains comparatively attractive. Scotland & Wales: Experiencing a slower but steady increase in activity, often driven by lifestyle buyers and remote workers. Sentiment surveys conducted by Zoopla and Rightmove indicate a marked improvement in how buyers perceive their chances of securing a property. The proportion of people who believe now is a good time to buy has increased by 15 percentage points since the autumn. This psychological shift is as crucial as the financial one, often preceding measurable increases in sales agreed. The Construction and Supply Response A sustained recovery requires a response from the supply side. Fortunately, leading homebuilders like Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey have reported an uptick in reservation rates for new homes. The Home Builders Federation notes that planning applications have also risen, suggesting developers are preparing for medium-term demand. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding the cost and availability of materials and skilled labor. The government’s proposed reforms to the planning system aim to address some of these bottlenecks. The success of these policies will be critical in determining whether supply can keep pace with recovering demand and prevent excessive price inflation in the future. Potential Risks and Economic Headwinds Despite the positive indicators, economists caution that risks persist. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, and any resurgence in inflation could delay interest rate cuts. Furthermore, household budgets are still under pressure from higher general living costs. The labour market, while robust, shows signs of softening in certain sectors. A significant rise in unemployment would quickly dampen housing demand. Therefore, the current optimism is tempered with a degree of caution. Market stability depends on a continued gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment rather than a rapid return to the conditions of the previous decade. Conclusion The UK housing market is experiencing a clear rise in optimism, fundamentally driven by the ongoing sterling correction and its secondary effect on mortgage rates. This has improved affordability and brought buyers back to the market. The recovery appears broad-based, with positive signs in buyer sentiment, transaction inquiries, and new construction. While regional variations exist and economic headwinds remain, the current data points to a period of stabilization and measured growth. The focus for policymakers and industry participants must now be on ensuring this recovery is sustainable and supported by adequate housing supply. The UK housing market, therefore, seems to be navigating toward a more balanced and accessible phase for participants. FAQs Q1: How does a weaker pound affect the UK housing market? A weaker sterling can influence the housing market indirectly. It often reduces pressure for high interest rates, which in turn can lead to lower mortgage costs, improving affordability for domestic buyers. Q2: Are mortgage rates expected to fall further in 2025? While recent reductions are positive, future mortgage rate trends depend on the Bank of England’s monetary policy. If inflation remains controlled, further gradual decreases are possible, but this is not guaranteed. Q3: Which areas of the UK are seeing the strongest housing market recovery? Current data suggests the London and Southeast markets are rebounding quickly in terms of buyer interest, while the Midlands and North are showing strong price stability due to better affordability. Q4: Is now a good time for first-time buyers to enter the market? With improved mortgage affordability and more realistic pricing, conditions for first-time buyers have improved. However, personal financial circumstances and long-term plans should always be the primary consideration. Q5: What are the main risks to the current housing market optimism? The main risks include a resurgence of inflation, a significant weakening of the labour market, or an unexpected shift in global economic conditions that could affect interest rate policies.

Some had speculated that he transferred funds from the wallet associated with that token, while others claimed that he profited from it. The Solana-based digital asset briefly surged to a market valuation of nearly $580 million but collapsed swiftly, leaving many investors deeply in the red. As accusations surrounding Adams continued to mount and the ongoing debate in the ecosystem heated up, Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams, shared an X post stating that, “To be completely clear: Eric Adams did not transfer any investor funds. He did not benefit from the launch of the NYC Token. No money was taken from the NYC Token.” Fraud claims erupt as NYC token crashes Just after the spokesperson shared his remarks, allegations of fraudulent activity began to surface. This occurred at a time when the NYC Token dropped to more than 80% in the early hours of trading. The backlash intensified after on-chain analysts flagged unusual liquidity changes in the token’s smart contract, which critics liken to a “rug pull,” causing the token’s price to collapse. Responding to these allegations, several crypto analysts had placed strong bets that Adams’ team could have withdrawn funds , resulting in a total loss of more than $3.4 million for investors. Nonetheless, even with these assumptions raised, Shapiro still insisted that these allegations lacked credibility due to an absence of evidence. Afterwards, he released a statement stating that, “At no time was his involvement meant for personal or financial gain,” pointing out market volatility as the primary cause of the token’s substantial decline. Still, criticism of Adams’ team continued to intensify, but Shapiro maintained his stance that no funds had been withdrawn from the NYC Token. However, sources reported that his statement appeared to differ from an earlier message displayed on the NYC Token’s X post . According to this X post, the individual managing the token’s X account claimed that it had modified liquidity provisions in response to overwhelming initial demand. Additionally, more funds were added to the liquidity pool of the NYC Token, according to a post on the X account. Meanwhile, during an interview with FOX Business, Adams discussed what they intend to do with the funds from the NYC Token. According to him, they plan to allocate these funds to non-profits that seek to initiate efforts to ensure all individuals have a better understanding of antisemitism and anti-Americanism via educational programs. Shapiro still insists Adams did not transfer funds from the NYC Token The former mayor, who presented himself as a strong advocate for crypto, claimed that apart from funding these non-profits, the funds would also establish a scholarship program to support students in marginalized communities in New York. Following his remarks, Shapiro affirmed that the controversial introduction of the NYC Token has not interfered with Adams’ strong commitment to these initiatives. “Mr Adams is still dedicated to responsible innovation and using new technologies to build trust, education, and shared civic values,” he said. In the meantime, data from DEXScreener noted that the current price of the Solana-based token is approximately $0.133. Interestingly, the token has maintained this price unchanged since it declined from $0.475 just after its introduction. Since attaining this early peak, reports alleged that the total losses incurred amount to more than $400 million from the NYC Token’s market capitalization.

This milestone represents a pivotal moment for the world’s leading cryptocurrency, underscoring its resilience and growing institutional adoption. Consequently, market analysts are closely examining the factors propelling this rally and its potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Breaks Through $97,000 Barrier According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin’s valuation has decisively climbed above $97,000. This price point marks a new high for the current market cycle, attracting attention from investors globally. The Binance USDT pairing, a major liquidity pool, confirms the trade at $97,009.98. This movement follows a period of consolidation and suggests renewed bullish sentiment. Therefore, understanding the context behind this surge is crucial for any market participant. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure over the preceding week. Trading volumes have increased by approximately 35% across major exchanges. This activity indicates strong institutional and retail interest. Historically, such volume spikes often precede sustained upward trends. For instance, similar patterns were observed before previous all-time highs. The current macroeconomic landscape also plays a role. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions has provided a more stable foundation for investment. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Several interconnected factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s impressive performance. Primarily, increased adoption by traditional finance (TradFi) institutions is a key driver. Major asset managers have recently launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These products have seen consistent net inflows, creating substantial buy-side pressure on the underlying asset. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty surrounding fiat currencies continues to bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as a digital store of value. Institutional Investment: Sustained capital inflow from corporate treasuries and ETFs. Macro Hedge: Investors seeking alternatives amid inflationary concerns. Network Fundamentals: The Bitcoin hash rate continues to reach record highs, signaling robust network security. Regulatory Developments: Clearer frameworks in markets like the EU and UK reduce operational risk. Technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as the maturation of the Lightning Network for payments, are enhancing its utility. Simultaneously, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected in 2024, continues to influence long-term investor psychology based on historical supply shock models. Expert Perspectives on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the importance of on-chain metrics. Data from Glassnode shows a decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges, suggesting a shift towards long-term holding strategies. This reduction in readily available supply typically supports higher price levels. Veteran trader and analyst, whose commentary is often cited by Bloomberg, noted, “The market structure appears healthier than during previous speculative peaks. We are seeing organic demand from diverse sources, not just leveraged retail trading.” Conversely, some experts advise caution. They point to potential volatility triggers, including geopolitical tensions or unexpected regulatory announcements. The overall sentiment, however, remains cautiously optimistic. The market has demonstrated an ability to absorb sell-side pressure more effectively than in past cycles. This resilience is partly attributed to the more sophisticated derivatives market and improved risk management practices among large holders. Historical Context and Future Trajectory for BTC Bitcoin’s journey to $97,000 must be viewed within its historical price action. The asset has experienced multiple boom-and-bust cycles, each reaching higher foundational lows. The recovery from the 2022 market downturn has been methodical, characterized by steady accumulation. Comparing key metrics across cycles provides valuable insight: Cycle Peak Price (USD) Primary Driver Time to Recover Previous ATH 2017 ~$20,000 Retail FOMO & ICO Boom N/A 2021 ~$69,000 Institutional Entry & Macro Narrative Approx. 3 years 2025 (Current) >$97,000 ETF Inflows & Global Adoption In Progress This trajectory suggests an evolving maturation of the asset class. The investor base is broader and the use cases more defined. Looking ahead, analysts are monitoring several price levels. The $100,000 psychological barrier represents the next significant milestone. Sustained trading above this level could unlock further momentum. However, market participants should prepare for potential volatility. Price corrections are a normal and healthy part of any financial market’s growth. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ascent above $97,000 marks a definitive chapter in its financial evolution. This Bitcoin price movement is supported by tangible factors like institutional adoption, strong network fundamentals, and a shifting macroeconomic landscape. While the future path will inevitably include volatility, the current rally reflects a deeper, more sustained interest in cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Ultimately, this milestone reinforces Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the digital economy and highlights its ongoing integration into the global financial system. FAQs Q1: What is the current Bitcoin price? The Bitcoin price is $97,009.98 as reported on the Binance USDT market, having risen above the $97,000 level. Q2: Why is Bitcoin’s price rising? Key drivers include sustained institutional investment via Bitcoin ETFs, its perceived role as a hedge against inflation, strong on-chain fundamentals like hash rate, and positive regulatory developments in major markets. Q3: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions should be based on personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and thorough research.

Meanwhile, the British pound edged higher in cautious trading. These developments reflect underlying economic fundamentals and shifting investor sentiment across international financial centers. Market analysts closely monitor these currency fluctuations for signals about broader economic trends. US Dollar Strength Driven by Economic Fundamentals The US dollar index climbed 1.8% this week, reaching its highest level since early 2024. This surge primarily reflects stronger-than-expected economic data from multiple sectors. The Commerce Department reported robust retail sales growth of 0.9% in January, exceeding consensus forecasts of 0.5%. Additionally, manufacturing output expanded for the third consecutive month, according to Federal Reserve data. Several key factors contribute to the dollar’s current strength: Labor market resilience: Unemployment remains at 3.7%, near historic lows Inflation moderation: Core CPI increased 0.3% monthly, showing controlled price pressures Interest rate expectations: Markets now price fewer rate cuts for 2025 Global safe-haven demand: Geopolitical tensions boost dollar appeal Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently emphasized data-dependent policy decisions. Consequently, strong economic indicators reduce expectations for imminent monetary easing. This monetary policy outlook further supports dollar valuation against other major currencies. Sterling’s Cautious Advance in European Markets The British pound gained 0.4% against the euro while holding steady against the dollar. This performance reflects mixed economic signals from the United Kingdom. The Office for National Statistics reported better-than-expected GDP growth of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, business investment declined for the second consecutive quarter. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey noted “cautious optimism” about economic recovery. The central bank maintains its benchmark rate at 5.25%, the highest among G7 nations. This interest rate differential provides some support for sterling. However, concerns about consumer spending and export competitiveness limit more substantial gains. Currency Performance Comparison (Week Ending February 14, 2025) Currency Pair Weekly Change Key Driver USD/EUR +1.6% US economic data strength USD/JPY +2.1% Yield differential widening GBP/USD +0.1% Mixed UK indicators GBP/EUR +0.4% Relative monetary policy Expert Analysis of Currency Market Dynamics Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief Currency Strategist at Global Markets Research, provides valuable perspective. “The dollar’s strength reflects genuine economic outperformance,” she explains. “US productivity growth continues to outpace other developed economies. This fundamental advantage supports currency valuation over medium-term horizons.” Chen further notes divergent monetary policy paths. “The Federal Reserve maintains flexibility while other central banks face greater constraints. This policy divergence creates natural currency movements. Sterling benefits from higher UK rates but faces structural economic challenges.” Historical context illuminates current trends. The dollar index has gained approximately 12% since its 2023 lows. This recovery aligns with improving US economic fundamentals relative to other regions. Meanwhile, sterling remains approximately 15% below its pre-Brexit referendum levels against the dollar. Global Economic Context and Currency Implications Currency movements occur within broader global economic conditions. The International Monetary Fund recently revised its 2025 growth forecast upward for the United States to 2.1%. Conversely, the Eurozone growth projection remains at 0.8%. This growth differential naturally supports dollar strength against the euro. Geopolitical developments also influence currency markets. Ongoing trade discussions between major economies create uncertainty. Consequently, investors increasingly favor the dollar as a reserve currency during periods of global uncertainty. This safe-haven demand provides additional support beyond economic fundamentals. Energy markets significantly impact currency valuations. Recent stabilization in oil prices reduces pressure on energy-importing nations’ currencies. However, natural gas price volatility continues affecting European currencies more than the dollar. This energy dynamic creates relative currency advantages. Market Reactions and Trading Patterns Foreign exchange trading volumes increased 18% this week according to CLS Bank data. This heightened activity reflects renewed focus on currency markets as central bank policies diverge. Institutional investors adjust portfolio allocations based on changing yield expectations. Options market data reveals interesting positioning. Traders accumulate protection against dollar strength continuation. Meanwhile, sterling volatility expectations remain elevated ahead of key UK economic releases. These derivative market signals provide insight into professional expectations. Real money flows show distinct patterns. Asian central banks continue diversifying reserve holdings, according to IMF data. However, dollar-denominated assets maintain dominant positions in global portfolios. This structural demand provides underlying support for the US currency. Economic Indicators and Future Currency Direction Several upcoming data releases will influence currency markets. The US Personal Consumption Expenditures report arrives next week. This Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure will guide monetary policy expectations. Additionally, UK employment data and Eurozone consumer confidence figures will provide further direction. Technical analysis suggests important levels to monitor. The dollar index approaches resistance near 106.50, a level not seen since November 2024. Sterling faces resistance around 1.2850 against the dollar. Breakthroughs at these technical levels could signal extended currency movements. Seasonal patterns historically affect currency markets. February typically shows increased volatility as traders position for quarterly adjustments. This seasonal tendency might amplify current trends or trigger corrective movements. Market participants remain alert to these historical patterns. Conclusion The US dollar demonstrates significant strength based on robust economic fundamentals and monetary policy expectations. Sterling shows more cautious gains amid mixed economic indicators. These currency movements reflect underlying economic realities across different regions. Market participants will monitor upcoming data releases for further direction. The dollar’s strength and sterling’s performance will continue influencing global trade, investment flows, and economic conditions throughout 2025. FAQs Q1: What specific economic data boosted the US dollar recently? The dollar strengthened following better-than-expected retail sales (0.9% vs 0.5% expected), manufacturing expansion, and low unemployment at 3.7%. These indicators suggest economic resilience. Q2: Why is sterling gaining despite economic challenges? Sterling benefits from the Bank of England’s higher interest rates (5.25%) compared to other central banks. This rate differential attracts some investment, though gains remain limited by economic concerns. Q3: How do interest rate expectations affect currency values? Currencies from countries with higher expected interest rates typically strengthen as they offer better returns to investors. Reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts support dollar strength. Q4: What role does the dollar play as a safe-haven currency? During global uncertainty, investors often buy US dollars and dollar-denominated assets perceived as more stable. This safe-haven demand provides additional support beyond economic fundamentals. Q5: How might these currency movements affect international trade? A stronger dollar makes US exports more expensive abroad but reduces import costs. Sterling’s modest gains have limited trade impact but affect UK tourism and foreign investment flows.

In his latest essay, “Frowny Cloud,” the Maelstrom CIO says he is adding risk via Strategy (MSTR), Japan’s Metaplanet, and Zcash (ZEC) as he expects US dollar liquidity to inflect higher after a year in which Bitcoin lagged both gold and US tech stocks. Hayes frames 2025 as an awkward year for the standard cross-asset shorthand that treats Bitcoin as either digital gold or a high-beta proxy for US tech. In his telling, Bitcoin behaved “as expected” under tightening conditions, while gold and the Nasdaq 100 rose for different reasons despite falling dollar liquidity. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Volatility Sparks Fresh Attention On MicroStrategy He argues gold’s bid is being driven by sovereign balance sheets rather than retail mania, rooted in distrust of US Treasury exposure after prior asset-freeze precedents. “If the US president steals your money, it’s an instant zero. Does it then matter what price you buy gold at?” he writes, casting central banks as price-insensitive buyers. On equities, Hayes leans into an industrial-policy interpretation of the AI trade. His claim is that the US and China have effectively treated “winning AI” as strategic, dulling the usual market discipline and helping explain why the Nasdaq decoupled from his dollar-liquidity index in 2025. That divergence matters because it sets up his core takeaway for 2026: Bitcoin needs expanding dollar liquidity to regain momentum. “Bitcoin and the Nasdaq rise when dollar liquidity expands. The only problem is the recent divergence,” Hayes writes, before returning to the “vicissitudes of dollar liquidity” as the primary driver he wants to track. The Three-Pillar Liquidity Pitch Hayes’ 2026 outlook hinges on a sharp rebound in dollar credit creation. He cites three channels: a growing Fed balance sheet via Reserve Management Purchases (RMP), commercial-bank lending into “strategic industries,” and lower mortgage rates catalyzed by policy-driven demand for mortgage-backed securities. In his account, quantitative tightening faded as a dominant headwind in late 2025, with QT ending in December and RMP beginning as a new, steady buyer. He claims RMP “at a minimum” expands the balance sheet by $40 billion per month, and expects that pace to rise as government funding needs increase. The second leg is bank credit creation, which he says accelerated in 4Q25, with large lenders willing to extend loans where government equity stakes or offtake agreements reduce default risk. The third is housing: Hayes points to Trump-backed directives for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to deploy $200 billion toward MBS purchases, arguing that lower mortgage rates could unlock a familiar wealth effect and, by extension, more credit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Strategy Purchases 1,287 BTC Amid Rising Prices He ties the pieces together with a simple conclusion: if liquidity turns, Bitcoin should follow. “Bitcoin … and dollar liquidity bottomed around the same time,” he writes, arguing that the next major leg depends less on sentiment than on renewed credit expansion. MSTR, Metaplanet, And ZCash Hayes describes himself as a “degen speculator” and says Maelstrom is already “nearly fully invested,” but he still wants “MOAR risk” to capture upside convexity if Bitcoin reclaims higher levels. Rather than using perpetuals or options, he says he’s long Strategy and Metaplanet for levered exposure via corporate balance sheets. His timing argument is valuation-relative: he compares each company’s “DAT” to Bitcoin priced in the relevant currency (yen for Metaplanet, dollars for Strategy) and says those ratios sit near the low end of the past two years, after being “down substantially” from mid-2025 peaks. He adds a key condition: “If Bitcoin can retake $110,000, investors will get the itch to go long Bitcoin through these vehicles. Given the leverage embedded in the capital structure of these businesses, they will outperform Bitcoin on the upside.” He also flags continued accumulation of Zcash. Hayes argues the departure of developers at Electric Coin Company (ECC) is not bearish: “We continue to add to our Zcash position. The departure of the devs at ECC is not bearish. I firmly believe they will ship better, more impactful products within their own for-profit entity. I’m thankful for the opportunity to buy discounted ZEC from weak hands.” At press time, MSTR traded at $179.33.

Its dominance over the altcoins has risen within the same timeframe, as most altcoins have failed to double down on their recent gains. Nevertheless, ETH is still well above $3,350, aiming at $3,400. BTC Dominance Pumps After last week’s price gains that drove BTC from under $90,000 to almost $95,000 within days, the cryptocurrency’s run was halted, and it slipped below its starting point. However, the bulls quickly intercepted the move and helped bitcoin reclaim the $90,000 support. It tried to break out on a couple of occasions. Although it failed at $92,000 the first few times, it finally reclaimed that level on Tuesday and surged to $96,500. The bears stepped up at this point, driving it to under $94,500, but BTC was quick on the gas pedal. On Wednesday evening, it skyrocketed by several grand again and touched $98,000 for the first time since mid-November. This came despite the growing geopolitical tension. Although it was stopped there, it currently sits at $97,000 with a 2.2% increase in the past day.

Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) continue to attract steady interest due to their long-standing roles in the market. Alongside these established names, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the next big crypto that investors are actively accumulating during its ongoing presale phase 7. Together, these three crypto coins represent a blend of stability, utility, and forward-looking growth that many market participants are aligning with this month. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is gaining bullish attention as Standard Chartered suggests it could outperform Bitcoin, citing strong fundamentals, heavy institutional buying, stablecoin dominance, and improved network throughput. Bitmine is also pushing deeper into the ecosystem with its MAVAN platform, aiming to become the largest ETH staking operator. Technically, analysts say Ether could surge up to 95% against Bitcoin if it breaks the key 0.042 BTC resistance level. XRP (XRP) XRP is seeing growing optimism after a draft U.S. Clarity Act suggested it could be treated as a non-security if used in a U.S.-listed ETF by January 2026, potentially easing regulatory pressure. Market conditions remain healthy with low leverage and no panic selling, while Ripple’s expanding global footprint and recent acquisitions further strengthen the case for XRP to challenge new all-time highs. A Legitimate Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Presale With a fixed total supply of just 4 billion tokens, the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already showing strong traction. Across all phases, the project has raised approximately $19.80 million so far, signaling growing investor confidence. The token is currently priced at $0.04, while more than 18,850 holders have already secured their positions through earlier rounds. Demand is clearly building in the current phase as well, with 6% of the 180 million tokens allocated to this stage already sold, reflecting accelerating interest as supply continues to tighten. It is also important to underline that the presale is 100% legitimate. The team has been active since early 2025 and has consistently followed its roadmap while delivering key milestones on schedule. Timely execution, an upcoming launch of a fully functional protocol, and steady organic community growth continue to reinforce the project’s credibility. These factors clearly set Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from the many short-lived presales in today’s market and position it as a serious long-term venture rather than a speculative risk. From a roadmap perspective, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to build confidence. Phase 1 of the roadmap has been fully completed, and more than half of Phase 2 has already been achieved. The remaining goals in Phase 2 include implementation of advanced features, risk parameters, and advanced analytics tools. The updated whitepaper now includes detailed protocol progress and recent updates, reinforcing that development is active and transparent. CertiK Audit and Protocol Progress At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built around a dual lending model that combines peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. This structure is designed to give users flexible borrowing and lending options while keeping capital active within the ecosystem. Security plays a central role in this design. The protocol has undergone a CertiK audit that included methods such as manual review and static analysis. The audit delivered a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a CertiK Skynet Score of 79.00, with the audit timeline requested on 2/25/2025 and revised on 5/20/2025. To further strengthen security, the project has introduced a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program. This program rewards ethical hackers based on severity, with critical issues earning up to $2,000, major issues up to $1,000, medium issues up to $500, and low-severity findings up to $200. This layered approach to safety demonstrates a clear commitment to protecting users and the protocol itself. Recent protocol updates from November 24, 2025, show that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is actively building rather than relying on promises. Front-end data testing has been fully completed, meaning users will see accurate balances, positions, and market data from day one. The ELK monitoring system is already live, giving the team real-time insight into performance and system health. The full staking workflow has also been implemented and tested, covering staking, unstaking, and reward tracking with secure automated deployment scripts. Continued smart-contract audit improvements, advanced admin dashboards, and deep performance testing further highlight a focus on reliability and long-term stability. In a market where many presales launch unfinished products, this level of preparation makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out. What Expects To Drive Value? A major growth driver for the platform will be its decentralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will always aim to stay at $1 in value and will only be minted when users borrow against collateral such as ETH. It will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated, keeping the system balanced. Borrowing rates will be managed through governance to help maintain price stability, while overcollateralization and automatic liquidations will protect the system. This stablecoin will anchor Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending markets and create recurring borrowing and lending activity, which is expected to drive consistent demand for MUTM as the protocol grows. Another strong driver is the expected upcoming exchange listing. Given the strong presale trajectory and clear utility of the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is projected to move toward listings on well-known Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges after launch. As visibility increases and liquidity flows in, broader participation is expected to follow. Final Verdict As January unfolds, investors are aligning with a balanced strategy that combines established leaders and high-growth opportunities. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) continue to offer stability and recognition, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the next big crypto capturing early attention. With strong presale traction, real development progress, clear utility, and confident growth projections, MUTM is positioning itself as one of the most compelling crypto coins investors are buying alongside ETH and XRP this month.

That break marked a clear shift in long-term structure. Instead of acting as a ceiling, the level has since functioned as support. Dom (@traderview2), a Data Alchemist, focused on that fact in a recent post, pointing out that the asset continues to respect the area long after the initial breakout. He noted that XRP broke the $1.90 resistance over a year ago and remains above it today. Markets often test important levels repeatedly after a breakout. XRP has done so without surrendering the zone. This persistence defines the current setup more than any short-term rally or pullback . Over 400 days ago $XRP broke the $1.90 resistance that held it down for 6 years A year later, price is still holding on to that as support Realistically, this is a bullish setup But if this level is lost, it will be the biggest let down after 7 years of hopes and dreams pic.twitter.com/7zRGeA9Tch — Dom (@traderview2) January 13, 2026 Why the $1.9 Zone Still Controls the Chart The $1.9 level holds technical relevance because it rejected XRP across multiple cycles. In 2018 and again in 2021, rallies failed once the price reached that region. Those failures reinforced the level as a major reference point that veterans like Peter Brandt could not ignore . When XRP finally moved above it, the reaction that followed carried weight. Dom stated that the “price is still holding on to that as support.” He attached a 2-week chart to back that claim. Each pullback toward the level has attracted buyers, and XRP has not closed decisively below it for over a year. Dom described the current structure plainly, writing, “realistically, this is a bullish setup.” His assessment rests on price behavior, and a market that holds a former multi-year resistance from above will favour an upward move as long as that structure stays intact . Defined Risk Without Ambiguity Dom also addressed the downside scenario. He noted that if the $1.9 level is lost, “it will be the biggest letdown after 7 years of hopes and dreams.” That statement outlines the risks clearly. A failure at this level would carry meaning precisely because of how long it has held. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This does not weaken the bullish case; it sharpens it. Clear invalidation levels strengthen technical analysis, and XRP’s current structure provides a visible line where market behavior would change. Until that occurs, the asset remains in a bullish position . Where XRP Stands Now XRP is trading above a level that defined its ceiling for most of the past decade. It has held that level for over a year. Dom’s analysis centers on those facts alone, focusing on the chart structure. As long as its price continues to respect $1.9 as support, the breakout remains valid. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Societe Generale-FORGE said the pilot successfully demonstrated end-to-end settlement flows for tokenized bonds, including issuance, delivery-versus-payment (DvP), coupon payments and redemption. Central to the trial was SG-FORGE’s EUR CoinVertible, the MiCA-compliant stablecoin designed for on-chain settlement and natively compatible with Swift’s interoperability capabilities. In September, Societe Generale-FORGE partnered with Bullish Europe GmbH, a BaFin-regulated provider of digital asset trading and custody services, to launch the USD CoinVertible (USDCV). Societe Generale-FORGE partners with Bullish Europe to launch USD CoinVertible (USDCV) — the first MiCA-licensed USD stablecoin. #Stablecoin #Crypto https://t.co/PGfK3fBuTW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 By offering both EURCV and USDCV, SG-FORGE and Bullish Europe said it is positioning itself at the forefront of regulated stablecoin adoption bridging the gap between traditional financial infrastructure and blockchain-based markets. Bridging Blockchain and Traditional Finance This latest collaboration builds on years of joint work between SG-FORGE, Swift, major financial institutions, and public bodies to establish a secure and interoperable framework for digital assets. Swift’s role as an orchestration layer proved critical, coordinating messages and settlement across multiple platforms while maintaining compliance with established financial messaging standards. European Digital Finance Initiatives The project also builds on experimental work by the European Central Bank around interbank central bank digital currency. The firm said by adding fiat currencies alongside stablecoins as settlement assets, the trial explored hybrid settlement models that could appeal to banks and corporate firms. The settlement flows were completed using Swift infrastructure and ISO 20022 standards, reinforcing the feasibility of adopting tokenized assets within existing regulatory and operational frameworks. A Blueprint for Scalable Digital Asset Adoption By proving that tokenized bonds can settle efficiently over Swift, the project also highlights a practical path toward faster settlement cycles, reduced operational risk, and enhanced transparency for capital markets participants. Thomas Dugauquier, Tokenised Assets Product Lead at Swift, said the trial demonstrates how interoperability will shape the future of capital markets, enabling customers to adopt digital assets with confidence and at scale. SG-FORGE CEO Jean-Marc Stenger added that the collaboration supports the adoption of efficient, fast, and secure payment solutions for financial institutions and corporates using distributed ledger technology and EUR CoinVertible as a reference stablecoin. Tested with participating banks the pilot forms part of Swift’s broader digital asset programme. In September last year, Swift said it was working with more than 30 global banks, including Societe Generale and SG-FORGE, on a shared digital ledger focused on allowing real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments.

On Thursday, the group that runs the site announced a string of deals with names like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For years, the Wikimedia Foundation has watched tech giants use its free articles to build their products. Now, the non-profit is finally turning that reliance into a source of income. Over the last year, they have signed up newer players like the AI startup Perplexity and France’s Mistral AI. These companies join a growing list that already includes Meta and Amazon, as well as Google , which signed a deal back in 2022. High costs of AI training Wikipedia’s data is a tech treasure trove. Chatbots and virtual assistants are trained to speak and respond to inquiries using its 65 million articles, which are authored in more than 300 languages. However, there is an additional expense. Wikipedia’s servers are heavily taxed when these businesses “scrape” or extract massive volumes of data from the website. These expenses are typically covered by modest contributions from the general public, but the increased demand from AI businesses has increased those expenses. To solve this, Wikimedia is pushing its “Enterprise” service. It allows big companies to pay for the content they need in a format that works better for their high-tech systems. Lane Becker, who leads the Enterprise branch, said these companies realize they need to help fund the site if they want it to survive. He said it took some time to figure out exactly what features to offer to get companies to switch from the free site to the paid version. Supporting the volunteer community The site itself is still kept running by a massive team of 250,000 volunteers who write and check the facts for free. Tim Frank from Microsoft said that having access to honest, high-quality info is a big part of how they see the future of AI. He noted that by working with Wikimedia, they are helping to keep a system where the people who write the content are still supported. Amidst these business changes, the foundation is also getting a new leader. Bernadette Meehan, a former U.S. Ambassador, is set to take over as chief executive on January 20.

This significant development, observed on March 15, 2025, marks a pivotal moment for Binance Smart Chain’s ongoing evolution and signals renewed institutional confidence in specific blockchain projects. The foundation’s renewed acquisition activity focuses on two distinct tokens: 币安人生 (Binance Life) and 我踏马来了 (I’m Coming). BSC Foundation Resumes Strategic Token Purchases The BSC Foundation has reactivated its ecosystem support mechanism after a brief four-day hiatus. This resumption represents more than routine portfolio management. Indeed, it demonstrates a calculated commitment to specific projects within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa first identified these transactions through comprehensive blockchain analysis. The foundation’s purchasing activity serves multiple strategic purposes. Primarily, it provides liquidity support to selected projects. Additionally, it signals confidence to the broader market. Furthermore, it aligns with long-term ecosystem development goals. Blockchain foundations frequently utilize treasury funds to support ecosystem growth. The BSC Foundation follows this established industry practice. However, its specific token selections reveal particular strategic priorities. The four-day pause preceding this activity generated considerable market speculation. Some analysts interpreted the hiatus as a period of evaluation. Others suggested it reflected normal operational scheduling. Regardless, the resumption has captured significant attention across cryptocurrency communities. Analyzing the Targeted Ecosystem Tokens The BSC Foundation’s renewed purchases specifically target two tokens with distinct functions within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Understanding these tokens provides crucial context for the foundation’s strategic decisions. 币安人生 (Binance Life) – The Lifestyle Integration Token 币安人生, translated as “Binance Life,” represents an innovative project integrating blockchain technology with daily consumer activities. This token facilitates various real-world applications. Users can employ 币安人生 for retail purchases, service payments, and loyalty rewards. The project emphasizes practical cryptocurrency adoption beyond speculative trading. Recent developments include partnership expansions with Asian e-commerce platforms. These partnerships significantly increase the token’s utility and potential user base. Key characteristics of 币安人生 include: Real-world payment integration with over 500 merchants Cross-chain compatibility features Staking mechanisms offering consumer rewards Governance rights for token holders 我踏马来了 (I’m Coming) – The Gaming and Metaverse Token 我踏马来了, meaning “I’m Coming,” operates primarily within blockchain gaming and metaverse environments. This token serves as the primary currency for an expanding gaming ecosystem. Players utilize it for in-game purchases, character upgrades, and virtual land acquisitions. The project has demonstrated substantial user growth throughout 2024. Its developer team recently announced upcoming virtual reality integrations. These technological advancements position the token for potential expansion into broader metaverse applications. The table below compares key metrics for both tokens: Metric 币安人生 (Binance Life) 我踏马来了 (I’m Coming) Primary Use Case Consumer Payments & Loyalty Gaming & Metaverse Economy Current Circulation 45 million tokens 28 million tokens 30-Day Trading Volume $12.4 million $8.7 million Ecosystem Partners Retail & E-commerce Gaming Studios & VR Platforms Strategic Implications for Binance Smart Chain The BSC Foundation’s purchasing decisions carry significant implications for the entire Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. These strategic acquisitions typically precede broader development initiatives. Historical data reveals patterns in the foundation’s market activities. Previous token purchase phases often correlated with subsequent ecosystem announcements. For instance, similar activities in early 2024 preceded major DeFi protocol launches. The current purchases may signal upcoming partnerships or technological upgrades. Market analysts closely monitor foundation activities for several reasons. First, they provide insights into institutional priorities. Second, they often influence retail investor sentiment. Third, they can indicate areas of potential ecosystem growth. The selective nature of these purchases suggests careful project evaluation. The foundation appears to favor tokens with demonstrated utility and growth potential. This approach contrasts with broader, less targeted investment strategies employed by some blockchain organizations. Blockchain foundations serve crucial ecosystem stabilization functions. Their purchasing activities can mitigate excessive market volatility. They also provide validation for promising projects. The BSC Foundation’s transparent on-chain transactions enhance overall market confidence. This transparency represents a positive trend in blockchain governance. It allows independent verification of foundation activities. Consequently, it builds trust within the cryptocurrency community. Expert Analysis and Market Context Industry experts provide valuable perspectives on the BSC Foundation’s resumed activities. On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa emphasizes the technical significance of these transactions. “Foundation purchases represent more than simple asset accumulation,” the analyst noted in a recent commentary. “They function as strategic ecosystem investments with multiple objectives.” These objectives include liquidity provision, price stability support, and project validation. The broader market context remains essential for proper interpretation. Cryptocurrency markets experienced moderate volatility throughout early 2025. Several blockchain foundations adjusted their strategies accordingly. The BSC Foundation’s brief purchasing pause aligned with this broader pattern. Its resumption suggests renewed confidence in current market conditions. Additionally, it may reflect completed internal evaluations of ecosystem projects. Historical comparison reveals interesting patterns. The BSC Foundation conducted similar purchasing activities throughout 2023 and 2024. These activities often preceded periods of ecosystem expansion. For example, increased token acquisitions in Q3 2023 preceded the launch of multiple DeFi protocols. The foundation’s current strategy may follow established operational patterns. However, each purchasing phase targets different ecosystem segments based on evolving priorities. Key factors influencing foundation decisions include: Project development milestones and roadmap progress User adoption rates and community growth metrics Technical innovation and protocol upgrades Market conditions and liquidity requirements Strategic alignment with broader ecosystem goals Technical Execution and Blockchain Verification The technical execution of foundation purchases involves sophisticated blockchain operations. Transactions occur on the Binance Smart Chain network. They utilize smart contracts for automated execution. This automation ensures precise timing and amount control. The foundation typically employs gradual accumulation strategies. These strategies minimize market impact while achieving position targets. On-chain analysts verify transactions through multiple blockchain explorers. This verification process provides transaction transparency. Blockchain technology enables unprecedented transaction visibility. Anyone can examine foundation wallet activities. This transparency represents a fundamental blockchain advantage. It allows independent verification of organizational actions. The BSC Foundation maintains several publicly identifiable wallets. Analysts monitor these wallets for activity changes. The recent purchasing resumption was immediately detectable. This detectability demonstrates blockchain’s inherent transparency features. Transaction analysis reveals specific execution patterns. The foundation appears to utilize both market and limit orders. This mixed approach balances price considerations with execution certainty. Purchases typically occur across multiple transactions. This method reduces slippage and market disruption. The technical sophistication of these operations reflects professional treasury management.

The analyst has presented a chart analysis showing XRP slowly approaching a key decision zone that could determine its next upward move and push it firmly out of its current consolidation. XRP Price Structure Still Bullish On Wednesday, January 14, Egrag Crypto said the XRP 3-day chart shows obvious, strong signals. He stated that XRP remains structurally bullish despite experiencing long periods of consolidation following its last rebound above $2 this year. According to the analyst, XRP’s price is currently compressing within a descending channel as it moves closer to a key decision zone between $2.30 and $2.40. He explained that this type of compression often appears after a strong move and can lead to a larger price expansion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $57,000: The Bullish Path That Could End In Tears In his post on X, Egrag Crypto shared key trends he observed on XRP’s 3-day chart. He revealed that the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has begun to flatten, indicating that selling pressure for XRP may be easing. At the same time, the 200 EMA continues to move higher, supporting the analyst’s opinion that the macro trend for XRP is still bullish. Egrag Crypto also emphasized that XRP is holding above the EMA cluster, a sign of structural strength rather than weakness. He highlighted that the upper boundary of the descending channel aligns precisely with the critical resistance areas at $2.3, marked by a red line on the chart. As these four developments occur simultaneously on the XRP chart, Egrag Crypto shared insights into their potential price impacts. He stated that a clean 3-day close above $2.40 would likely confirm XRP’s breakout from the descending channel. Based on the chart structure, he added that such a move could open the door for a continuation toward the $2.70 and $3.13 levels. If XRP is rejected at the channel’s resistance, Egrag Crypto has said that the price would likely remain range-bound. He concluded his analysis by emphasizing that as long as XRP continues trading above $2.0, its bullish structure will remain intact, and this ongoing consolidation phase should be seen as a period of compression ahead of a potential major price expansion. Related Reading: This Ethereum Triangle Breakout Puts Price Above $24,000, Here’s The Path Chart Signals Potentially Deeper Downtrend In Egrag Crypto’s chart, the lower boundary of the descending channel touches a key support area, marked by a white line. This could mean that if XRP fails to hold $2 and even drops below it, it could invalidate the analyst’s bullish thesis and trigger a decline toward the next support level at $1.65, representing a roughly 17.5% drop from current prices. If price falls further below $1.65, XRP could crash toward the last highlighted support level just around $1.0, reflecting an approximately 50% decrease from around $2.1.

He emphasized that Ripple’s escrow releases are carefully controlled and time-locked. “They can’t emergency-dump supply during a crisis,” he noted. This setup limits monthly releases, creating predictability as the new XRP enters the market. Claver’s observation draws attention to the structural factors that can influence price movements. Escrow Controls and Market Function XRP’s escrow system is designed to maintain discipline in token distribution. Escrowed XRP is released on a strict schedule, with monthly maximums enforced. Ripple cannot bypass these limits, even during periods of market volatility. This ensures that large, sudden sales from the company do not occur, reducing the risk of uncontrolled supply entering the market. The system is not meant to dampen shocks but to make them sharper when market events coincide with scheduled releases. Ripple's escrow releases are time-locked to monthly maximums. They can't emergency-dump supply during a crisis. This makes supply shocks more severe, not less. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 14, 2026 Understanding Supply Shocks A supply shock occurs when demand remains high while new token releases are limited. In XRP’s case, the escrow schedule can create moments when the available supply does not meet market demand. Such scenarios often result in rapid upward price movement. Supply shocks reward holders and can amplify momentum during bullish conditions. Claver’s commentary highlights that these mechanics, while structural, can actively support price strength. By controlling supply releases, XRP reinforces its value proposition. Investors can anticipate the maximum monthly XRP entering circulation, reducing uncertainty. In essence, the controlled supply system can intensify price effects when demand is strong, rather than dilute them.

Supply shocks provide opportunities for XRP holders as constrained supply can accelerate price growth . Claver’s analysis shows that the system is designed to maintain discipline and transparency. It prevents sudden oversupply and lets market forces respond to scarcity. This reinforces the view that XRP’s structure can create conditions for favorable price action. Jake Claver’s insight underscores the importance of XRP’s escrow schedule in shaping market dynamics. The time-locked monthly releases create predictable scarcity, which can amplify the effects of strong demand. Supply shocks, as a result, become a mechanism that benefits XRP holders. Controlled distribution and structural discipline ensure that Ripple cannot act in ways that destabilize the token’s flow. Instead, the escrow system protects XRP . Claver’s analysis provides clarity on why supply mechanics are a fundamental factor in XRP’s market performance.

This initiative, developed alongside BNB Chain core developers and the 0xBow team behind the pioneering Privacy Pools protocol, represents a sophisticated fusion of advanced cryptography and practical regulatory frameworks. Scheduled for a first-quarter release, the pool aims to fundamentally reshape how users interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) by enabling demonstrable compliance without sacrificing personal data sovereignty. Brevis Intelligent Privacy Pool: A New Paradigm for BNB Chain The forthcoming Brevis Intelligent Privacy Pool builds directly upon the foundational architecture of 0xBow’s existing Privacy Pools. However, it introduces a critical, innovative layer: a ZK-based user eligibility verification system. This system allows participants to generate cryptographic proofs about their transaction history or identity status without revealing the underlying sensitive information. Consequently, users can seamlessly prove they are not associated with illicit activities or that they have completed necessary off-chain checks, all while maintaining pseudonymity on-chain. This development arrives at a pivotal moment for the BNB Chain ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Regulatory scrutiny around decentralized protocols, particularly those offering privacy features, has intensified globally. Traditional privacy tools often create a binary choice: complete anonymity, which raises regulatory red flags, or full transparency, which erodes user privacy. The Brevis model, therefore, seeks to establish a crucial middle ground. It provides a technologically enforced mechanism for good actors to distinguish themselves, thereby fostering a healthier and more sustainable DeFi environment on one of the world’s largest smart contract platforms. Deconstructing the Zero-Knowledge Verification Engine At the core of the Intelligent Privacy Pool lies Brevis’s specialized zero-knowledge verification technology. To understand its impact, one must first grasp the two primary verification pathways it enables for proving regulatory compliance. The Dual Pathways: On-Chain History and zkTLS The system offers users flexible options for generating proof of legitimacy. First, users can leverage their own on-chain transaction history. Through ZK proofs, a user can cryptographically attest that none of their past transactions interacted with addresses blacklisted by regulators or known to be associated with hacking incidents, all without exposing any other transaction details. Second, and more innovatively, the pool integrates zkTLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security) technology. This allows users to link off-chain Know Your Customer (KYC) verifications from licensed providers to their pool participation. The zkTLS protocol generates a proof that a valid KYC check occurred, confirming the user’s human identity and jurisdictional compliance, without leaking any personal data—such as name, date of birth, or ID number—onto the immutable blockchain. This approach directly addresses a major pain point: the permanent and public nature of on-chain data. The technical collaboration is significant. 0xBow brings its battle-tested privacy pool smart contract design, which uses set membership proofs to allow users to withdraw assets without revealing their deposit source. Brevis contributes its agile ZK coprocessor, which can efficiently prove complex statements about data from any blockchain. BNB Chain provides the high-throughput, low-cost execution environment necessary for such computationally intensive operations to be practical for everyday users. Context and Implications for the Broader Crypto Landscape The announcement is not an isolated event but part of a clear industry trend toward ‘compliant privacy’ or ‘regulated DeFi.’ Following regulatory challenges faced by earlier privacy protocols, there is a concerted push from developers, foundations, and even regulators to find technical solutions that satisfy both privacy rights and legal obligations. The Brevis and BNB Chain initiative positions itself at the forefront of this movement. The potential impacts are multifaceted. For users, it promises enhanced access. Many regulated DeFi applications and institutions currently block interactions from privacy-focused protocols. By providing a built-in compliance layer, the Intelligent Privacy Pool could act as a gateway, allowing its users to access a wider array of financial services without switching wallets or identities. For developers building on BNB Chain, it offers a new primitive—a privacy-preserving liquidity pool that inherently mitigates regulatory risk, potentially attracting more institutional capital and sophisticated users to their applications. Furthermore, this model could influence regulatory discourse. By providing a tangible example of how technology can automate compliance, it moves the conversation beyond simplistic bans. It demonstrates that blockchain systems can be designed with regulatory considerations embedded into their code, a concept often referred to as ’embedded regulation’ or ‘compliance by design.’ Comparison: Traditional Privacy vs. Intelligent Privacy Pool Feature Traditional Privacy Tools Brevis Intelligent Privacy Pool Core Mechanism Anonymity sets, coin mixing ZK proofs of compliance + anonymity sets Regulatory Posture Often adversarial or opaque Proactive, proof-based compliance User Data Exposure None (fully anonymous) None (selective disclosure via proof) Key Innovation Breaking transaction links Proving good actor status without links Potential Adoption Privacy-centric users Privacy-centric + compliance-conscious users & institutions Expert Analysis and Projected Timeline Industry observers note the technical elegance of combining these specific technologies. “The integration of a general-purpose ZK coprocessor like Brevis with a specific application like Privacy Pools is a logical evolution,” commented a researcher specializing in cryptographic applications, who preferred to speak on background. “It shows the maturation of ZK tech—moving from theoretical advantage to solving concrete, real-world problems like regulatory interoperability. The use of zkTLS to bridge the off-chain and on-chain trust worlds is particularly noteworthy.” The project roadmap indicates a first-quarter launch for the initial version of the Intelligent Privacy Pool on the BNB Chain mainnet. This will likely be followed by iterative upgrades based on user feedback and evolving regulatory landscapes. Success metrics will include total value locked (TVL), the diversity of assets supported, and crucially, adoption by other DeFi protocols as a source of compliant, private liquidity. The long-term vision may involve expanding the system to support proofs based on other compliance frameworks beyond KYC, such as proof-of-sanctions screening or tax residency attestations. Conclusion The launch of the Brevis Intelligent Privacy Pool on BNB Chain marks a significant step forward in the search for sustainable privacy within the blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for user eligibility verification, the project directly tackles the central tension between anonymity and accountability. It provides a practical tool for users to affirm their regulatory compliance without resorting to full transparency, thereby protecting fundamental privacy rights. For the BNB Chain, this innovation enhances its infrastructure, offering developers and users a forward-looking solution that aligns with global regulatory trends. As the first-quarter launch approaches, the industry will watch closely to see if this model of compliant privacy can successfully scale and become a new standard for responsible DeFi participation. FAQs Q1: What is the main purpose of the Brevis Intelligent Privacy Pool? The primary purpose is to allow blockchain users to participate in private transactions while simultaneously being able to prove their regulatory compliance. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to let users verify they are not associated with illicit activity or that they have completed KYC, without exposing any personal or transactional data. Q2: How does this differ from a standard cryptocurrency mixer or privacy coin? Standard mixers and privacy coins focus solely on obscuring transaction links. The Intelligent Privacy Pool adds a verification layer on top of privacy. Users can cryptographically prove specific, positive attributes about their history or identity (like being KYC’d) while still keeping all other data hidden, which most traditional tools cannot do. Q3: What is zkTLS and why is it important for this pool? zkTLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security) is a technology that allows someone to prove they received a valid certificate or passed a check from a trusted off-chain server (like a KYC provider) without revealing the content of that communication. It’s crucial because it lets users link off-chain, real-world compliance to their on-chain activity in a privacy-preserving way. Q4: Will using this pool make my transactions completely anonymous? The pool will provide strong privacy protections by breaking the direct link between your deposit and withdrawal addresses within the pool’s anonymity set. However, the optional compliance proofs add a new dimension: you can choose to be a *verifiably compliant* private user, which may be necessary for interacting with certain regulated DeFi applications. Q5: When is the Brevis Intelligent Privacy Pool scheduled to go live, and on which network? The pool is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of the coming year. It will be deployed exclusively on the BNB Chain network, leveraging its high performance and low transaction costs to make the ZK proof generation process economically feasible for users.

57185104,https://cryptonews.com/?p=474961,1768476916,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57185104.jpeg,Bank of America CEO Warns $6T in Deposits Could Flow into Stablecoins,https://cryptonews.com/news/bank-of-america-ceo-warns-6t-in-deposits-could-flow-into-stablecoins/,"Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has warned that stablecoins could pull trillions of dollars out of the US banking system, underscoring growing tensions between traditional lenders and the digital asset industry. Key Takeaways: Up to $6 trillion in US bank deposits could move into stablecoins, according to Bank of America’s CEO. Banks warn yield-bearing stablecoins could drain deposits and limit lending. Lawmakers are pushing to curb stablecoin yields as a crypto bill nears a deadline. Speaking during the bank’s Wednesday earnings call , Moynihan said as much as $6 trillion in deposits, roughly 30% to 35% of all US commercial bank deposits, could migrate into stablecoins under certain regulatory outcomes. Moynihan said the estimate was based on Treasury Department studies and linked the potential shift to an ongoing legislative debate over interest-bearing stablecoins. Banks Warn Stablecoin Yields Could Speed Deposit Outflows At issue is whether issuers should be allowed to offer yield on stablecoin balances, a feature banks argue could accelerate deposit outflows by giving consumers a bank-like product without bank-style regulation. According to Moynihan, many stablecoin models resemble money market mutual funds rather than traditional deposits. Reserves are typically held in short-term instruments such as U.S. Treasurys, rather than recycled into lending for households and businesses. That dynamic, he said, could shrink the deposit base banks rely on to fund loans across the economy. “If you take out deposits, they’re either not going to be able to loan or they’re going to have to get wholesale funding,” Moynihan said, adding that alternative funding sources would likely come at a higher cost. Lawmakers are now racing to settle these issues as the Senate Banking Committee works on a negotiated crypto market structure bill. Bank of America CEO on why stablecoins shouldn't pay interest: (TLDR: consumers shouldn't earn yield so banks can) Quick summary: Interest on stables -> mass deposit flight Fully reserved money -> no fractional leverage Banks lose free funding -> profits go bye bye! https://t.co/WE5P7F6V48 pic.twitter.com/2ebBx82NE9 — Omar (@TheOneandOmsy) January 15, 2026 The latest draft, released Jan. 9 by committee chair Tim Scott, includes language that would bar digital asset service providers from paying interest or yield to users simply for holding stablecoins. At the same time, the proposal allows activity-based rewards tied to functions such as staking, liquidity provision or posting collateral, drawing a clear line between passive balances and active participation. Pressure on the bill has intensified as the committee faces tight legislative timelines. More than 70 amendments were filed ahead of a planned markup this week, reflecting heavy lobbying from both banking groups and crypto firms. Other unresolved issues include proposed ethics provisions, which gained attention following reports that President Donald Trump earned hundreds of millions of dollars from family-linked crypto ventures. Galaxy Research Warns Crypto Bill Could Expand Treasury Surveillance The draft has also sparked concern outside the banking sector. A recent report from Galaxy Research warned the bill could significantly expand Treasury Department surveillance powers over digital asset transactions. Meanwhile, industry support has begun to fracture. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said Wednesday the exchange could not back the bill, citing provisions he argued would effectively eliminate stablecoin rewards. Later that day, Scott announced the committee had postponed the scheduled markup, saying negotiations were ongoing and that “everyone remains at the table working in good faith.” The post Bank of America CEO Warns $6T in Deposits Could Flow into Stablecoins appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bank|Bank of America|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2026-01-15 11:35:16
57185182,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261831,1768477212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Sygnum’s Stunning $400K Forecast Hinges on US Regulatory Clarity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-prediction-sygnum-us-regulation/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Sygnum’s Stunning $400K Forecast Hinges on US Regulatory Clarity ZURICH, SWITZERLAND – A groundbreaking Bitcoin price prediction from Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum suggests the cryptocurrency’s valuation could ascend to between $350,000 and $400,000, contingent upon the United States establishing definitive regulatory frameworks for the sector. This analysis, reported by Cointelegraph, directly links the future trajectory of the world’s premier digital asset to legislative actions in Washington D.C., presenting a compelling case for how regulatory certainty could catalyze unprecedented institutional and sovereign adoption. Sygnum’s Bitcoin Price Prediction and the Regulatory Catalyst Sygnum Bank AG, a FINMA-licensed institution specializing in digital assets, published a detailed report outlining this significant Bitcoin price prediction . The bank’s analysts argue that clear U.S. cryptocurrency regulation would serve as a powerful global signal. Consequently, this signal would reduce systemic uncertainty for large-scale institutional investors and national treasuries. The report specifically cites pending U.S. legislation, such as the CLARITY Act and proposals for a Bitcoin Act that could authorize national-level purchases. Furthermore, Sygnum emphasizes that American regulatory leadership often sets a de facto standard for financial markets worldwide. Therefore, decisive action from U.S. lawmakers could unlock a new phase of capital allocation toward Bitcoin. The Mechanics of Sovereign Adoption and Reserve Assets Sygnum’s analysis extends beyond simple price speculation to examine the fundamental mechanics of potential sovereign adoption. The bank identifies two primary categories of nations most likely to consider adding BTC to reserve assets . Firstly, pragmatic countries with strong, diversified economies—such as Japan and Germany —may view Bitcoin as a strategic, non-correlated asset to enhance their national balance sheets. Secondly, nations experiencing currency instability or hyperinflation, including Brazil and Poland , might adopt Bitcoin as a modern hedge against local economic turmoil. A coordinated move by several countries into the Bitcoin market, which has a relatively limited and fixed supply, would create substantial buy-side pressure. This pressure is the core driver behind Sygnum’s lofty valuation model. Contextualizing the $400,000 Bitcoin Forecast To understand this Bitcoin price prediction , one must consider the current macroeconomic landscape and historical precedents. Central banks globally have expanded their balance sheets significantly in recent years, seeking alternative reserve assets beyond traditional gold and foreign exchange holdings. For instance, if a coalition of nations allocated even a small percentage of their total reserves—collectively worth trillions of U.S. dollars—to Bitcoin, the price impact would be profound. Sygnum’s forecast aligns with models used by other analysts who factor in Bitcoin’s scarcity and potential as a digital store of value. However, Sygnum uniquely ties this outcome directly to the specific trigger of U.S. cryptocurrency legislation , providing a clear, conditional pathway to the predicted valuation. The Parallel Growth of Tokenized Traditional Finance Sygnum’s report does not focus solely on Bitcoin. It also highlights the accelerating convergence of digital assets with traditional finance, known as tokenization . The bank projects that up to 10% of new bonds issued by major financial institutions in the current year could utilize a tokenized format. This process involves representing ownership of real-world assets like bonds or real estate on a blockchain. Tokenization promises increased efficiency, liquidity, and transparency in capital markets. This trend towards digitizing traditional finance runs parallel to Bitcoin’s potential adoption as a reserve asset. Together, they represent a comprehensive transformation of the global financial system, moving it onto more programmable and accessible digital infrastructure. Potential Sovereign Adopters of Bitcoin Reserves Country Category Potential Motivation Japan Pragmatic Economy Portfolio diversification, technological leadership Germany Pragmatic Economy Hedge against currency debasement, store of value Brazil Currency Crisis Inflation hedge, financial innovation Poland Currency Crisis Economic sovereignty, modernizing reserves The timeline for these developments remains uncertain, yet the direction of travel is clear. Legislative processes, particularly in the U.S., are inherently slow and subject to political negotiation. However, the growing discussion around clear cryptocurrency regulation indicates a maturation of the political dialogue. Key impacts of such regulation would include: Enhanced Investor Protection: Clear rules reduce fraud and market manipulation risks. Institutional Participation: Major banks and asset managers could enter the market with confidence. Global Standardization: Other nations would likely model their own frameworks on U.S. rules. Market Stability: Reduced regulatory ambiguity often leads to decreased volatility over time. Conclusion Sygnum Bank’s conditional Bitcoin price prediction of up to $400,000 presents a detailed, cause-and-effect narrative for the cryptocurrency’s future. It posits that definitive US crypto regulation is the missing key to unlocking a wave of sovereign and institutional adoption. This adoption, in turn, could propel Bitcoin’s valuation to unprecedented heights by integrating it into the architecture of global finance as a legitimate reserve asset. While the prediction is speculative and hinges on specific political outcomes, it underscores the critical and growing interconnection between regulatory policy in major economies and the evolution of the entire digital asset ecosystem. The coming months of legislative activity in Washington will therefore be scrutinized by markets as a potential inflection point for Bitcoin’s long-term valuation trajectory. FAQs Q1: What is the main condition for Sygnum’s $400,000 Bitcoin prediction? The primary condition is the United States enacting clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, such as passing the CLARITY Act or similar legislation. Q2: Which countries does Sygnum suggest might add Bitcoin to their reserves? Sygnum identifies pragmatic economies like Japan and Germany, as well as nations facing currency pressures like Brazil and Poland, as potential sovereign adopters. Q3: How would U.S. regulation affect other countries’ decisions? U.S. regulatory clarity is seen as a global standard-setter. It would reduce uncertainty for other nations and provide a legal template, making sovereign adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset a more viable and less risky policy. Q4: What is tokenization, as mentioned in Sygnum’s report? Tokenization is the process of issuing traditional financial instruments, like bonds, on a blockchain. Sygnum predicts up to 10% of new bonds from major institutions could be tokenized, representing a parallel trend of digitizing finance. Q5: Is Sygnum’s prediction a guarantee? No, it is a conditional forecast based on a specific scenario. It is an analytical projection, not a guarantee, and actual outcomes depend on complex political, economic, and market factors.

Known as Qaisar Qamza on social media, the man has already had at least some of his coin wealth seized by the government in Astana, revealed a statement by the country’s main financial watchdog. Kazakh blogger loses Tether paid for promoting online casinos A famous blogger from Kazakhstan is now wanted internationally on allegations of promoting illegal gambling on the Internet, his homeland’s Financial Monitoring Agency (AFM) announced. In the past five years, the 30-year-old Kaisar Kamza Bakytzhanuly was active under the handle “ qais_arr ” on Instagram, where he had 2.4 million subscribers, and administered a closed Telegram channel with 368,000 members. He also had a TikTok account and a YouTube channel. Using his social media accounts, he regularly uploaded videos and other commercial materials directly linking to a website for online betting. He also offered followers his personal promo code, which provided special bonuses to users, the agency said. In its notice posted on Thursday, which was quoted by the Russian business news portal RBC and local media, the AFM detailed further: “Kamza, K.B. advertised the online platform aimed at attracting citizens to participate in gambling, which allowed him to earn income in the form of rewards and percentages.” The blogger received remuneration for his services in the U.S.-dollar pegged stablecoin Tether. Assets amounting to 182,700 USDT have been seized based on a court order, the regulator also noted. “To conceal his illegal income, the suspect used a crypto wallet, which received payments from the organizers of the online casino,” the authority stated, asking for any information about his whereabouts that could lead to his detention. Screenshot of Qaisar Qamza’s Instagram profile. Source: Instagram Kazakhstan seizes millions in cryptocurrency in criminal investigations While working to liberalize and regulate crypto transactions in its economy, the government of Kazakhstan has been cracking down on crypto-related crime. In November, the interior ministry revealed it had registered over 1,000 criminal cases linked to operations with cryptocurrencies in the past couple of years. In September 2025, the country seized $10 million worth of digital assets as part of an investigation into a Ponzi scheme that lured investors from across the former Soviet space. At the end of the month, Kazakhstan disrupted a $224 million crypto laundering service called RAKS, which was quite popular on the dark web. The AFM blocked dozens of its wallets, freezing 9.7 million Tether (USDT). In 2025, the authorities in Astana restricted access to a total of more than 1,100 illegal crypto trading websites, the agency announced in January, as reported by Cryptopolitan this week. The news came after last October, the watchdog said it had busted almost 130 unlicensed crypto exchanges, claiming to have confiscated almost $17 million in virtual currencies from their operators. It’s unclear what the government intends to do with all that digital cash. However, the National Bank of Kazakhstan unveiled in November that it’s going to build a national cryptocurrency reserve. The latter should be established in the first half of 2026 and will hold the equivalent of up to $1 billion in digital coins. The monetary authority has already earmarked $300 million for the purchase. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

What was once a niche digital entertainment sector has matured into a highly competitive global market, with operators constantly adapting to stay relevant. As player behaviour changes and new markets open, several clear trends are shaping how online casinos, sportsbooks, and gaming platforms operate in 2026 and beyond. Player Demand for Speed and Convenience One of the most noticeable trends across iGaming is the growing demand for faster, simpler user experiences. Players increasingly expect instant access, quick onboarding, and minimal friction when signing up or cashing out winnings. This has pushed operators to streamline registration processes, reduce document checks where regulations allow, and improve payment processing times. The popularity of concepts such as instant withdrawal casino no verification reflects a broader shift toward convenience-driven gambling experiences. Mobile-first design has also become essential rather than optional.With a majority of users accessing platforms via smartphones, operators are prioritising fast-loading interfaces, intuitive navigation, and one-tap gameplay. Expansion of Cryptocurrency and Alternative Payments Payment innovation remains a key battleground in the iGaming space. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and stablecoins, are now widely supported by many international platforms, offering faster transactions and enhanced privacy. Alongside crypto, alternative payment methods such as digital wallets, local bank transfers, and buy-now-pay-later-style solutions are gaining traction in certain regions. These options allow operators to cater to diverse markets while reducing reliance on traditional banking systems. For players, the appeal lies in speed and accessibility. For operators, flexible payment infrastructure can improve conversion rates and retention, particularly in emerging markets where card usage may be limited. Artificial Intelligence and Personalisation Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly central role in iGaming operations. AI-driven tools are now used to personalise game recommendations, bonuses, and promotions based on individual player behaviour. Beyond marketing, AI is also enhancing risk management and responsible gambling measures.Advanced algorithms can identify unusual betting patterns, flag potential problem gambling, and help operators intervene earlier. Customer support is another area seeing rapid change. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants now handle a large share of player queries, providing instant responses while reducing operational costs. Live Gaming and Immersive Experiences Live dealer games continue to grow in popularity, bridging the gap between traditional casinos and online platforms. High-definition streaming, professional dealers, and interactive features have made live gaming one of the fastest-growing segments in iGaming. At the same time, virtual reality and augmented reality are beginning to gain attention, even if mass adoption remains some distance away. Several operators are experimenting with immersive casino environments designed to replicate the social feel of land-based venues. While still niche, these technologies highlight the industry’s focus on experience rather than simply expanding game libraries. Regulation and Market Fragmentation Regulation remains one of the most influential forces shaping iGaming trends. Governments across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia continue to update gambling laws, often introducing stricter compliance and player protection requirements. This has led to greater market fragmentation, with operators tailoring platforms to meet country-specific rules.Licensing, advertising restrictions, and responsible gambling standards now vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. For large operators, compliance has become a competitive advantage.Smaller platforms, however, may struggle with the costs and complexity of operating across multiple regulated markets. Rise of Casual and Social Gambling Another notable trend is the blending of gambling with casual gaming and social features. Free-to-play games, social leaderboards, and community-driven challenges are being used to attract a wider audience. This approach appeals particularly to younger users who may be less interested in traditional casino formats. By lowering entry barriers and emphasising entertainment, operators can build brand loyalty before players transition to real-money games. Looking Ahead The iGaming industry shows no signs of slowing down, but success increasingly depends on adaptability. Operators that prioritise user experience, embrace new technologies, and navigate regulation effectively are best positioned to thrive. As competition intensifies, innovation is shifting away from sheer volume of games toward smarter platforms built around speed, trust, and engagement. For players, this means more choice, faster access, and increasingly personalised gaming experiences in a rapidly changing digital landscape.

The meme cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation phase after failing to breach this psychological barrier. DOGE’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex) The broader cryptocurrency market has posted modest gains over the past week. Digital assets have risen 4% during this period, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana all recording positive momentum. Dogecoin has maintained relative stability within this environment, consolidating around the $0.14 mark. Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern Emerges Technical analysts have identified an inverse head-and-shoulders formation on Dogecoin's daily chart. This pattern typically precedes bullish reversals in asset prices. The neckline resistance sits near $0.152, representing a crucial threshold for the cryptocurrency. A successful breakout above this level could trigger a rally toward $0.186. Market participants are watching this resistance zone closely as it may determine the asset's near-term trajectory. The pattern's completion would require sustained buying pressure and increased trading volume. Source: X The inverse head and shoulders formation consists of three distinct troughs. The middle trough forms the ”head” at a lower price point than the two ”shoulders” on either side. A break above the neckline connecting the shoulders' peaks would validate the pattern and suggest further upside potential. Whale Activity Surges Large-scale investors acquired over 297 million DOGE tokens in the past 24 hours. This substantial accumulation has drawn attention from market participants and analysts. Whale movements often precede significant price action in cryptocurrency markets. The timing of these purchases suggests institutional confidence in Dogecoin's prospects. Large holders typically accumulate positions ahead of anticipated price movements or positive developments. This buying activity has generated optimism within the trading community. Historical patterns show whale accumulation frequently correlates with subsequent price appreciation. These investors possess the resources to conduct extensive market research before deploying capital. Their actions may indicate expectations of a market shift or an upcoming catalyst. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator has formed an early bearish crossover. The MACD line has dipped below the signal line while the histogram trends toward neutral territory. This suggests weakening bullish momentum in the short term. The Relative Strength Index currently reads 51, down from a recent high of 59. This neutral reading indicates balanced buying and selling pressure. The RSI sits comfortably between oversold and overbought territories, leaving room for movement in either direction. Support exists at $0.13, where Dogecoin found buyers during previous consolidation periods. A breach of this level would expose the $0.12 zone as the next potential floor. Historical data shows strong buyer interest at these lower price points. Bulls must recapture the $0.15 level to resume upward momentum. This price represents both psychological significance and technical resistance. A decisive break above this threshold could attract additional buying interest and activate the inverse head and shoulders pattern.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-15 11:48:28

In a short thread published by pseudonymous Morpho Network Discord manager Albist, the protocol announced it would close public channels and turn its servers to read-only after careful consideration, effective February 1. “To provide you with safer, more reliable support, all official support and contact are consolidated through the Morpho Help Page and its chatbox. For all Morpho-related questions, technical support, and assistance,” the message from Albist read. Morpho closes Discord due to scams and institutional influence, project developer mulls Monarch Finance developer Anton Cheng shared a screenshot of the thread on X earlier today, saying he “didn’t see it coming.” “This could be a trend for other protocols too, scams, bot scraping, or just too much noise might be at play. But maybe its also signals that big DeFi teams are focusing more on institutions and less on communities. Kinda bittersweet to see defi going mainstream,” Cheng wrote , discussing the reasons why Morpho may have chosen to shut its channels down. Several DeFi community members quoted the post in support of Morpho, with some arguing that crypto activity on most servers has gone lower by the day for the last five years. “Good idea if your team doesn’t have a use for it. Everyone was forced into discords in 2021/2022, but the reality is that people aren’t living in them the way they did back then. So meet your community where they are instead,” an NFT enthusiast wrote on X. Discord was mostly used by gamers who created channels to share tips for activities like speedrunning, but as for crypto, discussions are more retail-heavy and promotional. DeFi platforms are now moving to attract institutional users and business-to-business relationships, so some developers like Cheng believe it is no longer a place to create “communities.” Discord servers are hunting grounds for cons Security concerns have clouded the success of crypto project servers, now ridden by scammers impersonating moderators, posting phishing links, or directly messaging users to coerce them into sending their funds. One of DefiLlama’s dashboard builders, known on X as 0xngmi, said the analytics platform has also been shifting away from Discord. They noted that DefiLlama has made live support chat and email-based ticketing systems its main priority. “Discord makes it impossible to protect your users from getting scammed. Even if you ban scammers instantly, they still DM users directly to scam them,” they surmised. When asked why the move away from Discord is happening now, despite scams being prevalent since 2021, the builder resonated the move to operational fatigue. “Its been a constant battle to keep them in line and at some point its just not worth it esp when we built more a support team since then other support channels have way better tools to make sure nothing is forgotten,” they answered. Moreover, Morningstar Ventures Head of Growth Petr Martynov said Telegram groups with subtopics have a way smoother UX, and Discord is “too complicated even for many web3 degens.” “Unfortunately discord servers of protocols become ghost towns after airdrops/tge rewards are distributed,” he noted. Last October, government ID photos of about 70,000 global Discord users were exposed after hackers breached a company contracted to perform age verification checks for the online messenger. Discord gave a statement later after the incident, saying the leaked data may have included users’ names, email addresses, IP addresses, and messages exchanged with customer service. Zscaler ThreatLabz find malware attacking crypto networks A November investigation by Zscaler ThreatLabz uncovered malware in three malicious software packages hidden inside the public code library NPM Zscaler found that attackers created package names that closely resembled trusted tools from the legitimate bitcoinjs project. In one cited example, a hacker linked to the email address supertalented730@gmail.com and uploaded three packages, including bip40, which was downloaded about 958 times, bitcoin-lib-js with 183 downloads, and 2,286 downloads of bitcoin-main-lib. “To deceive developers into downloading the fraudulent packages, the attacker used name variations of real repositories found within the legitimate bitcoinjs project,” Zscaler’s researchers noted.

Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) increased by 1.1%, now trading at $3,367. This is the category’s second-best performer. The lowest increase was Solana (SOL)’s 0.1%, currently standing at $145. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP (XRP) recorded drops over the past day. DOGE is down 2.4% to the price of $0.1447, while XRP fell 1.6% to $2.11. When it comes to the top 100 coins per market cap, 60 are up today, compared to 95 yesterday. Two of these posted double-digit increases. Provenance Blockchain (HASH) is the category’s best performer. It’s up 20.5%, now trading at $0.02652. The next on the list is Internet Computer (ICP) , having appreciated 11.2% and now standing at $4.21. While two more coins are up by around 6%-7% each, the rest increased by 2% and less per coin. On the red side. Canton (CC) fell the most in the same timeframe. It’s down 8.3% to $0.1301. Next up is Pepe (PEPE) , recording an 8.1% drop to $0.000006108. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin could climb to new all-time highs in 2026. He argued that Bitcoin struggled in 2025 due to liquidity, while gold and the Nasdaq continued rising. “Dollar liquidity must expand” for BTC to outperform, Hayes said. Source: cryptohayes.substack.com BTC Moves Back to Centre of Financial Attention Antonio Di Giacomo, Senior Market Analyst at XS.com , commented that Bitcoin posted a notable bullish move, climbing to the $97,800 area, its highest level in nearly two months. “The rally revived positive sentiment among market participants at a time when risk assets show mixed performance, and investors are assessing opportunities with greater caution,” he wrote. “The cryptocurrency has once again moved to the centre of financial attention, consolidating its role as a barometer of appetite for innovation and alternative hedging.” The primary catalyst, the analyst argues, was a 13,600 BTC purchase by Strategy , its largest since July 2025. The company reinforced its position as the world’s largest corporate BTC holder. “Beyond the volume, the implicit message to the market was clear: institutional conviction in the asset remains intact,” Giacomo said. “However, the rally was not accompanied by uniform enthusiasm across all market segments. Despite price strength, signs have emerged that retail demand, particularly in the United States, remains relatively weak. This contrast suggests that the current move is driven more by technical and institutional factors than by emotional or speculative enthusiasm among the broader public.” The analyst noted that the market is being increasingly dominated by institutional decision-making. The price movements are driven less by mass speculative impulse and more by medium- and long-term capital allocation strategies. “If this balance holds, Bitcoin could remain resilient even during consolidation phases, as long as institutional flows continue to support the asset. However, to accelerate the bullish cycle further, many analysts believe a more substantial return of retail participation will be necessary, as it has historically fuelled the most explosive rallies.” In conclusion, he says, BTC’s recent advance reflects a market increasingly sustained by institutional capital, with major corporate purchases and ETF inflows setting the tone. While retail demand still appears subdued, the current structure suggests a stronger and less speculative foundation than in previous cycles. If this institutional support persists and is eventually joined by renewed interest from the broader public, the outlook for the cryptocurrency could remain favourable in the coming months. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC stood at $97,053. It started the day with an intraday low of $94,736. It soon jumped to $97,704, trading on a similar level since, with a few minor dips. Over the past week, BTC has appreciated 7.7%. In this period, it has been trading in the $89,799-$97,538 range. If BTC manages to hold onto the $95,700–$95,200 demand zone, the bullish structure will remain intact. Moreover, surpassing $98,800 could potentially lead to the coin hitting the psychologically significant level of $100,000. Moreover, Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,367. Its trading day was choppier than BTC’s. Following a fall to the day’s low of $3,281, it surged to the high of $3,386, but saw another dip to the $3,280 level again. It has recovered since. Over the past week, ETH has appreciated by 8.4%, outperforming BTC. It has been trading in the $3,068-$3,379 range. The price seems to be steadily moving towards $3,400. Holding this level may lead to a revisit of the $3,500 level on the path towards reclaiming the $4,000 mark. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Moreover, the crypto market sentiment is still increasing, moving deeper into the neutral zone and further away from the fear zone. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 54 this morning , compared to 52 yesterday. It’s a small increase, but a notable one, given that the metric hovered on the brink of fear territory for days and has now moved towards the green zone. Optimism and hope have been rising amongst market participants since the beginning of the year, following the relative increase in market prices. Still, analysts argue that we’re in a consolidation period, so caution is still notable. ETFs Continue Green Streak On Wednesday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a thirds straight day of positive flows, adding $843.62 million in total, which is the highest level since early October. This is the second day in a row that they’re seeing October levels. With this, the total net inflow increased to $58.12 billion. Notably, eight of the twelve ETFs posted inflows, and none saw outflows again. BlackRock took first place with $648.39 million in inflows. Fidelity is next on this list, having taken in $125.39 million on the same day. Furthermore, the US ETH ETFs posted inflows as well. On 14 January, these totalled $175 million . This is a level briefly seen in December and in October before that. With this latest amount, the total net inflow moved up to $12.74 billion. Six of the nine funds saw inflows, one more than yesterday, and none saw outflows again. The highest amount among these is BlackRock’s total of $81.6 million. Grayscale follows closely with inflows of $75.82 million in total posted on the same day. Meanwhile, Vlad Tenev, head of Robinhood , called out the US lawmakers, as staking remains unavailable in four states. Staking is one of the most sought-after features among the platform’s users, he said, but it’s still inaccessible in these states “due to the current gridlock.” “Stock Tokens are available to our customers in the EU, but not in our home market,” Tenev wrote. “We support Congress’s efforts to pass the market structure bill,” he added. “But we see a path and are here to help the US Senate Banking Committee GOP and the Senate Banking and Housing Democrats get it over the line.” Staking is one of the most requested features on @RobinhoodApp , but it’s still unavailable to customers in four U.S. states due to the current gridlock. Stock Tokens are available to our customers in the EU, but not in our home market. It's time for the US to lead on crypto… — Vlad Tenev (@vladtenev) January 15, 2026 Quick FAQ Did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market posted a slight increase over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the US stock market closed another session lower on Wednesday. By the closing time on 14 January, the S&P 500 was down 0.53%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 1.07%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.086%. Investors were still digesting fresh economic data and bank earnings reports. Is this rally sustainable? Today’s increase is not high compared to yesterday, for example. It’s a minor increase that can still either jump higher or turn red. A drop would not be surprising in the current consolidation period, with prices moving in a relatively tight range.

57185857,https://invezz.com/?p=3032908,1768478065,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Dogecoin faces key test as traders sell into strength near $0.15,https://invezz.com/news/2026/01/15/dogecoin-faces-key-test-as-traders-sell-into-strength-near-0-15/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is once again at a critical crossroads as selling pressure builds near the closely watched $0.15 level. The Dogecoin price has struggled to extend recent gains, even as the broader crypto market shows pockets of strength. This hesitation highlights growing caution among traders and reinforces the idea that DOGE is entering a decisive phase. As a leading memecoin, Dogecoin (DOGE) often reacts sharply to shifts in sentiment, liquidity, and risk appetite, and recent price action suggests that enthusiasm is being tested by both technical resistance and wider market uncertainty. Selling pressure builds as Dogecoin tests resistance Dogecoin price recently attempted to break above the $0.15 area but was met with aggressive selling. Traders sold into strength near $0.151, signalling distribution rather than renewed accumulation. This rejection triggered a sharp intraday pullback, pushing DOGE toward the $0.142–$0.144 support zone. Trading volume surged well above recent averages during the decline, confirming that the move was driven by conviction selling. Such volume behaviour often reflects traders locking in profits after a sustained rally. The selling pressure comes despite Dogecoin maintaining a strong monthly uptrend, underscoring a conflict between short-term caution and medium-term optimism. On lower timeframes, price stabilisation has appeared near session lows, but momentum remains fragile. This pattern reinforces the narrative that buyers are hesitant to chase higher prices without clearer confirmation. Market sentiment weighs on Dogecoin (DOGE) Broader market dynamics have also played a role in DOGE’s recent weakness. Regulatory uncertainty has resurfaced after delays surrounding a key US crypto market legislation . This lack of clarity has dampened institutional risk-taking, particularly across altcoins and memecoins. As a result, capital has rotated toward Bitcoin, leaving Dogecoin underperforming despite overall market resilience. Geopolitical tensions have further weakened risk appetite, reducing speculative demand for high-beta assets like DOGE. This environment tends to favour defensive positioning rather than aggressive breakout trades. Even so, Dogecoin’s longer-term structure remains constructive, with higher lows intact on the monthly chart. This tension between macro caution and technical potential defines the current DOGE setup. Technical structure signals caution From a chart perspective, Dogecoin has been forming a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern. This bullish formation, however, remains unconfirmed until price decisively clears resistance near $0.15. Repeated failures at this level weaken short-term confidence and invite opportunistic selling. Momentum indicators such as the RSI remain neutral, suggesting neither buyers nor sellers have full control. Dogecoin price analysis | Source: TradingView This neutrality leaves DOGE vulnerable to external catalysts, both positive and negative. Support has held so far near the mid-$0.14 range, but repeated tests could erode its strength. The current structure reflects consolidation rather than trend reversal, but patience is wearing thin among traders. Dogecoin price forecast The Dogecoin price forecast now hinges on a narrow set of key technical levels. Immediate resistance remains firmly defined between $0.150 and $0.151, where selling pressure has consistently emerged. A clean breakout above this zone, supported by strong volume, would revive bullish momentum and open the door toward $0.17 and $0.18. Failure to reclaim $0.15 keeps DOGE vulnerable to further consolidation or pullbacks. On the downside, initial support sits near $0.142, which has already acted as a stabilisation area. A decisive break below this level could expose the 30-day moving average near $0.134. Below that, the $0.136–$0.138 range becomes critical for maintaining the broader uptrend. As long as these supports hold, Dogecoin retains its medium-term bullish structure.

That’s the biggest figure the company has ever recorded. It’s also the first time any asset manager has passed the $14 trillion mark. But while that number grabbed attention, profit actually dropped in the last three months of the year because of higher costs. The company made $1.13 billion in net income, which is 33% lower than the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, BlackRock earned $13.16 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $12.24. The company also said base fees, the fixed management fees not tied to performance, went up 9% year-over-year once the effects of market swings were taken out. Total net inflows during the quarter came in at $268 billion, missing the forecast of $311.6 billion, but still a very large number. BlackRock increases dividend and adds more buybacks For the full year, BlackRock’s GAAP operating income dropped 7%, and GAAP diluted earnings per share fell 16%. Both numbers were affected by noncash charges tied to acquisitions and a one-off donation. Those expenses were not counted in the adjusted numbers. Without them, operating income jumped 18%, and diluted EPS rose 10%. The total number of diluted shares for the year was 160.9 million, which was 6% higher than in 2024. The board approved a 10% increase in the cash dividend, now set at $5.73 per share, payable on March 24, 2026, to shareholders on record by March 6. Over the course of 2025, the company gave $5 billion back to shareholders. That includes $1.6 billion from stock buybacks. The board also authorized another 7 million shares to be bought back in the future. Revenue for the fourth quarter hit $7 billion, up 23% compared to Q4 last year. But GAAP operating income for the quarter came in at $1.66 billion, down 20%. The operating margin dropped from 36.6% to 23.7%. Still, on an adjusted basis, operating income was $2.85 billion and the margin was 45%, which is almost the same as last year. ETFs and equity inflows lead $341.7 billion net in Q4 Total net inflows for the quarter were $341.7 billion. Long-term flows made up $267.8 billion of that. Cash management added another $73.9 billion. For the full year, total net flows hit $698.3 billion. Average AUM for the quarter was $13.73 trillion, which was up 19% from the year before. Equity products brought in the most at $126 billion. That pushed total equity assets to $7.79 trillion. Fixed income added $83.8 billion, reaching $3.27 trillion. Multi-asset brought in $36.9 billion, now sitting at $1.22 trillion. Private markets got $12.7 billion of new money, landing at $322.6 billion. Liquid alternatives gained $2.9 billion. Digital assets, however, lost value and ended at $78.4 billion, down from $104 billion. Commodities and currency products added $5 billion, now totaling $169.2 billion. By client type, ETFs dominated the inflow picture, pulling in $181.5 billion. That brought total ETF assets to $5.47 trillion. Retail investors added $81.8 billion, now at $1.28 trillion in total. Institutional clients added only $4.6 billion. Within that, active strategies gained $16.1 billion, while index strategies saw $11.6 billion in outflows. On the investment style side, active funds pulled in $97.7 billion. Non-ETF index products lost $11.4 billion. ETFs were again the big winners, with the same $181.5 billion in flows. Long-term assets now make up $12.96 trillion of the total. The other $1.08 trillion comes from cash management. By region, the Americas brought in $190 billion, EMEA had $86 billion, and APAC had $8 billion in net outflows. On the retail side, equity added $15.2 billion, fixed income brought in $37.6 billion, and multi-asset gained $26 billion. In private markets and liquid alternatives, retail clients added about $2.9 billion. Among ETFs, equity funds got $122.8 billion, and fixed income ETFs got $51.9 billion. Digital asset ETFs had $579 million in new flows. Commodity ETFs added $5.1 billion. For institutions, equity saw a pullback of $4.3 billion, and fixed income was down $2.1 billion. Multi-asset had $9.8 billion added. Private markets and alternatives brought in a combined $12.7 billion, while index strategies shed $11.6 billion. In total, BlackRock added $341.7 billion in assets during the quarter. That came from new money, market growth, and a bit of currency impact. There were $11.1 billion in realizations and $17.7 billion in currency losses. All added up, the final AUM number stood at $14.04 trillion, the biggest in Larry Fink’s history.

IRE stands out for its exceptional liquidity, with $270mm in net assets and a $120.46mm average daily trading volume, supporting efficient execution. IREN is a high-growth, profitable data center operator with major expansion plans and trades at an attractive 23.15x GAAP P/E. I recommend a Buy rating on IRE for daily exposure only, emphasizing strict risk management due to compounding and NAV erosion risks. The Defiance Daily Target 2X Long IREN ETF ( IRE ) is a leveraged exchange-traded fund designed to provide investors with 2x the daily performance of IREN Limited ( IREN ). IRE has a highly liquid market with an average of $120.46mm in share value changing hands on a daily basis, making IRE an appealing investment vehicle for those seeking to amplify their daily exposure to IREN shares. Given the risks associated with trading leveraged strategies, investors should only consider IRE for daily exposure, as the ETF may not be appropriate as a long-term holding; risks associated with leveraged strategies include compounded returns, NAV erosion, and potential losses that may be unrecoverable. About Defiance Daily Target 2X Long IREN ETF Defiance ETFs launched IRE on October 20, 2025, on the NYSE Exchange. IRE has a relatively high expense ratio of 131 bps, modestly higher than peer single-name leveraged stock strategies provided by peers like Direxion Funds, GraniteShares, and Rex Shares, though on par with the Tradr 2x Long IREN Daily ETF ( IREX ). Seeking Alpha I believe the most critical factor to consider when evaluating a leveraged strategy is liquidity. Comparing IRE to peer leveraged IREN ETFs, IRE presents the most liquid market with $270mm in net assets and a 3-month average trading volume of $120.46mm in share value. High liquidity is crucial for actively trading a strategy for a variety of reasons, including asset pricing and cost management as it relates to the bid/ask spread. Accordingly, IRE has an average bid/ask spread of 18 bps, which may add to trading costs for investors. Seeking Alpha IRE utilizes swap derivatives in order to gain 200% exposure to IREN shares. Swap contracts have certain intricacies that may impact the pricing and returns of the ETF, features that should be considered when making an investment decision. Swap contracts are agreements between two parties to exchange daily performance for a fixed rate, settled at the end of each trading day. As a result of the daily settlement, performance is reset on the following trading day, which is reflected in the performance of the ETF. This means that the performance of the ETF will not roll forward and will reset the following day, compounding returns over an extended holding period. This may result in returns beyond the indicated 2x daily performance target, whether to the upside or downside. If misappropriately used, the compounding effect can significantly impact one’s position and may result in compounded losses that may be unsalvageable. In addition to this, leveraged funds may experience NAV erosion, or value decay over time, which may impact performance over a long holding period. For these reasons, investors should only consider trading IRE for daily exposure. IREN Limited is an Australia-based data center and electrical infrastructure operator that’s in the business of mining bitcoin. The company is currently in the process of constructing four 50MW liquid-cooled data centers with the intent of hosting Microsoft ( MSFT ) as part of its 750MW Childress campus. In addition to this, IREN has 2 GW of data center capacity in development at its Sweetwater site, of which 1.4 GW is scheduled for April 2026 and 600 MW for late 2027. A big appeal of IREN is that the firm has reported positive net earnings in recent quarters. Looking at consensus forecasts, IREN is expected to more than double its revenue from eFY26 to eFY27, presenting a high-growth opportunity for investors. Despite being in a strong financial position, concerns about an AI bubble have been growing in recent months as capital investments for AI compute capacity are expected to outweigh returns on investment. Though I don’t agree with the AI bubble theme, investor uncertainty may create short-term trading opportunities in which investors trade on both good and bad news, whether it’s directly involved in domestic AI development or the development of models in China like DeepSeek. From a tactical perspective, IREN is currently exhibiting positive pricing action, though it is trading far above its 50-, 100-, and 200-day simple moving averages and may be turning towards a small sell-off to balance out trading strength. Fundamentally , IREN shares are trading at 23.15x GAAP price/earnings, presenting an appealing valuation for a high-growth company. At a high level, these features may present investors with an appealing opportunity to trade IRE if IREN shares exhibit positive pricing pressure over time. TradingView TradingView Additional Risks Related to IRE Leveraged strategies were designed for daily exposure; holding IRE beyond a single trading day may present investors with certain risks that should be considered in order to protect one’s position. Holding leveraged strategies beyond a single trading day may result in a compounding effect on shares held that may result in returns beyond the indicated 2x performance target, working both to the upside and downside. Long-term exposure to IRE may result in value decay that may impact one’s initial investment. Leveraged strategies may expose investors to greater volatility risk when compared to the underlying shares. Given the risks involved in trading leveraged strategies, I believe traders should adhere to strict risk management protocols, maintaining their trading parameters in order to protect themselves from significant losses. Given that IRE was designed for daily exposure, traders may be exposed to greater short-term capital gains in addition to the expense ratio for holding the shares. You can review additional risks here and the SEC bulletin here . Final Thoughts IRE can be an appealing leveraged ETF for those seeking to amplify their daily exposure to IREN shares, particularly given the high level of liquidity in the market. The market has a long-term positive outlook for IREN shares, potentially presenting investors with an appealing strategy to trade to the upside. Given the risks associated with holding leveraged strategies, investors should only consider IRE for daily exposure; I am recommending IRE with a Buy rating for daily exposure.",IREN|IREX|IRE,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-15 12:00:00

MicroStrategy significantly grew its holdings by purchasing 13,627 BTC for $1.25 billion. The Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act aims to clarify regulation by establishing distinct oversight for digital commodities (CFTC) and centralized assets (SEC). Near-term technical levels point to key support at $95,000 and $92,000, with major resistance at the $100,000 psychological barrier. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has demonstrated a robust recovery as the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap has transitioned from a period of speculative volatility into a phase of institutional consolidation and regulatory formalization. The recent Bitcoin rally has come about as a result of converging factors, which include a cooling inflationary environment in the United States and the imminent arrival of a definitive federal regulatory framework via the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act. Bitcoin is up around 5.59% for the week at the time of writing. Source: TradingView Institutional Treasury Integration and Corporate Accumulation One of the key factors behind the recent rally is the scale of Treasury participation. Many public companies have followed MicroStrategy’s ( MSTR ) lead, using Bitcoin as a standard tool to protect their wealth from inflation. The MicroStrategy Strategy In early January 2026, MicroStrategy significantly grew its holdings: The Purchase - They bought 13,627 Bitcoin for about $1.25 billion (at roughly $91,519 per coin). The Total - This brought their total stash to 687,410 BTC. The Funding - To pay for this, the company sold roughly $1.13 billion in new stock and raised another $119 million through specialized ""preferred"" shares. Long-Term Stability This isn't just a gamble; it's a calculated financial plan. On January 12, Director Carl Rickertsen showed personal confidence by investing nearly $780,000 of his own money into company shares. Furthermore, MicroStrategy is keeping $2.25 billion in cash on hand to pay its bills and dividends, proving they are prepared for the long haul rather than just betting on price spikes. This trend is mirrored by the performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which recorded $697 million in net inflows on January 5 alone, the highest single-day gain in over three months. These inflows, primarily driven by BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity, suggest that institutional allocators are utilizing ETFs as a ""liquidity floor,"" effectively absorbing sell pressure from retail participants. Legislative Catalysts: The Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act Add to this a potential legislative catalyst in the form of a new bill called the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act. This bill aims to stop the confusion between government agencies and create clear rules for the industry. Ending the Turf War The bill draws a ""bright line"" to decide who regulates what: The CFTC - Will oversee ""digital commodities"" (assets that are decentralized and not controlled by one person). The SEC - Will oversee assets that still rely on a central company, though with simpler rules than traditional stocks. The Fight Over Stablecoins The biggest argument in the Senate right now is about stablecoin interest: The Ban - Banks are worried that if people can earn high interest on stablecoins, they will pull their money out of traditional bank accounts. Because of this, the bill currently bans paying interest just for holding a stablecoin. The Exceptions - Companies can still offer rewards if the user is actually doing something, like ""staking"" or using the coin for transactions. The Pushback - Major companies like Coinbase hate these restrictions. They argue the rules are unfair and might force crypto businesses to leave the US. What Comes Next for Bitcoin Prices? Bitcoin is currently in a steady transition phase as the heavy selling seen at the end of 2025 begins to fade. Long-term investors are holding onto their coins more firmly, and institutional buying has stabilized, suggesting the market has successfully absorbed recent price pressure. While the recent climb toward $96,000 was driven more by technical trading maneuvers than a massive wave of new buyers, the overall setup for the first quarter of 2026 looks promising. Given that there is less ""sell pressure"" and trading remains thin, even a small increase in new demand could trigger a significant price jump. If steady buying from spot markets and ETFs continues, this quiet period could be the foundation for the next major leg up. Technical Analysis - BTC-USD Looking at structure though (on the H4 chart), the price has just printed a higher high before dropping in the Asian session. This could partly be down to profit-taking and market participants eyeing consolidation ahead of the next major move. The move lower has led the period-14 RSI to leave overbought territory, with a retest of the neutral 50 level now a possibility. Immediate support may be found at 95000 before the 92000 breakout level and 100-day MA resting at 91042 comes into play. A move higher here will have to navigate its way beyond the 100000 and then gain acceptance above this psychological barrier. Beyond that, market participants may eye the 103647 and 105000 handles as points of interest.

CEO Vlad Tenev sharply criticized the United States’ regulatory gridlock on cryptocurrency policy this week, highlighting how legislative uncertainty continues to block popular services like crypto staking in several states. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, Tenev emphasized that staking, a feature that enables crypto holders to earn rewards by participating in proof-of-stake networks, remains one of the most requested capabilities on the Robinhood app. However, there are four US states where customers cannot access the services at the moment due to various regulatory holdups, he said. He even shared his frustrations that Stock Tokens, referring to tokenized stocks , are available in the EU, while the US still blocks them. “Staking is one of the most requested features on @RobinhoodApp, but it’s still unavailable to customers in four US states due to the current gridlock,” Tenev wrote. “Stock Tokens are available to our customers in the EU, but not in our home market.” Tenev asks lawmakers to pass bills that protect consumers and foster innovation Robinhood’s executive advised the US to lead its effort in crypto policymaking and pushed for lawmakers and regulators to create regulations that protect consumers while fostering innovation. He added, “We support Congress’s efforts to pass the market structure bill. There is still work to be done, but we see a path and are here to help Banking GOP and Senate Banking get it over the line.” Several X users who replied to Tenev’s post backed his call for US regulators to permit staking. One commented , “Staking would be a huge add for crypto investors, Vlad!” Another commenter also stated, “Totally agreed, the US needs to be the leader. It’s the future.” Another popular commentary account, DOGEai_tx, also argued that Robinhood’s state-by-state restrictions on staking reveal a patchy regulatory attitude towards crypto in the United States. It emphasised that H.R. 3633, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, will help reduce the “chaos of state-by-state regulation” and establish national standards that would preempt state regulations regarding security under Section 308, easing the working landscape for Robinhood. However, it noted that even sections 405 and 302 of the bill, designed for consumer protection, allow platforms to boast of “innovation” as they profit handsomely from staking rewards (25%). Just before the bill’s markup on Thursday, crypto exchange Coinbase pulled its support for the bill, cautioning that the provisions on tokenized equities, DeFi, and stablecoin rewards would make it “materially worse than the current status quo.” Robinhood has nearly 2,000 tokenized assets Recently, Robinhood added roughly 500 tokenized assets on the Arbitrum blockchain , including GLXY (Galaxy), BULL (WeBULL), and SNPS (Synopsys). The latest inclusions bring the company’s tokenized count to almost 2,000 assets. Most of those assets, about 73%, are US stocks, while crypto ETFs constitute approximately 24%. Then, US Treasury securities, crypto-linked ETFs, commodities, and private equity together make up the rest of the assets. Following the implementation of new tokenized products on the Arbitrum blockchain network, Tenev (CEO) stated that the implementation process will take place in stages, allowing their tokenized products to be offered to customers. X analyst, Tom Wan, also commented on the new tokens’ availability to EU residents to invest in US stocks and exchange-traded funds. Overall, McKinsey & Company still estimates that tokenized products will reach a total market capitalization of $2 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, the company is also seeing growth in its prediction markets. By the third quarter of 2025, its prediction contracts had already become a major source of revenue, alongside the platform’s tokenization and staking sector.

With blockchain-based payments gaining institutional traction and Ripple expanding its global footprint, speculation now centers on how the company may position itself for its next phase of growth. Market participants increasingly view Ripple not just as a crypto firm, but as a mature financial infrastructure provider with multiple strategic options ahead. In a recent commentary, Jake Claver introduced a forward-looking thesis that outlines two potential paths Ripple could take in 2026. His analysis frames these outcomes as conditional scenarios tied to market structure and corporate strategy rather than as definitive predictions. Ripple might direct list on Texas Stock Exchange 2026 or get acquired. Direct listing = no lockups, no dilution. If acquired by 'BR' company, 1:1 share conversion could be massive. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 15, 2026 A Direct Listing Gains Attention Claver pointed to the possibility of Ripple pursuing a direct listing, potentially on the Texas Stock Exchange. A direct listing would allow Ripple to go public without issuing new shares, which would prevent dilution and remove traditional lockup periods. Existing shareholders could access liquidity immediately, while public markets would establish valuation through open trading rather than underwritten pricing. This route aligns with Ripple’s financial position. The company does not rely on public fundraising to sustain operations and continues to invest heavily in payments infrastructure, regulatory licensing, and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. A direct listing would reflect confidence in its balance sheet and long-term revenue model while preserving shareholder value. Acquisition Becomes a Strategic Alternative Claver also discussed a scenario in which Ripple could become an acquisition target instead of entering public markets. In this case, a large “BR” company, commonly interpreted by market watchers as a major banking or financial rails provider, could pursue Ripple to accelerate its blockchain settlement capabilities. Such a move would allow an acquirer to bypass years of in-house development and regulatory positioning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 One of the most closely watched elements of this scenario involves a potential one-to-one share conversion. Under this structure, Ripple equity could convert directly into shares of the acquiring company. Depending on the acquirer’s market valuation, this conversion could represent a significant value realization for Ripple stakeholders. Why Ripple Attracts Strategic Interest Ripple’s appeal stems from its established enterprise relationships, compliant payment solutions , and deep integration with global financial corridors. Unlike early-stage crypto firms, Ripple operates at scale and aligns closely with regulatory frameworks, which increases its attractiveness to traditional financial institutions seeking blockchain exposure. These qualities explain why acquisition discussions continue to surface, even without any indication that Ripple intends to sell. What the Market Is Watching Next At this stage, no confirmed plans support either outcome. Ripple remains private, independent, and operationally focused on expanding its payments ecosystem. However, as Jake Claver’s analysis highlights, Ripple has reached a level of maturity where strategic optionality becomes a central narrative. As 2026 unfolds, investors will monitor corporate signals closely, knowing that whether through a direct listing or a strategic acquisition, Ripple’s next move could reshape its role within global finance.

This groundbreaking transaction, executed in Paris during early 2025, represents a significant milestone in bridging traditional finance with digital asset infrastructure through collaboration with global financial messaging giant SWIFT. Tokenized Bond Settlement Achieves New Institutional Milestone SG-Forge’s recent transaction demonstrates the practical implementation of blockchain technology for sophisticated financial instruments. The subsidiary utilized its EURCV stablecoin alongside conventional cash to settle a tokenized bond, thereby validating multiple core financial functions on a blockchain platform. Specifically, the deal successfully tested issuance mechanisms, delivery versus payment (DvP) protocols, interest payment structures, and redemption processes. This comprehensive validation addresses longstanding concerns within traditional financial institutions regarding blockchain’s capability to handle complex, regulated financial operations. Financial technology analysts immediately recognized the transaction’s significance. “This represents more than just another blockchain pilot,” noted Dr. Elara Vance, Director of Digital Asset Research at the European Financial Innovation Institute. “SG-Forge has demonstrated that regulated entities can execute complete bond lifecycle management using digital assets while maintaining compliance with existing financial regulations.” The transaction’s timing coincides with increasing regulatory clarity across European jurisdictions, particularly following the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. EURCV Stablecoin Integration with SWIFT Messaging The utilization of SG-Forge’s EURCV stablecoin within the SWIFT network creates a powerful hybrid model for financial settlements. SWIFT, which facilitates trillions in daily cross-border transactions, provides the trusted messaging layer, while the EURCV stablecoin enables instant settlement on a blockchain. This combination potentially reduces settlement times from days to minutes while maintaining the security and audit trails expected in institutional finance. Key technical aspects of the integration include: Interoperability Framework: The system connects traditional banking infrastructure with blockchain networks Regulatory Compliance: EURCV operates within existing EU financial regulations and banking oversight Settlement Finality: Transactions achieve immediate settlement with reduced counterparty risk Audit Trail: Blockchain provides transparent, immutable transaction records Comparative analysis reveals significant advantages over previous approaches: Settlement Method Time Frame Counterparty Risk Infrastructure Required Traditional T+2 Settlement 2 business days Moderate to High Legacy banking systems Pure Blockchain Settlement Minutes Low New blockchain infrastructure SG-Forge Hybrid Model Minutes Low Existing SWIFT + blockchain Institutional Adoption Accelerates Across Europe The transaction occurs within a rapidly evolving European digital asset landscape. Multiple central banks, including the European Central Bank, have advanced their digital euro research. Simultaneously, major financial institutions across Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands have announced tokenization initiatives. SG-Forge’s parent company, Societe Generale, has been particularly active in blockchain experimentation, having previously issued digital green bonds on public blockchain networks. Market data indicates accelerating institutional interest. According to the European Blockchain Observatory, institutional investment in blockchain-based financial infrastructure increased by 47% year-over-year in 2024. Regulatory developments have played a crucial role in this growth. The European Union’s Digital Finance Package and MiCA regulation have created clearer frameworks for digital asset issuance and trading. These regulations specifically address stablecoins, providing guidelines for their issuance, governance, and reserve requirements. Technical Architecture and Security Considerations The settlement system employs a sophisticated technical architecture designed for institutional requirements. SG-Forge built the platform with multiple security layers, including hardware security modules for private key management and multi-signature authorization protocols. The blockchain component likely utilizes a permissioned or hybrid structure, balancing transparency with privacy requirements for financial transactions. Security experts emphasize the importance of this balanced approach. “Institutional adoption requires enterprise-grade security,” explained Marcus Thorne, Chief Security Officer at Digital Finance Security Group. “SG-Forge’s implementation appears to incorporate both blockchain’s cryptographic security and traditional financial controls, creating a robust environment for high-value transactions.” The system reportedly underwent extensive penetration testing and regulatory review before deployment. Key security features include: Multi-party computation for transaction authorization Real-time monitoring for suspicious activity Integration with existing anti-money laundering systems Regular third-party security audits Market Implications and Future Developments This successful settlement has immediate implications for multiple financial market segments. Bond markets, which traditionally involve lengthy settlement cycles, could experience significant efficiency improvements. Secondary market trading of tokenized bonds might benefit from increased liquidity and reduced operational friction. Furthermore, the model potentially extends to other asset classes, including equities, commodities, and derivatives. Industry observers anticipate several developments following this breakthrough: Increased tokenization of government and corporate bonds Expansion of similar hybrid models to other financial institutions Development of standardized protocols for cross-platform interoperability Regulatory refinements based on practical implementation experience The transaction also demonstrates the growing maturity of enterprise blockchain solutions. Early blockchain implementations often struggled with scalability, privacy, and regulatory compliance. Recent advancements in zero-knowledge proofs, layer-2 solutions, and regulatory technology have addressed many of these challenges. Financial institutions now possess more robust tools for implementing blockchain solutions that meet their stringent requirements. Conclusion SG-Forge’s successful tokenized bond settlement represents a pivotal moment in institutional blockchain adoption. By combining traditional financial messaging through SWIFT with blockchain-based settlement using the EURCV stablecoin, the transaction demonstrates a practical path forward for integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. This breakthrough in tokenized bond settlement addresses key concerns regarding scalability, security, and regulatory compliance while potentially unlocking significant efficiency gains across financial markets. As financial institutions continue to explore blockchain applications, this hybrid model may establish a new standard for digital asset transactions in regulated environments. FAQs Q1: What exactly did SG-Forge accomplish with this transaction? SG-Forge successfully settled a tokenized bond using both cash and its EURCV stablecoin, demonstrating that blockchain technology can handle complete bond lifecycle management including issuance, delivery versus payment, interest payments, and redemption within regulatory frameworks. Q2: Why is the involvement of SWIFT significant for this transaction? SWIFT’s participation bridges traditional financial messaging infrastructure with blockchain settlement, allowing institutions to use existing trusted networks while gaining blockchain’s efficiency benefits, potentially accelerating institutional adoption. Q3: How does EURCV differ from other stablecoins in the market? EURCV is a euro-denominated stablecoin issued by a regulated banking subsidiary (SG-Forge) rather than a cryptocurrency company, operating under banking regulations with presumably full banking oversight and compliance with EU financial regulations. Q4: What are the main benefits of tokenized bond settlements? Tokenized bonds can settle in minutes rather than days, reduce counterparty risk through atomic settlements, increase transparency through blockchain records, and potentially create more liquid secondary markets through fractional ownership. Q5: How might this transaction affect traditional bond markets? This development could pressure traditional bond markets to modernize settlement processes, potentially leading to widespread adoption of digital settlement methods, reduced operational costs, and increased accessibility for a broader range of investors.

In 2029, the DOT price is expected to range from a maximum of $10.47 to a minimum of $7.71. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $20.82 in 2032. Polkadot (DOT) is a next-generation blockchain network designed to connect and secure multiple blockchains, enabling them to share data and operate together seamlessly. Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot aims to solve key issues such as scalability, interoperability, and security through its unique multi-chain architecture. The network’s central relay chain coordinates specialized blockchains known as parachains, allowing transactions to be processed in parallel for greater efficiency. DOT, the native token, is used for network governance, staking to secure the ecosystem, and bonding to add new parachains, making it a core component of Polkadot’s growing Web3 infrastructure. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2026-2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $2.18 Market Cap $3.61B Trading Volume $233.27M Circulating Supply 1.65B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $2.29 24-hour Low $2.16 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.16% 50-Day SMA $ 2.12 14-Day RSI 62.25 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 42(Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $ 3.47 Polkadot price analysis: DOT key support and resistance levels indicate a possible breakout Polkadot is fluctuating within a narrow range, with resistance at $2.29 and support at $2.16, indicating market uncertainty. Despite a downtrend, Polkadot is holding above key support levels, suggesting a potential reversal or continuation. Traders are closely watching for a breakout above $2.29 or a dip below $2.16 to determine the next move. On January 15, 2026, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $2.18, down 4.44% in the last 24 hours. The price faces resistance at $2.29 and support at $2.16, indicating volatility. Despite recent fluctuations, Polkadot’s scalability and interoperability remain key focuses in the blockchain community. Polkadot daily price chart: DOT faces key support at $2.16 as price consolidates, eyes potential breakout The daily chart for Polkadot shows a downtrend, with the price dropping below the $2.29 resistance but holding above the $2.16 support. This pattern of lower highs and lows signals bearish momentum, but recent activity suggests DOT may find support near $2.16, with traders watching for a potential reversal or a continuation of the downtrend. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView Currently in a consolidation phase, DOT remains steady at $2.18, just above support. If the price breaks below $2.16, the next support level could be $2.10, extending the bearish trend. However, a move above $2.29 could lead to bullish momentum toward higher resistance. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT faces resistance at $2.29 as the market waits for a momentum shift On the 4-hour chart, Polkadot’s price shows small fluctuations between $2.18 and $2.19. The short-term trend indicates uncertainty, as the price struggles to break above $2.29. With lower trading volume, there is a lack of clear direction from buyers or sellers. If Polkadot continues to hover between support and resistance, a breakout could occur once the market gains momentum. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView On the shorter timeframes, the RSI remains neutral, hovering near the 50-mark, indicating a balance between buying and selling pressure. As Polkadot approaches critical levels, the price is likely to react strongly in either direction, making the upcoming hours crucial for determining the next short-term movement. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 2.73 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.60 SELL SMA 10 $ 2.45 SELL SMA 21 $ 2.46 SELL SMA 50 $ 2.75 SELL SMA 100 $ 3.35 SELL SMA 200 $ 3.79 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 2.50 SELL EMA 5 $ 2.73 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.10 SELL EMA 21 $ 3.45 SELL EMA 50 $ 3.70 SELL EMA 100 $ 3.86 SELL EMA 200 $ 4.21 SELL What can you expect next for Polkadot (DOT)? Polkadot is at a critical juncture, with key levels of resistance and support determining its next move. If the price breaks above $2.29, it could lead to bullish momentum, while a dip below $2.16 may signal further bearish action. Traders will be watching these levels closely for a breakout or continuation of the current trend. The market’s next steps depend on how Polkadot responds to these key zones. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot offers strong scalability and interoperability, making it a valuable player in the blockchain ecosystem. Its technology aims to improve communication between multiple blockchains, which is a key factor in the growing Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors. Despite recent price fluctuations and a current downtrend, Polkadot’s long-term potential remains intact, especially if it can successfully break above resistance levels or hold key support. However, as with any investment, it’s crucial to monitor key levels and market sentiment closely. For those looking to invest, Polkadot’s innovation and future scalability present potential opportunities, but short-term volatility should be considered when making decisions. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot’s recent price decline can be attributed to ongoing market volatility and uncertainty. On January 15, 2026, Polkadot is down 4.44% in the last 24 hours, with the price fluctuating within a narrow range between $2.18 and $2.19. The broader crypto market sentiment has been volatile, which may have contributed to DOT’s downtrend, as it faces key resistance at $2.29 and support at $2.16. Additionally, the lower trading volume indicates a lack of strong conviction from buyers and sellers, further amplifying the uncertainty surrounding the token’s near-term price movement. Despite the short-term decline, Polkadot’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, particularly due to its scalability and interoperability features, which continue to be key drivers of its value in the blockchain ecosystem. Will Polkadot reach $10? Yes, according to long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $10 by 2029. Will Polkadot reach $20? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $20 by 2032. Will Polkadot reach $100? Reaching $100 for Polkadot (DOT) is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Does Polkadot have a promising long-term future? Based on Polkadot’s ongoing buying demand and positive community support, the DOT price is set to make new highs in the coming years. However, you are advised to do your research before investing in the volatile market, especially considering future performance.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In December 2024, Polkadot showed signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4. In January 2025, Polkadot peaked at $7.98 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, resulting in a trading range of $4.64 to $5.28 in February. In March 2025, Polkadot (DOT) traded at approximately $4.30. In April 2025, Polkadot (DOT) experienced a gradual downtrend, with its price hovering slightly below the $4 mark amid ongoing market volatility. In May, Polkadot (DOT) began trading at around $ 4.10 and exhibited moderate fluctuations. As of the latest update, the price has declined slightly and is currently hovering near $ 3.90, reflecting a mild bearish trend so far. Polkadot (DOT) declined from a high of around $4.20 to approximately $3.30 in June, with a consistent downtrend and brief rebounds near $3.60 in July. In August 2025, Polkadot traded around $4.10, maintaining a steady pace with limited volatility. The price slightly dipped during September 2025, hovering near $4.00 as market sentiment remained neutral. By October 2025, DOT showed mild recovery, trading near $4.30, suggesting cautious accumulation among traders amid broader market stabilization. As of November 2025, Polkadot price fluctuated between $2.55 and $2.67 before stabilizing around $2.60. Polkadot fell from roughly $2.7 in early November to about $2.1 by the end of the month, holding near the same level in early December. As of January 2026, Polkadot (DOT) has traded in a relatively tight range between roughly $2.10 and $2.25, with brief intraday rebounds toward $2.22 before pulling back to around $2.17.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOT|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|ASTR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-15 12:10:28

The debate is no longer about ideology or price cycles, but about utility, regulation, and whether the technology can deliver outcomes meaningful enough for institutions, businesses, and everyday users. With Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold” largely settled, attention is shifting to what comes next—and whether the broader token economy can underpin real economic activity. Yat Siu, Chairman of Animoca Brands, argues that this moment closely resembles the post–dotcom reset, when excesses gave way to durable platforms and long-term winners. In his view, the next wave of growth will be driven by utility-focused altcoins, clearer regulatory frameworks such as Europe’s MiCA, and a funding cycle increasingly centred on liquid, established digital assets rather than speculative launches. Speaking ahead of his participation at Davos’ Web3 Hub, Siu outlines why identity, tokenization, and compliant public blockchains are moving to the centre of global economic discussions—and what the “crypto curious” should be watching as Web3 seeks a seat at the institutional table. At Davos this year, we expect a clear signal that crypto and blockchain have moved beyond ideology and speculation, and into a phase defined by utility, regulation, and institutional collaboration. Invezz: If Bitcoin is the anchor, which non-gaming utility sector will deliver the fastest real-world value to the “crypto curious,” and why? Bitcoin will continue to cement its status as “digital gold,” but real utility will come from the broader altcoin market. Many people who enter crypto do so through tokens that offer some kind of utility, whether it be in DeFi, NFTs, etc. I’d say identity will deliver the most real-world value to the crypto curious in terms of verifiable credentials, tokenized memberships, and loyalty programs. Almost everyone has a pain point here, proving who they are, proving what they own, or accessing benefits across platforms. You don’t need to understand DeFi to see the value of “this token proves I’m a verified professional, student, or premium customer.” That’s real-world utility people can grasp instantly. Invezz: Which real-world asset classes (real estate, infrastructure, IP, royalties, etc.) are closest to mainstream tokenization, and what are the single biggest operational barriers still blocking scale? Today, digital music has been completely integrated into our lives to the point that we no longer say “digital music” or “MP3”; we simply call it music. As such, royalties and IP are actually the closest to achieving mainstream today. Music, film, gaming IP, and creator royalties are already moving into tokenized forms because the ownership and cash-flow structure is discrete, digital, and enforceable. Custody and interoperability will be the biggest operational barrier. It’s easy to mint a token representing an asset, but if exchanges, custodians, wallets, and marketplaces don’t “talk to each other,” you’ve got isolated silos. And then there’s the regulatory compliance side: KYC, AML, and cross-border legal frameworks can still be ineffective. Invezz: Many large companies are risk-averse about tokenizing assets. What mistakes or misconceptions will cause incumbents to be left behind, and what immediate, low-cost steps should they take to avoid that fate? Businesses must tokenize or die. Today, companies that do not tokenize their assets to make them more accessible to AI and Web3 liquidity will become less relevant in much the same way that traditional businesses lost to internet-savvy competitors like Amazon or Steam. The biggest mistake is thinking this is “just another IT project.” It’s not; tokenization is a business model. Immediate, low-cost steps include simply exploring the possibilities of tokenization. Mapping out network effects and unearthing how tokenizing assets could unlock new partnerships or audiences will serve to identify strategic opportunities, inform decision-making, and lay the groundwork for scalable, value-driven implementations. Invezz : Regulators and institutions are citing frameworks like MiCA. What specific regulatory guardrails or market infrastructure are still missing to make public blockchains a trusted settlement layer for banks and asset managers? The adoption of compliant, institutional-grade tokenization frameworks in major jurisdictions, such as the EU’s MiCA regulation, makes RWAs a compelling reason for major banks and asset managers to engage with public blockchains. MiCA and similar rules are a good start, but public blockchains aren’t ready for banks yet. To become trusted settlement layers, they still need clear global rules, strong risk and compliance frameworks, legal certainty for on-chain transactions, tools for monitoring and auditing, and integration with existing financial systems. Until these exist, banks can experiment, but cannot fully replace traditional ledgers with public blockchains. Invezz: In contrast to Europe, how do you view the US regulatory landscape in 2026? Are we seeing a divergence where innovation continues to migrate to Europe and Asia, or is the US finally catching up to becoming a “viable settlement layer” for banks? The US is still fragmented. Some states are aggressively pro-crypto, some agencies are cautious, and the SEC’s stance is still heavy-handed in areas like token securities. On the other hand, Europe, with MiCA and sandboxes, is more consistent and predictable. While the GENIUS Act provided an initial legal framework, the industry also gained much-needed guidance with the proposed Clarity Act in the US, which establishes a framework to define SEC vs CFTC jurisdiction over digital assets. I believe the Clarity Act will pass Congress in 2026 and will trigger a wave of tokenization for many types of companies in the US, both large and small. Invezz: Animoca is moving toward a Nasdaq listing. What strategic advantages do you expect that listing to bring for Animoca’s portfolio companies and for broader institutional engagement with Web3? The reverse merger of Animoca Brands and Currenc will result in the world’s first publicly-listed, diversified digital assets conglomerate, giving investors on Nasdaq direct access to the growth potential of the trillion-dollar altcoin digital economy through a single, diversified vehicle spanning DeFi, AI, NFTs, gaming, and DeSci. I believe that this proposed transaction will usher in a new asset class that should position investors at the forefront of one of the greatest opportunities of our generation.

57185835,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261836,1768479317,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin’s Resilient Rise: How Surging Spot Demand Signals a Healthier Market Foundation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-spot-demand-market-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Resilient Rise: How Surging Spot Demand Signals a Healthier Market Foundation In a significant shift for the world’s leading cryptocurrency, a compelling analysis reveals that Bitcoin’s remarkable 2025 rally is being primarily driven by robust spot market demand. This fundamental shift away from futures-led speculation points toward a potentially more sustainable and healthier market structure, according to data examined by industry analysts. The trend, which became particularly evident during Bitcoin’s recent ascent from $90,000 to over $97,000, suggests a maturation in investor behavior that could have profound implications for long-term stability. Bitcoin Spot Demand: The Engine of Organic Growth Market analysts at CoinDesk, citing on-chain data from Checkonchain, have identified a clear transition in market dynamics. During the latest price surge, demand demonstrably shifted from derivative futures contracts to direct purchases on the spot market. This distinction is crucial for several reasons. Primarily, spot demand reflects the acquisition of the actual underlying asset. Consequently, it indicates genuine buying interest from investors, institutions, and potentially long-term holders. Furthermore, this type of demand creates a more solid price foundation compared to leveraged speculation. Supporting this observation, data from CoinGlass shows that aggregate Bitcoin futures open interest has remained relatively flat despite the price increase. Typically, a futures-led rally would see open interest—the total number of outstanding derivative contracts—climb sharply alongside price. The absence of this pattern strongly suggests that new capital is flowing directly into Bitcoin itself rather than through leveraged bets on its future price. This development marks a notable evolution from previous bull cycles, which were often characterized by excessive leverage. Decoding the Futures Market Signals While spot buying takes center stage, the derivatives market still provides critical signals about trader sentiment and potential risks. A key variable identified in the analysis is the perpetual futures funding rate. This mechanism periodically transfers payments between long and short position holders to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price. A negative funding rate indicates that traders holding short positions are paying a fee to those holding long positions. This scenario often emerges when there is a prevalent bearish sentiment or a high concentration of short bets in the market. The current confluence of rising spot prices and a persistently negative funding rate creates a specific market condition. Analysts warn this setup could increase the risk of a short squeeze. A short squeeze is a rapid, self-reinforcing price move upward. It occurs when rising prices force traders who have bet against the asset (shorted it) to buy back Bitcoin to cover their losses, thereby adding more fuel to the buying pressure. This cascade of liquidations can lead to explosive, albeit sometimes volatile, upward movements. Spot Market: The exchange where assets like Bitcoin are traded for immediate delivery. Futures Market: A derivative market where contracts to buy or sell an asset at a future date are traded. Open Interest: The total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. Funding Rate: A periodic payment exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to tether the contract price to the spot price. Expert Insight: A Maturing Market Landscape This shift toward spot-driven growth is widely interpreted by seasoned market participants as a sign of maturation. Historically, parabolic price increases fueled by futures and excessive leverage have often preceded sharp corrections. In contrast, accumulation in the spot market suggests stronger conviction among buyers, as they are taking direct custody of the asset without employing high leverage. This behavior is frequently associated with institutional players, exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows, and long-term investors who are less sensitive to short-term volatility. The broader context is essential. Since the approval and successful integration of several U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, a new, steady channel for spot demand has been institutionalized. These financial products require their issuers to purchase actual Bitcoin to back their shares, creating a consistent baseline of spot market buying pressure. This structural change in the market’s infrastructure provides a plausible explanation for the sustained spot demand observed in 2025, differentiating this cycle from those that came before it. Historical Context and Market Impact Understanding this dynamic requires a look back. Previous major Bitcoin rallies, notably in 2017 and 2021, exhibited clear signatures of futures and leverage dominance. Metrics like the estimated leverage ratio and funding rates often reached extreme levels. The subsequent market downturns were exacerbated by the unwinding of this leverage. The current environment, while not devoid of leverage, shows a marked difference in the primary demand driver. The potential impact is twofold. First, a spot-driven market may experience less extreme volatility during pullbacks, as there are fewer cascading liquidations from over-leveraged positions. Second, it could lead to a more gradual and sustained appreciation in price, as it is built on actual capital inflow rather than credit expansion within the crypto ecosystem. However, analysts caution that the negative funding rate serves as a reminder that speculative forces are still present and can trigger sharp moves if the price momentum continues upward. Spot vs. Futures-Led Rally Characteristics Characteristic Spot-Led Rally Futures-Led Rally Primary Driver Direct asset purchases Leveraged derivative contracts Market Health Indicator Generally viewed as healthier Often viewed as more speculative Price Stability Potentially more stable foundation Prone to high volatility from liquidations Investor Profile Long-term holders, institutions Short-term traders, speculators Key Risk Overvaluation, macro shifts Short squeezes, long squeezes, liquidity crises Conclusion The analysis of Bitcoin’s current price action underscores a pivotal development: the rise appears fundamentally supported by authentic Bitcoin spot demand . This transition from a futures-dominated environment to one where spot buying leads the charge suggests a deeper, more resilient market foundation. While the specter of a short squeeze remains a near-term risk due to negative funding rates, the overarching narrative points toward market maturation. For investors and observers, this shift highlights the importance of monitoring on-chain spot flow data and derivative metrics in tandem to fully grasp the underlying forces shaping cryptocurrency’s volatile yet evolving landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the difference between spot demand and futures demand for Bitcoin? A1: Spot demand refers to buying the actual Bitcoin asset for immediate delivery and settlement. Futures demand involves buying contracts that speculate on Bitcoin’s future price, often using leverage, without taking immediate ownership of the asset. Q2: Why is spot demand considered a healthier indicator for Bitcoin’s price? A2: Spot demand is considered healthier because it represents real capital entering the market to own the asset directly. It suggests long-term conviction and reduces systemic risk from the cascading liquidations that can occur in over-leveraged futures markets. Q3: What is a short squeeze, and how is it related to current Bitcoin market conditions? A3: A short squeeze happens when rising prices force traders who bet on a price decline (shorts) to buy back the asset to limit losses. Their buying adds upward pressure, squeezing prices higher. The current condition of rising spot prices with negative funding rates (indicating many shorts) increases this risk. Q4: How have Bitcoin ETFs influenced spot market demand? A4: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs create constant, institutional-grade spot demand. To issue shares, ETF providers must purchase actual Bitcoin, channeling traditional market capital directly into the spot market and providing a structural base of buying pressure. Q5: Does strong spot demand guarantee Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise? A5: No. While strong spot demand creates a solid foundation, Bitcoin’s price remains subject to broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market sentiment. It reduces certain risks but does not eliminate market cycles.

57186039,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=27723,1768479410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What is Rayls (RLS)?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/what-is-rayls-rls/,"Rayls is an institutional-grade blockchain ecosystem designed to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralised finance (DeFi). Positioned as “the blockchain for banks,” it provides financial institutions with the infrastructure to operate privately, settle securely and access global liquidity—without compromising compliance, confidentiality or performance. Its aim is simple but far-reaching: to unlock more than $100 trillion in traditional financial assets and bring 6 billion banked users on-chain by combining institutional safeguards with the openness and interoperability of public blockchains. Institutional-Grade Infrastructure Financial institutions demand privacy, predictable performance and regulatory certainty—conditions public blockchains were never designed for. Rayls addresses this through a unified three-layer architecture that separates private institutional execution from public blockchain liquidity and interoperability. This enables institutions to bring key operations on-chain—from client account management and near-real-time cross-border and FX settlement, to the tokenisation and distribution of real-world assets (RWAs)—all within the same compliant ecosystem. At a glance, Rayls Privacy Nodes are private, single-node EVM chains operated individually by each institution for high-throughput internal workflows and confidential execution, with support for gasless or alternative-fee models. Rayls Private Networks are permissioned, multi-institution settlement layers that connect groups of Privacy Nodes into shared, governed environments for interbank settlement and regulatory-aligned collaboration. Multiple Private Networks can exist, each serving specific jurisdictions, asset classes or consortium groups. Above these sits the Rayls Public Chain , an EVM Layer-1 offering predictable USD-pegged gas fees payable using stablecoins including USDt, fast and deterministic finality, harmful MEV (Maximal Extraction Value) protection and compliant access to global liquidity. The Rayls Public Chain also periodically commits state roots to Ethereum, inheriting Ethereum’s security features, providing censorship-resistance and recovery assurances aligned with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. All three components run on a unified execution stack powered by Reth , ensuring consistent performance and seamless interoperability across private and public environments. Both the Rayls Public Chain and Private Networks currently use an RBFT-based consensus model, with the public chain scheduled to migrate in 2026 to Rayls Axyl , a next-generation consensus engine engineered for sub-second block times, deterministic finality and institutional-scale throughput with design targets in the tens of thousands of transactions per second. Rayls also incorporates Rayls Enygma , a next-generation cryptographic framework that enables private transactions and encrypted balances through a combination of zero-knowledge proofs, encrypted state commitments, and post-quantum secure key exchange. Enygma allows institutions to transact confidentially while still providing regulators with selective visibility, a requirement for CBDCs, tokenised deposits, and interbank settlement. Rayls meanwhile, provides native on-chain identity services, enabling institutions to verify counterparties and enforce compliance requirements using cryptographic attestations, while preserving user privacy and EVM compatibility. Although Rayls is designed primarily for banks, its public chain is fully open and, being EVM-compatible, allows developers, dApps and retail users to build and transact on the same infrastructure used by such institutions. Rayls infrastructure is already being used by more than 25 major financial institutions across production and pilot environments. The Brazilian Central Bank’s Drex CBDC pilot , for example, is using Rayls to enable private institutional settlement and encrypted transaction flows for both central and commercial banks. Núclea , the largest financial market infrastructure provider in the Southern Hemisphere, is using Rayls to power tokenisation and receivables platforms at national scale. Meanwhile Cielo , Brazil’s largest merchant acquirer, began building payment and yield-bearing asset products on Rayls in Q4 2025. The network was also ranked No.2 in J.P Morgan’s 2024 EPIC report , recognising it as one of the most advanced institutional blockchain architectures tested in real-world financial environments. Get Started What Is the RLS Token? RLS is the Rayls ecosystem’s native utility token, used across all three layers of the network for transaction fees, staking, security and governance. Institutions operating Privacy Nodes and participating in Private Networks generate usage fees denominated in USD but settled in RLS, while users on the public chain pay predictable USD-priced gas fees in stablecoins, which are automatically converted into RLS at settlement. This creates a unified fee market where all activity, public or private, ultimately settles in the same token. RLS also secures the Rayls Public Chain through proof-of-stake. Validators must stake RLS to participate in consensus, process transactions, and verify zero-knowledge proofs coming from private networks. Honest validators earn RLS rewards funded by network fees, while malicious behaviour can lead to slashing, providing strong economic incentives for correct behaviour. Beyond fees and staking, RLS functions as the governance token of the Rayls ecosystem. Token holders vote on protocol upgrades, validator requirements, burn parameters, ecosystem grants and other decisions that shape the evolution of the network as institutional adoption increases. Importantly for crypto-native users, RLS represents a direct economic link between institutional usage and token demand. As more financial institutions move settlement, payments, tokenisation flows and cross-border activity onto Rayls, their usage generates fees that must be settled in RLS, creating a natural source of ongoing demand that scales with real financial volume rather than speculative activity. Rayls Tokenomics Initial Supply and Distribution At the Token Generation Event (TGE), approximately 1.5 billion RLS (15% of total supply) entered circulation. The remaining supply is allocated across ecosystem development, contributors, investors and community initiatives, with long-term vesting schedules designed to align incentives with sustainable network growth. Fixed Supply and Deflationary Design RLS has a fixed total supply of 10 billion tokens. No additional RLS can be minted. Every transaction across Rayls generates RLS fees, which are split automatically: 50% are burned, permanently reducing circulating supply, and 50% fund the Network Security Pool, which compensates validators and supports ecosystem development. As adoption grows, particularly across institutional workflows, more RLS is removed from circulation, creating deflationary pressure. Once supply falls below 70% of the original amount, token holders may vote to adjust the burn rate. Rayls will also soon introduce a Proof of Usage (PoU) framework, where anonymised cryptographic proofs of institutional activity are published on-chain, providing transparent visibility into network usage, fee generation and token burns without revealing sensitive transaction or counterparty data.

Over the past 24 hours, LTC fell 3.68%, while Bitcoin (BTC) and other major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , posted gains. The recent decline highlights mounting pressure from technical breakdowns and on-chain activity. Whale activity raises uncertainty Santiment’s Age Consumed index shows that Litecoin whale transactions ($100k+) spiked to a five-week high of 503 on January 14. Santiment’s Age Consumed index on Litecoin | Source: Santiment This surge coincided with LTC falling to $75, signalling potential selling pressure. Whale activity can indicate accumulation or distribution, and in LTC’s case, the direction remains unclear. Historically, similar spikes in December 2025 coincided with local tops, creating psychological pressure for retail traders to exit positions. A rebound above $78.75, the 50% Fibonacci retracement, could signal accumulation and support near-term recovery. Litecoin ETF remain stagnant Institutional interest in Litecoin remains muted, with the Canary Capital Litecoin ETF (NASDAQ: LTCC) seeing negative inflows for five consecutive days. In comparison, Solana ETFs recorded $10.67M in inflows , while XRP ETFs drew $15.04M . This lack of institutional activity underscores a broader apathy toward LTC. Litecoin’s 60-day return of -25% further discourages institutional investors from reallocating capital to the asset. The ETF stagnation adds to bearish sentiment, leaving Litecoin vulnerable to continued downside pressure. Technical breakdown fuels selling pressure The breach of LTC’s $77.91 pivot point triggered algorithmic selling, accelerating the decline. The MACD histogram currently sits at -0.489, signalling bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA at $99.13 highlights long-term weakness, while the RSI of 39.23 indicates room for further downside before becoming oversold. Litecoin price analysis | Source: TradingView Traders are now closely watching the $72.76 swing low as immediate support. Failure to defend this level could expose Litecoin to a retest of the October 2025 low at $50. Bitcoin dominance, currently at 59.06%, continues to anchor market sentiment, limiting capital flows into altcoins like LTC. Litecoin price forecast Monitoring Litecoin ETFs, technical indicators, and Bitcoin dominance is essential for evaluating market momentum, and investors and traders should consider these factors carefully to navigate both short-term volatility and medium-term recovery potential. In addition, traders should also monitor key levels for Litecoin price action in the short and medium term. Immediate support lies at $72.76, with a potential rebound above $78.75 signaling accumulation. A sustained move above the $77–$80 resistance zone could open the path toward $87–$95, as highlighted by medium-term technical forecasts. Conversely, a breakdown below $72.76 may see LTC retest $66–$68, with a more extreme scenario targeting the $50 mark.

According to a ministry statement, Kim Jung-kwan met with representatives of the South Korean semiconductor industry to discuss how to address the 25% duty imposed on semiconductors. During the meeting, Kim Jung-kwan stated that the tariffs will not significantly impact Korean businesses, as they do not apply to semiconductors used in U.S. data centers and startups. South Korea responds to U.S. AI chip tariffs The ministry stated companies, however, noted that a White House fact sheet suggested Trump may impose higher tariffs on imported semiconductors and related products to encourage domestic manufacturing. Such a move would create significant uncertainty for the semiconductor sector, the statement added. Notably, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on specific AI chips, such as the Nvidia H200 AI processor, and a comparable semiconductor from AMD called the MI325X. The action was announced in a new national security order issued by the White House on Wednesday. The White House fact sheet stated that Trump understood the essential nature of both national security and the economy, recognizing the need to restore domestic production capabilities for semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and products derived from them. The report revealed that the U.S. Secretary of Commerce’s Section 232 investigation under the Act was the basis for Trump imposing a 25% tariff on certain AI semiconductor chips. The investigation concluded that there is a threat to national security from the existing import volumes and conditions of semiconductors, related production equipment, and derivative items. According to the administration, the Commerce Secretary suggested a tariff offset scheme that would provide companies investing in U.S. semiconductor production and particular supply chains with priority treatment. The plan also included the possibility of imposing significantly higher tariffs on a broader range of semiconductor imports . Commerce Secretary proposals follow a series of previous tariff threats and measures targeting imported semiconductors. According to Cryptopolitan, the Trump administration threatened to apply tariffs of up to 100% on imported semiconductors last summer, except for businesses that construct semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the U.S. The report further noted that Trump had previously suggested placing tariffs at levels higher than 100%, possibly as high as 200% or 300%. In April of last year, Trump imposed global reciprocal tariffs in response to the national emergency presented by the U.S.’s extensive and ongoing trade imbalances. SK monitors won stability amid $350B investment pledge Beyond tariffs, South Korea is closely monitoring the U.S. Treasury’s stance on currency stability, as Secretary Scott Bessent’s recent remarks have raised concerns about the potential devaluation of the won and its impact on bilateral commerce and investment. SK Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Koo Yun Cheol said on Thursday that Scott Bessent’s remarks regarding the recent weakening of the Korean won demonstrate Washington’s understanding of the importance of stable foreign exchange rates in an investment promise. According to a U.S. Department of the Treasury report, Bessent claimed that the recent weakness of the won was inconsistent with South Korea’s “strong” economic fundamentals at a meeting in Washington with visiting Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol. Additionally, he emphasized that “excess volatility” in the foreign currency market is not desired. Senior Ministry of Economy and Finance official Choi Ji-young told reporters that the two finance ministers concurred that a stable won is crucial for bilateral trade and economic cooperation, and expressed concerns about the won’s recent sharp decline. The continued efforts to fulfill South Korea’s investment pledge align with the discussion about the stability of the won, a crucial component of the broader trade and economic agreement between the United States and South Korea. In October of last year, Seoul and Washington completed the specifics of South Korea’s $350 billion investment commitment, which was made in exchange for a reduction in U.S. tariffs. Under the agreement, South Korea would make annual cash installments of $200 billion to the United States. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

57186012,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261846,1768479911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitmine’s Bold $200M Bet: Strategic Investment in MrBeast’s Beast Industries Signals New Era,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitmine-investment-mrbeast-beast-industries/,"BitcoinWorld Bitmine’s Bold $200M Bet: Strategic Investment in MrBeast’s Beast Industries Signals New Era In a move that merges the frontiers of digital currency with mainstream influencer empire-building, publicly-traded crypto asset firm Bitmine (BMNR) has committed a substantial $200 million equity investment into Beast Industries. This corporate holding company manages the vast business interests of Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, the world’s most-subscribed individual YouTuber. Reported first by Bloomberg and Reuters on March 15, 2025, this transaction represents one of the largest direct investments by a cryptocurrency-focused entity into a creator-led conglomerate, potentially reshaping how digital asset firms leverage mainstream reach. Bitmine’s Strategic Pivot and the Beast Industries Portfolio Bitmine, primarily known for its strategic accumulation and management of Ethereum (ETH) reserves, is executing a deliberate diversification. Consequently, this investment marks a significant shift from pure digital asset treasury management into equity stakes in high-growth, consumer-facing digital media enterprises. The company’s leadership, including CEO Arman Sarhaddar, has frequently discussed seeking “real-world utility and adoption channels” for blockchain technology. Therefore, Beast Industries presents a unique vector. Beast Industries operates as the umbrella for MrBeast’s ventures beyond YouTube ad revenue. These include: Feastables: A rapidly expanding snack food company. MrBeast Burger: A virtual restaurant concept with global delivery partnerships. Team Trees / Team Seas: Environmental fundraising initiatives. Content Production: The core engine of video creation across multiple channels. Analysts suggest Bitmine’s capital will fuel international expansion for these brands, particularly Feastables and retail-facing projects. Moreover, the deal includes provisions for potential future integration of Web3 loyalty programs or payment solutions, though neither company has confirmed specific product roadmaps. Market Context and Financial Implications of the Deal The cryptocurrency market has increasingly sought bridges to traditional consumer bases. For instance, other firms have sponsored sports arenas or launched celebrity endorsements. However, Bitmine’s direct equity purchase in a holding company is a more integrated, long-term approach. Financial filings show Bitmine allocated part of its substantial treasury, built during the 2023-2024 market accumulation phase, for this strategic acquisition. Comparative Strategic Investments (2023-2025) Company Investment Target Amount Type Bitmine (BMNR) Beast Industries $200M Equity Stake Competitor A Sports League Sponsorship $85M Marketing Deal Competitor B Payment App Startup $120M Venture Capital This table illustrates Bitmine’s comparatively larger, more direct bet on an existing audience platform. Market reaction was initially positive, with BMNR shares rising approximately 5% in pre-market trading following the announcement. Importantly, the deal valuation for Beast Industries was not fully disclosed, but sources indicate it provides Bitmine with a significant minority stake and a board observer seat. Expert Analysis on Synergy and Risk Dr. Lena Chen, a professor of digital media economics at Stanford University, provided context. “This isn’t merely a sponsorship,” Chen explained. “It’s a structural alignment. Bitmine gains a direct pipeline to MrBeast’s predominantly young, digitally-native audience of hundreds of millions. Conversely, Beast Industries receives patient capital from a firm that understands digital-native assets and global scaling.” Chen also highlighted inherent risks. “The regulatory environment for crypto remains fluid. Furthermore, the valuation of creator-led businesses is highly tied to individual brand equity. Any significant shift in public perception creates volatility. Bitmine’s shareholders are betting that the operational strength of Beast Industries transcends the personal brand.” Simultaneously, analysts from firms like Bernstein and JPMorgan noted the investment’s timing. It coincides with a broader maturation phase in both the crypto and creator economies, where institutional capital seeks stable, revenue-generating outlets beyond speculative asset trading. The Future of Creator-Led Conglomerates and Crypto Integration This partnership may establish a blueprint. Other top creators with diversified business holdings could attract similar strategic investments from tech and finance sectors seeking authentic engagement. The key question is whether this capital will fund traditional business expansion or enable novel Web3 experiments. Potential integration areas, based on industry trends, include: Tokenized Rewards: Loyalty programs for Feastables or merchandise using blockchain for verification. Transparent Philanthropy: Using smart contracts for donations to Team Seas or other charities, ensuring traceability. Fan Engagement: Limited digital collectibles related to video milestones or challenges. However, both companies have remained cautious about announcing specific crypto products. Their joint statement emphasized “exploring innovative technology to improve customer and fan experiences” while prioritizing compliance and user safety. This measured public communication reflects an awareness of the sensitive regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency promotions. Conclusion The $200 million investment by Bitmine into Beast Industries is a landmark deal. It signifies a convergence between the institutional crypto world and the apex of the creator economy. For Bitmine, the move diversifies its asset base and embeds it within a massive consumer ecosystem. For MrBeast’s empire, it provides substantial capital for scaling physical products and experiences. Ultimately, this partnership will be closely watched as a test case for whether cryptocurrency-focused capital and mainstream digital media empires can build sustainable, long-term value together, moving beyond marketing gimmicks to foundational corporate strategy. FAQs Q1: What does Bitmine (BMNR) do? Bitmine is a publicly-traded company specializing in the strategic acquisition, management, and deployment of cryptocurrency assets, with a noted focus on Ethereum (ETH). It operates as a digital asset treasury and investment firm. Q2: What is Beast Industries? Beast Industries is the corporate holding company that consolidates the business ventures of YouTuber Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson. It oversees operations beyond YouTube, including Feastables snacks, MrBeast Burger, philanthropy, and content production. Q3: Why would a crypto company invest in a YouTuber’s business? Bitmine’s investment is a strategic diversification. It provides access to MrBeast’s vast, young, and digitally-engaged audience, creates potential pathways for future technology integration, and invests in fast-growing consumer brands with global expansion potential. Q4: How will MrBeast use the $200 million investment? While specific allocations are not public, capital is expected to fund the rapid scaling of Feastables’ distribution, expansion of retail and merchandise operations, and potential international growth for existing and new ventures under the Beast Industries umbrella. Q5: Does this mean MrBeast will start promoting cryptocurrency? Not necessarily. The deal is an equity investment, not an immediate endorsement deal. Both companies stated they will explore technological innovations cautiously. Any future integration of crypto or blockchain elements would likely focus on utility (like loyalty programs) rather than asset promotion, adhering to strict compliance standards.

Reports have disclosed that lawmakers in the State Duma are in the final phase of text meant to lower barriers for ordinary Russians, even as they keep safeguards and restrictions in place. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Power Buyers: Companies Bought 3 Times What Miners Produced The draft bill has drawn attention because it marks a shift from years of strict limits. According to TASS, the proposal would take cryptocurrencies out of a special financial regulation regime so they become a more common part of financial life for people across Russia. Lawmakers say this could make buying and holding crypto something regular citizens do, instead of a privilege for a few. “A bill has already been prepared that removes cryptocurrencies from special financial regulation, which means, they will be a common occurrence in our lives,” Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the State Duma’s Financial Market Committee, said. Expanded Access With Caps Under the current text, people who are not considered “qualified investors” would be able to buy digital coins up to a certain limit. The figure mentioned is 300,000 rubles per year, which is roughly $3,800. This cap aims to let more Russians participate in crypto while trying to prevent big losses if prices swing wildly. Ordinary buyers would still face conditions. Reports say they will have to meet some basic criteria or checks before gaining access, such as passing a short risk‑awareness step and trading only through licensed brokers or exchanges. This is meant to keep unregulated peer‑to‑peer trading from dominating. Professional or qualified market players would face fewer limits. They could trade and hold a wider range of cryptocurrencies with no annual restrictions, though they may still have to demonstrate understanding of risks. Legislative Push And Timing Lawmakers have said the draft is ready and will be discussed during Russia’s spring parliamentary session. If the State Duma passes the bill, implementation could start later in 2026. Aksakov told state media that this move could make crypto “a normal part of life” for many Russians. At the same time, Russian regulators continue to work on other crypto rules. The Bank of Russia has said it plans to set out penalties for illegal crypto intermediaries starting in 2027 and is pushing for a wider regulatory framework that covers both qualified and ordinary investors.

It’s Already Happening,https://timestabloid.com/dark-defender-to-xrp-the-floodgates-are-open-its-already-happening/,"Crypto commentator Dark Defender has returned to an analytical chart he shared on December 9 to restate his view on XRP’s current market position. In his latest post, he argues that recent developments have unfolded in line with that earlier assessment, suggesting that XRP remains on a defined path along a long-term valuation curve. The update is presented not as a new prediction, but as confirmation that the sequence outlined weeks ago is progressing as expected. Dark Defender maintains that the December post clearly identified where XRP stood at the time. According to his interpretation, the asset had already moved past an early phase of skepticism and was entering a period marked by growing recognition. He asserts that subsequent events have reinforced that view rather than challenged it. Up next, ""The Fellowship of the #XRP Phase"". U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould: ""It's time to embrace the new digital assets entrants into banking."" The floodgates are open It is already happening before our eyes. pic.twitter.com/I5bRELL2yz — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 9, 2025 Media Coverage as a Sequential Development A key element of his commentary is the timing of media coverage. Dark Defender notes that increased reporting and public commentary emerged after the position on the curve had already been identified. He presents this as a natural sequence rather than a catalyst, implying that visibility followed underlying market conditions instead of creating them. In his view, this order of events supports the accuracy of the original placement on the curve. He also highlights the rise in questions from market participants seeking clarity on XRP’s status. These inquiries, he suggests, reflect a shift in awareness that aligns with the stage he previously described. The emphasis remains on confirmation rather than reaction, with Dark Defender stressing that observable developments continue to match the expectations set out in December. Reference to Grok and External Confirmation In an attempt to reinforce his point, Dark Defender tagged Grok, asking whether it agreed with recent interpretations regarding XRP’s position . The mention was intended as a reference point for those following related posts and discussions. However, Grok did not respond to the inquiry. Dark Defender does not treat this absence as a setback; instead, he reiterates that his conclusions are based on market behavior and publicly visible signals rather than third-party endorsement. The Approach of the “Fellowship of the XRP” Phase Dark Defender connects the current situation directly to the language used in his December 9 post, where he stated that the next stage would be “The Fellowship of the XRP Phase.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In his latest update, he suggests that this phase is now approaching, if not already beginning. He associates it with increased alignment between market conditions, public awareness, and institutional developments. To support this perspective, he references recent comments from U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould, who stated that it is time to embrace new digital asset entrants into banking. Dark Defender interprets this statement as further evidence that institutional barriers are easing. In his assessment, such remarks strengthen the case that the transition he outlined weeks ago is already taking place, reinforcing his view that XRP is advancing along the curve exactly as anticipated.

57187113,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261867,1768483511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Robinhood Spot LIT Listing: A Strategic Leap for Mainstream Crypto Adoption,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/robinhood-lists-spot-lit/,"BitcoinWorld Robinhood Spot LIT Listing: A Strategic Leap for Mainstream Crypto Adoption In a significant move for retail cryptocurrency access, the trading platform Robinhood announced on April 2, 2025, that it has officially listed spot LIT for trading. This decision marks a pivotal expansion of the platform’s digital asset offerings, directly providing millions of users with exposure to the LIT network’s native token. Consequently, the listing represents a continued blurring of lines between traditional fintech services and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Analysts immediately viewed the announcement as a validation of LIT’s growing infrastructure and a strategic play by Robinhood to capture a broader segment of the crypto-curious investor base. Robinhood Spot LIT Listing: Context and Market Impact The Robinhood spot LIT listing arrives during a period of maturation for both the company and the cryptocurrency sector. Historically, Robinhood Crypto has carefully curated its asset selection, focusing on high-liquidity, large-market-cap tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, the addition of LIT signals a calculated shift towards integrating more specialized blockchain assets. Market data from the preceding quarter showed increased institutional interest in LIT’s underlying technology, which focuses on decentralized storage and computing. Subsequently, Robinhood’s move provides a regulated, user-friendly on-ramp for retail participants to engage with this niche. Industry experts note the listing’s timing aligns with broader regulatory clarifications in the United States. For instance, recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission has provided more defined frameworks for trading certain digital assets on registered platforms. Robinhood, as a regulated broker-dealer, operates under strict compliance protocols. The company’s due diligence process for listing any new asset involves rigorous legal and security reviews. This process ensures the platform maintains its commitment to operating within established financial regulations while innovating its product suite. Expert Analysis on Platform Strategy Financial technology analysts emphasize the strategic nature of this listing. “Robinhood is not merely adding another ticker,” stated Dr. Alisha Chen, a fintech researcher at Stanford University. “They are strategically positioning themselves at the intersection of decentralized infrastructure and mainstream finance. By offering spot LIT, they cater to a tech-savvy user demographic interested in the foundational layers of Web3, beyond simple speculation.” This perspective is supported by Robinhood’s recent product developments, including enhanced wallet functionality and educational content focused on blockchain utility. Understanding the LIT Network and Its Value Proposition To comprehend the significance of the Robinhood spot LIT listing, one must understand the LIT network’s core function. Unlike purely monetary cryptocurrencies, LIT serves as the essential fuel for a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN). This network allows users to share and monetize unused computing resources, such as storage space and processing power. Essentially, the LIT token facilitates transactions and incentivizes participation within this peer-to-peer ecosystem. The network aims to create a more efficient and user-owned alternative to traditional cloud service providers. The project has demonstrated substantial growth metrics over the past two years. Key performance indicators include: Network Capacity: A reported 300% increase in available storage resources year-over-year. Active Nodes: Over 50,000 independent nodes globally contributing resources. Token Utility: LIT is used for purchasing resources, staking for network security, and governing protocol upgrades. This real-world utility provides a fundamental value thesis distinct from many purely speculative assets. Accordingly, Robinhood’s listing can be interpreted as an endorsement of this utility-driven model. It provides investors with a straightforward method to gain exposure to the potential growth of decentralized infrastructure. Comparative Analysis: Robinhood’s Evolving Crypto Playbook Robinhood’s approach to cryptocurrency listings has evolved significantly since its initial foray into the space. A comparison with past listings reveals a clear strategic trajectory. Listing Phase Example Assets Strategic Goal Early Adoption (2018-2021) BTC, ETH, DOGE Capture broad retail interest and trading volume. Diversification (2022-2024) SOL, ADA, MATIC Expand into major Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchain ecosystems. Niche Utility (2025+) LIT, Other DePIN tokens Provide access to specialized, utility-driven crypto sectors. This phased evolution demonstrates a maturation from chasing volatility to building a comprehensive digital asset portfolio. The Robinhood spot LIT listing fits squarely into the third phase. It reflects a confidence in both the asset’s longevity and its relevance to the platform’s user base. Furthermore, it creates a competitive moat against other retail brokerages that may offer a more limited selection of digital assets. Regulatory Landscape and Consumer Protection The listing occurs within a complex and evolving regulatory environment. Robinhood Crypto operates under the oversight of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and other state regulators. The company emphasizes its commitment to compliance, which includes: Asset Review: A multi-departmental review of each crypto asset’s legal status, technology, and market integrity. Transparency: Providing clear educational resources about each asset’s function, risks, and volatility. Security: Employing industry-standard custodial practices and insurance for digital assets held on the platform. This regulatory-first approach is crucial for maintaining consumer trust. It also mitigates potential legal risks associated with offering newer digital assets. By listing spot LIT through this rigorous framework, Robinhood lends a layer of institutional credibility to the token. However, the company consistently reminds users that cryptocurrency investments remain inherently volatile and are not protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). The Road Ahead for Retail Crypto Integration The long-term implications of this and similar listings are profound. As noted by Michael Torres, a former regulator now with the Brookings Institution, “Each carefully vetted listing by a major regulated entity like Robinhood acts as a stepping stone. It normalizes digital asset exposure within a familiar financial interface, potentially paving the way for more integrated financial products in the future, such as crypto-linked retirement accounts or payment systems.” This progression suggests a future where digital assets are a standard, albeit risky, component of a diversified retail investment portfolio. Conclusion The Robinhood spot LIT listing represents a meaningful development in the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. It is not an isolated event but a strategic decision reflecting LIT’s established utility, evolving regulatory clarity, and Robinhood’s ambition to serve as a comprehensive gateway to digital assets. This move significantly enhances mainstream access to the decentralized infrastructure sector, allowing retail investors to participate in a novel technological paradigm. Ultimately, the success of this listing will depend on user adoption, continued network development for LIT, and the stable progression of the regulatory framework governing digital assets. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that Robinhood lists spot LIT? It means users of the Robinhood Crypto platform can now directly buy, sell, and hold the LIT token. This is a “spot” trade, meaning you own the actual asset, as opposed to trading a derivative contract based on its price. Q2: Why is Robinhood listing LIT significant? The listing is significant because Robinhood is a major, regulated retail brokerage. Its endorsement through a rigorous listing process provides mainstream legitimacy and easy access to LIT, a token with utility in decentralized computing, for millions of potential investors. Q3: What is the LIT token used for? LIT is the native token of a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN). It is used to pay for decentralized storage and computing services, to stake for network security, and to participate in the governance of the protocol. Q4: Is LIT considered a security by regulators? As of April 2025, the regulatory classification of LIT has not been definitively stated by the SEC. Robinhood’s decision to list it suggests their legal team has conducted analysis indicating it can be offered compliantly, likely under existing frameworks for commodities or utility tokens. Q5: How does buying LIT on Robinhood differ from buying it on a crypto exchange? Buying on Robinhood offers a familiar interface for existing users, integrates with traditional banking, and operates under Robinhood’s regulatory compliance umbrella. However, you may not have immediate access to withdraw the token to a private wallet, unlike on a dedicated crypto exchange which typically offers full custody options.

The latest push was strong enough to squeeze shorts and reset sentiment from extreme fear to neutral, yet the price is stalling right where you would expect sellers to defend: higher-timeframe resistance and key moving averages. XRPPrice Analysis: The USD Chart On the daily chart, XRPUSDT has pushed into the $2.00 resistance block and is struggling to hold above it after a sharp bounce off the $1.80 demand zone. The asset was recently rejected by the 100-day moving average, with the 200-day MA still sitting higher as an additional dynamic resistance, so the medium-term structure is still bearish. The RSI also briefly tagged the overbought region and is now curling down, which fits the idea of a relief rally hitting a ceiling rather than a fresh bullish trend. Yet, as long as XRP holds inside or just above this $2.00 area, buyers can argue for a consolidation before another attempt at the key $2.40 resistance zone. A clean daily close above that zone would be the first real sign that momentum is shifting back in favor of buyers. The BTC Pair On the BTC pair, XRP is clearly underperforming. The price has pulled back to roughly 2,180 sats after being rejected decisively from the 2,500 sats supply zone and failing to hold above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are now back overhead as resistance elements. The recent fakeout above the moving averages, followed by quick selling, is a classic sign of distribution. Liquidity has been grabbed higher, and the asset has been sent back into the prior range. For now, the key support to watch is the 2,000 sats area. As long as that level holds, XRP can continue to chop sideways versus BTC while it digests the recent move. Meanwhile, a strong daily close back above the 100-day moving average and then reclaiming the 2,500 sats area would be needed to say XRP is genuinely gaining relative strength against Bitcoin, which looks unlikely at the moment.

57187196,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=875949,1768483809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/57187196.jpeg,"Glassnode: Bitcoin Is Back At $96K, Hitting The Same Sell Ceiling Again",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/glassnode-bitcoin-back-96k-hitting-the-same-sell-ceiling/,"Bitcoin’s early-2026 bounce has pushed back into a familiar problem area: a dense pocket of overhead supply that Glassnode says has repeatedly capped rallies since November. In its latest Week On-chain report, the analytics firm frames the move above $96,000 as constructive on the surface, but still largely dependent on derivatives positioning and liquidity conditions rather than persistent spot accumulation. Glassnode’s central argument is that Bitcoin has rallied straight into a historically significant band of long-term holder (LTH) cost basis, built during April to July 2025 and associated with sustained distribution near cycle highs. The report describes a “dense cluster” spanning roughly $93K to $110K, with rebounds since November repeatedly stalling near the lower boundary. “This region has consistently acted as a transition barrier, separating corrective phases from durable bull regimes,” Glassnode wrote. “With price once again pressing into this overhead supply, the market now faces a familiar test of resilience, where absorbing long-term holder distribution remains a prerequisite for any broader trend reversal.” The firm’s framing is blunt: the market is back at the same sell ceiling, and clearing it requires real absorption, not just price probing. The next level the report highlights is the short-term holder (STH) cost basis at $98.3K, which it treats as a confidence gauge for newer buyers. Sustained trading above it would indicate that recent demand is strong enough to keep late entrants in profit while soaking up overhead supply. On-chain, Glassnode notes long-term holders remain net sellers, with total LTH supply still trending lower. The key change is speed. The report says the rate of decline has “slowed materially” versus the aggressive distribution seen in Q3 and Q4 2025, suggesting profit-taking is continuing but with less intensity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Turns ‘Neutral’ For First Time Since October “What follows will depend primarily on the demand side’s ability to absorb this supply, particularly from investors accumulated over Q2 2025,” the report said. “Failure to hold above the True Market Mean at ~$81k, in the long term, would significantly increase the risk of a deeper capitulation phase, reminiscent of the April 2022 to April 2023 period.” It is one of the clearest downside conditionals in the note: if the market loses the long-run mean, the probability distribution shifts toward a more severe unwind. A related signal is the Net Realized Profit and Loss of Long-Term Holders, which Glassnode says reflects a “markedly cooler distribution regime.” Long-term holders are realizing roughly 12.8K BTC per week in net profit, a sharp slowdown from cycle peaks above 100K BTC per week. That moderation does not imply capitulation risk is gone, but it does suggest the heaviest phase of profit-taking has eased. Bitcoin Demand Remains Uneven Off-chain indicators lean more constructive. Glassnode argues institutional balance-sheet flows have “gone through a full reset” after months of heavy outflows across spot ETFs, corporates, and sovereign entities, with net flows stabilizing as sell-side pressure appears exhausted. Spot ETFs are described as the first cohort to turn positive again, re-establishing themselves as the primary marginal buyer. Corporate and sovereign treasury flows, by contrast, are portrayed as sporadic and event-driven rather than consistent. The upshot is a market where balance-sheet demand can help stabilize price, but may not yet function as a sustained growth engine, leaving short-term direction more sensitive to derivatives positioning and liquidity conditions. At the venue level, Glassnode points to improving spot behavior. Binance and aggregate exchange flow measures have shifted back into buy-dominant regimes, and Coinbase, described as a consistent source of sell-side aggression during the consolidation, has “meaningfully slowed its selling activity.” The report calls this a constructive structural shift, while stressing it still falls short of the persistent, aggressive accumulation typically associated with full trend expansions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Futures Flush 31% Of Open Interest As Bottom Thesis Takes Shape The most pointed caution in the report is that the move into the $96K region was “mechanically reinforced” by short liquidations in a relatively thin liquidity environment. Futures turnover remains well below the elevated activity seen across most of 2025, implying it took comparatively little capital to force shorts out and push price through resistance. “This indicates that the breakout occurred in a comparatively light liquidity environment, where modest positioning shifts were able to drive disproportionately large price responses,” Glassnode said. “In practical terms, it did not take significant new capital to force shorts out of the market and lift price through resistance.” The implication is that continuation now depends on whether spot demand and sustained volume can replace forced covering once the squeeze impulse fades. Options markets add a second layer of tension. Glassnode describes implied volatility as low but “deferred,” while skew continues to price downside asymmetry, with 25-delta skew biased toward puts in mid and longer maturities. In short: participants appear comfortable holding exposure, but remain unwilling to do so without insurance. Positioning also matters at the microstructure level. The report flags dealers as short gamma around spot, with a zone roughly from $94K to $104K. In that setup, hedging flows can amplify moves rather than dampen them, buying into rallies and selling into dips, raising the odds of faster travel toward high-interest strikes such as $100K if momentum takes hold. At press time, BTC traded at $96,334.

This launch, reported by The Block, positions Fogo not just as another entrant but as a potential paradigm shifter with its audacious performance metrics and a clear path for community token distribution. The move arrives at a critical juncture where demand for faster, more efficient Layer 1 solutions continues to surge globally. Fogo Mainnet Ushers in Unprecedented Speed Claims Fogo’s core technical proposition centers on raw speed and finality. The network officially boasts a block generation time of just 40 milliseconds. For context, this metric represents the interval between the creation of new blocks on the chain, directly influencing transaction confirmation times and overall network throughput. Consequently, this ultra-low latency forms the foundation of Fogo’s performance profile. Furthermore, the development team makes a direct comparative claim, stating the network operates at speeds up to 18 times faster than established competitors like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI). This assertion, if validated under real-world, mainnet conditions, would place Fogo at the forefront of high-performance blockchain technology. Industry observers note that such claims necessitate rigorous independent verification. However, the architectural choice to build on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) provides a credible foundation. The SVM is renowned for its parallel processing capabilities, which allow multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously rather than sequentially. Therefore, Fogo’s implementation likely involves optimizations at the consensus and networking layers to achieve these reported gains. The transition from testnet to a live, public mainnet is the ultimate stress test for these capabilities. Architectural Foundations and the SVM Advantage Fogo’s decision to utilize the Solana Virtual Machine is a strategic one with significant implications. The SVM has emerged as a standard for developers seeking to build high-throughput applications. By adopting this ecosystem, Fogo gains immediate compatibility with a vast array of tools, programming languages like Rust and C, and potentially, existing Solana projects. This interoperability lowers the barrier to entry for developers, a crucial factor for network adoption. Essentially, Fogo is not creating an entirely new development environment but is attempting to supercharge an existing, popular one. The pursuit of sub-second finality has been a central challenge in blockchain design. Traditional networks often sacrifice decentralization or security for speed—a dilemma known as the blockchain trilemma. Fogo’s architecture, presumably leveraging a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism variant optimized for the SVM, aims to navigate this trilemma. Its 40-millisecond block time suggests a highly optimized validator network and efficient data propagation protocols. For end-users, the practical impact could mean near-instantaneous settlement for decentralized finance (DeFi) trades, non-fungible token (NFT) minting, and gaming transactions, rivaling the experience of centralized payment systems. Expert Analysis on the High-Performance Blockchain Landscape Blockchain infrastructure analysts emphasize that mainnet launches represent only the beginning of the journey. “Performance claims in controlled environments must now face the open internet’s unpredictability,” notes a researcher specializing in Layer 1 protocols. “The true metrics to watch will be sustained transactions per second (TPS) under peak load, average transaction cost, and validator decentralization over the coming months.” The history of blockchain is replete with networks that promised revolutionary speeds but encountered bottlenecks as user activity grew. The competitive landscape is also a key consideration. Solana itself has undergone significant optimization to improve its reliability and speed. Sui and Aptos, other leading high-performance chains, employ different parallel execution engines. Fogo’s entry, therefore, intensifies competition in a niche focused on maximum throughput. This competition ultimately benefits developers and users through technological innovation and potentially lower costs. The success of Fogo will depend not just on its technical specs but on its ability to attract and retain a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). FOGO Token and the Fogo Flames Points Conversion Integral to the mainnet launch is the activation of the network’s native token, FOGO. The project has outlined a clear mechanism for initial distribution tied to its pre-launch community program. Holders of “Fogo Flames” points will be eligible to convert them into FOGO tokens. Points-based incentive campaigns have become a standard growth tactic in Web3, used to reward early community members for testnet participation, content creation, and social advocacy. This approach aims to decentralize ownership from the outset and reward early supporters. The utility of the FOGO token will follow standard Layer 1 tokenomics, encompassing several critical functions: Network Security: Used for staking to participate in consensus as a validator or delegator. Transaction Fees: Paid in FOGO to execute transactions and deploy smart contracts. Governance: Likely to grant holders voting rights on future protocol upgrades and treasury management. The responsible and transparent execution of this points-to-token conversion will be a key early indicator of the project’s operational maturity and commitment to its community. It also marks the transition from a conceptual network to a live economic system with tangible value. Potential Impacts and Future Roadmap The successful deployment of Fogo’s mainnet could have ripple effects across several sectors. For DeFi, a reliably fast and low-cost chain presents a new venue for algorithmic trading, lending, and borrowing protocols where latency is a direct competitive disadvantage. In gaming and social media applications, fast finality is essential for a seamless user experience. Moreover, the growth of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization demands networks that can handle high volumes with predictable settlement times. Looking ahead, the immediate technical roadmap for Fogo will involve monitoring network stability, scaling validator sets, and onboarding the first wave of dApps. The broader adoption roadmap will focus on developer grants, ecosystem funding, and strategic partnerships. The project’s long-term viability will be measured by the originality and utility of the applications built upon it, not just its theoretical speed. The coming year will serve as a critical proving ground, testing whether Fogo’s mainnet can deliver on its promises under real-world demand and establish a sustainable, decentralized ecosystem. Conclusion The Fogo mainnet launch represents a bold step in the evolution of high-performance Layer 1 blockchains. By leveraging the SVM and claiming unprecedented speed advantages, Fogo enters a crowded but rapidly growing market. Its success hinges on validating its performance claims under mainnet conditions, fostering a robust developer ecosystem, and executing a fair token distribution. While challenges lie ahead, this launch undeniably contributes to the broader industry push toward blockchain infrastructures capable of supporting global, mainstream applications at scale. The Fogo mainnet is now live, and the network begins the critical work of proving its value in the open market. FAQs Q1: What is the Fogo blockchain?

Around 7% of the OM token supply remained locked in the form of ERC-20 tokens. The Mantra project is making the last call for migrating its OM tokens from Ethereum to its native chain. The team announced the last day of the migration period, leaving the remaining tokens locked on Ethereum. MANTRA enters a new era. Today is officially the last day to migrate your ERC20 OM to MANTRA mainnet. — MANTRA | Tokenizing RWAs (@MANTRA_Chain) January 15, 2026 The migration may have decreased the supply of OM, as around 7% of the supply remains unmigrated and may remain stuck on the old chain. The token swap was facilitated by Kraken, which was one of the first holders of OM on the new native main net. OM is seen as a risky asset, with slim chances of recovery, as the native chain still struggles to attract apps and users. OM still trades near three-month lows OM used to be a top performer among RWA platforms. However, in April 2025, the token crashed by over 95%. The team ascribed the crash to the activities of market makers with one-sided liquidity. Since then, OM has not been able to stem its slide, despite proposing buybacks and token burns. OM open interest is down to all-time lows at around $19M, with no signs of recovery. The token also does not have an accumulation of short positions or hope for a short squeeze and a short-term rally. As the swap period ends, OM traded at $0.07, still down over 37% in the past three months. OM and Mantra have not regained their position, despite the promises for RWA tokenization. The asset is still in the top 100 coins and tokens, but has significantly underperformed the market. Mantra restructures the organization, lays off parts of the team The CEO of Mantra JP Mullin announced the organization will go through restructuring, cutting all possible redundant roles. The launch of its chain and any attempts at recovery failed to produce sufficient business for the platform. Mullin cited the April 2025 crash and the worsening market conditions as the main rationale behind the restructuring.

Mullin announced the company had already streamlined its operations, but would need further cuts. Mantra will continue with its core team, but reduce functions in business development, marketing, HR, and other support roles. The Mantra chain attracted under $1M in liquidity through its attempts to build a DeFi space. For now, the chain lags far behind other networks, which at least manage to produce predictable fees. Mantra has also been displaced by other leaders with market-ready products in tokenization, including Ondo Finance and Solana-based tokenization project XStocks. Despite this, Mullin still hopes to make the project relevant in the next wave of crypto adoption.

While Ong declined to address specific negotiations, he expressed enthusiasm about “ possibilities that enable us to better serve users and facilitate institutional crypto adoption. “ It’s worth noting that CoinMarketCap, another crypto market data platform, was purchased by crypto exchange Binance in 2020 for an estimated $400 million. When announcing that acquisition , Binance clarified that while both the exchange and its BNB token were featured on the platform, “ CoinMarketCap and Binance remain separate entities adhering to a strict independence policy. “ More than five years later, crypto industry observers believe a $500 million valuation for CoinGecko is reasonable, given that crypto data has become increasingly valuable and Wall Street data intelligence companies command substantially higher valuations. For instance, Bloomberg L.P., though privately held, is estimated to be worth tens of billions, recent calculations suggest over $120 billion based on a 2008 stake transaction, with current annual revenues surpassing $13 billion as of early 2025. $8.6B in Crypto Deals: Polygon, Fireblocks Lead 2026’s M&A Explosion The quantity and value of mergers, acquisitions, and initial public offerings within the cryptocurrency space surged throughout 2025, with dealmaking hitting a record $8.6 billion as a more accommodating regulatory stance in the United States encouraged investors and financial institutions to re-enter the sector.

According to the analysis, Bitcoin is trading within a consolidation range that has held for nearly two months, with current price action sitting less than two percent below the upper boundary of that structure. The attached chart highlights a prolonged period of compression, followed by price behavior that suggests Bitcoin is positioning for a directional move. Bird’s assessment emphasizes that this range has acted as a stabilizing phase after prior volatility. The tightening structure, combined with recent upward pressure, is presented as a setup that typically precedes expansion. The chart illustrates Bitcoin holding above rising diagonal support while repeatedly testing resistance at the $93,580 price point. Bitcoin is less than 2% away from breaking out of this nearly two month range. Once this breakout confirms (likely this week), it’s exactly the momentum we need to push $XRP to $2.70+ again and bring the bulls back in business. We’re close now. Very close. https://t.co/rUXqYRKZ0I pic.twitter.com/mj1PujMSZL — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 13, 2026 Breakout Timing and Broader Market Impact The commentary suggests that confirmation of a breakout could occur within the current trading week, provided Bitcoin decisively moves beyond the established range and holds above it. This confirmation, in Bird’s view, would signal the return of momentum across the digital asset market. The expectation is not framed as a guarantee, but as a conditional scenario dependent on follow-through and sustained price acceptance at higher levels. Crucially, the analysis links Bitcoin’s potential breakout to renewed strength in XRP . Bird argues that a confirmed move in Bitcoin would create the conditions necessary for XRP to revisit the $2.70 level or higher. The reasoning presented is that Bitcoin-led momentum tends to restore confidence among market participants, encouraging capital rotation into large-cap altcoins once BTC establishes direction. XRP Positioning Within a Bitcoin-Led Cycle Within this perspective, XRP is positioned as a beneficiary rather than the initial driver. Bird’s view implies that XRP’s prior rallies have coincided with periods when Bitcoin had already resolved its own structure and entered a phase of expansion. The reference to “bringing the bulls back in business” reflects an expectation of renewed buying interest rather than short-term speculative spikes. The analysis highlights that the market is close to a decisive moment, but still awaits confirmation. Until Bitcoin exits its range with conviction, XRP’s upside scenario remains conditional rather than certain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Bitcoin Often Moves First Historically, Bitcoin has tended to establish trend direction before capital flows more aggressively into altcoins such as XRP. As the largest and most liquid digital asset, Bitcoin often absorbs initial inflows during periods of renewed risk appetite. Once Bitcoin stabilizes or accelerates upward, traders and investors frequently seek higher beta opportunities elsewhere in the market. Bird’s commentary aligns with this general market behavior, suggesting that Bitcoin’s breakout would act as the trigger rather than the destination for momentum. In this framework, XRP’s potential move is viewed as a secondary development that follows confirmation at the market leader level. The analysis concludes with a clear emphasis on timing, noting that conditions are nearing resolution, but that confirmation remains the critical factor.

The protocol has successfully bought back 525 million JST tokens, representing a substantial $21 million investment into its own ecosystem. This strategic action, announced on March 15, 2025, signals a pivotal moment for one of the TRON network’s leading liquidity protocols and offers critical insights into evolving DeFi treasury management strategies. Analyzing the JustLend DAO JST Buyback Mechanics The core transaction involves the protocol’s treasury utilizing accumulated fees and revenue to purchase JST tokens directly from the open market. Consequently, this action reduces the circulating supply of the governance and utility token. Typically, such buyback programs aim to return value to long-term token holders and stabilize the asset’s price floor. Furthermore, the scale of this buyback—$21 million—represents a significant commitment from the DAO’s treasury, highlighting robust protocol-generated revenue. JustLend operates as a central money market on the TRON blockchain. Users deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against their collateral. The JST token facilitates governance voting for key parameters like interest rate models and supported assets. Therefore, a reduction in circulating supply can potentially increase the voting power concentration among remaining holders. This dynamic could lead to more decisive governance outcomes, for better or worse. The Financial Engineering Behind the Move Protocols like JustLend generate revenue primarily through spread fees between lenders and borrowers. A sustained period of high utilization rates and healthy trading activity on the platform creates a treasury surplus. The DAO community then votes on capital allocation, choosing between distributions, further development funding, or strategic buybacks. This recent decision underscores a preference for direct tokenomics intervention over other expenditure methods. Contextualizing the Buyback in the 2025 DeFi Landscape This event does not occur in a vacuum. The broader DeFi sector in early 2025 continues to mature, with established protocols focusing on sustainable economics and shareholder—or rather, stakeholder—value. Buyback programs, once rare in the decentralized world, are becoming a more common tool for mature protocols with substantial treasuries. For instance, other major lending protocols like Aave and Compound have explored similar mechanisms through fee switches and token burns. The 2025 market environment emphasizes real yield and tangible utility. Projects without clear value accrual mechanisms for their native tokens face increased scrutiny. JustLend’s action directly addresses this by creating a buy-side pressure for JST, theoretically linking protocol success more tightly to token value. This model mirrors aspects of traditional corporate share repurchases but operates within a transparent, on-chain, and community-governed framework. Supply Shock: Removing 525 million tokens from circulation creates a potential supply shock, altering market dynamics. Holder Alignment: The move aligns incentives between the protocol’s operators and its long-term token holders. Treasury Health: Executing a buyback of this size indicates a strong and healthy protocol treasury, a key metric for DeFi investors. Immediate Market Impact and Long-Term Implications Market reactions to such announcements are often immediate. Historically, token buybacks generate positive short-term price momentum due to the sudden introduction of a major, protocol-backed buyer. However, the long-term impact depends entirely on continued protocol growth and usage. A buyback alone cannot sustain value if fundamental metrics like total value locked (TVL) or revenue decline. For JustLend, the implications extend beyond price. The DAO has made a public statement of confidence in its own future utility and revenue generation. It also effectively distributes protocol profits to participants who choose to hold JST, rather than sell. This can foster a more dedicated and stable holder base, which is crucial for decentralized governance stability. Moreover, it sets a precedent for how the DAO might manage future treasury surpluses. Expert Perspectives on DeFi Capital Allocation Industry analysts often view buybacks as a sign of maturity. “When a DeFi protocol transitions from hyper-growth to steady-state operations, capital allocation becomes paramount,” notes a common perspective from sector reports. “A buyback signals that the protocol believes reinvesting in its own token is the highest-return opportunity available, which is a powerful message.” This reflects a shift from speculative tokenomics to fundamentals-driven financial engineering. The action also involves clear risks. Diverting $21 million from the treasury reduces the war chest available for security audits, grants for new integrations, or insurance fund growth. The DAO community presumably weighed these opportunity costs carefully. The success of this strategy will be measured over quarters, not days, by tracking protocol health metrics alongside the JST token’s performance. Technical Execution and On-Chain Transparency A key advantage of decentralized autonomous organizations is transaction transparency. Interested parties can trace the buyback execution on the TRON blockchain, verifying the treasury address, the purchase transactions, and the destination of the bought tokens. Typically, repurchased tokens are sent to a burn address or a community-managed vault, effectively removing them from the circulating supply permanently or locking them for future community use. This level of verifiability builds trust. It contrasts with opaque corporate buybacks where timing and execution details are often undisclosed until after the fact. The on-chain nature of the JustLend DAO buyback allows for real-time analysis and ensures the community that the action matches the proposal’s intent. This transparency is a cornerstone of the DeFi value proposition and a requirement for maintaining regulatory compliance in evolving global frameworks. Conclusion The JustLend DAO’s completion of a $21 million JST token buyback represents a significant milestone in the evolution of decentralized finance. This strategic decision highlights a mature approach to treasury management, a commitment to aligning tokenholder value with protocol success, and a confident outlook on JustLend’s future revenue generation. While the immediate market impact is notable, the long-term success of this capital allocation hinges on the protocol’s continued growth, adoption, and innovation within the competitive 2025 DeFi landscape. This move firmly places JustLend DAO among the protocols pioneering sophisticated, real-world financial mechanisms in the transparent realm of blockchain. FAQs Q1: What is a token buyback in DeFi? A token buyback occurs when a decentralized protocol uses its treasury funds to purchase its own native token from the open market. This reduces the circulating supply and is often seen as a method to return value to token holders. Q2: Why did JustLend DAO buy back JST tokens? The DAO likely executed the buyback to signal confidence in the protocol, support the JST token’s value by reducing supply, and allocate excess treasury revenue in a manner that benefits long-term stakeholders. Q3: Where did the $21 million for the buyback come from? The funds originated from the JustLend protocol treasury, which is filled by revenue generated from platform activities like borrowing and lending fees. Q4: What happens to the JST tokens after the buyback? Typically, repurchased tokens are permanently burned (sent to an unusable address) or locked in a community-controlled vault, effectively removing them from active circulation. Q5: How does this buyback affect a regular JST holder? By reducing the available supply, the buyback can potentially increase the scarcity and value of each remaining JST token, assuming demand remains constant or grows. It also may increase the governance weight of each token held.

This event, completed for the first quarter of the year, underscores the blockchain’s long-standing commitment to its pre-programmed tokenomics model. Consequently, the action directly reduces the total supply of BNB, a core mechanism designed to create scarcity and long-term value alignment for the ecosystem. The scale of this burn, one of the largest in the network’s history, immediately draws attention from investors and analysts globally, prompting a fresh examination of supply-side economics in major blockchain networks. Understanding the BNB Chain Token Burn Mechanism The BNB Chain token burn is not a spontaneous decision but a fundamental, automated component of its economic design. Originally, Binance Coin (BNB) launched with a maximum supply of 200 million tokens. The protocol’s whitepaper committed to using 20% of its quarterly profits to buy back and permanently destroy, or “burn,” BNB tokens until 50% of the total supply, or 100 million BNB, was removed. This 34th event brings the cumulative total of burned BNB significantly closer to that target. The process is transparent and verifiable on-chain, with the burned tokens sent to a publicly known, inaccessible “dead” wallet address. Therefore, this systematic reduction contrasts with inflationary models used by some other blockchains, creating a predictable deflationary pressure over time. The Economic Rationale Behind Deflationary Tokenomics Economists and crypto analysts often highlight the value of predictable supply schedules. A deflationary model, when paired with steady or growing demand, can theoretically support price stability or appreciation. The BNB burn directly reduces the circulating supply, increasing the scarcity of each remaining token. Furthermore, the burn is funded by the chain’s real-world economic activity, including transaction fees generated on the BNB Smart Chain and other ecosystem revenues. This creates a direct feedback loop: more network usage generates more revenue, leading to larger burns and greater supply reduction. Importantly, this model aligns the interests of the network’s developers, validators, and token holders around sustainable growth. Historical Context and the Journey to 100 Million BNB The 34th burn represents a milestone in a multi-year journey that began in 2017. Initially, burns were conducted by Binance the exchange, but the responsibility transitioned to the decentralized BNB Chain ecosystem following its evolution into a community-driven project. A historical analysis reveals the burn size fluctuates with market conditions and network profitability. For instance, during the 2021 bull market, quarterly burns regularly exceeded $600 million in value. The recent $1.277 billion burn, however, stands out due to the substantial nominal value of BNB at the time of execution. The following table illustrates the progression toward the 100 million BNB burn goal, showcasing the deflationary trajectory. Milestone Total BNB Burned (Cumulative) Approximate Percentage of Initial Supply Removed After 10th Burn ~15 million BNB 7.5% After 20th Burn ~30 million BNB 15% After 30th Burn ~45 million BNB 22.5% After 34th Burn (Current) ~48 million BNB* ~24% *Estimated figure based on historical burn data. The precise cumulative total is subject to official verification from BNB Chain. This consistent reduction schedule provides a clear, long-term roadmap for investors. It also demonstrates a key difference from purely disinflationary assets like Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply cap but no active burning, and from inflationary assets like Ethereum post-merge, which can experience net negative issuance under certain conditions but lacks a pre-set burn target. Immediate Market Impact and Analyst Perspectives Market reactions to burn events are typically analyzed in both the short and long term. Immediately following the announcement, markets often scrutinize whether the burn was already “priced in” by traders anticipating the event. The sheer magnitude of this burn, however, represents a substantial removal of sell-side pressure. Analysts from firms like Arcane Research and CoinMetrics frequently note that while single events may cause volatility, the primary value is in the sustained, predictable application of the model. The burn reinforces several key points for the market: Protocol Commitment: It validates BNB Chain’s adherence to its original tokenomic promises. Scarcity Acceleration: Each burn increases the scarcity of remaining BNB at a faster rate as the total supply shrinks. Ecosystem Health Signal: A large burn implies robust network activity and fee generation in the prior quarter. Consequently, the event is often viewed as a positive fundamental indicator, though experts universally caution that it is one factor among many, including broader crypto market trends, regulatory news, and technological developments within the BNB Chain ecosystem itself. The Role of Auto-Burn and BEP-95 Beyond the quarterly burn, BNB Chain also employs a real-time burning mechanism known as BEP-95. This upgrade automatically burns a portion of the gas fees from every block produced on the BNB Smart Chain. This creates a constant, background deflationary effect independent of quarterly profit calculations. The coexistence of these two mechanisms—the scheduled quarterly burn and the continuous auto-burn—creates a layered approach to supply reduction. This dual-model is unique among major blockchains and is designed to make the deflationary process more organic and directly tied to real-time network usage. Comparative Analysis with Other Blockchain Burn Models BNB Chain’s approach is distinctive but not entirely unique. Several other blockchain projects employ token burn mechanisms, though with different rationales and methods. For example: Ethereum: After the EIP-1559 upgrade, a base fee is burned for every transaction, making Ethereum potentially deflationary during high-usage periods. However, this is a market-driven outcome, not a pre-programmed target. Shiba Inu: The SHIB community has initiated manual burn events to reduce supply, but these are often community-led and not protocol-mandated. Stablecoins: Issuers like Tether and Circle burn tokens to reduce supply when users redeem them for fiat, maintaining the peg. The BNB model is notable for its scale, regularity, and direct linkage to protocol profitability. It serves as a long-term case study in programmed digital asset scarcity, providing verifiable on-chain data for economists and crypto researchers studying the effects of transparent supply reduction. Conclusion The completion of BNB Chain’s 34th quarterly token burn, erasing $1.277 billion in BNB from existence, represents a pivotal moment in the network’s economic history. This event highlights the relentless execution of its deflationary tokenomics, moving steadily toward the goal of halving its original supply. The mechanism, powered by real ecosystem revenue, creates a tangible link between network utility and token scarcity. While market prices respond to a confluence of factors, the structural reduction of BNB’s supply through these burns establishes a fundamental, long-term value proposition rooted in verifiable on-chain action. As the blockchain industry matures, the BNB Chain token burn model continues to offer a compelling blueprint for aligning protocol growth with investor incentives through programmed digital scarcity. FAQs Q1: What is a token burn? A token burn is the permanent removal of cryptocurrency tokens from circulation by sending them to a verifiable, inaccessible wallet address. This reduces the total and circulating supply of the asset. Q2: Why does BNB Chain burn BNB tokens? BNB Chain burns tokens as part of its original tokenomic promise to reduce the total supply from 200 million to 100 million BNB. The burns are funded by a portion of network profits, creating a deflationary model that aims to increase scarcity over time. Q3: How does this burn affect the price of BNB? While a direct, immediate price impact is not guaranteed, reducing the supply against steady or growing demand is a fundamental economic principle that can support long-term value. The burn is considered a positive fundamental indicator of network health and commitment to its model. Q4: What is the difference between the quarterly burn and BEP-95? The quarterly burn is a scheduled event using protocol profits. BEP-95 is a real-time, automatic burn of a portion of every block’s gas fees. They work together to reduce supply through both scheduled and usage-based mechanisms. Q5: How close is BNB Chain to burning 100 million BNB? With an estimated 48 million BNB burned cumulatively after 34 events, the protocol is approaching the halfway point of its 100 million BNB target. The remaining burns will continue quarterly until the goal is met.

The request targets an estimated $320 million in active college sports markets, a figure that reflects how quickly prediction platforms have expanded into territory long dominated by regulated sportsbooks. As Prediction Markets Grow, NCAA Pushes for Safeguards In a letter dated January 14, 2026, NCAA President Charlie Baker urged CFTC Chairman Michael Selig to halt collegiate sports prediction trading until stronger safeguards are put in place. Source: NCAA Baker argued that although prediction markets are often framed as financial products, many now function in practice like sports wagering. NCAA noted that platforms are offering moneyline, spread, and total markets on college games that closely mirror traditional betting, while operating under a lighter regulatory framework. The timing of the letter comes as prediction markets experience explosive growth. Total daily trading volume across major platforms reached a record $701.7 million on January 12, with sports accounting for a growing share of activity. Source: Dune analysis Platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket together processed tens of billions of dollars in trades during 2025, and sports markets now represent roughly three-quarters of Kalshi’s weekly volume and nearly 40% of Polymarket’s. In 2026, prediction models will be used to collectively decide what is true and what is not [true] and as a guide for fact-checking, analysts say. #Polymarket #Kalshi #PredictionMarkets #BTC https://t.co/fkQeRz28Qs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 That scale has drawn institutional interest, but it has also raised alarms among regulators and sports bodies. At the center of the NCAA’s concern is student safety. Baker warned that college prediction markets often allow participants as young as 18, compared with the 21-and-over requirement in most states for sports betting. NCAA surveys show that 58 percent of individuals aged 18 to 22 have participated in sports betting, with a significant portion reporting academic, financial, and mental health consequences. The letter also highlighted gaps in advertising rules. While sportsbooks face restrictions on marketing to college campuses, similar limits do not consistently apply to prediction markets. The NCAA said some students may mistakenly view prediction trading as a form of investing rather than gambling, despite the inherent unpredictability of sports outcomes. NCAA Cites Harassment and Integrity Gaps in College Prediction Platforms That framing, Baker argued, increases the risk of excessive participation and financial harm. Integrity monitoring was another key issue, as the NCAA monitors more than 23,000 contests annually for suspicious activity and relies on detailed data, including bettor geolocation, to investigate irregularities. Baker said many prediction platforms lack this level of oversight and are not required to share integrity alerts with other operators or governing bodies. He pointed to recent efforts by prediction platforms to seek approval for markets tied to the college transfer portal as an example of activity that could create severe risks for athletes if left unchecked. The NCAA also raised concerns about harassment, as Baker said student-athletes frequently report abuse from bettors, including online harassment tied to game outcomes. He argued that prediction markets should be required to enforce anti-harassment measures across platforms, including banning participants who target athletes. Harm reduction resources were also cited as missing, with the NCAA noting that many states direct sportsbook revenue toward gambling education and treatment programs on campuses, a mechanism that prediction markets do not consistently provide. The request places the CFTC in a difficult position, as prediction markets fall under federal commodities law rather than state gambling statutes, and the agency has previously approved certain sports-related contracts. However, the rapid growth of college-focused markets and the entry of major sports betting and fantasy operators into the space have intensified scrutiny.

The Ministry of Science and ICT revealed the decision today after completing initial reviews of the national program. Naver Cloud and NCSoft are no longer in the race. The other three organizations that will progress are Upstage, SK Telecom, and LG AI Research. The government organized this competition to create what officials call a “ sovereign AI ” basic paradigm. The goal is to develop technology that South Korea can handle on its own. Scoring criteria for the evaluation proces s Th e two government agencies in charge of the assessment process were the Telecommunications Technology Association and the National IT Industry Promotion Agency. The teams were assessed using three criteria. 40 points were awarded for benchmark testing. This section evaluated the AI systems’ ability to comprehend language, solve issues, and produce written material. 35 points came from expert reviews. Experts examined the models’ training and design processes as well as whether the technology was genuinely novel. The final 25 points came from user comments. The reliability and practicality of the systems were assessed in this section. LG AI Research won all three categories. Reviewers emphasized SK Telecom ‘s reliable operations and strong infrastructure. Upstage was acknowledged for its technological efficiency despite its small size. The government explained why Naver Cloud was taken down. Officials claimed that the company’s proposal did not meet the criteria that models be built “from scratch.” Reviewers from outside the company discovered that Naver’s vision encoder, which handles photos and visual data, was nearly identical to one made by Alibaba’s Qwen system in China. More than 99% of the weights in the two models matched. Naver Cloud supported this strategy, claiming that it improved performance and assisted with worldwide compatibility. However, the ministry determined that the competition’s goal of attaining technical independence was undermined by modifying or utilizing significant components from foreign models . NC AI, the NCSoft team, likewise failed. The group did not receive enough points to advance to the following round. Specific scoring information for this squad was not disclosed by the ministry. The path forward Naver Cloud declared today that it will not contest the ministry’s decision. The business intends to continue supplying the project with GPU infrastructure. Outside of this government competition, it will also focus on developing its own AI technologies. Four teams should remain in the competition, according to the government. To fill the vacancy, officials said they will conduct another round of selection in the first half of 2026. Businesses including Kakao, KT, and Konan Technology who were rejected in previous phases will get another opportunity to participate. The government plans to pick two final winners by 2027. Those teams will receive major backing from the state. Support includes access to KRW 1.9 trillion worth of powerful computing equipment and large national datasets. Don’t just read crypto news.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $3,321.49 and a minimum price of $2,797.05. By 2032, BNB’s price could surge to $6,817.80 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2026 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction as the current market sentiment turns negative. The coin’s price also decreased to $938.32 as selling momentum surged once again. If traders continue selling, the BNB price might see a further decrease and break below $919. On the other hand, a success in attracting buying demand might result in a recovery. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate resistance at $951. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,817.80 in 2032. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $938.32, as bears target $919. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 1.05 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding it above $800. BNB can cross the $1000 again in 2026 anytime. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2028, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,817.80 by 2032. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900. At the start of 2026, BNB is trending near the $870 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-15 13:50:00

This significant statement provides a crucial signal about the potential direction of U.S. monetary policy. However, Goolsbee simultaneously emphasized a data-dependent approach, underscoring the central bank’s cautious stance. His comments arrive at a critical juncture for markets, businesses, and consumers nationwide. Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations Gain a Vocal Advocate Austan Goolsbee, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2025, articulated his outlook during a recent economic forum. He stated that current inflation trends and labor market conditions could justify a policy easing later this year. Consequently, investors immediately adjusted their forecasts for the timing of the first rate reduction. Goolsbee’s perspective carries substantial weight because he leads one of the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks. Moreover, his academic background as a former economics professor informs his analytical, data-centric public communications. This expectation for a Federal Reserve rate cut does not exist in a vacuum. It follows over two years of aggressive monetary tightening aimed at curbing the highest inflation in decades. The Fed’s benchmark federal funds rate currently sits at a restrictive level, designed to slow economic activity. Recently, however, key inflation metrics like the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index have shown consistent moderation. Therefore, policymakers like Goolsbee are now assessing when to pivot from restraint to support. The Data-Driven Path to Lower Interest Rates President Goolsbee stressed that any policy move remains contingent on incoming economic data. The Fed’s dual mandate—price stability and maximum employment—guides every decision. Specifically, officials need further confirmation that inflation is moving sustainably toward their 2% target. They also monitor employment figures to ensure the labor market cools without cracking. Upcoming reports on consumer prices, wage growth, and consumer spending will therefore be paramount. Key Indicators the Fed is Watching The Federal Reserve analyzes a dashboard of indicators beyond headline inflation numbers. Core metrics that exclude volatile food and energy prices provide a clearer trend. Additionally, services inflation and housing costs are critical components of their assessment. The following table outlines the primary data points influencing the rate cut debate: Data Series Why It Matters Recent Trend (2025) Core PCE Inflation The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge; excludes food & energy. Moderating toward 2.5-3.0% Employment Cost Index Measures wage growth, a key driver of services inflation. Growth slowing gradually Job Openings (JOLTS) Indicates labor market tightness and demand. Declining from historic highs Consumer Spending Reflects underlying economic strength and demand. Growing at a moderate pace Goolsbee’s call for patience aligns with recent FOMC meeting minutes. These documents reveal a committee committed to avoiding premature easing that could reignite inflation. Conversely, they also wish to prevent overly restrictive policy that damages the economic expansion. This balancing act defines the current policy landscape. Historical Context and the Road to 2025 The current discussion about a Federal Reserve rate cut represents a potential inflection point. To understand its significance, one must review the recent policy trajectory. The Fed began raising rates in March 2022 to combat surging post-pandemic inflation. It executed the most rapid tightening cycle since the early 1980s. By mid-2023, the federal funds rate target range reached 5.25% to 5.50%, where it has remained. This prolonged period of high rates has had profound effects: Housing Market: Mortgage rates soared, cooling home sales and construction. Business Investment: Borrowing costs for expansion and equipment rose sharply. Consumer Debt: Credit card and auto loan interest payments increased household burdens. Financial Markets: Equity and bond markets experienced heightened volatility. Now, with inflation receding, the conversation has logically shifted. Policymakers like Goolsbee are evaluating whether the current rate level is still necessary. The “higher for longer” mantra is gradually giving way to discussions about the timing and pace of normalization. Diverging Views Within the Federal Reserve System While Goolsbee’s comments are notable, they represent one voice in a diverse committee. The FOMC comprises 12 members: the seven Washington-based Governors and five rotating regional Bank Presidents. Consensus is not guaranteed. Some officials, often labeled “hawks,” prioritize inflation risks and advocate for prolonged caution. Others, more “dovish” like Goolsbee, emphasize risks to employment and growth. This internal debate is healthy and central to the Fed’s decision-making process. For instance, regional economic conditions vary significantly. A banker from a manufacturing-heavy district may see different pressures than one from a financial hub. Goolsbee’s Chicago district includes a diverse mix of industry and agriculture. His outlook likely incorporates data from this broad economic cross-section. Ultimately, the median projection of all 19 FOMC participants, summarized in the quarterly “dot plot,” will signal the committee’s collective leaning. Implications for Markets and the Main Street Economy The anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut carries immediate and long-term consequences. Financial markets often price in policy changes months in advance. Goolsbee’s statement alone can influence: Bond Yields: Expectations for lower short-term rates typically push down Treasury yields. The U.S. Dollar: Lower rate prospects can weaken the dollar’s value relative to other currencies. Stock Valuations: Lower borrowing costs can boost corporate earnings outlooks and equity prices. For everyday Americans, the impact is more tangible. A rate cut cycle would eventually lead to lower borrowing costs for homes, cars, and businesses. Savers, however, might see diminished returns on savings accounts and certificates of deposit. The broader goal is to engineer a “soft landing”—reducing inflation without triggering a recession. Goolsbee’s optimism suggests he believes this challenging outcome is increasingly within reach. Conclusion Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee’s expectation for a Federal Reserve rate cut this year marks a pivotal moment in post-pandemic monetary policy. His data-dependent stance highlights the careful, evidence-based approach the central bank must maintain. While not a commitment, his comments provide a clear signal that policymakers are actively planning the next phase. The journey from aggressive tightening to cautious easing is complex. It requires continuous verification from economic reports on inflation and employment. For businesses planning investments and families considering major purchases, Goolsbee’s outlook offers a hopeful, though guarded, glimpse of financial relief on the horizon. The path to lower interest rates in 2025 is now openly charted, awaiting confirmation from the hard numbers. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee say about interest rates? Austan Goolsbee stated he expects an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve within the current year. However, he emphasized the need to review more economic data before confirming such a move, adhering to a data-dependent policy approach. Q2: Why is Goolsbee’s opinion on a Federal Reserve rate cut important? As President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and a voting member of the FOMC in 2025, Goolsbee’s views directly influence monetary policy discussions. His public statements provide insight into the thinking of key policymakers and can shape market expectations. Q3: What economic data will the Fed review before cutting rates? The Federal Reserve will primarily analyze inflation data, especially the Core PCE index, to ensure it is moving sustainably toward 2%. They will also monitor labor market conditions, including wage growth and job openings, to assess the balance between cooling inflation and maintaining employment. Q4: How would a Federal Reserve rate cut affect average consumers? Over time, rate cuts would lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. This could make large purchases more affordable. Conversely, interest earned on savings accounts might decrease. Q5: Does Goolsbee’s view represent the entire Federal Reserve committee? Not necessarily. While Goolsbee’s view is influential, the FOMC comprises members with diverse perspectives. The final decision on rate cuts will be determined by a consensus or majority vote of the committee, based on collective analysis of economic conditions.

The move brings TRON’s infrastructure into MetaMask’s multichain environment allowing users to manage TRON-based assets and interact with TRON dApps without relying on additional wallets or complex bridging workflows. MetaMask is developed by Consensys and is one of the most widely used wallets in the crypto ecosystem, with a growing focus on multichain access beyond Ethereum. Unified Multichain Experience With native TRON support, MetaMask users can now swap assets seamlessly across TRON, EVM-compatible networks, Solana, and Bitcoin from a single interface. The integration allows users to send USDT on TRON, stake TRX, and connect directly to TRON-based decentralized applications, while benefiting from the network’s fast confirmation times and low transaction costs. By embedding TRON directly into MetaMask, the wallet removes the need for separate extensions or third-party tools, offering a more streamlined experience for users who operate across multiple blockchain ecosystems. The update reflects MetaMask’s broader strategy to act as a universal access point for Web3, reducing friction for users navigating an increasingly fragmented blockchain landscape. Expanding Access to a Major Stablecoin Network TRON has become a core settlement layer for global stablecoin activity, processing more than $21 billion in daily stablecoin transfer volume, according to data cited by the network. Sam Elfarra, community spokesperson at TRON DAO said the integration broadens access to a blockchain that underpins real-world payment flows and DeFi activity at scale. By making TRON available through a familiar wallet interface the integration is expected to expand participation in TRON’s ecosystem especially for users who already rely on MetaMask for asset management across other networks. MetaMask’s Multichain Strategy For MetaMask, native TRON support represents another step in its multichain expansion. Rizvi Haider, staff product manager at MetaMask said the update follows earlier integrations with Solana and Bitcoin, bringing more non-EVM networks into a unified user experience. @MetaMask added native Bitcoin support, allowing users to buy, swap, and send BTC directly from the wallet. #MetaMask #Bitcoin https://t.co/na8C8OMCSN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 16, 2025 The goal, according to MetaMask, is to meet users where they are by supporting the networks they actively use, while moving closer to a universal gateway for the decentralized economy. Native integrations reduce reliance on bridges and wrapped assets, which have historically introduced added complexity and risk. Lowering Barriers to Global Web3 Adoption TRON’s ecosystem has seen strong adoption across regions including Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where stablecoins play an important role in payments, remittances, and on-chain financial activity. By combining TRON’s high-throughput blockchain with MetaMask’s widely adopted wallet infrastructure, the collaboration aims to lower barriers to entry for both emerging and established markets. The integration is a broader trend toward wallet-led multichain access, as infrastructure providers seek to simplify how users interact with an expanding universe of blockchain networks and applications.

This development represents a calculated move within the evolving digital asset landscape, potentially increasing market accessibility and liquidity for the FOGO token ecosystem. The announcement follows extensive market analysis and platform development, positioning Binance to capture growing institutional and retail interest in cryptocurrency derivatives products. Binance FOGO Perpetual Futures: Market Context and Significance Binance’s decision to list FOGO perpetual futures arrives during a period of substantial growth in cryptocurrency derivatives trading volumes. According to recent market data from CryptoCompare, derivatives now account for approximately 65% of total cryptocurrency trading activity globally. The exchange has carefully timed this listing to coincide with increasing institutional adoption of digital asset derivatives. Furthermore, Binance has established a rigorous listing framework that evaluates multiple factors before adding new perpetual futures contracts. The exchange typically considers trading volume, market capitalization, community engagement, and technological infrastructure when selecting assets for derivatives products. FOGO’s inclusion suggests the token has met these stringent criteria, indicating both market demand and technical readiness. Perpetual futures contracts differ from traditional futures because they lack expiration dates, allowing traders to maintain positions indefinitely while paying funding rates periodically. This structure has proven particularly popular in cryptocurrency markets since their introduction by BitMEX in 2016. Understanding Perpetual Futures Mechanics Perpetual futures contracts represent sophisticated financial instruments that enable traders to speculate on cryptocurrency price movements without owning the underlying assets. These contracts utilize a funding rate mechanism to maintain price alignment with spot markets. The funding rate exchanges payments between long and short position holders every eight hours typically. When the perpetual contract trades above the spot price, long positions pay funding to short positions, creating downward pressure on the contract price. Conversely, when the contract trades below spot price, short positions fund long positions. This innovative mechanism prevents significant price divergence between perpetual futures and their underlying assets. Binance will implement specific parameters for FOGO perpetual futures including: Leverage options: Multiple tiers up to 25x for qualified traders Margin requirements: Initial and maintenance margin calculated dynamically Settlement: Continuous funding rate payments every eight hours Risk management: Auto-deleveraging and liquidation protocols Market Impact and Trading Implications The listing announcement typically generates immediate market reactions across multiple dimensions. Historical data from previous Binance futures listings shows an average price increase of 15-25% for the underlying token during the announcement week. However, market analysts emphasize that these effects vary based on broader market conditions and token fundamentals. The FOGO perpetual futures listing will likely increase overall token liquidity by attracting new market participants with different trading strategies. Derivatives markets often provide price discovery functions that enhance market efficiency. Additionally, institutional traders frequently utilize futures contracts for hedging purposes, potentially stabilizing spot market volatility over time. Binance has developed comprehensive educational resources alongside this listing to ensure traders understand the risks associated with leveraged derivatives trading. The exchange maintains transparent fee structures and provides real-time market data through its trading interface. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework Binance operates within an increasingly complex global regulatory environment for cryptocurrency derivatives. The exchange has implemented geographic restrictions for FOGO perpetual futures trading in jurisdictions where regulatory frameworks remain uncertain. Users must complete identity verification procedures and risk assessment questionnaires before accessing leveraged trading products. These measures align with Financial Action Task Force recommendations and demonstrate Binance’s commitment to regulatory compliance. The exchange collaborates with multiple regulatory bodies worldwide to establish appropriate safeguards for derivatives traders. Recent developments include enhanced reporting requirements and improved risk disclosure protocols. Binance’s compliance team continuously monitors regulatory changes across different jurisdictions, adjusting product availability accordingly. This proactive approach has helped the exchange maintain operations in major markets while navigating evolving legal landscapes.

Regular security audits by independent third-party firms verify system integrity and protection mechanisms. Binance also maintains a Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) that provides additional protection against unexpected events. These technical safeguards create a robust trading environment for FOGO perpetual futures participants. Educational Resources and Trader Support Recognizing the complexity of derivatives trading, Binance provides extensive educational materials through its academy platform. These resources cover fundamental concepts, trading strategies, and risk management techniques. The exchange offers simulated trading environments where users can practice with virtual funds before risking actual capital. Additionally, Binance maintains 24/7 customer support services across multiple languages and communication channels. The platform’s interface includes advanced charting tools, real-time market data, and customizable trading views. These features enable both novice and experienced traders to make informed decisions based on comprehensive market information. Binance regularly hosts webinars and trading competitions to engage community members and promote responsible trading practices. The exchange emphasizes education as a cornerstone of sustainable market participation. Conclusion Binance’s listing of FOGO perpetual futures represents a strategic expansion within the cryptocurrency derivatives ecosystem. This development provides traders with additional instruments for speculation and hedging while potentially increasing overall market liquidity for the FOGO token. The exchange has implemented comprehensive technical infrastructure, educational resources, and risk management protocols to support this new trading product. As cryptocurrency markets continue maturing, derivatives offerings like FOGO perpetual futures will likely play increasingly important roles in price discovery and market efficiency. Binance maintains its position as an industry leader through calculated product expansions that balance innovation with responsible market practices. FAQs Q1: What are perpetual futures contracts?

The same filing also shows a fresh allocation to the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, a rare double-print of BTC and ETH exposure inside an Ivy League endowment’s public equity book. Dartmouth’s Endowment Adds Bitcoin And Ethereum Crypto market observers flagged the disclosure immediately. MacroScope, an analyst account that tracks institutional positioning, framed the filing as a meaningful signal from the endowment complex: “Very important filing today. In a 13F, Dartmouth College reported owning 201,531 shares of IBIT as of December 31, valued over $10 million. It also reported owning 178,148 shares of Grayscale Ethereum Mini valued at $4.9 million.” The SEC filing provides the precise marks. Dartmouth’s Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust stake was listed at $4,998,833 for 178,148 shares at quarter-end, placing the combined Bitcoin and Ethereum allocations at roughly $15.0 million of reported 13F holdings. In the context of Dartmouth’s disclosed 13F portfolio, crypto remains a slice rather than a core. The filing’s summary page lists a “Form 13F Information Table Value Total” of $393,306,686 across nine positions. On that math, IBIT represents about 2.5% of the reported book, with the Ethereum Mini position adding roughly 1.3%. The rest of the holdings read like a traditional endowment liquid sleeve. Dartmouth’s largest position was SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust at $227,897,664, alongside sizable allocations to emerging markets (iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets at $50,043,811), a quality-factor ETF (GMO US Quality at $42,153,006), and a value ETF (Vanguard Value at $34,807,928). Notably, neither IBIT nor the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust appeared in Dartmouth’s prior 13F for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025, supporting the claim that both positions were new additions heading into year-end.Notably, Dartmouth is not the first campus allocator to route crypto exposure through the ETF wrapper. Brown University disclosed a new IBIT position in its March 31, 2025 13F, 105,000 shares valued around $4.9 million, the school’s “first foray” into spot bitcoin ETF ownership that quarter. Emory University moved earlier. In an October 2024 disclosure, the Atlanta-based school reported putting $15.8 million from its endowment into a publicly traded bitcoin ETF, with the filing showing roughly 2.7 million shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust. And at the other end of the spectrum sits Harvard’s endowment manager . Harvard Management Co.’s public-equities 13F for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025 showed IBIT as its largest reported position, 6,813,612 shares worth about $442.9 million on the filing’s valuation marks.

The District Attorney urged the state to criminalize and regulate unlicensed crypto operations, which have now grown to a $51 billion economy. The official stated that the industry has grown and developed due to the presence of loopholes and blind spots in current regulations governing crypto activities. According to Bragg, the blind spot facilitates money laundering activities for drugs, fraud, and gun-related illegal activities. Bragg emphasized that the issue requires urgency and categorized it as a second-term priority, alongside shoplifting and gun control. He demanded that regulators revisit regulations to close down loopholes that allow malicious actors to launder proceeds from criminal activities without facing prosecution. Manhattan DA calls out unregulated crypto ATMs While speaking at New York Law School on Wednesday, Bragg focused on crypto ATMs and unlicensed crypto kiosks. According to the official, these outlets charge as high as 20% to convert “dirty” cash into digital assets. He said that the outlets know that criminals are laundering gun proceeds, but proceed to complete the transactions anyway. Manhattan prosecutors have successfully cracked crypto-related criminal activities in the past, including a $5 million unlicensed Bitcoin ATM operation that had links to terrorism financing in Syria. However, he urged that the current systems heavily rely on criminals making mistakes, such as using their bank accounts or bragging on social media. He emphasized that clever criminals may get away with illegal activities. He also urged lawmakers to make all crypto businesses obtain legal licences that permit their operations by saying that “if you are operating a crypto business, if you are transferring, trading, moving, whatever verb you wanna use, virtual currency, you should be licensed. It’s that simple.” Bragg emphasized that crypto entities should emulate banking infrastructure by employing customer KYC requirements for their users. He explained that some crypto players have implemented KYC standards for their users. Still, the majority of the sector remains highly unregulated, despite reaching a market cap of more than $3 trillion. According to the DA, Manhattan will be the 19th state to ban unlicensed crypto operations. Crypto crimes in New York have migrated from online scams to physical altercations alongside robbery with violence. On July 24, 2025, Cryptopolitan reported that two men had been arrested for kidnapping, torturing, and coercing an Italian national in Manhattan to gain access to his crypto address. Another July report noted that Asia had become a hotspot for physical and violent crypto attacks, including abduction. Illicit crypto volume reaches an all-time high of $158 billion in 2025 A 2026 Crypto Crime Report, released on January 10 by TRM Labs, shows that illicit crypto volume in 2025 increased by nearly 145%, reaching an all-time high of $158 billion, up from $64 billion in 2024. The report highlighted that most of the volume increase came from a small number of large-scale hacks and enforcement-driven attributions. The report also highlighted that major geopolitical players prefer to use cryptocurrencies to circumvent international sanctions. Countries such as Iran and Venezuela relied on crypto for sanctions-constrained payments and financial services at scale. The news comes after the New York Assembly reintroduced a bill targeting crypto prediction platforms such as Polymarket. According to a previous report by Cryptopolitan, NY Assemblyman Clyde Vanel reintroduced a bill dubbed the ORACLE Act, which prohibits these platforms from offering sports betting, despite it being the most significant revenue source for prediction markets.

In just two weeks, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has delivered a double-digit gain, pushing back toward the psychologically important $100,000 level and rewarding investors who entered the year with fresh exposure. According to price data as of January 15, 2026, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $96,885, up sharply from $87,412 on January 1, the first trading day of the year. That move represents a year-to-date gain of 10.84%, making Bitcoin one of the strongest major assets so far in 2026. Bitcoin year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Google Finance/Finbold A $1k investment in Bitcoin at the start of 2026 For an investor who allocated $1,000 into Bitcoin at the start of the year, the rally has already translated into meaningful profits. At a January 1 price of roughly $87,412 per coin, a $1,000 investment would have purchased about 0.01144 BTC. At today’s price near $96,885, that same holding is now worth approximately $1,108, turning a four-figure stake into a $108 gain in just 15 days. The speed of the move highlights how quickly Bitcoin sentiment has shifted. Early January saw a brief pullback toward the low-$90,000 range, but buyers stepped back in aggressively, driving a sharp rebound that erased the dip and pushed prices to new 2026 highs within days. The rally has been supported by a combination of factors. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have remained positive, institutional participation continues to grow, and macroeconomic expectations around interest rate cuts later in the year have renewed appetite for risk assets. At the same time, Bitcoin’s fixed supply narrative has regained traction as investors look for assets that can outperform in an environment of persistent global debt and currency debasement.What makes the current run particularly notable is how it compares to traditional markets. A 10.8% return in just two weeks would typically take months or even years to achieve in equities or bonds . For Bitcoin, however, this type of volatility remains part of its core appeal, delivering outsized upside for investors willing to tolerate sharp swings.

As central banks and policymakers explore blockchain-based payment infrastructure, developments in a major financial hub like Luxembourg naturally draw global attention. Recent discussions surrounding Ripple and XRP have intensified interest, raising questions about how far institutional engagement with public blockchain assets may extend. Market commentary circulated by SMQKE has connected these discussions to Ripple’s expanding regulatory presence in Europe. The renewed focus follows Ripple’s preliminary Electronic Money Institution license approval from Luxembourg’s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, a move that strengthens Ripple’s ability to deliver regulated cross-border payment services across the European Union. What Ripple’s Luxembourg Approval Confirms Ripple’s EMI license allows the company to issue electronic money and provide compliant payment services across EU member states through passporting rights. This approval aligns with Ripple’s broader regulatory strategy, which now includes more than 75 licenses, registrations, and approvals worldwide. LUXEMBOURG’S CENTRAL BANK HAS OPENLY DISCUSSED THE INTEGRATION OF XRP Documented. https://t.co/75q3e9z6p8 pic.twitter.com/CufVqO5ByR — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 14, 2026 The Luxembourg authorization reinforces Ripple’s credibility as a regulated financial infrastructure provider rather than a purely crypto-native firm. However, the scope of the license centers on payments and stablecoin-related services. It does not confirm or imply direct adoption of the XRP token by Luxembourg’s central bank or any EU monetary authority. Examining Claims of Central Bank XRP Discussions SMQKE’s post references imagery suggesting that Luxembourg’s central bank has discussed XRP integration, alongside mentions of other jurisdictions such as France and Brazil. Despite the circulation of such materials, no primary documents, official statements, or policy publications from Luxembourg’s central bank currently verify a formal discussion or decision to integrate XRP at the central bank level. This absence of confirmation is critical. Without verifiable primary sources, claims of explicit central bank XRP integration remain speculative rather than fact. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Verified Role in CBDC Development Ripple’s involvement with central banks is well documented in the context of central bank digital currency experimentation. The company has confirmed participation in CBDC pilot programs and initiatives in more than 20 countries. Many of these projects use the XRP Ledger or its underlying technology to test interoperability, programmability, and settlement efficiency. In most cases, central banks rely on private or permissioned ledger environments rather than the public XRP token itself. This structure allows institutions to evaluate blockchain infrastructure while maintaining strict control over monetary policy and risk exposure. Separating Confirmed Progress From Assumption Luxembourg’s openness to fintech innovation and Ripple’s regulatory momentum naturally invite speculation about deeper integration, including potential XRP usage. However, accuracy requires a clear separation between confirmed regulatory approvals and unverified claims of central bank adoption. At present, the evidence supports Ripple’s expanding role within Europe’s regulated payments ecosystem. Claims that Luxembourg’s central bank has openly discussed integrating XRP remain unsubstantiated. Until official documentation emerges, such assertions should be treated with caution, even as Ripple’s presence keeps XRP firmly within the broader institutional conversation.

This strategic expansion directly responds to growing institutional demand for diversified crypto exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Consequently, it marks a significant step toward mainstream financial integration for these three prominent blockchain networks. CME Group Futures Launch: A Deep Dive into the New Offerings The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will introduce cash-settled futures for ADA, LINK, and XLM. These contracts will settle against the CME CF Cryptocurrency Real-Time Indices. This methodology ensures pricing integrity and aligns with existing Bitcoin and Ether futures. Each contract will represent a specific quantity of the underlying digital asset, providing a standardized, regulated tool for hedging and speculation. CME Group first entered the crypto space with Bitcoin futures in 2017. Subsequently, it added Ether futures in 2021. The exchange has consistently cited client demand and market maturity as key drivers for new product launches. The selection of ADA, LINK, and XLM follows a rigorous evaluation of liquidity, market capitalization, and institutional interest. This move effectively brings the total number of crypto futures offered by CME to five. The three new futures contracts share several critical features: Cash Settlement: Contracts settle in U.S. dollars, eliminating the need for physical delivery of tokens. Regulated Environment: Trading occurs under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Transparent Pricing: Prices derive from aggregated data across major spot exchanges. Risk Management: Provides institutions with tools to hedge portfolio exposure. Analyzing the Impact on Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar The launch confers immediate legitimacy and visibility. CME’s rigorous listing standards act as a de facto vetting process for institutional investors. Therefore, ADA, LINK, and XLM gain a powerful stamp of approval. Historically, the announcement of CME futures has preceded increased trading volume and price discovery for an asset. However, the long-term price impact remains a function of broader market dynamics. More importantly, these futures create new avenues for capital flow. Institutional players, such as hedge funds and asset managers, who are restricted from direct spot market purchases, can now gain regulated exposure. This potential influx of institutional capital could enhance overall market depth and stability for these assets. Moreover, the availability of hedging tools may encourage larger enterprises to build on these blockchains, knowing they can manage treasury risk. Profile of the New CME Crypto Futures Assets Asset Primary Use Case Notable Differentiator Cardano (ADA) Proof-of-stake smart contract platform Peer-reviewed, research-driven development Chainlink (LINK) Decentralized oracle network Bridges smart contracts to real-world data Stellar (XLM) Cross-border payments and asset issuance Focus on financial inclusion and low-cost transfers Expert Perspective on Market Structure Evolution Financial analysts view this expansion as a natural progression. “CME’s move signals that the crypto market is maturing beyond a two-asset ecosystem,” notes a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. It reflects a growing recognition of the unique utility provided by alternative layer-1 platforms and critical infrastructure protocols like oracles. Furthermore, this development pressures other traditional finance (TradFi) institutions to evaluate their own crypto product roadmaps. The competitive landscape for crypto derivatives is intensifying rapidly. Regulatory clarity remains a pivotal backdrop. The CFTC’s oversight of these futures contrasts with the ongoing SEC deliberations over spot crypto ETFs. This regulatory dichotomy highlights the complex environment for digital assets in the United States. Nevertheless, CME’s established compliance framework provides a trusted conduit for cautious institutional capital. The launch also arrives as global financial hubs like the EU implement comprehensive crypto regulations, fostering a more structured global market. Conclusion The CME Group’s launch of ADA, LINK, and XLM futures on February 9 represents a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency adoption. It extends the reach of regulated financial instruments to three major altcoins, validating their market role and utility. This development provides institutional investors with essential risk management tools. Ultimately, it strengthens the bridge between decentralized blockchain networks and the traditional global financial system, fostering greater integration, liquidity, and maturity for the entire digital asset class. FAQs Q1: What are CME Group’s new cryptocurrency futures? CME Group is launching cash-settled futures contracts for Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), and Stellar (XLM), allowing regulated trading and hedging based on their prices. Q2: Why is the launch of ADA, LINK, and XLM futures significant? It signals institutional validation, provides regulated exposure tools for major funds, and expands the crypto derivatives market beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Q3: How will these futures contracts be settled? They are cash-settled in U.S. dollars, using the CME CF Cryptocurrency Real-Time Indices as the official reference price, with no physical delivery of tokens. Q4: What impact could this have on the prices of ADA, LINK, and XLM? While futures can improve liquidity and price discovery, direct price impact is uncertain and depends on broader market sentiment, adoption, and capital flows. Q5: Can retail investors trade these CME futures contracts? Yes, but typically through a futures brokerage account that meets CME’s requirements; they are not traded on standard crypto exchanges. Q6: Does this mean ADA, LINK, and XLM are more likely to get a spot ETF? Not directly. A futures launch is separate from an ETF approval process, which involves different regulators and criteria, though it may support the case for their maturity.

Two distinct levels are being monitored by analysts: a move above $105,000 could confirm ongoing momentum, and a decline below $83,000 could signal a systematic shift. Key Bitcoin Price Levels Under Watch EGRAG CRYPTO posted that Bitcoin is compressing near the lower side of its rising trend. According to their breakdown, the channel is still holding, but pressure is building. “A weekly close above $105K confirms strength,” EGRAG noted. If that happens, it could open the way toward the $180K to $210K zone. However, they warned that “a weekly close below $83K would break the channel” and suggested weakness in the current cycle. For now, the price action still respects the existing structure. Bitcoin touched a high of $98,000 on Thursday before dropping slightly on news related to a delay in legislative discussions. Despite this, it has held above $96,000 and remains up by over 6% this week. Price Movement and Market Conditions Bitcoin is outperforming many other assets even as broader markets turn cautious. The total crypto market cap stands at $3.34 trillion, with BTC making up over 57% of it. Rekt Capital commented that Bitcoin’s current price behavior is similar to what was seen in late November 2024. “ Bitcoin could weekly close around $97K but retest $93,500 next week, ” they shared. They also noted that BTC is near its Bull Market EMAs but has not yet confirmed these levels as support. #BTC Even though the Bull Market EMAs are teasing to act as resistance, history suggests Bitcoin shouldn’t struggle to break beyond them However history suggests Bitcoin will struggle to keep them as support and the crossover may occur once the EMAs have been turned into new… https://t.co/QqDtHmhNXS pic.twitter.com/H56rg1LdZN — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) January 14, 2026 In addition, Bitcoin is also testing key moving averages. According to Merlijn The Trader, the asset has reclaimed its 50-day average. Holding this level could support a continuation higher, with the next resistance at the 100-day average. Whales in Control, Retail Cools Off CW shared that large holders continue to dominate trading volume. The recent drop in demand from smaller buyers may create pressure during any downside moves. “Retail investors have very little influence,” they stated. Meanwhile, data shared by CryptosRus suggests that long-term holders are selling less. “ OG selling at local tops has been rolling over, ” they wrote. Coins that have been held for five or more years are not moving at the same pace as earlier in the cycle. OG BITCOIN SELLING IS DRYING UP This chart is important. It tracks #Bitcoin being spent by OG holders — coins that sat dormant for 5+ years. Earlier this cycle, OGs were very active. Selling pressure from long-term holders actually exceeded the last cycle, which made sense.… pic.twitter.com/EBIVPn9dP3 — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) January 15, 2026 This shift could reduce supply in the short term. If demand stays steady while older coins remain off the market, Bitcoin may find support more easily.

This collaboration represents a strategic move to bridge the knowledge gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, potentially accelerating institutional adoption across one of Asia’s most technologically advanced economies. Ethereum Foundation and Undefined Labs Forge Strategic Alliance The partnership between Undefined Labs and the Ethereum Foundation Enterprise Team marks a pivotal moment for blockchain education in institutional finance. Undefined Labs, established in 2018, has built a strong reputation as South Korea’s premier blockchain research and education organization. The firm has previously collaborated with major domestic universities and financial institutions to develop comprehensive blockchain curricula. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation Enterprise Team focuses specifically on supporting enterprise adoption of Ethereum technology through education, technical resources, and strategic partnerships. This collaboration follows South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT announcement in late 2024 regarding increased government support for blockchain integration in financial services. According to the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, over 60% of domestic financial institutions have initiated blockchain research projects since 2023. However, many organizations face significant knowledge barriers when implementing these technologies in production environments. Comprehensive Educational Program Structure The joint initiative will roll out in multiple phases throughout 2025, beginning with a major seminar scheduled for mid-April. This structured approach ensures participants receive both foundational knowledge and practical implementation guidance. The program specifically targets executives and technical teams from banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and fintech organizations. Educational sessions will cover several critical areas: Ethereum Technical Architecture: Detailed explanations of consensus mechanisms, smart contract functionality, and network security protocols Enterprise Use Cases: Real-world applications in trade finance, cross-border payments, and digital asset management Regulatory Compliance: Alignment with South Korea’s specific financial regulations and reporting requirements Implementation Roadmaps: Practical guidance for integrating Ethereum-based solutions with existing financial infrastructure The curriculum development team includes both international Ethereum experts and local financial technology specialists who understand South Korea’s unique regulatory environment. This balanced approach ensures content remains globally relevant while addressing specific domestic considerations. South Korea’s Financial Technology Evolution South Korea represents one of the world’s most sophisticated financial technology markets, with nearly universal smartphone penetration and widespread digital payment adoption. The Bank of Korea’s 2024 Digital Currency Research Report indicates that 78% of financial transactions now occur through digital channels. This digital maturity creates ideal conditions for blockchain integration, particularly in areas requiring enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency. Major financial institutions have already begun experimenting with blockchain technology. Shinhan Bank launched a blockchain-based international remittance service in 2023, while KB Kookmin Bank developed a digital asset custody platform in partnership with local blockchain firms. However, these initiatives often operate in isolation without standardized implementation frameworks or shared best practices. The Undefined Labs-Ethereum Foundation partnership addresses this fragmentation by providing coordinated education and establishing common technical standards. Industry analysts predict this could accelerate blockchain adoption timelines by 12-18 months across South Korea’s financial sector. Global Context and Competitive Landscape South Korea’s blockchain education initiative emerges within a broader global trend of financial institutions embracing decentralized technologies. Singapore’s Monetary Authority has operated the Project Guardian blockchain initiative since 2022, while Japan’s Financial Services Agency established formal cryptocurrency exchange regulations in 2023. The table below illustrates how South Korea’s approach compares with regional counterparts: Country Primary Regulatory Approach Institutional Adoption Status Key Blockchain Focus Areas South Korea Pro-innovation with strict compliance Early implementation phase Digital assets, cross-border payments Singapore Sandbox experimentation Advanced pilot programs Tokenized assets, DeFi protocols Japan Licensing framework Regulated exchange operations Cryptocurrency trading, stablecoins Unlike Singapore’s sandbox model or Japan’s exchange-focused approach, South Korea’s strategy emphasizes comprehensive institutional education before widespread implementation. This methodical progression reflects the country’s characteristic balance between technological innovation and regulatory caution. Expert Perspectives on the Initiative Financial technology analysts have responded positively to the announced partnership. Dr. Min-ji Park, Director of the Korea Fintech Research Institute, notes that “coordinated education represents the missing link in South Korea’s blockchain adoption journey.” She emphasizes that previous fragmentation between different institutions’ learning initiatives created knowledge silos that slowed overall progress. Meanwhile, global blockchain educators recognize the significance of this partnership model. Professor Michael Sung, Chair of the FinTech Research Center at Fudan University, observes that “the Ethereum Foundation’s direct involvement provides institutional credibility that accelerates adoption curves.” He further notes that similar education-first approaches in other Asian markets have reduced implementation failures by approximately 40%. Industry participants also express enthusiasm for the program’s practical orientation. “We need implementation guidance, not just theoretical concepts,” states Choi Ji-hoon, Head of Digital Innovation at a major Seoul-based securities firm. “Previous blockchain workshops provided interesting overviews but lacked the technical depth our engineering teams require for actual deployment.” Implementation Timeline and Expected Outcomes The educational program follows a carefully structured timeline designed to maximize knowledge retention and practical application. The initial mid-April seminar will introduce fundamental concepts to executive audiences, followed by technical deep-dive sessions throughout May and June. Advanced implementation workshops will occur in the third quarter, with ongoing support continuing through year-end. Expected outcomes include: Standardized understanding of Ethereum technology across participating institutions Development of shared implementation frameworks and best practices Creation of a professional network for ongoing knowledge exchange Accelerated deployment of Ethereum-based solutions in regulated environments Success metrics will track both educational completion rates and subsequent implementation milestones. The partnership agreement includes provisions for program evaluation and curriculum adjustments based on participant feedback and technological developments. Conclusion The collaboration between Undefined Labs and the Ethereum Foundation represents a strategic investment in South Korea’s financial technology future. This comprehensive education initiative addresses critical knowledge gaps while establishing standardized implementation approaches across the financial sector. As blockchain technology continues evolving, such coordinated educational efforts will likely become increasingly important for institutional adoption. The program’s success could establish a replicable model for other markets seeking to balance innovation with regulatory compliance, potentially influencing blockchain education approaches worldwide. The Ethereum Foundation’s direct involvement provides both technical credibility and global perspective, while Undefined Labs ensures localization to South Korea’s specific financial context. FAQs Q1: What specific financial institutions will participate in the education program? While the complete participant list remains confidential, organizers confirm that major commercial banks, securities firms, and insurance companies have registered for the initial sessions. The program specifically targets institutions with existing blockchain research initiatives or planned implementations. Q2: How does this initiative differ from previous blockchain education efforts in South Korea? Previous programs typically involved individual institutions working with various education providers, creating fragmented knowledge bases. This coordinated approach establishes standardized curricula, shared best practices, and professional networks that facilitate industry-wide progress rather than isolated advancements. Q3: Will the education program address South Korea’s specific regulatory requirements? Yes, the curriculum includes dedicated modules on regulatory compliance, with content developed in consultation with domestic financial authorities. These sessions will cover reporting requirements, consumer protection standards, and anti-money laundering protocols specific to South Korea’s financial regulations. Q4: What technical prerequisites do participants need for the advanced workshops? Organizers recommend basic understanding of blockchain fundamentals and software development principles for technical workshops. However, the program includes foundational sessions for executives and non-technical professionals who require conceptual understanding without implementation responsibilities. Q5: How will the program evolve as Ethereum technology develops? The partnership includes provisions for ongoing curriculum updates based on technological advancements and participant feedback. Quarterly reviews will ensure content remains current with Ethereum protocol upgrades, new development tools, and evolving industry standards.

Experts cite that this situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, as a clear path forward for the country’s economic revival is uncertain. Iran is facing an economic crisis, driving levels of societal unrest that the country has not seen in decades. In late 2025, the Iranian rial crashed significantly in value, leading to widespread protests across the nation, and annual inflation surging above 40%. As of January 2026, the exchange rate of the currency is sitting at roughly 1.5 million rials per U.S. dollar. This renders the rial effectively worthless in global markets, making it essentially impossible to purchase any goods from outside the country. The purchasing power of Iranians has been critically impacted as a result, with large portions of the population unable to afford basic necessities like food and healthcare. These circumstances have created mass instability in the nation, escalating to the point where citizens are calling to overthrow the current regime. Over 2,000 protesters have been killed, and the government continues to initiate major internet blackouts in an attempt to quell the unrest. The collapse of the Iranian economy in detail The reason behind Iran’s economic upheaval and currency collapse is multi-layered. Experts on the matter have tied it to a combination of both external and structural pressures, along with policy decisions spanning decades. Geopolitical tensions have been a key factor in Iran’s recent economic destabilization. The country has been incredibly isolated from the global economy for years, having been hammered by both international and notably U.S. Sanctions dating all the way back to 1979. This has made it very difficult for the country to meaningfully participate in global markets, seeing as the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency. The International Institute for Sustainable Development reports that Iran has experienced persistent annual inflation rates of over 40% since 2018. This inflation is primarily driven by fiscal dominance, “where persistent government deficits are financed by monetary expansion” from the country’s central bank. This rampant inflation and currency debasement have pushed millions of Iranian citizens into poverty, with the World Bank estimating that as high as 40% of the country lives below the poverty line. Iran has also been experiencing a major drought over the last five years, which has dramatically impacted food production, according to The Independent. With very few trading partners outside of countries like China and Russia, a drought of this extent has been detrimental to an economically isolated Iran. Yale Environment 360 reports that the country is currently on the verge of “water bankruptcy” caused by “years of ill-conceived dam projects and overpumping” that has destroyed crucial underground water reserves. Iranian citizens turn to stablecoins amid currency collapse The collapse in the Iranian rial due to years of hyperinflation, currency debasement, and international sanctions has erased household savings and critically impacted the purchasing power of Iranians. This has led many citizens to turn to stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar as a means of preserving what money they have left. Due to this rise in stablecoin usage, the Iranian government imposed limits on transactions in September 2025, likely to avoid further flight away from the rial. This ruling caps annual purchases at $5,000 per person and restricts total holdings from exceeding $10,000, according to Iran International. However, the Iranian government’s recent and nearly complete internet blackout across the country has made it almost impossible for citizens to access their stablecoin holdings. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated he plans to consult Elon Musk on using Starlink to restore internet in Iran . Even partially restored internet access via Starlink could provide a crucial lifeline for Iranians during this period of economic unrest. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

All three companies were trying to stop a plan that would limit what banks can charge each other for cross-border online payments. They lost. The court said the UK regulator was right to introduce price caps on these fees, even though Visa and Revolut had filed a judicial review last year. They claimed the regulator was stepping out of line and hurting competition. The court didn’t agree. Visa and Mastercard raised their fees after Brexit This fight started in 2023 when the PSR claimed it had noticed the fees had jumped five times higher since the UK left the EU. The regulator then said this proved it was time to step in and limit what banks could charge when people used a card to shop online across countries. The PSR pointed to “card not present” payments, where a buyer in one country pays a seller in another, usually online, as where the fees have particularly surged. Between 2021 and 2022, Visa and Mastercard’s debit card fees went from 0.2% to 1.15%, and credit card fees surged from 0.3% to 1.5%. Even though Visa and Mastercard don’t actually keep the interchange fees, they still have something to lose. The court said banks are more likely to use their services when the fees are high, because that’s how banks make more money. Lower the fees, and banks might look elsewhere. The PSR had warned in a briefing seen by the Financial Times that these changes are costing UK businesses between £150 million and £200 million more every year. That’s what pushed them to act. They said the cap was needed “to protect UK businesses from overpaying”. Fintechs and banks say the cap puts them at a loss Not everyone agreed. A lot of European fintechs and banks went straight to the Treasury to complain. One trade body said the cap would make them “lose money on each transaction” because the cost to process a payment would be more than the fee they’re allowed to charge. Fintechs like Revolut said the same thing. Unlike big banks, they don’t make money from loans. Their business depends on payment fees. Capping those fees hits their core revenue. Some also said this new rule would make things worse for the economy. They claimed it went against the UK government’s plans to grow the industry. They said it was anti-competitive. Things have already gotten more expensive since Brexit. Banks now have extra work to process payments between the UK and Europe. Then there’s the rise of digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, which have their own costs and need new tech to support them. While the price cap still doesn’t have a set date or limit, this ruling means the PSR can move forward. But the regulator itself won’t be around much longer. The government is scrapping it and merging it into the Financial Conduct Authority. And all this happened right after Donald Trump pushed for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates. Banks weren’t happy. Now they’ve got this on their plate too. Get seen where it counts.

The message centers on conviction rather than short-term price action, emphasizing belief in the asset’s future. While brief in form, Amonyx’s post reflects a narrative that has gained traction among long-term XRP holders who view the coming years as a decisive period for adoption and valuation. Amonyx’s outlook does not focus on near-term volatility or speculative trading cycles. Instead, it places XRP as an asset whose most meaningful value realization remains ahead, contingent on structural developments. The reference to 2026 emphasizes patience and long-duration positioning, aligning with expectations that major institutional and regulatory developments will require time to materialize. #XRP is about to print generational wealth in 2026. Believe in something. pic.twitter.com/XYa9TmicQV — Amonyx (@amonyx) January 12, 2026 Community Responses Emphasize Discipline and Execution Responses to Amonyx’s statement added further depth to the discussion by grounding optimism in fundamentals and execution. One community member highlighted that conviction is not an emotional stance but a result of consistent fundamentals, patience, and delivery. From this perspective, the significance of 2026 would lie not in speculations but in outcomes tied to real-world utility and adoption at scale. Another response reflected on the evolving psychology of the market. According to this viewpoint, the opportunity to accumulate XRP with high conviction was more apparent in late 2024, when uncertainty was higher. At the current stage, the central question has shifted from whether price appreciation will occur to the magnitude of that appreciation and the ability of XRP holders to maintain positions through extended periods. Underlying Drivers Supporting the 2026 Projection Supporters of XRP’s long-term outlook often point to several structural drivers that could influence its valuation over time. Regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions continues to improve, reducing uncertainty for institutional participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the same time, XRP’s established role in cross-border payment infrastructure positions it as a tool for liquidity and settlement efficiency, particularly as financial institutions explore blockchain-based solutions. Further attention has been directed toward expanding use cases, including on-demand liquidity, tokenization initiatives, and potential integration within infrastructures in the financial market. As adoption moves beyond pilot programs and into sustained usage, proponents argue that valuation will increasingly reflect utility rather than speculation. Taken together, Amonyx’s assertion and the accompanying responses present a narrative centered on long-term conviction. The emphasis is not on rapid gains, but on disciplined belief in execution, adoption, and outcomes that may define XRP’s position by 2026.

Key findings: Bitcoin’s breakout to a two-month high has coincided with rising perpetual futures open interest and higher funding rates for several altcoins. Short-dated Bitcoin and Ether options have moved toward a neutral volatility skew after a prolonged bearish bias. Futures term structures for Bitcoin and Ether have clustered at similar levels, indicating consistent pricing of risk across maturities. The analysis finds that Bitcoin’s recent move into the upper $90,000 range, following more than a month of rangebound trading, has had a notable impact across futures and options markets. Open interest in perpetual futures has increased across major digital assets, signaling new long positions as traders position for potential continuation of the rally. Funding rates for select altcoins have also moved higher, reflecting improved risk appetite. Options markets are showing a parallel adjustment. Volatility smiles for short-dated Bitcoin and Ether options have shifted toward a neutral skew after previously pricing in a bearish put premium. Despite the sharp spot price move, implied volatility has remained relatively subdued, suggesting markets are recalibrating expectations rather than anticipating immediate turbulence. “Cryptos have braved past geopolitical shockers at the onset of 2026, appearing intent on catching up with other risk assets,” said Han Tan, Chief market analyst at Bybit Learn. “Recent gains bode well for our 2026 Bitcoin target of $150,000, though the road ahead will likely be marked by turbulence as geopolitical and U.S. monetary policy risks cloud the macro outlook.” Spot market dynamics continue to support prices. Year-to-date inflows into Bitcoin and Ether spot exchange-traded funds remain positive, reinforcing demand during the latest breakout. Ether has also benefited from on-chain factors, with roughly 30 percent of its circulating supply now staked, tightening available supply. The report highlights the $94,000 to $96,000 price region as a key trigger for sentiment changes in derivatives markets. A similar move earlier this month briefly pushed options skews to neutral before reversing when prices failed to hold. The latest breakout has again shifted positioning, though analysts note that a sustained move above these levels may be required for a more decisively bullish options skew to emerge.

This major transfer, recorded on the public ledger, immediately sparked intense analysis across financial and crypto sectors regarding its implications for institutional strategy and Ethereum’s market dynamics. Consequently, experts are scrutinizing the move for signals about long-term asset accumulation trends. Bitmine ETH Acquisition: Analyzing the $80.6M Transaction Blockchain data confirms the precise movement of 24,000 ETH from a wallet associated with FalconX to one controlled by Bitmine. At the time of the transfer, the Ethereum price hovered around $3,357 per token, establishing the total deal value. Lookonchain, a respected on-chain intelligence provider, first highlighted this transaction, drawing immediate attention to its scale. Furthermore, such transparent activity underscores the immutable nature of blockchain records, allowing for real-time market surveillance. Bitmine operates as a digital asset investment firm specializing in cryptocurrency treasury management and strategic acquisitions. FalconX, conversely, serves as a prime brokerage and trading platform tailored for institutional clients, facilitating large-volume transactions with minimal market impact. This partnership highlights a growing trend where specialized entities execute sizable transfers efficiently. Therefore, the deal reflects sophisticated institutional coordination rather than a simple market order. Transaction Volume: 24,000 ETH Approximate Value: $80.57 million USD Source: FalconX (institutional platform) Recipient: Bitmine (investment firm) Data Source: Lookonchain blockchain analytics Institutional Cryptocurrency Accumulation and Market Context This acquisition occurs within a broader context of increasing institutional participation in the digital asset space. Major corporations, hedge funds, and asset managers have progressively added Bitcoin and Ethereum to their balance sheets throughout recent years. Notably, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has enhanced its appeal for long-term holders seeking yield through staking. Simultaneously, regulatory developments continue to shape institutional entry strategies. The transaction likely represents a strategic allocation rather than short-term speculation. Institutional actors typically conduct thorough due diligence before committing capital of this magnitude. They assess factors like network security, developer activity, and future upgrade roadmaps. For instance, Ethereum’s ongoing development, including proto-danksharding for scalability, provides a fundamental thesis for investment. Accordingly, Bitmine’s move may signal confidence in these technological trajectories. Expert Analysis on Whale Activity and Market Impact Market analysts often monitor large transfers, known as “whale movements,” for potential price signals. However, a direct sale from one institutional entity to another differs meaningfully from a deposit to a centralized exchange. The latter often precedes a market sell order, while the former suggests a private, over-the-counter (OTC) deal. OTC trades help institutions avoid slippage and significant price disruption. Consequently, this specific transfer may not imply immediate selling pressure on the open market. Historical data reveals that sustained accumulation by known entities can contribute to reduced liquid supply, a potentially bullish fundamental indicator. When long-term holders withdraw assets from exchanges into cold storage, the available supply for trading diminishes. This dynamic can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Therefore, tracking the destination wallet’s future activity becomes crucial for understanding Bitmine’s intent, whether for staking, further allocation, or future deployment. Entity Role Notable Detail Bitmine Recipient / Investor Specializes in strategic crypto asset management. FalconX Source / Prime Broker Facilitates large institutional trades. Lookonchain Data Analyst Provided the initial transaction report. Ethereum Network Blockchain Platform Settled the transaction transparently. Understanding the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem Strategy Ethereum serves as the foundational layer for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps). Its native asset, ETH, functions as both a transactional currency and a staking asset securing the network. Institutional interest, therefore, often stems from a dual thesis: ETH as a store of value and as a productive, yield-generating asset. The ability to stake ETH and earn rewards provides a compelling cash-flow analogy for traditional finance models. Moreover, the regulatory landscape for Ethereum continues to evolve. Clarity regarding its classification as a commodity or security remains a pivotal issue for institutional adoption in various jurisdictions. Large-scale acquisitions by regulated entities like Bitmine can reflect a calculated assessment of this regulatory trajectory. They may indicate growing comfort with compliance frameworks and custody solutions. Thus, the transaction embodies both financial and operational confidence in the asset’s future. The Role of On-Chain Analytics in Modern Finance Platforms like Lookonchain have become indispensable tools for market participants and journalists. By parsing public blockchain data, they provide transparency into the movements of large holders, venture capital funds, and exchanges. This visibility creates a new paradigm for market analysis, moving beyond traditional chart patterns to include fundamental on-chain metrics. Metrics such as exchange flows, holder distribution, and staking participation rates now form a critical part of investment analysis. The identification of this specific transaction exemplifies this shift. Without on-chain analytics, such a significant transfer between two private entities might have remained obscured. Now, it becomes a public data point for the entire market to analyze. This transparency ultimately contributes to market efficiency and informed decision-making for all participants. However, it also requires nuanced interpretation to avoid misreading intent from raw data alone. Conclusion The reported Bitmine acquisition of 24,000 ETH from FalconX represents a substantial institutional vote of confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. Valued at over $80 million, this strategic transfer highlights the maturation of cryptocurrency markets, where sophisticated entities execute large-scale allocations through coordinated channels. While the immediate market impact may be neutral due to its likely OTC nature, the long-term implications for supply dynamics and institutional sentiment are significant. Ultimately, this Bitmine ETH acquisition underscores the growing intersection of traditional finance rigor with blockchain-native asset strategy, a trend poised to define the digital asset landscape moving forward. FAQs Q1: What was the exact value of the ETH acquired by Bitmine? The acquisition was valued at approximately $80.57 million, based on an Ethereum price of around $3,357 per token at the time of the 24,000 ETH transfer. Q2: How was this transaction discovered? Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain identified and reported the transaction by analyzing publicly available data on the Ethereum blockchain, tracing the movement from a FalconX-associated wallet to a Bitmine-controlled address. Q3: Does this mean Bitmine will sell the ETH soon? Not necessarily. The nature of the transfer, likely an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, suggests a strategic long-term allocation. Immediate selling would be unusual and counterproductive for such a large position, which may be intended for staking or long-term holding. Q4: What is FalconX’s role in this transaction? FalconX acted as the source or counterparty, providing the Ethereum from its institutional liquidity pools. The company operates as a prime brokerage and trading platform designed to facilitate large-volume cryptocurrency transactions for institutional clients without causing major market disruption. Q5: Why is this transaction important for the broader crypto market? It signals continued institutional capital inflow and sophisticated asset management within the cryptocurrency space. Large-scale acquisitions by registered investment firms like Bitmine contribute to legitimizing the asset class, potentially reducing circulating supply, and setting a precedent for other institutional actors.

Le i and former senior vice-president Dong Xue have fled overseas to evade investigation, according to sources close to the case. The legal action comes close to six years after Xunlei, a file-sharing and cloud services provider listed on Nasdaq, first dismissed Lei in April 2020 and reported him to the Shenzhen public security authorities. What is Xunlei accusing Chen Lei of? Court filings and company insiders claim that Lei had his hands in different schemes to steal funds from Xunlei between 2017 and 2020. Investigators have found an off-balance-sheet company, Shenzhen Xingronghe, a bandwidth supplier, that Lei used to transfer Xunlei’s assets through phony transactions. Investigators found that another two blockchain technology consultants from Hegang, Heilongjiang province , we re actually farmers in their sixties. Even more curious, they were Xu’s relatives, and she controlled the bank accounts that received their consulting fees. Lei and Xue reportedly have an “improper relationship,” and they put Xue’s friends and relatives from Hegang throughout Xunlei’s hierarchy. This network proved useful for Lei as he used it to create false contracts and fabricate transactions to embezzle company funds. Prosecutors claim Lei had his hands on millions of yuan that he routed into illegal crypto trading. Can Lei and Xue be prosecuted? Zhu Wei, an associate professor at China University of Political Science and Law, noted that senior managers possess sophisticated knowledge of corporate mechanisms and demonstrate high counter-investigation awareness. They often use side agreements, install trusted associates in critical positions, and leave minimal written evidence of wrongdoing. Lei’s departure from China in early 2020 has frustrated the investigation because Chinese public security organs lack extraterritorial law enforcement authority. This makes evidence collection and witness interviews difficult, and the case could be dismissed if prosecutors cannot prove that seemingly legitimate transactions concealed illegal activities. Before joining Xunlei in 2014 as chief technology officer, Lei held senior positions at Tencent, including general manager of Tencent Cloud Platform. He holds degrees from Tsinghua University and the University of Texas at Austin and previously worked at Google and Microsoft. Lei rose to the position of CEO in 2017, in what was seen as Xunlei’s pivot towards blockchain technology. How are Chinese tech companies tackling corruption? ByteDance dismissed 120 employees for rule violations in the third quarter of 2025. The company named 28 publicly and transferred 14 of the employees to judicial authorities for suspected criminal offenses, among other actions. Other major firms, like Bilibili, have announced similar crackdowns. Beijing’s Haidian District People’s Procuratorate released a document in mid-2025 handled between 2020 and 2024. The research found threads of highly covert methods, frequent internal-external collusion, “the prevalence of petty officials embezzling huge sums, and rent-seeking through platform soft power,” in the 1,253 commercial corruption cases it looked at among internet companies. The Haidian District People’s Procuratorate document also admitted the frustration involved in cracking these corruption cases. Some take years to uncover, with 25 cases requiring more than five years of investigation and three taking over a decade. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The world’s leading Ethereum treasury company said the transaction is expected to close on or about January 19, 2026. Bitmine’s $200M MrBeast Deal In its announcement, Bitmine said that its broader focus is on implementing digital asset strategies for institutional investors and public market participants. Thomas “Tom” Lee, Chairman of Bitmine, said MrBeast and Beast Industries represent the leading content creator and creator-driven platform of the current generation, while citing their reach and engagement across Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and millennial audiences. Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, also weighed in and stated, “We are excited to welcome Tom Lee and Bitmine as new investors in Beast Industries, joining our current top-tier venture investors. Their support is a strong validation of our vision, strategy, and growth trajectory, and it provides additional capital to achieve our goal to become the most impactful entertainment brand in the world. We look forward to exploring ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.” Last September, the analytics platform Lookonchain claimed that the YouTuber invested 705,821 ASTER, which was then valued at approximately $1.28 million. MrBeast, however, publicly denied the rumors. Insider Trading Allegations An on-chain investigation later linked MrBeast to more than 50 cryptocurrency wallets allegedly involved in insider trading activities. According to a report by advisory firm Loock.io back in 2024, investigators claimed that MrBeast and members of his influencer network promoted multiple crypto tokens on social media before selling holdings at significant profits, collectively estimated at over $23 million. Tokens cited in the report included SuperVerse (SUPER), Ethernity Chain (ERN), Polkamon (PMON), STAK, and AIOZ. SuperVerse alone allegedly generated more than $11 million in profits. The findings revealed that transaction patterns were traced through a publicly known Ethereum wallet previously used for NFT purchases, which helped analysts connect related wallets and track fund movements. Investigators pointed to instances where tokens were sold shortly after promotional activity, thereby raising questions about insider trading practices. However, control over individual wallets could not be definitively established. The report also detailed specific cases, including a PMON investment that reportedly turned $25,000 into $1.3 million and ERN token transfers that happened before large sell-offs.

Investment bank Benchmark characterizes this crypto bill markup delay as a constructive opportunity for legislative refinement. This development allows lawmakers to address complex issues like stablecoin revenue and tokenized securities with greater precision. Crypto Bill Markup Delay Creates Legislative Space The Senate Banking Committee initially scheduled the markup session for January 15. However, committee members postponed the proceedings to allow additional deliberation time. Benchmark analysts immediately recognized the strategic value of this postponement. Consequently, they published their constructive opportunity assessment within hours of the announcement. Markup sessions typically represent the final legislative stage before committee voting. During these sessions, lawmakers propose, debate, and vote on amendments. The crypto market structure bill addresses multiple regulatory gaps in digital asset oversight. Therefore, thorough preparation becomes essential for effective legislation. Historical context reveals similar legislative delays often produced stronger outcomes. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act underwent multiple postponements before passage. Each delay allowed for technical refinements that improved the final legislation. The current crypto bill markup delay follows this established legislative pattern. Benchmark’s Constructive Opportunity Analysis Benchmark’s financial analysts specialize in regulatory impact assessment. Their team includes former SEC officials and blockchain technology experts. This combination provides unique insight into legislative processes affecting digital assets. Their analysis emphasizes three key benefits from the postponement. First, additional time allows for narrowing fundamental disagreements. Stablecoin revenue distribution represents one contentious issue. Various stakeholders propose different models for revenue allocation between federal and state authorities. The delay enables more stakeholder consultations and compromise development. Second, clearer regulations for tokenized securities require careful drafting. Traditional securities laws often conflict with blockchain-based token characteristics. The extra time helps legislators create more precise definitions and compliance frameworks. Third, international regulatory alignment becomes more achievable. The European Union recently implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Asian jurisdictions have advanced their own digital asset frameworks. The delay allows U.S. lawmakers to consider these global developments. Expert Perspectives on Legislative Timing Financial regulation experts generally support measured legislative approaches. Dr. Eleanor Vance, former Federal Reserve economist, explains the importance of timing. “Rushed financial legislation often creates unintended consequences,” she notes. “The 2008 financial crisis response demonstrated both the necessity and challenges of rapid regulation.” Blockchain industry representatives express cautious optimism about the delay. Maya Rodriguez, CEO of Digital Asset Alliance, emphasizes collaboration opportunities. “This additional time enables more productive dialogue between regulators and innovators,” Rodriguez states. “We can address technical complexities that might otherwise create compliance obstacles.” The following table compares key provisions requiring additional deliberation: Provision Area Key Issues Potential Solutions Stablecoin Revenue Federal vs. state allocation, issuer requirements Tiered system based on stablecoin size Tokenized Securities Definition clarity, custody requirements Technology-neutral definitions Market Structure Exchange classification, investor protections Hybrid regulatory approach Stablecoin Revenue Regulation Complexities Stablecoin revenue distribution represents perhaps the most contentious issue. These digital assets maintain price stability by backing each token with reserves. Revenue generated from these reserves creates allocation challenges. Federal regulators seek oversight authority, while states emphasize their traditional financial regulatory roles. The delay allows examination of various revenue models. Potential approaches include: Percentage-based allocation: Fixed percentages distributed between federal and state authorities Tiered system: Different allocations based on stablecoin market capitalization Dedicated fund: Revenue directed toward specific financial innovation or consumer protection programs International precedents offer valuable guidance. The European approach centralizes oversight while allowing national implementation. Singapore’s model emphasizes coordination between monetary authority and financial regulators. U.S. lawmakers can analyze these systems during the extended timeline. Tokenized Securities Framework Development Tokenized securities represent traditional financial instruments recorded on blockchain networks. These digital assets combine characteristics of conventional securities with blockchain efficiency. Current U.S. securities regulations struggle with this hybrid nature. The Howey Test, established in 1946, provides limited guidance for blockchain applications. The postponement enables more precise definition development. Key considerations include: Technology-neutral regulatory language Custody requirements for digital assets Secondary market trading protocols Investor disclosure standards Market participants emphasize the importance of regulatory clarity. Clear rules reduce compliance uncertainty and encourage institutional participation. The additional deliberation time helps address these complex technical and legal questions. Historical Parallels in Financial Regulation Financial market history reveals patterns in regulatory development. The Securities Act of 1933 emerged from extensive congressional debate. Similarly, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 followed prolonged deliberation after accounting scandals. Each major financial regulation required careful balancing between innovation and protection. The current crypto bill markup delay continues this historical pattern. Digital assets represent unprecedented technological innovation. Therefore, regulatory frameworks must accommodate both current applications and future developments. The additional time supports this forward-looking approach. Market data indicates institutional interest in clearer regulations. A recent Digital Asset Institutional Survey shows 78% of respondents cite regulatory clarity as their primary concern. Furthermore, 65% indicate they would increase digital asset allocations with improved regulatory frameworks. Conclusion The crypto bill markup delay represents a strategic opportunity for legislative refinement. Benchmark’s constructive opportunity assessment highlights the potential benefits of additional deliberation time. Stablecoin revenue distribution and tokenized securities regulation require careful consideration. Historical parallels demonstrate how legislative delays often produce stronger outcomes. The extended timeline allows for stakeholder consultation and technical refinement. Consequently, the final legislation may better balance innovation and protection. This crypto bill markup delay could ultimately strengthen the regulatory foundation for digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: What is a markup session in legislative terms? A markup session is when a congressional committee debates, amends, and votes on proposed legislation before sending it to the full chamber for consideration. Q2: Why is stablecoin revenue distribution controversial? Stablecoin revenue distribution involves complex questions about federal versus state authority, with different stakeholders advocating for different allocation models based on their regulatory priorities. Q3: How do tokenized securities differ from traditional securities? Tokenized securities are traditional financial instruments recorded on blockchain networks, offering increased efficiency and transparency but creating regulatory challenges under existing securities laws. Q4: What is Benchmark’s expertise in cryptocurrency regulation? Benchmark employs financial analysts with backgrounds in regulatory agencies and blockchain technology, providing unique insight into how legislation affects digital asset markets. Q5: How might this delay affect cryptocurrency markets? While creating short-term uncertainty, the delay could produce clearer long-term regulations, potentially increasing institutional participation and market stability.

This analysis, initially highlighted by industry publication Cointelegraph, hinges on the recent breakout from a critical bearish formation and the emergence of a new bullish structure. Consequently, traders are closely monitoring these developments for confirmation of a sustained trend reversal. XRP Price Prediction: Decoding the Bullish Chart Patterns The primary driver of this optimistic XRP price prediction is a clear technical breakout observed on the daily chart. Specifically, the XRP/USD trading pair decisively broke above the upper boundary of a falling wedge pattern on January 1st, 2025. This pattern is significant because it typically forms during a downtrend and signals a potential reversal when the price breaks upward. Furthermore, the breakout was accompanied by a noticeable increase in trading volume, which technical analysts often cite as a key factor for validating such moves. Following this initial breakout, a secondary bullish pattern has developed on the shorter-term eight-hour chart. Market technicians have identified the formation of a bull flag, which is a continuation pattern that often appears after a strong price advance. The structure suggests a period of consolidation before a potential resumption of the prior uptrend. According to the analysis, a confirmed breakout above the $2.15 resistance level could trigger the measured move of this pattern, projecting a target near $2.8. Falling Wedge Breakout: A bullish reversal pattern completed on the daily chart on January 1st. Bull Flag Formation: A continuation pattern on the eight-hour chart indicating consolidation before a potential next leg up. Key Support: The $2.00 level is now viewed as crucial support that must hold for the bullish thesis to remain intact. Resistance Levels: Analysts are watching $2.15 for the bull flag breakout, with interim targets at $2.4 and $2.7. Contextualizing the Cryptocurrency Market Environment This technical analysis for XRP does not exist in a vacuum. The broader cryptocurrency market has shown signs of renewed institutional interest and regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions throughout late 2024. For instance, the approval of new financial products and clearer operational guidelines for crypto firms has provided a more stable foundation for asset evaluation. Moreover, XRP’s unique position, following its landmark legal clarity in the United States, continues to influence its market dynamics differently from other major digital assets. It is essential to understand that technical analysis examines past price action and volume to identify probabilities for future movement. While patterns like the falling wedge and bull flag have historical precedents, they are not guarantees. Therefore, market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and unforeseen industry news can rapidly alter any technical forecast. Seasoned traders typically use such analysis as one tool within a broader risk management strategy, rather than a standalone prediction. Expert Perspective on Risk and Validation Financial analysts emphasize the importance of confirmation when evaluating technical signals. A common framework involves waiting for the price to reclaim and hold above former resistance levels, which then turn into support. For the current XRP price prediction, the $2.00 zone acts as this critical juncture. A sustained move above this level, followed by a successful retest, would significantly strengthen the bullish argument. Conversely, a breakdown below this support could invalidate the short-term optimistic outlook and lead to a re-test of lower price levels. Historical volatility in the cryptocurrency sector also warrants caution. Assets like XRP can experience rapid price swings based on trading activity in leveraged derivatives markets or large wallet movements. Thus, while the chart patterns suggest a path to $2.8, the journey may be characterized by high volatility. Investors are advised to consider their risk tolerance and conduct their own research, potentially consulting multiple analytical sources before making financial decisions. Conclusion In summary, the current XRP price prediction pointing toward a $2.8 rally is grounded in the identification of two consecutive bullish technical patterns: a falling wedge breakout and a developing bull flag. These indicators, set against a backdrop of improving market structure, provide a data-driven case for cautious optimism. However, the trajectory remains contingent on the asset maintaining key support levels and achieving further breakout confirmations. As always in cryptocurrency markets, prudent analysis balances technical potential with an awareness of inherent volatility and external risk factors. FAQs Q1: What is the main technical reason for the $2.8 XRP price prediction? The prediction is primarily based on a confirmed breakout from a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, followed by the formation of a bull flag pattern on the eight-hour chart, which together project a price target near $2.8. Q2: What is a falling wedge pattern in technical analysis? A falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern characterized by converging downward-sloping trendlines. A breakout above the upper trendline, especially on high volume, suggests the prior downtrend is exhausting and a reversal to the upside is likely. Q3: How reliable are these chart patterns for predicting cryptocurrency prices? While historical patterns provide probabilistic insights, they are not foolproof. Their reliability increases with confirmation from volume, momentum indicators, and the price holding key support levels. They should be used in conjunction with other market analysis methods. Q4: What key price level must XRP hold for this bullish outlook to remain valid? Analysts identify the $2.00 level as critical support. A sustained drop below this point could weaken the bullish technical structure and potentially invalidate the short-term prediction for a move toward $2.8. Q5: Where did this analysis originate? The specific technical setup was initially reported and analyzed by the cryptocurrency news and analysis platform Cointelegraph, based on standard charting techniques observed in the XRP/USD trading pair.

The market sentiment is still cautious, even with the $0.50 target. Technical analysis reveals that without new driving forces, ADA could remain range-bound, making it less attractive to market participants. Another project that is gaining traction in the market is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . MUTM has managed to collect almost $19.8 million with over 18,800 unique buyers in presale. Cardano Price ADA has managed to defend a strong horizontal support level, making higher lows as it approaches a declining resistance line. A strong breakout above the line could lead to prices reaching $0.52-$0.55, but breaking down from the support level could lead to retesting lower levels. Although Cardano has a stable foundation, the potential for growth is relatively limited, especially when compared to Mutuum Finance, a new crypto in DeFi. MUTM Presale Momentum Paves the Way for Growth Mutuum Finance has shown remarkable early-stage traction since its presale started in 2025. The cost of the tokens in Phase 7 is $0.04, which is the cheapest entry possible. Phase 8 will include a 20% increase to $0.045. These increases will continue until public launch at $0.06. This makes now the best time to buy this new crypto for maximum gains. L2 Integration The cost of transacting on Ethereum mainnet can make it impractical to engage in DeFi as a small investor. This is addressed by Mutuum Finance, as it is primed for multi-chain expansion and layer-2 integration to make lending and borrowing cost-effective. For instance, an investor may want to deposit $1,000 ETH as collateral for a loan. Each transaction (deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw) could cost $25-$40 in gas fees on a busy day. This means up to $120 in fees, which makes it uneconomical for a small DeFi user. With L2 integration, the same user can deposit, borrow, repay, and adjust her position for under $5 total. This makes it more practical to engage with the platform and positions MUTM as the top crypto to invest in today. Mutuum Finance is also set to launch a stablecoin that will go hand in hand with yield-bearing collateral. Investors can borrow the stablecoin with assets like ETH and USDT as collateral. At a 70% LTV ratio, a borrower will be required to provide $10,000 as collateral for a $7000 loan. In addition, their collateral continues to earn yield in Mutuum Finance’s lending pools. Some of the interest accrued here can be used to repay the loan. Multi-Layered Security Framework Security is one of the founding principles of the development of MUTM. The project’s V1 lending and borrowing protocol has been thoroughly audited by Halborn Security ahead of testnet launch. Further security validation was provided through the Token Scan of the token itself by CertiK. This provided a security grade of 90/100. In addition, Mutuum Finance has unveiled a $50,000 bug bounty program. This is a means of encouraging outside developers to test the token for bugs before the testnet and mainnet launches. What Makes MUTM Special When considering the growth measured by Cardano, Mutuum Finance provides early exposure to the next big thing in DeFi with Phase 7 tokens at $0.04, Layer-2 optimization, and a sharp security focus. Mutuum Finance provides not only utility but asymmetrical growth opportunities with its well-organized presale and ever-expanding community. For those looking for the top crypto to invest in, MUTM provides an early opportunity.

Announced on January 15, 2025, as part of Wikipedia’s 25th-anniversary celebrations, these deals center on the foundation’s commercial arm, Wikimedia Enterprise, and represent a pivotal strategy for sustaining the world’s largest encyclopedia in an era dominated by AI. Consequently, this initiative ensures that the human-curated knowledge of Wikipedia remains a foundational pillar for the technology shaping our digital future. Wikimedia Enterprise: The Engine Behind Wikipedia’s AI Partnerships Developed and launched by the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise functions as a commercial API product designed for large-scale, high-volume reuse of content from Wikipedia and its sister projects. Fundamentally, it serves a dual purpose. First, it provides technology companies with reliable, structured, and fast access to verified factual data. Second, it creates a sustainable revenue stream for the non-profit foundation, which relies primarily on donations. Previously, the foundation had only publicly confirmed a partnership with Google, established in 2022. However, the new announcement reveals a broader ecosystem of commercial clients secured over the past year. The newly confirmed partners include: Amazon: Likely for enhancing Alexa’s knowledge base and AWS AI services. Meta: Potentially for AI assistants across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Microsoft: For bolstering Copilot, Bing, and other Azure AI offerings. Mistral AI: The European open-weight model competitor. Perplexity AI: The answer-engine startup that heavily cites sources. Additionally, the foundation noted ongoing relationships with other entities like the search engine Ecosia, and firms such as Pleias, ProRata, Nomic, and Reef Media. This diverse client list underscores the universal demand for Wikipedia’s trusted data. The Critical Need for a Structured Commercial Feed Before Wikimedia Enterprise, AI companies typically scraped Wikipedia’s public website, a process that could be inefficient, slow, and strain the site’s servers. The commercial product solves this by offering a dedicated pipeline. Importantly, it delivers content in a machine-readable format with clear licensing, volume tiers, and professional support. This structure is vital for companies building real-time applications that require immediate access to updated information, such as breaking news biographies or recent scientific discoveries. Therefore, Wikimedia Enterprise doesn’t just monetize access; it formalizes and improves it, creating a symbiotic relationship between the volunteer-edited project and the commercial tech sector. Sustaining Human Knowledge in the Age of AI The timing of these partnerships is profoundly significant. As large language models (LLMs) and AI assistants become ubiquitous, they increasingly rely on vast corpora of human-written text for training and real-time query answering. Wikipedia, with its rigorous sourcing policies and neutral point of view, represents a gold standard of reliable public data. Selena Deckelmann, Chief Product and Technology Officer at the Wikimedia Foundation, emphasized this point in a statement: “Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever.” This announcement directly addresses a central tension in modern AI: the dependence on human-created content. By establishing formal partnerships, the Foundation ensures that the value Wikipedia provides to the AI ecosystem is recognized and contributes to its own longevity. The revenue supports the immense technical infrastructure required to host a top-ten global website, which serves nearly 15 billion page views per month across over 300 languages. Furthermore, it funds the tools and resources used by the global community of volunteer editors who are the true engine of the project. Wikipedia’s Global Reach & Impact (2025 Data) Metric Statistic Monthly Page Views ~15 Billion Total Articles >65 Million Active Languages >300 Global Website Rank Top 10 Primary Funding Model Donations & Enterprise API A 25th Birthday Focused on the Future The partnership news anchored a suite of announcements celebrating Wikipedia’s 25th anniversary. The foundation launched a birthday campaign featuring a video docuseries highlighting volunteers worldwide. It also released an interactive “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule, narrated by founder Jimmy Wales, exploring the site’s history and future. A livestreamed birthday event on January 15th offered games and entertainment across Wikipedia’s social channels. Beyond celebration, the foundation highlighted its forward-looking investments. These include significant upgrades to its technical infrastructure to handle future growth, its own principled approach to integrating AI tools for editors, and experiments with new formats like games and short-form video to engage broader audiences. Collectively, these efforts paint a picture of an organization not resting on its legacy but actively evolving to maintain its relevance. The Broader Implications for the AI Industry This move by the Wikimedia Foundation sets a powerful precedent for other open-knowledge and content creators. It demonstrates a viable model for collaborating with the AI industry that acknowledges value exchange. For AI companies, partnering with Wikimedia Enterprise mitigates legal and ethical risks associated with unsanctioned data scraping. It provides a clear license for commercial use and ensures access to high-quality, consistently updated data. As regulatory scrutiny on AI training data intensifies globally, such formal agreements may become industry standards. Ultimately, this fosters a more transparent and sustainable ecosystem for developing AI technologies. Conclusion The Wikimedia Foundation’s announcement of major AI partnerships through Wikimedia Enterprise marks a transformative chapter for Wikipedia. By formally engaging with tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, the foundation has secured a crucial mechanism for sustainability while reinforcing the indispensable role of human-curated knowledge in the AI age. This strategic pivot ensures that the donations of millions of readers are complemented by support from the commercial entities that benefit most directly from Wikipedia’s data. As Selena Deckelmann affirmed, with the help of its global community, Wikipedia is poised to remain the essential hub for human-powered knowledge for the next 25 years and beyond. FAQs Q1: What is Wikimedia Enterprise? Wikimedia Enterprise is a commercial API product from the Wikimedia Foundation. It provides technology companies with high-volume, high-speed, and reliable access to structured data from Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects under clear licensing terms. Q2: Why do AI companies need to partner with Wikipedia? AI models and assistants require vast amounts of accurate, factual, and well-structured data for training and to answer user queries. Wikipedia is one of the largest and most trusted repositories of such human-curated knowledge, making it an invaluable resource. Formal partnerships ensure efficient, legal access. Q3: Does this mean Wikipedia is no longer free? No. Wikipedia remains completely free to read and edit for everyone. Wikimedia Enterprise is a separate service for large-scale commercial users who need guaranteed service levels, specific data formats, and high-volume access that goes beyond typical public use. Q4: How does this help sustain Wikipedia? The revenue generated from Wikimedia Enterprise partnerships provides a significant, diversified income stream for the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. This funding helps pay for the massive server infrastructure, software development, and editor support tools needed to keep Wikipedia online and growing, reducing reliance solely on donor campaigns. Q5: What other companies are using Wikimedia Enterprise? In addition to the newly announced partners (Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Perplexity), the foundation has previously announced partnerships with Google, Ecosia, Pleias, ProRata, Nomic, and Reef Media.

The rankings reflect search interest on the platform between December 1, 2025, and January 14, 2026. IREN’s prominence on social media and investor platforms appears to be tied to the booming Bitcoin mining industry and the expansion of its technological footprint. On Sunday, Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, first announced that the company is rolling out “Smart Cashtags” to allow for more accurate tagging of assets and smart contracts in posts. Bier had said the tags will act as shortcuts to real-time pricing and a feed of posts connected to the asset. He remarked, “X is the best source for financial news — and hundreds of billions of dollars are deployed based on things people read here. We are building Smart Cashtags that allow you to specify the exact asset (or smart contract) when posting a ticker.” The announcement landed, however, just one day after Crypto Twitter reacted angrily to a Bier post that appeared to hint at new restrictions on how much users could participate in threads. Bier says IREN and Tesla were the top tickers in the platform’s cashtag searches In a recent update, Bier showed that IREN ranked first in X cashtag searches from December 1, 2025, to January 14, 2026, followed by Tesla, AST SpaceMobile, and Bitcoin, respectively. Then, tickers for Ondas Holdings, XRP, GameStop Corporation, Nebius Corporation, Opendoor Technologies Inc., and Ethereum made up the rest of the list. Following the results, one user inquired whether cashtags are detrimental to the algorithm’s functioning. Some also grew more curious about the Bitcoin miner IREN, questioning its nature and workings. Another user also asked about the ranking of memecoin cashtags, while others shared their opinions on other altcoins that they thought deserved more attention. There were mentions of the tickers $ADA, $MON, $TON, and more. Meanwhile, others shared how Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Onds are making the list tracks, noting their extreme bullishness. Some were also surprised that Solana was not ranked among the top tickers. AB Kuai Dong says Musk may establish his own exchange or partner with other platforms When Bier first announced the Smart Cashtags feature, its timing drew attention in the cryptocurrency community. Previously, there was speculation that X would limit replies after one of Bier’s other posts. Pseudonymous crypto analyst KALEO was one of the critics of the X executive’s earlier post, stating that limiting the frequency of replies would harm community-led conversations. “Imagine telling streamers that they’re limited to how often they can reply to their chat,” KALEO argued on X that it would be similar to stopping creators from interacting with their communities. Nonetheless, Bier’s feature announcement elicited enthusiasm among community members. According to AB Kuai Dong, the post going viral led many to believe X might become a hub for stock and crypto trading via partnerships with Coinbase , Base, and legacy brokerages. He wrote that many English-speaking users expect the platform to partner with Coinbase and stock brokers, with X serving as the entry point and the partners providing trading infrastructure. He also suggested that Musk could choose to build a native exchange, noting that X Money has been under development for nearly a year. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-589-analyst-says-next-few-weeks-will-be-very-interesting-heres-why/,"XRP has once again drawn intense market attention as its recent price action signals renewed momentum. After a period of consolidation and minor pullbacks, buyers are stepping in aggressively, testing key resistance levels and driving volatility higher. Traders and investors are now watching closely, anticipating whether the token can sustain its momentum and trigger a significant breakout. Market commentary from pepa highlights a striking technical comparison between XRP’s price movements in 2016 and its current trajectory spanning 2025–2026. According to the analysis, XRP appears to be replaying the consolidation and breakout sequence that led to its historic rally from the 2016 lows to the 2018 highs, a cycle that produced gains of approximately 60,000% on a logarithmic scale. Based on this historical analogue, pepa suggests that XRP could theoretically reach $589 if similar market dynamics materialize. $XRP same 2016 playbook..? would be $589 anyways this is stunning price action rh.. next few weeks going to be very interesting.. gl everyone.. https://t.co/9NupI8FgCx pic.twitter.com/i9STF95s9V — pepa (@moonshilla) January 14, 2026 Recent Price Momentum XRP has already shown tangible bullish signals. On January 14, 2026, the token surged 6% to $2.17, breaking above critical resistance at $2.14 after retracing from a $2.36 peak earlier in the month. The rally coincided with heightened trading volume , indicating strong participation from retail and institutional investors. Analysts interpret this activity as confirmation that XRP is actively testing breakout thresholds, which could set the stage for further upward movement over the coming weeks. Historical Parallels Inform Current Analysis The 2016–2018 cycle provides a meaningful blueprint for evaluating XRP’s current technical structure. During that period, XRP consolidated at lower levels before entering a parabolic rally fueled by adoption growth and market sentiment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By comparing today’s consolidation patterns and logarithmic trend lines with historical movements, analysts like pepa suggest that XRP could follow a similar trajectory if momentum continues and key resistance zones are cleared. Market Outlook and Risk Factors While projections like $589 generate excitement, they remain highly speculative . XRP’s trajectory depends on multiple factors, including liquidity, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and competition from other digital assets. Traders must monitor short-term signals such as resistance breaks, volume spikes, and market participation to gauge whether the potential rally is sustainable. Why the Next Few Weeks Are Crucial With XRP testing pivotal price levels and chart patterns reminiscent of previous parabolic cycles, the upcoming weeks could determine the token’s near-term path. Analysts and traders are focusing on momentum confirmation and breakout execution. As pepa emphasized, the combination of historical parallels, strong trading activity, and critical technical thresholds makes this period particularly important for understanding XRP’s potential upside.

After more than a month of consolidation, BTC’s thrust into the upper-$90,000 range has lifted broader market appetite, pulling futures open interest and options positioning in a more constructive direction. Sideways trading that dominated the end of 2025 gave way to a sharp breakout this week, with Bitcoin briefly approaching $98,000 before settling slightly lower. According to data from CoinCodex, the crypto market leader has surged over 6% in the past 7 days. Following a slight drop in the past 24 hours, BTC trades at $95,884 at the time of writing. That move over the past week has brought the altcoin market higher and set off a noticeable reaction across both perpetual futures and options markets. Perpetual Futures Show Rising Risk Appetite Open interest in perpetual futures has climbed sharply, surpassing $8 billion across the nine major tokens tracked by Bybit and Block Scholes, according to the report . That marks a return to levels last observed during Bitcoin’s early-January rally to $94,000. The breakout in spot prices appears to be attracting new leveraged long positions as well, as reflected by a steep rise in the firms’ Risk-Appetite Index. Block Scholes BTC and ETH Risk Appetite Indexes (Source: Bybit) Funding rates for select altcoins have also moved higher, indicating fresh demand for long exposure. Ether and other major assets are seeing additional support from continued inflows into their respective spot ETFs, which remain positive year-to-date. Options Markets Shift From Bearish to Neutral Skew Options markets are undergoing their own sentiment reset. Short-dated Bitcoin and Ether volatility smiles, which were previously tilted toward a bearish put premium, have shifted toward a neutral skew. The adjustment mirrors the brief sentiment flip earlier in January when BTC touched $94,000, though that shift reversed as soon as the price failed to hold the level. This time, the analysts say the $94,000 to $96,000 region remains an important trigger. A sustained hold above this zone could push options skew more decisively in favor of calls. However, a fallback below the range may once again restore a preference for downside protection. BTCUSDT Put-Call Skew (Source: Bybit) Despite the size of the spot move, implied volatility has remained relatively subdued. Realized volatility has drifted near 38 percent, while short-tenor implied volatility sits close to its lower historical bounds, signaling markets are recalibrating rather than bracing for disruption. Spot ETF Inflows Reinforce Market Strength Spot flows continue to underpin market sentiment. Bitcoin spot ETFs have already recorded more than $660 million in net inflows year-to-date, including a $760 million haul on Jan. 13. This is a single-day level not seen since the Oct. 10 liquidation event. The report noted that Ether is experiencing a similar boost, supported by both ETF activity and strong on-chain fundamentals, with roughly 30 percent of the total supply now staked. “Cryptos have braved past geopolitical shockers at the onset of 2026, appearing intent on catching up with other risk assets,” said Bybit Learn Chief Market Analyst Han Tan in a statement. “Recent gains bode well for our 2026 Bitcoin target of $150,000, though the road ahead will likely be marked by turbulence as geopolitical and U.S. monetary policy risks cloud the macro outlook,” Tan added. Term Structures and Leverage Signal Confidence The report also notes that futures term structures for both Bitcoin and Ether have clustered around similar values across maturities, indicating consistent pricing of risk. Seven-day BTC futures are trading with a notable 10 percent premium to spot, underscoring strong demand for leveraged upside exposure. Still, history shows that derivatives behavior remains sensitive to Bitcoin’s ability to maintain key levels. When BTC failed to hold $94,000 earlier this month, volatility smiles quickly reverted to pricing a put premium, the analysts said. The same risk applies if the current breakout loses momentum. Outlook Hinges on BTC Holding the Upper-$90K Zone While early indicators point to improving sentiment, the market’s next phase hinges on whether Bitcoin can stay anchored in the upper-$90,000 range. A sustained hold could deepen the bullish shift across derivatives, while a breakdown may reset positioning back toward downside hedging.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-15 16:06:38

Estimates for Uniswap’s average price in 2028 range from $18.54 to $22.02. UNI’s average price in 2032 will be $43.46, with a maximum price of $45.20. Uniswap, a DeFi protocol founded in 2018 by former mechanical engineer Hayden Adams. The Uniswap exchange is a 100% on-chain automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The AMM allows DeFi users to swap ether (ETH) for any ERC-20 token without intermediaries, solving many liquidity problems most exchanges face. Uniswap’s unique features and utility make its token, UNI, attractive to traders and investors. Will UNI reach $100? How high can UNI go in five years? Let’s take a look at Uniswap’s technical analysis and price prediction to provide answers to these queries.

The altcoin lost 4.06% of its value. UNI coin has support around the $5.25 level. On January 15, 2026, Uniswap (UNI) price analysis reveals a bearish trend for the day. The altcoin’s price decreased to $5.49 over the past 24 hours, representing an overall loss of 4.06% after finding resistance at the $5.73 level. Conversely, immediate support for UNI is established at $5.25. The downward momentum indicates that selling pressure remains strong near the $5.5 psychological level, as the asset faced a rejection a little above that level. Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart for Uniswap confirms a downward trend in the market. The UNI/USD pair is hovering near the $5.49 level as the bearish trend continues. The bearish push has significantly decreased the price, as red candlesticks on the chart signify selling momentum. The distance between the Bollinger Bands highlights the intensity of volatility. This distance is slowly expanding, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $6.27, whereby its lower limit, indicating a breached support, has moved to $5.25. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending in the neutral region. The indicator’s value was recorded at 44 today. The downward curve on the RSI signifies a bearish trend, and more instability can be expected if the selling momentum intensifies and the indicator’s score decreases further. Uniswap price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour chart analysis of Uniswap also shows selling momentum, as the price is declining toward support channels. This is evidenced by its price correcting to $5.49 over the past four hours; it may decrease further in the coming hours if traders continue selling more. Moreover, increasing volatility signifies a higher chance of a reversal or higher price oscillation. The Bollinger Bands are covering comparatively more area, leading to increasing volatility levels. This high volatility signals greater market unpredictability. The upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $5.85, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $5.25, establishing the support point. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator’s value decreased to 44 over the past few hours, with its curve pointing downward; however, the indicator is still trending in the neutral region. This condition suggests selling pressure is rising around the current price level on the four-hour chart. Further depreciation in the coin’s value is possible if buyers fail to defend support lines in the next few hours.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is decreasing after a bearish trend observed over the current trading session. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might decrease to the $5.2 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $16.23 level by 2027 and above $45.20 by 2032. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing negative market sentiment today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding, and so is UNI. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2026? The maximum UNI can reach in 2026 is $10.43, while the average price is expected to be around $8.69. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.27 and $7.8; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2028, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2032. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $45.20 by the end of 2032, substantially higher than its current price.

X API Policy Overhaul Targets InfoFi Ecosystem X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, announced comprehensive API policy changes through Head of Product Nikita Bier. The platform explicitly prohibits so-called “InfoFi” applications—a portmanteau of “Information” and “Finance”—that provide financial incentives for user posts and engagement. Consequently, X has revoked API access for these applications immediately. This strategic decision represents the platform’s most aggressive move against spam and automated content manipulation since Elon Musk’s acquisition. The policy shift follows months of escalating concerns about artificial engagement distorting platform metrics and user experience. Platform executives have documented increasing volumes of low-quality content directly correlated with financial reward mechanisms. Industry analysts note this action aligns with broader platform governance trends toward authentic interaction. Major social networks have gradually restricted automated posting and engagement tools throughout 2024. However, X’s complete prohibition of financially incentivized posting establishes a new precedent for platform policy enforcement. The timing coincides with increased regulatory scrutiny of social media’s role in financial markets and information ecosystems globally. European Union Digital Services Act compliance requirements and United States Federal Trade Commission guidelines have both influenced platform policy development significantly. Immediate Market Impact and Cryptocurrency Reactions The announcement triggered immediate market reactions across the cryptocurrency sector. KAITO, a prominent project within the InfoFi ecosystem, experienced a price plunge exceeding 14% within hours of the policy announcement. Market data from CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap confirms this dramatic decline occurred during peak trading hours. Additionally, CookieDAO (COOKIE) declared it would terminate its “Snaps” service—a feature that measured and rewarded influencer impact using proprietary units. This service shutdown affects thousands of content creators who relied on Snaps for supplemental income. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reported unusual trading volumes across multiple InfoFi-associated tokens following the announcement. The broader decentralized social media sector experienced correlated declines, though less severe than KAITO’s specific collapse. Market analysts attribute this differential impact to varying degrees of platform dependency among projects. Some InfoFi applications maintained partial functionality through alternative data sources, while others faced complete operational cessation. The table below illustrates initial market reactions: Project/Token Price Change Service Status KAITO -14.3% API access revoked CookieDAO (COOKIE) -8.7% Snaps service termination announced Other InfoFi tokens -3% to -12% Varying impacts Cryptocurrency exchange representatives reported increased sell orders for InfoFi-related assets throughout the trading day. Some exchanges temporarily paused deposits and withdrawals for affected tokens due to volatility concerns. Meanwhile, blockchain developers began discussing migration strategies to alternative platforms with different API policies. Expert Analysis of Platform Strategy Shift Technology policy experts interpret X’s move as part of a strategic reorientation toward sustainable platform economics. Dr. Alicia Chen, professor of digital media at Stanford University, explains, “Platforms face constant tension between engagement growth and quality maintenance. Financial incentives for posting create perverse motivations that ultimately degrade user experience through spam and low-value content.” Her research on platform governance demonstrates that reward-based systems frequently generate short-term engagement spikes followed by long-term quality deterioration. Platform architecture specialists note that API policy represents a fundamental control point for social media ecosystems. By restricting how third-party applications access user data and platform features, X exercises greater control over user experience and monetization pathways. This control becomes increasingly important as platforms develop their own subscription services and advertising products. Historical precedent exists in Facebook’s 2015 API restrictions and Reddit’s 2023 API pricing changes—both aimed at controlling third-party access while developing first-party revenue streams. Technical Implementation and Developer Response X’s technical team implemented the API restrictions through authentication protocol changes and endpoint limitations. The platform updated its developer documentation to reflect prohibited use cases explicitly. Key restrictions include: Posting automation limits: Applications cannot automate posting for financial reward distribution Engagement tracking restrictions: APIs no longer provide granular engagement data for reward calculation User data access controls: Tighter permissions for applications accessing posting behavior patterns Rate limiting enhancements: Reduced API call allowances for applications with posting functionality Developer communities expressed mixed reactions to these changes. Some applauded the potential reduction in spam and automated content. Others criticized the restrictions as limiting innovation in social media monetization. Open-source projects began exploring decentralized alternatives that don’t rely on centralized platform APIs. The decentralized social media protocol Farcaster reported increased developer interest following X’s announcement. Similarly, Bluesky’s AT Protocol saw heightened activity in its developer forums. Affected application developers face significant technical challenges. Many InfoFi applications built their entire architecture around X’s API infrastructure. Migration to alternative data sources requires substantial engineering resources and platform redesign. Some developers have initiated legal consultations regarding API access revocation, though platform terms of service typically provide broad discretion over API access. The economic impact extends beyond cryptocurrency values to developer livelihoods and startup viability. Historical Context and Industry Evolution The InfoFi concept emerged during the 2021-2022 cryptocurrency bull market, combining social media engagement with decentralized finance mechanisms. Early implementations rewarded users for popular posts with cryptocurrency distributions. These systems gained traction among content creators seeking alternative monetization beyond traditional advertising and sponsorship. However, critics consistently warned about sustainability concerns and potential regulatory issues. Social media platforms have historically oscillated between open and restricted API policies. Twitter’s early embrace of third-party applications fueled its initial growth, creating beloved clients like Tweetbot and Twitterific. Subsequent API restrictions in 2012 and 2018 gradually narrowed third-party functionality, prioritizing first-party experience control. X’s current policy continues this trajectory while addressing specific concerns about financialized engagement. The broader industry context includes increasing regulatory attention to social media’s financial dimensions. Securities regulators have scrutinized token distributions tied to social media activity. Consumer protection agencies have examined whether reward systems constitute unregistered securities offerings. X’s policy shift may preempt regulatory action by voluntarily restricting these practices. Platform executives have emphasized user protection and experience quality in official communications, avoiding direct commentary on regulatory considerations. Long-Term Implications for Content Creators Content creators who incorporated InfoFi rewards into their income streams face immediate financial impacts. Many creators diversified across multiple platforms and revenue sources precisely to mitigate platform policy risks. However, some specialized creators focused exclusively on X-based reward systems. These creators must now adapt their strategies rapidly. Platform alternatives offer varying approaches to creator monetization. YouTube’s Partner Program, TikTok’s Creator Fund, and Instagram’s bonus programs provide established alternatives, though with different content requirements and revenue models. Decentralized platforms like Mastodon and Pixelfed offer different community dynamics without financial reward systems. Creator economy analysts recommend portfolio approaches to platform dependence, avoiding over-reliance on any single revenue stream. The psychological impact on creator communities includes both frustration and cautious optimism. Some creators welcome reduced spam and automated engagement, which they believe devalues authentic content. Others mourn lost income opportunities during economic uncertainty. Platform representatives have hinted at developing alternative monetization features, though without specific timelines or details. This development vacuum creates uncertainty for professional content creators planning their 2025 strategies. Conclusion X’s API policy overhaul represents a pivotal moment in social media platform governance, with its ban on InfoFi applications rewarding users for posts creating immediate market disruption and long-term strategic implications. The policy shift demonstrates platform prioritization of authentic engagement over financially incentivized content creation, affecting cryptocurrency valuations, developer ecosystems, and creator economies simultaneously. As platforms continue balancing openness with control, and innovation with user protection, these policy decisions will shape social media’s evolution throughout 2025 and beyond. The X API policy changes particularly highlight the tension between decentralized financial innovation and centralized platform governance in today’s digital landscape. FAQs Q1: What exactly are InfoFi applications that X has banned? InfoFi applications combine information sharing with financial incentives, specifically rewarding users with cryptocurrency or tokens for creating posts, generating engagement, or achieving other metrics on social media platforms. Q2: Why did X decide to ban these applications now? X cited spam reduction and user experience protection as primary motivations, aligning with broader platform efforts to combat automated content manipulation and maintain authentic interactions amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of social media’s financial dimensions. Q3: How have cryptocurrency markets reacted to this policy change? Markets reacted immediately, with KAITO plunging over 14% and other InfoFi-related tokens declining 3-12%. CookieDAO announced termination of its Snaps service, demonstrating the policy’s direct economic impact on specific projects. Q4: Can developers create alternative applications that bypass these restrictions? Developers face significant technical hurdles as X implemented authentication and endpoint restrictions at the API level. Some developers are exploring decentralized alternatives that don’t rely on centralized platform APIs. Q5: What does this mean for content creators who used these reward systems? Affected creators must adapt their monetization strategies, potentially diversifying across platforms or exploring alternative revenue streams. The policy change highlights the risks of over-reliance on any single platform’s ecosystem for income generation.

It remains unclear which force will ultimately dominate, and the most likely scenario is that this year is still a tug-of-war between accumulation and distribution. Breaking the Pattern, Not the Cycle Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) price has long been characterized by a four-year cycle tied to its supply halving schedule. Roughly every four years, the block rewards for miners are cut in half. Each halving historically sparked a powerful bull run, followed by a sharp crash and a prolonged bear market. In 2012 halving, Bitcoin ran from about $12 up to over $1,150 in late 2013 (the post-halving year), then dropped 85% in 2024. In 2016 halving, its price climbed from $650 to nearly $20,000 in 2017 (the post-halving year), followed by 80% collapse in 2018. In 2020 halving, Bitcoin rallied from $8,700 to $69,000 by late 2021 (the post-halving year), followed by a 75% drawdown in 2022. This boom-and-bust cycle became a roadmap for traders, and many viewed the post-halving year bull market top as almost a law to Bitcoin. However, the year 2025 (the post-halving year of 2024 cycle) did not follow the typical script. While the price peaked at $126,000 in October, the whole year ended with a negative annual return of -6%. This marked the first-ever down year in the post-halving year. Source: Simon Dixon X profile From the perspective of full-year performance in the post-halving year, the four-year cycle “law” appears to have been broken. Nonetheless, the broader cycle chronology still held. Bitcoin’s price peak did arrive in Q4 2025, roughly on schedule. Although there is no euphoria and blow-off top in 2025, Bitcoin topped exactly in roughly 18 months post-halving. From this point of view, the cycle theory is still alive despite the trajectory of the market being different from past cycles. In short, 2025 both broke and at the same time echoed the four-year cycle. It delivered a first-ever negative return in the post-halving year, yet still produced a late-2025 peak consistent with historical rhythm. 2026? The Cycle will Remain in a Moderate Form There are many strong arguments claiming that the four-year cycle is dead. The impact of halvings, cutting new coin issuance in half every four years, has diminished over time. By the 2024 halving, roughly 94% of all Bitcoin had already been mined, meaning the April 2024 event reduced Bitcoin’s annual supply inflation from about 1.7% to just 0.85%. At the same time, greater regulatory clarity and rising mainstream adoption have enabled more consistent capital inflows from institutional investors. Vehicles such as spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies now provide a persistent bid in the market, in contrast to the historically liquidity-driven, retail-fueled boom-and-bust cycles of prior eras. That said, we still think the four-year cycle narratives remain relevant. Bitcoin's value is driven largely by investor expectations (since it has no earnings or cash flows), making its price highly reflexive. The four-year cycle pattern played out reliably in all previous times, and Bitcoin peaked again in Q4 2025. Investors, especially those who have remained in the market across multiple cycles, have come to expect this rhythm. That very expectation can, in turn, influence investor behavior and reinforce the cycle itself. Bitcoin Top in Every Q4 of Post-halving Year Bitcoin 1-year+ holding wave reflect this dynamic. This metric refers to the proportion of Bitcoin supply that has not moved for at least one year. A declining 1-year+ holding wave suggests long-term holders are distribution coins. These long-term holders know the four-year cycle playbook, and started to distribute their coins in every post-halving year, i.e. 2017, 2021, and 2025. In the 2024 cycle, long-term holders started selling much earlier than prior cycles. We explain the reason for this shift in detail in the article. Whale’s Digital Asset View: Top Two at a Crossroad Long-term Holders Distributing Coin Long-term Bitcoin holders who have lived through multiple cycles most likely still believe in the four-year cycle and thus view 2026 as a traditional bear market year. In contrast, Bitcoin’s newer source of demand, capital from traditional finance, largely dismisses the cycle theory. They either view Bitcoin as a long-term hedge to money debasement or allocate a certain small percentage of portfolio (like 4%) to Bitcoin for diversification purposes. Both investment objectives focus more on long-term performance rather than short-term price fluctuation. Therefore institutional demand provides consistent bid in a market where long-term holders are distributing their coins to them. It remains unclear which force will ultimately dominate in 2026, and the most likely scenario is that this year is a battle year between the two forces. While the analysis above focuses primarily on supply-and-demand dynamics within the Bitcoin market, a broader macro perspective does not support the conditions typically associated with a bull year as well. A Complex Macro Backdrop Brings More Uncertainty Bitcoin price is highly sensitive to global liquidity conditions. Bitcoin moves in the direction of global liquidity 83% of the time in any given 12-month period, which is higher than any other major asset class, according to a study by Lyn Alden. Many sell-side predictions paint a rosy picture for 2026, arguing liquidity will greatly improve thanks to the U.S. Fed pivots from tightening to easing. However, in our view, major central banks are not gearing up for broad easing; at best, we only see pockets of tactical relief. In the United States, the Federal Reserve did end the quantitative tightening in December 2025 after shrinking its balance sheet from nearly $9 trillion to about $6.6 trillion. However, ending QT is far cry from starting new QE. The announced $40 billion monthly purchase of Treasury bills starting from December is only a technical operation to maintain an ample level of bank reserve in the financial system and prevent potential liquidity strains after years of quantitative tightening. Indeed, the U.S. entered an interest rate-cutting cycle which has brought the policy rate down to the mid-3% range, but the latest Fed interest rate projection suggests no return to near-zero rate in the foreseeable future. Short-term rates are widely expected to maintain around 3% given persistent inflation, with just one or two rate cuts anticipated in 2026. Source: BlackRock Long-term rate expectations suggest an even more restrictive environment. Most forecasts point to the U.S. long-term rate to stay flat, or even edging slightly higher in 2026, due to sticky inflation and resilient economic growth. In other words, the era of ultra-cheap money is over. Source: tradingeconomics Across the Atlantic, the picture is even less accommodating. Both the European Central Bank and Bank of England are still in quantitative tightening, and neither of them are planning to open the liquidity taps in 2026. At best, they may end further tightening by late 2026 according to some estimates. The situation in Japan is even more restrictive. The Bank of Japan has pivoted to a tightening bias after years of QE in 2025. In December 2025, BOJ raised its policy rate to 0.75%, the highest level in three decades. This tightening stance in Japan stopped an important source of global liquidity, triggering an unwinding of the yen-based carry trades that had funneled cheap Japanese money into global markets for years. Given the above, 2026 is to be a year of fragmented and tactical liquidity infusion. Any liquidity injection into the market is likely to be reactive, aiming to resolve any funding strains when emerge. Such tactical liquidity can give Bitcoin short-lived boost, but sustained upward momentum may be harder to maintain.

This strategic initiative, first reported by Bloomberg in late 2024, positions one of the world’s largest custodians at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. Consequently, the development underscores a growing consensus among major financial institutions about the transformative potential of blockchain technology. The bank specifically intends to develop cash-like instruments including tokenized deposits and stablecoins, alongside tokenized versions of money market funds (MMFs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). State Street’s Strategic Push into Tokenized Financial Products State Street’s announcement represents a calculated expansion beyond its core custody and asset management services. The bank manages over $4 trillion in assets and serves as custodian for nearly $44 trillion, giving its foray into tokenization immense weight. Tokenization refers to the process of converting rights to a real-world asset into a digital token on a blockchain. These tokenized financial products promise greater efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. For instance, a tokenized U.S. Treasury fund could settle in minutes instead of days. Moreover, this move aligns with broader industry trends where giants like BlackRock and JPMorgan are actively exploring similar blockchain applications. The bank’s deep expertise in regulatory compliance and institutional-grade security provides a significant trust advantage in this nascent field. The Product Suite: From Stablecoins to Tokenized ETFs State Street’s planned offerings target key areas of institutional demand. Firstly, tokenized deposits would function as digital representations of traditional bank deposits on a blockchain, enabling instant settlement for corporate clients. Secondly, the exploration of stablecoins indicates a desire to participate in the digital payments ecosystem with a regulated, bank-issued instrument. Thirdly, tokenizing money market funds (MMFs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could revolutionize fund management. This process would allow for fractional ownership, 24/7 trading, and automated compliance through smart contracts. The following table outlines the potential benefits of these tokenized products compared to their traditional counterparts: Product Type Traditional Model Tokenized Model (Potential) Settlement Time T+2 or longer Near-instant (T+0) Accessibility Often high minimums Enabled fractional ownership Operational Cost Higher manual reconciliation Lower via automation Transparency Periodic reporting Near-real-time audit trail The Driving Forces Behind Institutional Tokenization Several converging factors make this the pivotal moment for banks like State Street to embrace tokenization. Primarily, client demand from asset managers and hedge funds for digital asset infrastructure is surging. Additionally, regulatory clarity, particularly in jurisdictions like the European Union with its MiCA framework and evolving guidance in the United States, is creating a more navigable environment. Furthermore, the proven resilience of blockchain networks and advancements in private, permissioned ledgers have alleviated earlier concerns about security and scalability. A 2024 report by the Boston Consulting Group projected the tokenized asset market could reach $16 trillion by 2030. Therefore, State Street’s move is both a response to market forces and a strategic bid to capture a share of this future market. The bank’s initiative is not an isolated bet but part of a fundamental re-architecting of financial market infrastructure. Expert Analysis and Market Impact Financial technology analysts view State Street’s plans as a validation signal for the entire asset tokenization sector. “When a custodian of State Street’s stature builds, it’s not an experiment; it’s a roadmap for the industry,” noted a managing director at a fintech research firm. The impact will likely unfold in phases. Initially, tokenized products may serve a niche of sophisticated institutional clients. However, as the infrastructure matures, benefits like reduced counterparty risk and lower operational costs could trickle down to broader markets. Importantly, this development pressures other global custodians and asset servicers to accelerate their own digital asset strategies. It also fosters collaboration between traditional finance (TradFi) and the blockchain-native sector, as banks seek technology partnerships to deploy these solutions securely. Navigating the Regulatory and Technical Landscape The path to launching these products is complex, involving meticulous navigation of regulatory and technical hurdles. State Street must work closely with regulators like the SEC and the OCC to define the legal status of each tokenized instrument. For example, a bank-issued stablecoin would likely be treated as a novel form of electronic money transmission. Technically, the bank must choose or develop a blockchain platform that meets stringent requirements for: Security: Protection against cyber threats and fraud. Scalability: Handling high transaction volumes without congestion. Interoperability: Ability to interact with other financial networks and blockchains. Privacy: Ensuring transaction details are visible only to authorized parties. Partnerships will be crucial. State Street is already a member of consortiums like the Global Financial Markets Association’s digital asset working group, which shapes standards. The bank’s existing technology infrastructure for traditional assets provides a strong foundation, but integrating blockchain layers requires significant investment and expertise. Conclusion State Street’s plan to launch tokenized financial products marks a definitive moment in the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. This initiative goes beyond mere experimentation, representing a strategic commitment to modernizing the backbone of global capital markets. By focusing on institutional-grade products like tokenized deposits, stablecoins, MMFs, and ETFs, the bank is addressing clear demands for efficiency, transparency, and new functionality. The success of this venture will depend on regulatory collaboration, technical execution, and market adoption. Ultimately, State Street’s bold leap could accelerate the widespread institutional adoption of tokenization, reshaping how the world manages and invests assets. The move solidifies the bank’s position not just as a custodian of the past, but as a foundational architect of the future financial system. FAQs Q1: What are tokenized financial products? Tokenized financial products are digital representations of traditional assets, like funds or deposits, issued and recorded on a blockchain. Each token signifies ownership or a claim on the underlying asset, enabling faster settlement and programmable features. Q2: Why is State Street’s announcement significant? State Street is one of the world’s largest asset custodians. Its entry into tokenization lends immense credibility to the technology and signals to other major institutions that blockchain-based asset management is moving from pilot to production. Q3: How do tokenized deposits differ from stablecoins? Tokenized deposits are digital claims on a specific bank’s deposit liability, typically used for wholesale settlements between institutions. Stablecoins are often designed for broader payments and may be backed by a basket of assets, not just a single bank’s deposit. Q4: What are the main benefits of tokenizing an ETF or money market fund? Key benefits include potential 24/7 trading, fractional ownership allowing for smaller investments, automated compliance (via smart contracts), and a transparent, immutable record of ownership and transactions. Q5: When will State Street launch these tokenized products? The Bloomberg report did not specify a public launch timeline. Developing regulatory-compliant, institutionally secure tokenized products is complex. Analysts expect a phased rollout, potentially starting with pilot programs for select clients in 2025 or 2026.

The WEF Annual Meeting 2026 is scheduled for Jan. 19–23 in Davos-Klosters. Ripple Joins WEF Davos Tokenization Panel Garlinghouse is once again listed among the public speakers for a WEF session titled “Is Tokenization the Future?” set for Jan. 21 (10:15–11:00 CET). The panel also lists Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters, ECB Governor François Villeroy de Galhau, Eurazeo CEO Valérie Urbain, and moderator Karen Tso. The session framing is explicitly market-structure oriented, positioning tokenization as something moving beyond pilots and into mainstream financial rails. In the WEF description, organizers write: “Asset tokenization is accelerating quickly, moving from early experiments to full deployment across major asset classes. As adoption expands, it promises new ways for individuals to invest while presenting traditional firms and emerging innovators with complex new dynamics.” A separate thread of Ripple’s Davos presence may run through “USA House,” a privately organized venue that typically operates in parallel with the official WEF perimeter. Venue materials list Ripple among sponsors of USA House for Davos 2026. Hedera Brings EcoGuard Global To Davos Hedera, for its part, is leaning into Davos week as a convening calendar rather than a single stage appearance. In a statement via X, Hedera announced: “Hedera is proud to be an official sponsor of the USA House during the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, and will contribute to senior-level discussions on digital assets, AI, central banking, and G20 coordination.” Hedera is also sponsoring Global Blockchain Business Council’s “Blockchain Central Davos,” which runs Jan. 19–22 alongside the WEF meeting, according to Hedera and GBBC materials. Separately, a Hedera-built carbon-market initiative called EcoGuard Global is scheduled to officially launch in Davos on Jan. 20 at Turmhotel Victoria (3:00–6:00 PM), per EcoGuard’s announcement. The EcoGuard description pitches an end-to-end infrastructure play around integrity and lifecycle accounting: “EcoGuard Global is a full carbon lifecycle company building and operating digital infrastructure and managed marketplaces—while actively participating in carbon markets as a developer, investor, and market enabler for high-integrity climate projects… Built on the Hedera network by The Hashgraph Group, EcoGuard Global combines trusted digital infrastructure with market operations, capital, and partnerships to support credible, investable, and scalable carbon markets.” At press time, HBAR traded at $0.12134.",XRP|HBAR|Hedera|Hedera Hashgraph|Hedera news|ripple|ripple news|XRP news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|HBAR|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-15 17:00:51

As traditional financial markets increasingly explore blockchain-based infrastructure, statements from high-profile executives can significantly influence adoption narratives. The recent commentary has already stirred discussion within crypto communities, highlighting XRP’s evolving role beyond speculation. JackTheRippler shared insights from the CEO of Germany’s largest stock exchange, who described XRP as set to become the backbone of the emerging financial system . The executive emphasized that XRP’s utility extends far beyond trading, positioning it as a critical infrastructure asset for faster, more efficient, and highly transparent financial operations at scale. BREAKING: The largest stock exchange in Germany says that #XRP will be the backbone of the new financial system! He also says that XRP could hit $7-$9 pretty soon, and might even soar to over $100 once the system runs on XRPL! pic.twitter.com/JWbCwF9FYF — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) January 14, 2026 XRP’s Role as Financial Infrastructure The CEO highlighted XRP Ledger (XRPL) technology as a foundation for institutional financial systems. XRPL enables near-instant settlement and minimal transaction costs, features that address long-standing inefficiencies in cross-border payments and liquidity transfers. By framing XRP as an essential infrastructure tool, the executive reinforced the view that its adoption will be driven by practical utility and integration into financial operations rather than by speculative market cycles. Potential Price Trajectory The commentary included bullish projections for XRP’s valuation. The CEO suggested that XRP could reach $7–$9 in the near term as adoption of XRPL-based systems expands. Furthermore, he indicated that once financial systems fully leverage XRPL technology, XRP could theoretically surpass $100. While these figures are speculative, they reflect a growing institutional narrative: XRP’s long-term price may increasingly correlate with its functional use as a settlement asset rather than market hype alone. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community and Market Reactions The statements triggered excitement within the XRP Army, who have long championed XRP’s utility as a high-functioning digital asset. Analysts note that while ambitious, these projections underscore XRP’s transformative potential within traditional finance. Traders are now closely monitoring liquidity flows, institutional onboarding, and regulatory clarity as key indicators that will influence the token’s adoption curve and validate these projections. Adoption Context and Broader Significance XRP’s role as a settlement and liquidity solution has strengthened through partnerships with global financial institutions and participation in central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilots across multiple jurisdictions. These initiatives enhance the token’s credibility as a scalable solution capable of supporting large financial operations, aligning with the CEO’s remarks. The comments arrive at a pivotal time in 2026, as market observers gauge XRP’s potential transition from a high-volume trading asset to a foundational component of financial infrastructure. As XRP continues to integrate with institutional systems, the next few months will be critical for evaluating how rapidly adoption progresses and whether the ambitious valuation scenarios outlined by the German CEO could materialize.

This pivotal policy, enacted by proclamation on Wednesday, directly targets chips manufactured outside the U.S. that transit through American ports before export. Consequently, this action formalizes and adds a significant cost layer to the Commerce Department’s prior approval for Nvidia to ship the H200 to vetted Chinese entities starting in December. The tariff also encompasses comparable chips from rivals like AMD’s MI325X, marking a new chapter in the intricate geopolitics of technology. Decoding the Nvidia H200 Tariff Proclamation The executive proclamation, signed by President Donald Trump, establishes a clear but narrow tariff framework. Specifically, it applies a 25% duty on “advanced AI semiconductors” that meet two criteria: first, production occurs outside the United States, and second, the chips physically pass through U.S. territory en route to final customers in other nations. Importantly, this structure does not affect chips imported for domestic use in research, defense, or commercial applications within America. The policy document explicitly cites national security concerns, noting the U.S. manufactures only about 10% of its required chips, creating a dangerous reliance on foreign supply chains. Industry analysts immediately recognized the strategic nuance. “This isn’t a blanket ban,” explains Dr. Anya Chen, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic Tech Policy. “It’s a calibrated economic tool. The U.S. is allowing the sale of cutting-edge technology to strategic competitors but attaching a premium, thereby generating revenue and subtly discouraging over-reliance while fostering domestic production goals.” The proclamation follows months of speculation about potential semiconductor tariffs and aligns with broader efforts to reshore critical technology manufacturing. Nvidia’s Calculated Response Despite the new financial hurdle, Nvidia publicly endorsed the administration’s decision. A company spokesperson stated, “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high-paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.” This supportive stance underscores a critical reality: access, even at a higher cost, is preferable to an outright embargo. The H200 represents the next generation of AI accelerator, offering substantial performance gains over its predecessor, the H100, for training large language models and running complex inference workloads. The Complex Dynamics of AI Chip Demand in China Demand for these high-performance chips within China remains exceptionally robust. Reports indicate Nvidia was considering ramping up H200 production due to a surge of early orders from Chinese tech giants and AI firms. These companies are racing to develop and deploy generative AI services and require the most powerful hardware available globally. However, the 25% tariff introduces a new variable into their procurement calculus, potentially increasing project costs by millions of dollars for large-scale deployments. Simultaneously, the Chinese government is crafting its own regulatory response. According to reports from Nikkei Asia, Beijing is drafting rules to govern how many semiconductors Chinese companies can purchase from overseas suppliers. This represents a potential policy shift from previous adversarial stances toward foreign chip imports. China faces a dual challenge: it urgently seeks to avoid falling behind in the global AI race while simultaneously striving to build a self-sufficient domestic semiconductor industry. Allowing controlled imports of chips like the H200 could serve as a temporary bridge while domestic capabilities, such as those from Huawei’s Ascend series, continue to develop. Market Reality: Chinese AI firms need top-tier hardware now to remain competitive. Strategic Dilemma: Reliance on U.S. technology conflicts with long-term autonomy goals. Cost Factor: The new tariff directly impacts total cost of ownership and project ROI. Broader Impacts on the Global Semiconductor Landscape This policy extends beyond Nvidia and China, affecting the entire ecosystem. AMD’s comparable MI325X accelerator also falls under the new tariff rule, ensuring a level competitive field among U.S. chip designers. Furthermore, the decision signals to other nations the U.S.’s willingness to use trade policy as an instrument of tech competition. It may incentivize alternative supply chain routing, though options are limited for the most advanced nodes produced primarily in Taiwan and South Korea. The table below outlines the key chips affected and the policy’s core mechanism: Affected Chip Company Primary Use Tariff Condition Nvidia H200 Nvidia AI Training & Inference 25% if produced overseas and transits U.S. to China AMD MI325X AMD AI & High-Performance Computing 25% if produced overseas and transits U.S. to China For U.S. national security officials, the move addresses a perceived vulnerability. The proclamation text highlights the risk of foreign supply chain dependence, a concern amplified by the chip shortages of recent years. By creating a financial disincentive for the export of the most powerful AI chips, while still permitting controlled sales, the policy aims to walk a fine line between economic benefit and strategic restriction. The Long-Term Strategic Game Observers view this as one move in a prolonged, multi-dimensional contest. “The AI chip has become the new strategic commodity, akin to oil in the 20th century,” notes tech geopolitical analyst Mark Linton. “This tariff is less about revenue and more about setting terms of engagement. It maintains a technological lead by controlling the spigot of cutting-edge capability, forcing competitors to pay a premium for access during a critical phase of AI development.” The ultimate impact may accelerate China’s push for indigenous alternatives, but in the immediate 2-3 year horizon, Chinese firms will likely absorb the cost to maintain their competitive pace. Conclusion The imposition of a 25% tariff on Nvidia’s H200 and similar advanced AI chips bound for China represents a sophisticated pivot in U.S. tech trade policy. Rather than employing a blunt embargo, the strategy allows controlled commercial access while imposing a significant cost, aligning economic and national security objectives. For Nvidia, it provides a continued, though more expensive, pathway to a crucial market. For Chinese AI firms, it introduces new budgetary pressures but preserves vital access to frontier technology. As both the U.S. and China navigate the delicate balance between technological competition and economic interdependence, this policy on AI chip tariffs will serve as a key benchmark, influencing global semiconductor investment, supply chain logistics, and the pace of artificial intelligence innovation worldwide. FAQs Q1: What exactly is being taxed under the new U.S. policy? The policy imposes a 25% tariff on advanced AI semiconductors (like the Nvidia H200 and AMD MI325X) that are manufactured outside the United States and then physically shipped through U.S. ports before being exported to customers in other countries, primarily targeting China. Q2: Why is Nvidia supportive of a tariff on its own products? Nvidia views the tariff as a preferable alternative to a complete ban. The policy allows them to continue selling the H200 to vetted customers in China, maintaining revenue and market presence, whereas an embargo would cut off access entirely. Q3: How might Chinese companies respond to the increased cost? Chinese AI firms, facing intense competitive pressure, are likely to absorb the higher costs in the short term to secure the necessary hardware. Simultaneously, this will intensify efforts to develop and adopt competitive domestic AI chips from companies like Huawei. Q4: Does this tariff affect chips used within the United States? No. The proclamation explicitly excludes chips that are imported into the U.S. for domestic use in research, defense, or commercial applications. The tariff only applies to chips transiting the U.S. for re-export. Q5: What is the stated rationale for this tariff? The U.S. government cites economic and national security risks due to over-reliance on foreign semiconductor supply chains. The policy aims to generate revenue, encourage domestic manufacturing, and apply a cost control on the export of strategically sensitive technology.

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history by CoinGecko Algorand conducted its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 per token. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million, while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed the ALGO token. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. In 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January and $0.35 in February. It crossed into October, trading at $0.22. The coin later nosedived, and by December, it had dropped to $0.14. It remained at this level into January 2026.",Crypto Price Predictions|Algorand,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-15 17:13:50

Coinbase Pulls Support For CLARITY Act The crypto ecosystem is deeply divided over the crypto market structure bill, with Coinbase withdrawing support for the legislation. Prominent ecosystem figures have said that the market structure bill needs considerable work, while others believe some regulation is better than no regulation. Chris Dixon, Partner at a16z Crypto, spoke in favor of the bill, stating that it gives some clarity around rules, giving entrepreneurs a fair chance. “Crypto builders need clear rules of the road. Over the past five years, Republicans, Democrats, and the Trump Administration have worked closely with members across the crypto industry to protect decentralization, support developers, and give entrepreneurs a fair shot. ​At its core, this bill does that.” Dixon urged industry executives and Congress to move forward with the legislation if the US were to become a leader in crypto. “It’s not perfect, and changes are needed before it becomes law. But now is the time to move the CLARITY Act forward if we want the U.S. to remain the best place in the world to build the future of crypto.” However, Coinbase withdrew support for the bill after CEO Brian Armstrong stated that it had too many issues and he could not support it in its current form. “There are too many issues, including a defacto ban on tokenized equities, DeFi prohibitions, giving the government unlimited access to your financial records, and removing your right to privacy, erosion of the CFTC’s authority, stifling innovation, and making it subservient to the SEC, [and] draft amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins, allowing banks to ban their competition.” Visit the following links for more information on Husky Inu: Website: Husky Inu Official Website Twitter: Husky Inu Twitter Telegram: Husky Inu Telegram Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This decision strategically expands the exchange’s derivatives offerings, providing institutional and retail traders with new tools for exposure and risk management. Consequently, the announcement immediately influenced market sentiment and sparked analysis regarding Coinbase’s evolving role in the global digital asset ecosystem. Coinbase LIT Perpetual Futures: A Deep Dive into the Listing Coinbase’s listing of LIT perpetual futures represents a calculated expansion of its product suite. Perpetual futures, unlike traditional futures, lack an expiry date. Traders therefore maintain positions indefinitely, provided they fund the ongoing ‘funding rate’. This mechanism periodically exchanges payments between long and short positions to tether the contract price to the underlying spot market. Specifically, the LIT token, which powers a decentralized cloud computing network, now joins a select group of assets available for leveraged derivatives trading on a major U.S.-regulated platform. Market analysts immediately noted the timing. The crypto derivatives market has seen exponential growth, with perpetual contracts dominating volumes on global exchanges. By listing LIT perpetuals, Coinbase directly competes in this high-liquidity segment. Furthermore, the move signals confidence in the LIT project’s longevity and liquidity profile. Data from on-chain analytics firms shows a notable increase in LIT token holdings on Coinbase Custody in the weeks preceding the announcement, suggesting preparatory institutional activity. The Evolving Landscape of Crypto Derivatives Trading The introduction of LIT perpetual futures occurs within a rapidly maturing regulatory and financial landscape. In 2024, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) clarified guidelines for crypto derivatives offered by registered entities. Coinbase, operating under these frameworks, ensures its contracts comply with strict risk disclosure and market surveillance requirements. This regulatory adherence differentiates its offering from many offshore platforms, potentially attracting a more cautious investor base. Moreover, perpetual futures serve crucial market functions. They provide efficient price discovery, enhanced liquidity, and vital hedging capabilities for projects within the LIT ecosystem, like node operators and service purchasers. For instance, a developer committing LIT tokens for long-term network resources can now hedge against short-term price volatility. This utility underscores a shift from purely speculative instruments to foundational financial infrastructure for Web3 economies. Expert Analysis on Market Impact and Strategic Rationale Financial technology experts point to several strategic rationales behind Coinbase’s decision. Firstly, diversifying revenue streams beyond spot trading commissions is paramount for public exchanges. Derivatives typically generate consistent fee income from funding rates and trades. Secondly, capturing market share in derivatives strengthens Coinbase’s position as a full-service crypto prime broker. Maria Chen, a lead analyst at Digital Asset Research, stated, “This listing isn’t just about one token. It’s a test case for onboarding more complex DeFi-native assets into a regulated derivatives framework, a key challenge for the industry.” The potential impact on the LIT token itself is multifaceted. Historically, major exchange derivatives listings correlate with increased spot market liquidity and volatility in the short term. However, they also broaden the investor base, attracting sophisticated capital and algorithmic trading firms. A comparative table illustrates typical post-listing metrics for similar assets: Metric Typical 30-Day Change Post-Derivatives Listing Spot Trading Volume +40% to +120% Volatility (30-day annualized) Initial spike of +15%, then normalization Wallet Holdings (>10k tokens) Increase of 5-10% Funding Rate (Average) Varies with market bias; often ±0.01% Finally, this development reflects the ongoing institutionalization of crypto markets. Products like regulated perpetual futures are prerequisites for larger-scale adoption by hedge funds, family offices, and corporate treasuries. They demand familiar, compliant instruments for managing crypto exposure. Coinbase’s move directly addresses this demand, bridging decentralized project tokens with traditional financial market structures. Mechanics and Risks of Trading LIT Perpetuals Understanding the mechanics is crucial for potential traders. The core components of the LIT perpetual futures contract on Coinbase will include: Leverage: Expected to be offered at tiers (e.g., 3x, 5x, 10x), with higher leverage requiring more collateral. Funding Rate: Calculated every eight hours based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot LIT index price. Margin Requirements: Initial and maintenance margin rules will apply, with automated liquidation procedures to manage counterparty risk. Settlement: Settled in USD Coin (USDC), providing stability and clarity for profit and loss accounting. However, significant risks accompany these features. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses, potentially leading to rapid liquidation during volatile periods. The funding rate can also become a persistent cost for holding a position against the prevailing market trend. Importantly, while Coinbase provides a regulated venue, the underlying LIT token’s price remains subject to the volatility and project-specific news of its native blockchain ecosystem. Traders must conduct thorough due diligence beyond the derivatives instrument itself. Conclusion Coinbase’s listing of LIT perpetual futures marks a pivotal step in the integration of decentralized finance assets into mainstream, regulated trading venues. This development enhances market depth for the LIT token and provides traders with sophisticated tools for speculation and hedging. Furthermore, it exemplifies the broader trend of crypto exchanges evolving into comprehensive financial service providers. As the market digests this news, the performance and adoption of these LIT perpetual futures will offer valuable insights into the future trajectory of crypto derivatives and the maturation of the entire digital asset class. FAQs Q1: What are perpetual futures? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that mimic a traditional futures contract but do not have an expiry date. Traders can hold positions indefinitely by paying or receiving a periodic ‘funding rate’ that helps anchor the contract price to the underlying asset’s spot price. Q2: Why is Coinbase listing LIT perpetual futures significant? The listing is significant because it represents a major U.S.-regulated exchange expanding its derivatives offerings to include tokens from decentralized computing networks. It enhances LIT’s liquidity, provides institutional hedging tools, and signals growing maturity in crypto market infrastructure. Q3: How does the funding rate work in perpetual futures? The funding rate is a periodic payment exchanged between long and short position holders. If the rate is positive, longs pay shorts; if negative, shorts pay longs. This mechanism encourages traders to align the futures price with the spot index price. Q4: What are the primary risks of trading LIT perpetuals? Key risks include high leverage leading to swift liquidations, sustained negative funding rates eroding profits, and the inherent volatility of the underlying LIT token based on its network adoption and broader crypto market conditions. Q5: How does this affect the spot price of the LIT token? Historically, derivatives listings can increase short-term volatility and trading volume for the spot asset. They often attract new market participants and capital, which can influence price discovery. However, long-term spot price is ultimately driven by the fundamental utility and adoption of the LIT network.

Experts Compare Shiba Inu (SHIB) and This New Altcoin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-for-20x-upside-experts-compare-shiba-inu-shib-and-this-new-altcoin/,"One question continues to emerge when crypto investors consider the current prices of crypto, and it is what crypto should buy to gain significantly. Shiba Inu is one of the most spoken meme coins, and its massive following and extensive history are known to the majority of crypto investors. Nevertheless, new projects that have genuine protocol utility are also being cited by experts that can provide alternative forms of growth. With the crypto predictions moving at a rapid pace in the world, a comparison of a well-established token such as SHIB with a fresh altcoin will give an idea of the kind of crypto to invest in in the short and long run. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a popular cryptocurrency born of the meme coin movement. It was released in 2020 and has since created a huge ecosystem. It trades at approximately $0.000009 per token with a market cap of approximately $5.2B, which is in the range of the largest meme coins by market capital. The action of the price at SHIB indicates that it is resistant at the levels of about $0.000013-$0.000017 that is being observed by the traders as the potential upside points on the chart. These resistance areas are observed depending on the previous high and technical points such as pivot points. Protocol Overview of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new altcoin that generates interest among analysts as it is not only a token but also a protocol that is under development. Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending/borrowing application that will be launched on Sepolia testnet in early 2026 and then transferred to mainnet. The team has mentioned that V1 will consist of such essential features as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. MUTM began its presale in early 2025. Phase 1 had started at $0.01 and grew to $0.04 in the new phases, which represents an approximate 300% MUTM appreciation since the beginning. As of today, the presale has collected $19.8M and approximately 18,800 holders and 830M tokens sold out of a total supply of 4B. The pre-sale, or approximately 1.82B tokens, makes up about 45.5% of it. Security initiatives also contain the completion of a Halborn audit of V1 and a 90/100 CertiK token scan score. Bug bounty The team also has a $50,000 bug bounty on code vulnerabilities and a 24 hour leaderboard where the most active member community member is awarded $500 in MUTM daily. These measures will be aimed at instilling confidence before launching. MUTM vs SHIB: Weaknesses and Strengths The sheer size of the market capital and its huge supply levels prevent Shiba Inu in how high it can climb. Even when SHIB hits $0.00002 which some technical experts believe acts as a resistance level, it would be just a small gain compared to most of the smaller cryptos. In most of the price projections, SHIB would experience slow increases but increases that are mathematically limited unless they are aggressively burnt and new strong demand rejuvenates the price. In comparison, Mutuum Finance remains new and developing. Crypto investing analysts observe that new protocol tokens tend to experience outsize changes when their software is launched and starts attracting actual usage. Since MUTM is pegged on a lending protocol, it is likely to track fees, revenue potential, and adoption as opposed to mere community sentiment. Take an $800 investment per token as a potential scenario. Even robust actions in any crypto markets would provide single digit or low double digit returns with SHIB at current levels. Conversely, should Mutuum Finance successfully launch and liquidity opens and the company starts earning fees that can be used to finance buybacks, that same $800 would be worth considerably larger multiple returns. Some market commentators believe that the pre-sale entry by MUTM still has 20x or more to appreciate in case of usage and listing as per the expectations. V1 Launch and Why It Matters V1 launch is important to investor confidence. Mutuum Finance is yet to be launched. The release of the mainnet will move it out of the idea and into the working protocol, and the initial testnet performance will determine how larger markets perceive its technology. Analysts frequently note that the utilization of the protocol can change the narrative of a token from new crypto to crypto to invest in because of its fundamental reasons. After V1 is launched, is earning interest on assets lent, and causes the use of mtTokens, the revenue stream that finances MUTM buybacks is a reality. To crypto investors aiming to capitalize on the next big cryptocurrency trends, it is important to know the dynamics of memes and protocol Basics. Shiba Inu can have a cultural cache and community power. Nevertheless, analysts who have pitted it against new altcoins such as Mutuum Finance point to fundamentals execution and utility as a metric that may bias long term returns on those who have their question on which crypto to purchase today to generate long term returns.

Brazil’s regulatory authorities asked WhatsApp to suspend a new policy, which comes into effect on Thursday, 15 January, that stops third-party general-purpose chatbots from being offered on the platform through its business API. Italy has also been exempted from the ban after regulators in that country raised concerns over the new policy. WhatsApp is giving a 90-day grace period beginning Thursday, 15 January, to AI providers and developers, instructing them to stop responding to user queries on the chat app, as well as notify users that their chatbots will no longer work on WhatsApp. WhatsApp halts implementation of the policy in Brazil However, according to TechCrunch , WhatsApp’s parent company, Meta, has told developers that they do not need to notify users with Brazilian contacts with code +55 of any changes or stop offering their services as per a notice to AI providers. “The requirement to cease responding to user queries and implement pre-approved auto-reply language (mentioned below) before January 15, 2026, no longer applies when messaging people with a Brazil country code (+55),” reads the notice seen by TechCrunch. General-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok stand to be affected by the new policy on the WhatsApp platform. The policy does not prohibit businesses from providing customer service via bots within the platform to their customers. However, the Brazilian antitrust body CADE indicated that it will probe Meta’s terms and assess if they do not hinder competition and favour its Meta AI, which is offered on WhatsApp. On Monday, it revealed it had opened an investigation into the matter and that it would also suspend Meta’s WhatsApp Business tool’s new terms in the country while evaluating the case. CADE raised concerns that there were potential anti-competition practices in the new policy with regard to the access and offering by AI tool providers of their tech to WhatsApp users. This is not the first time that the social media giant has faced hurdles over its new policy. Meta has previously provided similar exemptions in Italy after the country’s regulatory authorities took issue with the new policy late last year. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the EU regulators also intensified their investigations of the social media giant’s use of AI in WhatsApp late last year, focusing mainly on the “Meta AI” system, which was launched earlier in March. Meta has, however, maintained that AI chatbots strain its systems, which were developed for different uses of its business API. According to TechCrunch, the firm has previously indicated that people who want to use different chatbots could do so outside its WhatsApp platform. “These claims are fundamentally flawed,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in response to CADE’s probe on Tuesday. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” said the spokesperson, further indicating that the route to market for AI firms should be the app stores themselves, websites, and industry partnerships, and “not the WhatsApp Business Platform.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Tech|Brazil|Meta|Whatsapp,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-15 17:33:26

Its price has risen by almost 40% over the last week, with some analysts arguing that the rally might be just starting. History to Repeat Itself? Earlier today (January 15), ICP climbed to $4.78, the highest point since the end of November 2025. In the following hours, it lost some steam and currently trades at around $4.30 (per CoinGecko’s data), a 9% increase on a daily scale. ICP Price, Source: CoinGecko Its solid performance has drawn analysts’ attention, with many of them claiming there is still fuel left for additional gains. X user The Crypto Professor found similarities between ICP’s recent uptick and the one witnessed two months ago. Back then, the price surpassed $9.50, leading the market observer to suggest a similar move could be ahead. It is important to note that the asset’s pump to almost $10 in November last year was short-lived, immediately followed by a significant downtrend. However, X user Alex (BCP) believes that ICP’s latest jump “feels much more organic,” and it seems not entirely led by hype. “Volume looks great – it’s not just hype and big accounts shilling ICP. It feels like real demand,” he opined. Other analysts who gave their two cents on the matter include FOUR|Crypto Spaces and Open4profit. The former claimed that ICP could experience huge volatility in the short term and eventually exceed $6. Open4profit argued the token has completed its accumulation phase and is now heading toward the supply zone around $5. “Once price is able to trade above the zone, upside movement will become dominant, and we could see a test of the $6.15 resistance area,” they projected. Keep an Eye on This Metric Contrary to the optimistic forecasts, ICP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that a short-term pullback is also a plausible option. As CryptoPotato reported on January 14, the metric surged well above 70, indicating that the price has increased too rapidly over a brief period and could be due for a correction. Today (January 15), the index rose to a fresh two-month peak of approximately 85, reinforcing the probability of a downward move. Conversely, traders view anything below 30 as a buying opportunity.

Meanwhile, the percentage line climbed in parallel, moving from the mid teens to just under 30%. The steepest gains appeared early in the series, when staked ETH accelerated into the high 20 millions and then crossed 30 million. After that, the curve flattened, with the total hovering in the low to mid 30 millions before resuming an upward trend toward the current peak. Recent readings show the staked balance consolidating around the mid 35 millions and then pushing higher again.

The British economy will do better in 2025 than initially anticipated, according to new statistics from Bloomberg Economics, with November’s results showing more momentum towards the end of the year. The anticipated 1.4% growth rate would be the nation’s best economic performance since 2022, when the country recovered from lockdowns brought on by the virus. Britain secures third place among wealthy nations Upon assuming office in 2024, Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged to propel Britain’s economic development to the top of the Group of Seven countries. The nation has suffered from slow growth, which has reduced household earnings and made budget planning difficult for the government. If Britain hits the 1.4% growth forecast, it would rank third among G-7 countries , trailing only the United States and Canada. This comes as Germany, the largest economy in Europe, managed just 0.2% growth last year, according to recent data. Britain appears likely to hold onto that third-place position through this year as well. The country now looks set to show modest growth in the final three months of the year, rather than the flat performance predicted by some analysts, including the Bank of England. Still, this won’t necessarily ease concerns within the Labour government about economic conditions, particularly given weak job market numbers and cautious consumer spending. After a solid start to 2025, growth tapered off in the latter half of the year. Economists polled by Bloomberg predict the expansion will slow further to 1.1% in 2026. These numbers remain below the growth levels Britain saw throughout most of the 2010s. Consumer spending hold s ke y to future growth Bloomberg Economics experts Ana Andrade and Dan Hanson emphasized the main economic uncertainties. “The key question is whether consumers are now more willing to spend,” they stated. Through the remainder of 2026, the duo anticipates quarterly growth of about 0.3%; however, they cautioned that this forecast may prove “too optimistic, particularly in the context of a cooling labor market.” The 0.3% GDP growth in November was more than predicted. But a large portion of the expansion resulted from industrial output recovering after Jaguar Land Rover’s operations were interrupted by a hack. These latest numbers leave questions about how strong the economy really is underneath. The boost from the Jaguar Land Rover situation will likely fade, and the impact of Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ budget remains unclear. Her budget package raised taxes by £26 billion. Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, offered his assessment of the situation. “While momentum clearly weakened in the second half of the year as households and businesses turned cautious amid worries over further tax increases, economic activity seems to have been less soft than surveys and anecdotes from businesses had indicated,” he said. The government now faces the challenge of maintaining growth momentum while dealing with a cautious consumer base and a softening labor market. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

57192235,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261952,1768499711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Citrea ctUSD Stablecoin Launch: A Revolutionary Bitcoin ZK-Rollup Breakthrough for DeFi Liquidity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/citrea-ctusd-stablecoin-bitcoin-launch/,"BitcoinWorld Citrea ctUSD Stablecoin Launch: A Revolutionary Bitcoin ZK-Rollup Breakthrough for DeFi Liquidity In a significant development for decentralized finance, Citrea, a pioneering Bitcoin zero-knowledge rollup project, has officially launched its dollar-pegged stablecoin, ctUSD, marking a potential turning point for Bitcoin-based financial ecosystems. According to a CoinDesk report on March 15, 2025, this new digital asset represents a sophisticated approach to cryptocurrency stability, backed 1:1 by short-term U.S. Treasury bills and cash reserves. Issued through the established infrastructure of MoonPay, ctUSD aims to establish itself as the primary liquidity standard within the expanding Citrea network, potentially addressing long-standing challenges in Bitcoin’s DeFi landscape. Citrea ctUSD Stablecoin: Technical Architecture and Backing Mechanism The Citrea ctUSD stablecoin introduces a novel reserve structure to the cryptocurrency market. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that rely on complex smart contracts or overcollateralized models common in decentralized finance, ctUSD maintains direct 1:1 backing with highly liquid, low-risk assets. Specifically, the stablecoin’s reserves consist of short-term U.S. Treasury bills and cash equivalents held in regulated custodial accounts. This approach mirrors traditional money market funds while operating within a blockchain environment. Consequently, users can theoretically redeem ctUSD tokens for their equivalent dollar value at any time, assuming proper reserve management and transparency protocols remain in place. MoonPay, the issuance partner for ctUSD, brings established regulatory compliance and payment infrastructure to the project. The company has developed extensive know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks through its existing fiat-to-crypto services. Therefore, ctUSD enters the market with institutional-grade compliance measures already integrated. This foundation potentially positions the stablecoin for broader adoption beyond cryptocurrency-native users, possibly appealing to traditional finance participants exploring blockchain applications. The Bitcoin Zero-Knowledge Rollup Context Citrea operates as a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup on the Bitcoin blockchain, a technical approach that has gained substantial traction since 2023. ZK-rollups process transactions off the main Bitcoin chain while periodically submitting cryptographic proofs (validity proofs) to the base layer. This method significantly enhances transaction throughput and reduces costs while maintaining Bitcoin’s security guarantees. The launch of ctUSD specifically addresses the liquidity needs within this scaling solution. Historically, Bitcoin’s Layer 2 ecosystems have struggled with fragmented liquidity pools and reliance on cross-chain bridges from other networks. Citrea’s native stablecoin potentially creates a unified medium of exchange and store of value specifically optimized for its ZK-rollup environment. Comparative Analysis with Existing Stablecoin Models The stablecoin market has evolved through several distinct models since Tether’s initial launch in 2014. Understanding ctUSD’s position requires examining these existing frameworks. Stablecoin Model Primary Backing Key Examples Citrea ctUSD Position Fiat-Collateralized Bank deposits, cash equivalents USDC, USDT, BUSD Similar backing with Treasury focus Commodity-Collateralized Precious metals, real estate PAXG (gold) Different asset class approach Crypto-Collateralized Overcollateralized cryptocurrencies DAI, LUSD Non-crypto collateral alternative Algorithmic Smart contract mechanisms Previous: UST, FRAX (partial) Explicitly avoids algorithmic model Citrea’s ctUSD most closely resembles fiat-collateralized stablecoins like USDC and USDT in its reserve composition. However, several distinguishing factors emerge upon closer examination. First, the explicit focus on short-term U.S. Treasury bills potentially offers yield generation for reserve holders while maintaining high liquidity. Second, the integration with a specific blockchain scaling solution (Bitcoin ZK-rollup) creates a vertically aligned ecosystem rather than a general-purpose stablecoin. Third, the partnership with MoonPay suggests a different user acquisition and compliance strategy compared to purely decentralized or exchange-issued stablecoins. Potential Impacts on Bitcoin DeFi and Broader Cryptocurrency Markets The introduction of a natively issued stablecoin within a Bitcoin ZK-rollup could catalyze several developments in decentralized finance. Historically, Ethereum has dominated DeFi activity due to its smart contract capabilities and established stablecoin ecosystems. Bitcoin, while possessing the largest market capitalization, has seen limited DeFi adoption beyond wrapped Bitcoin tokens on other chains. Citrea’s approach potentially changes this dynamic by providing: Native liquidity: Reduced reliance on cross-chain bridges for stable assets Yield generation opportunities: Treasury-backed reserves may enable interest-bearing mechanisms Enhanced composability: Better integration with other Citrea-based DeFi applications Regulatory clarity: Transparent, auditable reserves with traditional asset backing Market analysts observe that successful implementation could attract developers to build more sophisticated financial applications directly on Bitcoin scaling solutions. This development might gradually shift the DeFi landscape from its current Ethereum-centric model toward a more multi-chain environment where Bitcoin scaling solutions compete directly with alternative Layer 1 blockchains. Furthermore, the Treasury bill backing could appeal to institutional participants seeking cryptocurrency exposure with familiar reserve assets, potentially bridging traditional finance and decentralized systems more effectively. Expert Perspectives on Reserve Management and Transparency Financial technology experts emphasize that reserve management represents the critical success factor for any fiat-backed stablecoin. The 2022 collapses of several algorithmic stablecoins and the temporary depegging events affecting even major fiat-collateralized stablecoins have made transparency non-negotiable for market participants. Citrea and MoonPay will likely need to implement several standard practices to maintain trust: Regular third-party audits of Treasury bill and cash reserves Real-time or frequent attestations of reserve composition Clear redemption policies and procedures for ctUSD holders Geographic diversification of custodians to mitigate jurisdictional risks Industry observers note that the choice of short-term Treasury bills (typically maturing in one year or less) provides relative stability compared to longer-dated bonds, which carry greater interest rate sensitivity. However, this conservative approach may also limit yield potential compared to more aggressive reserve strategies. The balance between safety and return will likely influence ctUSD’s competitiveness against other stablecoins that may pursue different reserve management approaches. Implementation Timeline and Ecosystem Integration Roadmap The launch of ctUSD represents the beginning of a broader integration process within the Citrea ecosystem. Based on typical blockchain project development cycles, several implementation phases will likely follow the initial issuance: Initial liquidity provisioning: Establishing baseline liquidity pools for ctUSD trading pairs DeFi protocol integration: Connecting ctUSD to lending, borrowing, and trading applications on Citrea Cross-chain interoperability: Developing secure bridges to other blockchain networks Institutional access channels: Creating compliant pathways for traditional finance participation Governance mechanisms: Potentially implementing decentralized decision-making for reserve policies Successful execution of this roadmap could position ctUSD as more than just a payment token within a single ecosystem. Instead, it might evolve into a benchmark stablecoin for Bitcoin-based financial applications, similar to how USDC has become a standard across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains. The partnership with MoonPay provides existing distribution channels, but widespread adoption will ultimately depend on technical reliability, consistent regulatory compliance, and demonstrated utility within practical applications. Conclusion The Citrea ctUSD stablecoin launch represents a sophisticated convergence of traditional finance principles and blockchain innovation. By combining Bitcoin’s security through zero-knowledge rollup technology with U.S. Treasury-backed reserves and MoonPay’s compliance infrastructure, this project addresses multiple challenges simultaneously: scalability limitations, stablecoin reliability concerns, and regulatory uncertainty. While the long-term success of ctUSD will depend on execution, transparency, and market adoption, its introduction marks a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s evolution beyond a store of value toward a more comprehensive financial ecosystem. As decentralized finance continues maturing in 2025, the Citrea ctUSD stablecoin provides a compelling case study for how blockchain projects might bridge the gap between cryptocurrency innovation and traditional financial stability. FAQs Q1: What exactly is Citrea ctUSD? Citrea ctUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin launched on March 15, 2025, operating within the Citrea Bitcoin zero-knowledge rollup ecosystem. It maintains 1:1 backing with short-term U.S. Treasury bills and cash reserves, issued through MoonPay’s infrastructure. Q2: How does ctUSD differ from USDC or USDT? While all three are fiat-collateralized stablecoins, ctUSD specifically operates natively on a Bitcoin ZK-rollup rather than primarily on Ethereum or other chains. Its reserves focus explicitly on short-term Treasury bills, and it’s designed as the native liquidity standard for a specific blockchain scaling solution rather than as a general-purpose stablecoin. Q3: What are the benefits of using a Bitcoin ZK-rollup for stablecoin issuance? Bitcoin ZK-rollups provide enhanced security by periodically validating transactions on Bitcoin’s base layer, benefit from Bitcoin’s network effects and decentralization, and enable faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining compatibility with the world’s most established cryptocurrency network. Q4: How can users verify ctUSD’s reserve backing? Users should look for regular third-party audit reports and reserve attestations published by Citrea and MoonPay. These documents typically detail the composition, value, and custody arrangements for the Treasury bills and cash backing the stablecoin. Q5: What potential risks might affect ctUSD’s stability? Potential risks include Treasury bill market volatility (though minimal for short-term instruments), custodial failure, regulatory changes affecting stablecoin classification, technical vulnerabilities in the Citrea rollup or smart contracts, and adoption challenges within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Q6: Can ctUSD be used outside the Citrea ecosystem? Initially designed for the Citrea ecosystem, ctUSD may become available on other networks through cross-chain bridges. However, its primary utility and integration are optimized for applications built on the Citrea Bitcoin ZK-rollup, where it serves as the designated liquidity standard.

The senator argues that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was not an isolated accident but an early signal of what happens when crypto-linked activity collides with an already fragile banking system. The warning draws heavily on findings from a 292-page investigation released last September by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. How Crypto-Era Bank Runs Slipped Past Regulators Until It Was Too Late, Senator Warns In the opinion piece on Fox News, Senator Richard Blumenthal examined the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, all of which had received clean audits shortly before collapsing. In racing to finish the crypto industry’s wish list, Congress should remember the lesson of Silicon Valley Bank—tech money comes fast but disappears even faster, leaving taxpayers & investors on the hook for bailouts & losses. https://t.co/oasospVEm1 — Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) January 15, 2026 The senator noted that those audits masked growing risks tied to fast-moving deposits, opaque exposures, and a business model increasingly influenced by crypto and venture capital flows that arrive quickly and leave even faster. In the senator’s telling, Silicon Valley Bank’s downfall followed a familiar pattern. During the boom years of cheap money, the bank attracted massive deposits from tech startups and venture-backed firms, including companies linked to the crypto sector. When conditions reversed after interest rates rose and major crypto firms like FTX collapsed , confidence evaporated. Panic spread rapidly through digital channels, and withdrawals accelerated at historic speed. Regulators ultimately stepped in to prevent wider contagion, committing up to $340 billion in emergency support. Even so, more than $54 billion in equity and bond value was wiped out. The senator has pointed to Signature Bank as a clearer example of crypto-linked risk. Signature had actively courted digital asset firms and built a large base of crypto-related deposits. After the FTX collapse in late 2022, those deposits flowed out en masse. Auditors repeatedly reassured the public that risks were under control, only for the bank to be shut down months later. For the senator, this failure illustrates how crypto’s complexity and lack of transparency can overwhelm traditional oversight before regulators can react. Notably, concern also extends to stablecoins, which the senator describes as “digital dollars” being marketed as alternatives to bank deposits. With the stablecoin market valued around $300 billion and projections suggesting it could quadruple by 2030, he warns that losses could be far larger if safeguards are not imposed. Circle-issued digital dollar USDC processed $18.3 trillion worth of transactions, leading the stablecoin transaction boom that totalled $33 trillion in 2025. #StablecoinTransaction #CircleUSDC #USDT https://t.co/8qYgLMVfmX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 9, 2026 Since the GENIUS Act passed last summer , several major stablecoins have temporarily lost their pegs, erasing hundreds of millions of dollars in value. How Crypto-Era Bank Runs Slipped Past Regulators Until It Was Too Late Crypto industry figures strongly dispute that framing, as market commentators and executives argue that blaming crypto for Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse rewrites well-documented facts. Shame on you @SenBlumenthal . Blaming crypto for the SVB and Signature collapses is either ignorant or willfully dishonest. Those banks ""failed"" because of massive interest-rate risk, duration mismatches, and bad balance-sheet management – not Bitcoin, not Ethereum, not… — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) January 15, 2026 They point to SVB’s core failure as a textbook case of interest rate mismanagement. The bank invested heavily in long-term U.S. Treasuries when rates were low and failed to hedge that exposure. When rates rose sharply, losses were locked in with more than 90% of deposits being uninsured and concentrated among a tightly connected tech community, making a run almost inevitable once confidence cracked. Silvergate Bank, critics note, presents a different case, as its collapse was directly tied to crypto market volatility and the loss of trust after FTX failed. Deposits fell by 68% in a single quarter, forcing the bank to sell assets at a $718 million loss and ultimately liquidate. Even there, defenders of crypto argue that concentration risk and poor balance sheet resilience were decisive, with crypto acting as a catalyst rather than the underlying cause. They also reject the idea that “digital-speed” runs are unique to crypto. Bank runs have occurred for centuries without smartphones or blockchains. Technology accelerated the process, they say, but did not create the vulnerability.

57192350,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261951,1768500011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Soars: BTC Achieves Stunning $97,000 Milestone in Major Market Rally",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-soars-97000-milestone/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Soars: BTC Achieves Stunning $97,000 Milestone in Major Market Rally In a significant development for global digital asset markets, Bitcoin (BTC) has surged past the $97,000 threshold, trading at $97,034.91 on the Binance USDT market as of March 2025. This price movement represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, capturing the attention of investors and analysts worldwide. The ascent above this key psychological level follows a period of sustained accumulation and shifting macroeconomic sentiment. Bitcoin Price Breaks Through a Critical Resistance Level Market data from multiple exchanges confirms Bitcoin’s decisive break above $97,000. This price action is not an isolated event. Consequently, it reflects a confluence of technical and fundamental factors. The rally demonstrates strong buying pressure across major trading platforms. For instance, Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken all reported elevated volumes during the ascent. Historically, breaking such round-number barriers has often preceded extended bullish phases, though past performance never guarantees future results. Several key metrics underscore the strength of this move. The 24-hour trading volume for BTC pairs has spiked by approximately 35%. Furthermore, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has reached a multi-month high. This indicates renewed institutional and retail participation. Market depth on the sell-side above $97,000 appears thin, suggesting limited immediate resistance. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Multiple converging narratives are fueling Bitcoin’s impressive performance. Firstly, evolving regulatory clarity in major economies has provided a more stable framework for institutional adoption. Secondly, recent macroeconomic data suggesting a potential shift in monetary policy has increased demand for non-correlated assets. Traditional safe-haven assets have shown volatility, prompting portfolio diversification. On-chain data provides further evidence of a strong foundation. The number of Bitcoin addresses holding 1 BTC or more continues to climb, signaling long-term holder conviction. Additionally, the percentage of the total BTC supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains near all-time highs. This metric, often called “HODLer” behavior, reduces available selling pressure. Institutional Inflows: Spot Bitcoin ETF products have seen consistent net inflows for several consecutive weeks. Macro Hedge: Investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a digital hedge against currency debasement. Network Fundamentals: The Bitcoin hash rate, a measure of network security, continues to set new records. Expert Perspectives on the Current Market Cycle Financial analysts point to the disciplined nature of this rally. Unlike previous cycles driven primarily by retail speculation, current inflows show a more measured pace. Market strategists from firms like Fidelity and Grayscale have published reports highlighting Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class. They note the growing correlation between macroeconomic announcements and Bitcoin’s price action, a sign of integration into broader financial markets. Technical analysts are watching several key levels. The $95,000 zone, now turned support, is critical for maintaining bullish momentum. The next significant resistance cluster is identified in the $100,000 to $102,000 range, a major psychological and technical barrier. Chart patterns observed in the lead-up to this breakout resembled historical accumulation phases seen before major advances. Historical Context and Market Impact of the Surge Bitcoin’s journey to $97,000 must be viewed within its historical context. The asset has experienced several boom-and-bust cycles since its inception. Each cycle has seen higher lows and, eventually, higher highs, painting a long-term upward trajectory. The current price places Bitcoin’s market capitalization well over $1.9 trillion, solidifying its position as a major global financial asset. The impact extends beyond Bitcoin itself. The broader cryptocurrency market, often led by BTC’s price action, has experienced a positive ripple effect. Major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have posted gains, though typically with higher volatility. This phenomenon, known as the “altcoin season” indicator, is being closely monitored. Capital rotation within the crypto ecosystem often follows significant Bitcoin milestones. Recent Bitcoin Price Milestones (2024-2025) Price Level Approximate Date Key Catalyst $60,000 Q4 2024 Spot ETF Approval Momentum $75,000 Q1 2025 Institutional Allocation Reports $97,000 March 2025 Macro Policy Shifts & Sustained Demand Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $97,000 marks a crucial chapter in the evolution of digital currencies. This achievement reflects a complex interplay of technological adoption, macroeconomic forces, and shifting investor sentiment. The Bitcoin price movement demonstrates the asset’s growing resilience and its embedded role in the future of finance. While market volatility remains a constant, this milestone provides a clear data point in the ongoing narrative of cryptocurrency’s integration into the global economic system. Observers will now watch how the market consolidates this gain and whether it can build a foundation for the next leg of its journey. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason Bitcoin price rose above $97,000? The rally is attributed to a combination of sustained institutional investment through ETFs, favorable shifts in macroeconomic expectations, and strong on-chain metrics showing long-term holder accumulation, reducing available supply. Q2: How does the current Bitcoin rally compare to previous ones? Analysts note this rally appears more institutionally driven and methodical compared to previous retail-fueled cycles. The price ascent has been accompanied by record network security (hash rate) and strong fundamentals, not just speculation. Q3: What does breaking $97,000 mean for the average investor? It signifies a major psychological and technical barrier has been overcome, which can influence market sentiment. However, investors should always base decisions on personal financial goals and risk tolerance, not just price milestones, as volatility persists. Q4: Could the Bitcoin price fall back below $97,000? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Retesting previous resistance levels, now turned support, is a common technical behavior. The key for bullish sentiment will be whether the $95,000 zone holds as support. Q5: What is the next major target for Bitcoin after $97,000? Market technicians widely identify the $100,000 level as the next significant psychological and technical hurdle. A sustained break above that could open the path toward the next resistance cluster around $102,000.

Related Reading: XRP Price Is Approaching A Key Decision Zone, But Structure Is Still Firmly Bullish While trading volumes across several markets have climbed, the token has struggled to maintain levels above key support zones, reflecting a growing gap between investor activity and price performance. Data from multiple exchanges shows that interest in XRP remains strong, particularly in regions such as Australia, where it recently overtook Bitcoin as the most traded digital asset on BTC Markets. However, this surge in trading has not translated into sustained upward price momentum. XRP's price records sideways price action on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP Trading Volume Rises as Investor Behavior Shifts According to BTC Markets’ 2025 Investor Study Report, XRP surpassed Bitcoin in trading activity for the first time in four years. The exchange cited strong community engagement and its role as a Ripple On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partner as key drivers behind the shift. Despite Bitcoin recording a 70% price increase in 2025 and reaching a new all-time high, Australian traders increasingly focused on XRP during the financial year. XRP itself saw notable price movements, reaching $3.34 in January 2025 and peaking near $3.66 by July before falling roughly 50% to around $1.80 by year-end. The report also projected a maturing investor base. Average trade sizes rose by 25%, daily trading volumes increased by 17%, and participation expanded among older investors, women, and self-managed super funds. This suggests that crypto activity is becoming more structured rather than purely speculative. Price Pullback Follows Brief Rally While trading activity has remained elevated, XRP’s price has struggled to hold recent gains. After briefly trading near the $2.20 level, the token slipped below $2.10, posting a daily decline of over 2%. Analysts attribute the pullback to regulatory uncertainty, whale distribution, and reduced optimism following delays to U.S. crypto market structure legislation. Market observers note that XRP is currently consolidating between $2.00 and $2.15, with $2.08 acting as a key support zone. Technical indicators indicate that the token is trading above its 50-day moving average but below its 200-day average, suggesting mixed momentum in the short term. Some analysts view the current phase as a period of consolidation rather than a full-fledged trend reversal. However, resistance near $2.20 remains a hurdle for any renewed upside. Institutional Signals and Long-Term Outlook Ripple has continued to position itself in the institutional market, recently highlighting its prime brokerage arm, Ripple Prime, on its homepage. The company also secured an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license in Luxembourg, allowing it to expand regulated payment services across the European Union under MiCA rules. Following the licensing news, XRP briefly climbed to around $2.14, supported by a 74% jump in trading volume. Even so, the price has yet to establish a stable breakout above higher resistance levels.

Algoz has established itself as one of the leading quantitative crypto investment technology firms, specialising in the development of proprietary, fully-automated and systematic trading strategies for digital assets. The firm boasts a team of engineers and data scientists with more than eight years of experience in crypto and over 20 years in quant trading. The company is on a mission to streamline access to automated trading in the digital asset space, whilst delivering exceptional returns for investors with pre-defined risk. The making of the AiQP Meta Fund Created in partnership with the Singapore-regulated Wealth Management Alliance, the AiQP Meta Fund is an institutional-grade version of Algoz’s original and highly successful AiQP strategy. The AiQP Strategy is one of Algoz’s flagship products launched in 2023, which over the years has established atrack record of consistent returns with low drawdowns for investors. The strategy combines data-driven strategies rooted in statistical rigor with advanced risk mitigation solutions and secure fund management, aiming to generate consistently strong yields from trading in crypto’s perpetual futures markets. According to the announcement, the AiQP Meta Fund also features a dedicated fund manager and is backed by regular audits as it remains fully compliant with Singapore’s financial regulations. Commenting on the announcement, Algoz Chief Executive Officer Tal Teperberg highlighted the crucial role of WMA in the new partnership: ”A number of traditional finance, family offices, and fund of funds within South-East Asia told us that they didn’t have a mandate for an SMA and were not able to access our key products,” he said. “We searched for the ideal partner in the region, and we’re thrilled that WMA can provide us with both the right vehicle and the expertise in the operational and risk management of digital assets.” Algoz’s rapid growth and dedication to protecting investors’ assets According to Teperberg, Algoz, which has seen its assets under management surpass $200 million, can attribute its success to the performance of its Segregated Managed Account (SMA) portfolio and SAAS solutions. AiQP Meta Fund will leverage Algoz’s award-winning Quant Pro product, which significantly mitigates counterparty risk whilst providing complete transparency and near real-time liquidity. The product has already proven very attractive to investors, according to Teperberg. Algoz’s layered risk management strategy is backed by thousands of data points accumulated through years of successful trading. According to the firm, the Algoz Quant Pro’s ability to enable trading against the collateral value of investor holdings without taking control of the underlying assets sets a new standard for secure, non-custodial trading and quantitative risk management. Steve Knabl, Managing Partner at Wealth Management Alliance, said his firm has been monitoring the progress of Algoz for the last three years, noting the quant firm’s “very impressive” effort it has made in order to protect investors’ assets. “As a Singapore-regulated entity, we can add an extra layer of protection for Algoz’s clients and ensure that, between us, we deliver an outstanding service. We are also pleased to have the services of Julien Guerrend as Portfolio & Risk Manager. Julien also brings a strong track record in the digital asset space,” said Knabl. Prospects for success Stephen Wundke, Strategy and Revenue Director at Algoz, believes that the firm’s battle-tested strategy will help the new fund succeed as it targets “well-aware and sophisticated crypto investors, who reside in the SEA region. “With WMA, we believe we have created a promising investment vehicle for companies and high-net-worth individuals to be able to take advantage of this nascent asset class and the wealth creation opportunities it provides. I am very proud of what we have created together,” said Wundke.

57192373,https://timestabloid.com/?p=95077,1768500045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ethereum (ETH) or GeeFi (GEE): Why Analysts Say $GEE Latest Update Can Start Its 100x Rally,https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-eth-or-geefi-gee-why-analysts-say-gee-latest-update/,"As Ethereum trades strong around $3,316.98 and reaches a new milestone with nearly 30% of its supply staked, it’s clear the market has long-term confidence in core crypto infrastructure. While this solidifies the position of established giants, it also means the opportunity for exponential gains has passed for many. This is why astute investors are looking for the next wave of high-utility projects. GeeFi is emerging as a leader in this category, offering a ground-floor investment opportunity that has already attracted over $2.6 million in its presale. GeeFi is developing a comprehensive financial application focused on security, user experience, and real-world utility. As its presale enters the final stage of Phase 3, GeeFi presents a powerful and timely investment case. A Decentralized Wallet Built for You Security remains a primary concern for crypto users, and GeeFi addresses this head-on. The project’s latest wallet update introduces enhanced encryption and advanced privacy controls, ensuring users maintain complete sovereignty over their digital assets. By operating on a decentralized framework, GeeFi eliminates the single point of failure common in centralized systems. This commitment to security builds a foundation of trust, making it the ideal platform for both new and experienced users to manage their portfolios confidently. Last Call: Phase 3 Presale Nears Completion The window to invest in GeeFi at its current price is closing. The presale is structured in phases, with the price of the $GEE token increasing at each new stage. With 90% of the allocated tokens for Phase 3 already sold , the opportunity to buy in at this level is nearly over. The high demand is a strong testament to investor confidence in GeeFi’s vision. To maximize returns, acting now is crucial to secure a position before the price increases. Calculating the Powerful Return on Investment The investment potential of GeeFi is clear and substantial. In the current presale phase, the $GEE token is available for just $0.10 . The confirmed listing price for its public exchange debut is $0.40 , which guarantees early investors a 300% gain , a 4x return, from the moment of launch. The long-term growth prospects are even more impressive. Market analysts project the $GEE token will climb to $3.00 or higher once its full ecosystem is operational. An investment of $1,000 today would secure 10,000 $GEE tokens. At the projected $3.00 price, that initial capital would grow to $30,000 , highlighting the significant wealth-building opportunity GeeFi offers. Multiply Your Gains with Bonuses and Passive Income GeeFi is building an ecosystem that rewards its community. A recently announced bonus program for early investors, shared on the X platform , is designed to add even more value for those who support the project in its early stages. Beyond bonuses, GeeFi offers robust passive income streams. Users can stake their $GEE tokens to earn a steady yield, creating a consistent return on their holdings. The platform also features a 5% referral system , directly rewarding users for bringing new members into the GeeFi community. These features encourage long-term commitment and foster organic network growth. Beyond Storage: A Full Financial Hub GeeFi is much more than a simple wallet. The capital raised is being used to accelerate the development of a native Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and GeeFi-branded Crypto Cards. These additions will transform the application into an all-in-one financial tool. The DEX will allow for seamless token swaps, while the Crypto Cards will bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday commerce, driving sustained, real-world demand for the $GEE token. Conclusion While established assets like Ethereum demonstrate market strength, the most significant growth opportunities are found in innovative projects like GeeFi. With its strong focus on security, a nearly sold-out presale phase, and a clear roadmap, GeeFi is a premier investment. The current $0.10 price is an entry point that is quickly disappearing.

At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.1419, down 4.20% over the last 24 hours. DOGE’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex) The cryptocurrency currently trades near a critical resistance point that could determine its direction for the coming weeks. The digital asset has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on its chart. This technical formation typically signals a potential reversal from bearish to bullish momentum. The pattern shows a bottom at $0.117 with two shoulders positioned above $0.138. The ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now faces its most significant test at the $0.152 neckline. A decisive break above this level could trigger substantial upward movement. Technical Pattern Points to Potential Rally The pattern has developed over several weeks with clear symmetry between the left and right shoulders. The right shoulder emerged quickly from below $0.13. Trading volume increased during this move, suggesting genuine buyer interest rather than a temporary spike. Previous resistance levels have flipped to support, which often indicates strengthening bullish sentiment. Technical projections based on the pattern suggest a target range between $0.178 and $0.186. This represents a potential gain of approximately 22% from current levels. The price action mirrors consolidation phases seen during previous Dogecoin rallies. These periods of tight compression have historically preceded significant breakouts. Volume profiles show accumulation patterns similar to those observed before past upward moves. Critical Price Levels Define Next Move The $0.152 level represents more than just a technical marker. It serves as the final major barrier before a potential surge toward higher price targets. A daily close above this threshold would validate the bullish pattern. High-volume confirmation would strengthen the breakout signal and attract additional market participants. Conversely, rejection at this level could send the cryptocurrency lower. Failure to breach resistance may result in a pullback toward $0.138. A more severe decline could test the $0.117 support level, potentially invalidating the entire formation. The consolidation under $0.152 has lasted several days. This extended period of sideways movement has allowed the market to digest recent gains and build energy for the next directional move. Trading volume will be crucial in determining the outcome. A breakout accompanied by strong volume typically has a higher probability of success than one occurring on thin trading activity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-15 18:02:32

57192602,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=895898,1768500303,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57192602.jpeg,"Bitcoin breaks above $97,000 as crypto kicks off first major rally of 2026",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-lead-first-major-rally/,"Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing the first major rally of 2026. Bitcoin reached a high of over $97,000, and Ethereum edged close to $3,400 on Wednesday afternoon. Some analysts predict this is part of a larger bullish trend. Cryptocurrency markets appear to be coming out of hibernation as Bitcoin and key altcoins reach price levels not seen in over a month. Ethereum rallied 5% over the last 24 hours, reaching a high of over $3,380 for the first time in the new year. Solana also saw some substantial gains, peaking at $148 Wednesday afternoon after hitting a low of $133 on January 8 th . Certain experts believe this rally is here to stay after Bitcoin broke well above the $95,000 resistance level that has plagued the cryptocurrency over the last few months. Around $700 million of short positions were liquidated in light of this breakout, with many investors now eyeing a $100,000 target for BTC in the near future. This rally has created some much-needed optimism amongst cryptocurrency investors after a weak Q4 in 2025. Key variables driving this rally The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report shows that inflation is starting to cool down, boosting expectations of additional rate cuts in 2026. Core CPI is down to 2.6% from 2.7%, with monthly CPI for both headline and core at 0.3%. This type of data has historically been positive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, which was likely why it was one of the main catalysts for this rally. Crypto ETF inflows remain positive as well, with Coinglass reporting $1.2 billion was added to all cryptocurrency ETFs in the last 5 trading days. This shows that institutional sentiment is leaning toward accumulation, a good sign for markets. Binance also attributed short-term momentum in crypto markets yesterday to positive regulatory sentiment tied to progress with the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (CLARITY Act). Some goals of this bill are to “clarify the regulatory split between the SEC and CFTC, place most non-security digital assets under CFTC oversight, and reduce uncertainty around token issuance and secondary market trading.” The Senate Banking Committee published a draft of the bill yesterday with a markup vote scheduled later this week. Why markets have since slowed down and what to expect next The crypto community was torn over the first draft of the bill, with some prominent industry leaders expressing support and others expressing disdain. The markup vote was inevitably canceled upon Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong publicly withdrawing his support for the bill in its current form. He stated it has “too many issues,” including calls for government access to DeFi users’ financial records, a ban on tokenized equities, “erosion of the CFTC’s authority,” and more. Despite this, Armstrong stated he is still optimistic that with continued effort, the proper outcome with this bill can be achieved. This news has since caused markets to stall, as additional time will now be required to amend the bill. Going forward, progress on the CLARITY Act, further news on rate cuts, and additional U.S. inflation and labor market data can all be seen as short-term catalysts that could generate another rally. The Fear & Greed Index is currently sitting at 54 (neutral), up from the low 20s (fear) in mid-December 2025.

While many focus on short-term price action, its long-term potential lies in enabling financial infrastructure that makes payments faster, cheaper, and programmable, unlocking entirely new economic behaviors. X FINANCE BULL shared a video featuring former Ripple CTO David Schwartz , who emphasizes the existential implications of XRP. Schwartz draws parallels between historical infrastructure revolutions—like the shipping container for global trade and TCP/IP for information—and what he calls the “shipping container of money.” He argues that XRP and the XRP Ledger could fulfill this role, drastically reducing transaction friction and costs while creating opportunities for applications and behaviors that today remain unimagined. YOU THINK $XRP IS JUST A COIN… YOU’RE MISSING THE BIG PICTURE If you’ve watched this video of Ripple CTO David Schwartz, the bullish case for $XRP becomes existential The next tech wave isn’t better UI or faster apps, it’s infrastructure that makes money move like… pic.twitter.com/4gKp9cFFKB — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 14, 2026 Transforming Payments and Economic Behavior Schwartz explains that current payment systems are slow and costly, limiting transaction frequency and flexibility. People typically receive salaries twice a month and pay bills monthly because payments remain expensive and cumbersome. With near-zero cost transfers enabled by XRP , money could stream continuously: salaries could be delivered in real time, bills paid incrementally, and micropayments processed seamlessly. This shift could fundamentally change economic interactions and resource allocation, creating financial behaviors previously impossible under traditional systems. Lessons from Past Technological Waves The former CTO compares XRP’s potential to the digital revolution of the 1990s. Just as early bandwidth limitations constrained internet applications—making streaming services unimaginable—the high cost and inefficiency of current payment rails restrict financial innovation. As XRP lowers costs and simplifies transfers, entirely new use cases, from micro-transactions to programmable money, could emerge. These innovations would reshape financial infrastructure much like the internet transformed information access and distribution.

Its value extends beyond speculation, serving as a scalable bridge asset for institutions, fintechs, and governments experimenting with cross-border liquidity solutions or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). By enabling near-instant and cost-efficient transfers, XRP positions itself as a critical layer of future financial systems. The Existential Bullish Case Schwartz’s commentary frames XRP’s long-term significance as existential: its true value lies in its capacity to underpin a new financial paradigm. As transaction costs approach zero and global financial systems leverage this efficiency, XRP could facilitate behaviors and use cases that remain largely unpriced by markets today. Investors and innovators alike must recognize that XRP’s potential extends far beyond market speculation , connecting the dots between infrastructure, adoption, and transformative economic impact.

57192537,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261957,1768500610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,NIP Group Bitcoin Mining Triumph: $14M Harvested in 90 Days Signals Esports Crypto Revolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nip-group-bitcoin-mining-triumph/,"BitcoinWorld NIP Group Bitcoin Mining Triumph: $14M Harvested in 90 Days Signals Esports Crypto Revolution In a stunning display of strategic diversification, the global esports organization NIP Group has successfully mined $14 million worth of Bitcoin during its inaugural quarter of formal operations. This remarkable achievement, occurring between September and November of last year, immediately positions the company among the elite ranks of U.S. public Bitcoin mining enterprises. The announcement reveals a calculated corporate pivot that merges competitive gaming infrastructure with high-performance cryptocurrency computation, fundamentally challenging traditional industry boundaries. Consequently, this move signals a broader trend of digital-native companies leveraging their technological expertise to capture value in the evolving digital asset economy. NIP Group Bitcoin Mining: A Deep Dive into the $14M Quarter The core of NIP Group’s announcement centers on a $14 million valuation of mined Bitcoin. Importantly, this figure represents the market value of the BTC mined, not direct revenue, and is subject to cryptocurrency price volatility. The company achieved this output within a strict three-month window, from September to November. Industry analysts note that this period coincided with specific network difficulty adjustments and Bitcoin price movements, which directly influenced mining profitability. To contextualize this output, we can compare it to established miners’ quarterly results from the same period. Company Approx. Q3-Q4 2023 BTC Mined Hash Rate (EH/s) NIP Group $14M (Value) 9.66 Riot Platforms ~1,775 BTC >12.0 Marathon Digital ~3,490 BTC >19.0 Furthermore, NIP Group disclosed a current operational hash rate of 9.66 exahashes per second (EH/s). This metric measures the total computational power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network and solving blocks. According to data compiled by industry publication Decrypt, this capacity ranks NIP Group within the top 20 publicly listed Bitcoin mining firms in the United States. Achieving this scale so rapidly suggests a significant upfront capital investment in Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners and specialized data center infrastructure. The Strategic Pivot from Esports to Blockchain Infrastructure NIP Group’s foray into Bitcoin mining is not an isolated venture but a logical extension of its existing business model. Primarily known as Ninjas in Pyjamas, the organization operates at the intersection of technology, gaming, and global fandom. The company’s core competencies include managing high-performance computing for esports tournaments, maintaining low-latency global network infrastructure, and operating massive digital communities. These skills are directly transferable to industrial-scale cryptocurrency mining, which demands robust IT management, 24/7 operational oversight, and sophisticated energy procurement strategies. Therefore, this pivot represents a strategic redeployment of corporate assets and expertise. The move also reflects a growing trend of diversification within the esports and gaming sector. For instance, several gaming companies now explore blockchain-based items, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and digital economies. However, NIP Group has taken a more fundamental approach by engaging with the base layer of the crypto ecosystem—network security and block production. This strategy provides a direct, commodity-like exposure to Bitcoin’s value, which can serve as a corporate treasury asset or a revenue stream less dependent on sponsorship deals and tournament winnings. Expert Analysis on Hash Rate and Market Positioning Industry experts highlight the significance of the 9.66 EH/s hash rate. “Breaking into the top 20 of U.S. public miners within your first operational quarter is exceptionally rare,” notes a financial analyst covering the blockchain sector. “It indicates they secured hardware during a favorable market cycle and executed the deployment flawlessly.” The hash rate not only determines potential Bitcoin earnings but also serves as a key metric for investor confidence in public mining companies. For comparison, the entire Bitcoin network’s hash rate fluctuates but has exceeded 500 EH/s, meaning NIP Group currently contributes nearly 2% of the global total from its U.S.-based operations. This gives them meaningful influence and a steady, if competitive, share of block rewards. Moreover, the timing of the launch is crucial. The company began operations just before a scheduled Bitcoin halving event, anticipated in 2024. Halving events cut the block reward for miners in half, historically triggering industry consolidation where only the most efficient operations thrive. By establishing a significant hash rate and presumably efficient infrastructure now, NIP Group positions itself to withstand the post-halving squeeze better than smaller, less-capitalized miners. Their esports revenue may also provide a financial buffer, allowing them to continue operations during periods of lower mining profitability. Broader Impacts and the Future of Corporate Crypto Adoption NIP Group’s successful mining quarter has several immediate implications. First, it validates a new model for esports and gaming organizations seeking sustainable revenue diversification. Second, it adds a substantial, publicly-known hash rate to the North American mining landscape, supporting the broader trend of mining geographic redistribution. Finally, it demonstrates to traditional investors that companies from adjacent tech sectors can successfully execute complex blockchain infrastructure projects. Looking ahead, key questions focus on the company’s long-term strategy. Will mined Bitcoin be held as a treasury reserve, sold for operational funding, or used in fan engagement programs? How will the company manage the inherent volatility of its new asset class? Furthermore, what are its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments regarding energy sourcing for its mining facilities? The answers to these questions will shape NIP Group’s identity as a hybrid esports and blockchain enterprise. Observers will closely watch its next earnings reports for updates on hash rate growth, energy contracts, and balance sheet management of digital assets. Conclusion The NIP Group Bitcoin mining venture stands as a landmark case study in corporate adaptation. By generating an estimated $14 million in Bitcoin value in just three months and achieving a top-20 U.S. hash rate, the company has successfully bridged the worlds of competitive gaming and cryptocurrency infrastructure. This achievement underscores the transferability of high-tech operational skills across digital frontiers. As the Bitcoin network evolves and the esports industry matures, NIP Group’s dual identity may offer a resilient blueprint for the future, proving that strategic diversification into foundational blockchain layers can yield substantial and rapid returns. FAQs Q1: How does NIP Group’s $14M mining revenue compare to its esports earnings? Direct comparison is complex as esports revenue comes from sponsorships, media rights, and merchandise, while mining yields a volatile digital commodity. The $14M represents the value of BTC mined in one quarter, a significant sum that likely rivals or exceeds traditional quarterly esports income for the organization, highlighting the strategic value of the diversification. Q2: What does a hash rate of 9.66 EH/s mean in practical terms? A hash rate of 9.66 exahashes per second means NIP Group’s mining hardware performs 9.66 quintillion cryptographic calculations every second. This immense computational power is dedicated to securing the Bitcoin blockchain and competing to solve the next block. This scale places them as a major, but not dominant, player in the global mining landscape. Q3: Why would an esports company get into Bitcoin mining? Esports companies like NIP Group possess expertise in managing high-performance computing, 24/7 global operations, and sophisticated IT infrastructure—all skills directly applicable to running an industrial mining operation. It represents a strategic diversification of assets and a hedge against the cyclicality of the entertainment and sponsorship-driven esports business. Q4: Is NIP Group now considered a mining company or an esports company? NIP Group is now a hybrid entity. Its core brand and community remain in esports, but its operations and balance sheet significantly include a large-scale Bitcoin mining business. This dual identity allows it to leverage strengths from both sectors, though it may face unique investor relations challenges in communicating this combined model. Q5: What are the main risks for NIP Group’s new mining venture? Key risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility, which directly affects the value of mined coins; rising global network hash rate, which increases competition for block rewards; regulatory changes around cryptocurrency mining; and the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024, which will cut mining rewards in half, pressuring profitability for all miners.

Only three L2 chains produce meaningful daily fees from app-based economic activity. Base rose to the top among L2 chains with the biggest daily fees. The chain built the most active app economy, achieving a total of $147K in daily revenues. Chain fees are also close at around $145K per day, reflecting significant on-chain activity. Base hosts close to 550K daily active addresses, mostly for DEX trading and token activities, as well as perpetual futures trading. Overall, L2 chains have lagged behind their promises of hosting a wide app ecosystem. Most of the existing networks produce less than $5K in daily fees. As a result, Base makes up around 70% of app-based revenue in the EVM-compatible L2 ecosystem. Based on Cryptorank data , only Base, Arbitrum, and Starknet produce robust daily fees. Arbitrum, formerly the leading L2 network, now has slower activity, producing only $39K in daily fees. Polygon is also one of the active chains in terms of revenues, reflecting the rise of Polymarket . While L2s were seen as competitors to Ethereum, the L1 network draws in close to $500K in daily fees from its smart contract activity. Base and Arbitrum are within the top 10 of fee-producing chains, while Starknet is ranked 11th. Most of the L2 networks are absent from the top of the fee chart. L2 share of app revenues is falling L2 chains produce around 15.9% of the app revenues in the Ethereum ecosystem. Revenues peaked on October 10, then slowed down along with the rest of the market. Both Ethereum and L2 revenues fell together, although the Ethereum ecosystem had one of its best years in terms of app activity and adoption. App activity on both Ethereum and L2 chains fell since October 10, but 2025 was one of the most successful years | Source: GrowThePie Base remains the leader in most categories, especially finance. Base carries over 2B smart contracts for decentralized finance, with around 589K for Arbitrum. Base is the leader in token transfers and general utility, and only lags behind Taiko for on-chain social media apps. Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, however, register a higher number of financial transactions on their DeFi apps. Ethereum remains the leader, handling DeFi traffic directly. The latest balance between L2 and L1 shows that the side chains did not take the liquidity off Ethereum. L2s are enjoying historically low fees for posting on the L1 chain, but they are not stealing traffic from Ethereum apps. L2 chain creation slows down In total, around 150 L2 chains are fighting for attention. At one point during the crypto cycle, multiple projects launched an L2 chain due to the ease of use. Of those chains, some are still considered mostly centralized. Around 99 of the remaining networks are considered live, with several closing each month due to a lack of demand. The L2 ecosystem evolved in the past year, with apps concentrating on a handful of task-specific networks, leaving the rest with almost zero liquidity and no users. Even previously busy chains were abandoned after the end of airdrop farming seasons.

The collaboration, confirmed via the project’s official X account on January 15, 2025, will yield a premium merchandise line available exclusively to adults. This alliance represents one of the most significant integrations of a non-fungible token (NFT) brand with a top-tier football institution, with full product details scheduled for unveiling on January 17. Pudgy Penguins and Manchester City: A Strategic Alliance The partnership between Pudgy Penguins and Manchester City signals a deliberate expansion for both entities. For the football club, this venture represents a sophisticated foray into the digital collectibles and Web3 merchandise space. Conversely, for the Pudgy Penguins brand, the alliance provides unprecedented mainstream legitimacy and access to a global sports audience numbering in the hundreds of millions. The official announcement emphasized that the forthcoming merchandise will be available for purchase by individuals aged 18 and over, adhering to responsible marketing practices within the digital assets sector. This collaboration follows a broader trend of sports organizations exploring digital asset utility. However, the Pudgy Penguins Manchester City deal distinguishes itself by focusing on tangible, premium physical goods linked to a beloved digital IP. The project’s native token, PENGU, has seen notable market activity following the news, reflecting investor and community anticipation. Industry analysts view this as a logical next step for Pudgy Penguins, which has consistently prioritized brand building and real-world utility over speculative trading alone. The Evolution of NFT and Sports Collaborations The fusion of non-fungible tokens and professional sports is not an entirely new phenomenon. Several football clubs and major sports leagues have previously experimented with fan tokens, digital collectibles, and metaverse experiences. For instance, organizations like Paris Saint-Germain and FC Barcelona have launched various digital initiatives. However, the Pudgy Penguins Manchester City partnership appears uniquely focused on a co-branded physical merchandise line, suggesting a model that leverages digital community strength to drive real-world product demand. This model offers distinct advantages. Primarily, it creates a bridge between the digital identity of NFT holders and physical brand expression. Furthermore, it allows Manchester City to engage with a younger, tech-savvy demographic that is highly active in the Web3 space. The partnership’s structure likely involves revenue sharing and intellectual property licensing, creating a new, sustainable income stream for both parties. The success of this venture could establish a blueprint for future collaborations between sports franchises and established digital communities. Feature Traditional Sports Merch Pudgy Penguins x Man City Collab Primary Audience General football fans Web3 enthusiasts & football fans (18+) Access Model Open retail Likely exclusive drops or pre-sales Brand Drivers Club loyalty & performance Digital community + club legacy Asset Link Physical item only Potential digital-physical utility Expert Analysis on Market Impact Market observers highlight several key implications of this deal. Firstly, it validates the “phygital” model—where physical products are enhanced by digital ownership and perks—as a viable strategy for NFT projects seeking longevity. Secondly, it demonstrates that major brands like Manchester City now view certain Web3 communities as valuable partners rather than mere marketing channels. The requirement for purchasers to be adults aligns with increasing regulatory scrutiny and a industry-wide push for responsible engagement, potentially setting a new standard for such collaborations. The timing is also strategic. The announcement precedes the January 17 detail drop, allowing market sentiment to build. For the PENGU token ecosystem, the partnership could drive utility through exclusive access or discounts for token holders, though such specifics remain to be confirmed. The move is seen as a defensive play against NFT market volatility, anchoring the Pudgy Penguins brand value in a partnership with a stable, world-renowned sports institution. Anticipating the January 17 Merchandise Reveal The community awaits the January 17 announcement with significant anticipation. Based on the brand identities involved, the premium merchandise line could encompass several categories. Expected items include limited-edition apparel, such as jerseys or jackets featuring co-branded logos, and high-end collectibles like figurines or art prints. A key question is whether the merchandise will incorporate digital verification, perhaps via QR codes or NFC chips linking to a digital certificate of authenticity on the blockchain, creating a true phygital asset. The launch mechanism will be critical. Potential models include: Exclusive Pre-sale: For holders of Pudgy Penguins NFTs or the PENGU token. General Sale: Open to the public via a dedicated online storefront. Staged Drops: Releasing different product tiers over time to maintain engagement. Pricing will indicate the “premium” positioning. Given the operational costs of high-quality manufacturing and the licensing fees involved, items will likely carry a price point above standard club merchandise. The target demographic—adults with an interest in both collectibles and football—suggests a focus on design quality and exclusivity over mass-market volume. Conclusion The Pudgy Penguins partnership with Manchester City marks a pivotal moment for NFT integration into mainstream culture. This collaboration moves beyond speculative digital art, focusing instead on building tangible products and deepening brand equity. The January 17 reveal will clarify the scope and ambition of this venture, but its initial announcement has already succeeded in merging two powerful communities. The success of this Pudgy Penguins Manchester City merchandise line will be closely watched, as it may well define the template for the next generation of sports, fashion, and Web3 collaborations. FAQs Q1: What did Pudgy Penguins announce regarding Manchester City? The Pudgy Penguins NFT project announced a partnership with Manchester City Football Club to create and release a line of premium co-branded merchandise. Full details will be released on January 17, 2025. Q2: Who can buy the Pudgy Penguins x Manchester City merchandise? The official announcement states the merchandise will be available for purchase by adults aged 18 and over.

The distribution will send 1.819 billion SKR to more than 100,000 users. Additionally, the company will allocate 141 million SKR to developers who shipped apps in Season 1. The announcement marks a major reward push for users who stayed active across the Seeker device, the Solana dApp Store, and onchain activity. Significantly, Solana Mobile has already launched an allocation checker. Users can now see their tier and estimated token rewards. This early visibility gives the community time to plan before the claim window opens. Allocation checker goes live for Seeker users The SKR allocation checker is now available inside the Seed Vault Wallet. Users can access the Activity Tracking tab to view their tier. They can also see their full SKR allocation under the Season 1 reward program. Besides simple participation, Solana Mobile tied rewards to engagement signals. The project also applied anti-sybil measures to reduce low-quality farming behavior. Consequently, the token amounts vary widely across each tier. The top tier, Sovereign, receives 750,000 SKR. Luminary receives 125,000 SKR, while Vanguard receives 40,000 SKR. Prospector qualifies for 10,000 SKR, and Scout holds the 5,000 SKR entry level. Claim date and transaction requirements Solana Mobile will open SKR claiming on January 21 at 2am UTC. The claim will happen inside Seed Vault Wallet under Activity Tracking. Users should keep about 0.02 SOL ready for the claim fee. Additionally, the SKR will go to the wallet tied to the Genesis Token at Season 1’s end. Solana Mobile also set a 90-day claim window. Hence, users do not need to rush on launch minute. This structure may also help reduce network congestion during peak activity. Developer rewards and staking rollout Solana Mobile also added a dedicated developer allocation for Season 1 builders. Eligible developers can check status through the Publishing Portal. Each qualifying developer receives 750,000 SKR. Moreover, users will gain access to staking after claiming. Seekers can stake directly to Guardians inside Seed Vault Wallet. SKR staking will also work through a web-based interface. Consequently, Solana Mobile positions SKR as a reward and participation asset.

Nowadays, big names such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are used to take the stage, but there are other cheap cryptos which have attracted attention of analysts and market observers. They claim that once the sentiment goes back and is positive, a token with a positive real use case, but at a lower price, might experience disproportionate returns. Below are 3 low priced cryptocurrencies that analysts believe have a 500% growth potential during the next rally, and why each of them counts. Dogecoin (DOGE) One of the most popular tokens in crypto has become Dogecoin (DOGE). It is a product of the internet culture that has attracted retail traders and other personalities. It is at a current price of approximately $0.14 and has a market cap of about $24B. DOGE has experienced various spikes during bullish periods and continues to be a staple in most of the portfolios. Dogecoin possesses a number of resistance zones which are closely monitored by traders on the crypto charts. Fourth, one of the resistance points seems to be at or near the price of $0.20 to $0.23, the previous top. The other major hindrance is around the $0.30 mark which it has not seen since the previous market heights. The areas indicate an area where there are past record increases in sell pressure based on price and volume levels. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Another cheap crypto that has stayed trendy is Shiba Inu (SHIB). It trades at present at approximately $0.000009 with a market cap of approximately 5B. The ecosystem of SHIB has expanded over time to have functionalities like BEP-20 tokens and community based programs. It has an avid fan base that keeps track of every new release and pattern in the chart. The past price peaks also define resistance zones of SHIB. A range of between $0.000013 and $0.000017 is one that traders monitor. Should SHIB manage to clear this area with good volume, there are commentators with whom it may indicate to greater levels. Nevertheless, the large total supply of SHIB complicates massive long term moves unless token burning or long term demand are in place. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new altcoin that attracts the attention of analysts who monitor the development of decentralized finance and the evolution of crypto prices. In contrast to DOGE and SHIB, MUTM is not a token it belongs to a proposed decentralized lending protocol that will roll out its V1 to Sepolia testnet in early 2026 before the mainnet launches. The protocol will enable borrowers and lenders to borrow and lend assets based on pooled smart contracts. The liquidity providers will be given mtTokens that will reflect their stake with the interest taken respectively after the system becomes operational. The presale started at the beginning of 2025 at $0.01 and progressed through levels to $0.04 with a positive growth of approximately 300% compared to phase 1. Up to now, the presale has already collected more than 19.8M and sold more than 18,800 holders and 830M tokens. Security is included in the foundation. Mutuum Finance was audited by Halborn and received a CertiK token scan score of 90/100. The project has also a 24 hour leaderboard and a $50,000 bug bounty and top contributors earning $500 in MUTM prizes. These will be taken to establish trust before V1 is released into the market. Looking Ahead According to the view of many commentators in the market, there is still potential that DOGE and SHIB are going to move upwards within a bullish cycle. Nevertheless, both have obvious drawbacks. The high supply, and inability to be useful means that DOGE will be restricted in terms of its potential to rise to a high price, unless demand is incredibly high. Mutuum Finance is configured differently. It is created to bring in revenue upon the commencement of lending activities. Some protocol revenue will be purchased by MUTM in the open market and MUTM that is acquired in the open market will be resold to the user who will stake the mtTokens in the safety module. In order to show a basic comparison, consider investing at present levels of $700 in each of the projects. At DOGE of 0.$14 a strong move to 0.20 would be under 1.6x. At SHIB of $0.000009, even doubling or tripling would not be considered big returns. In the case of MUTM, when the protocol is launched, with revenue being generated, some analysts are postulating lines of increase, which show 10x to 20x increases on the presale price once it is listed and used. These perceptions rest on the basics that most traders consider when posing the query of what crypto to invest in the upcoming cycle. The Significance of V1 Launch and Security One of the catalysts is the V1 launch as it will transform Mutuum Finance to a working protocol. Live system refers to lending fee, borrowing, and actual usage information. This is vital to investor confidence and to have markets perceive MUTM as not just a new crypto coin. Having audits and a gradual rollout, the initiative is in line with the manner in which most analysts explain successful protocol rollouts in the crypto industry. To investors who have this question discussed, use of utility, security, and execution are equally important as price charts and resistance zones to purchase a crypto today to hold long term.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any involvement in a shady deal with the Roche Freedman law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend from January to May, after which bears took control of the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20. In July, it traded at the $18 level and $23 in September. In October, it rose above $30. It then reversed, and by December, had dropped to $14. It maintained the price into January 2026.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIL|ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|APT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-15 18:30:00
57192916,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261960,1768501811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stablecoin Adoption Soars: A Staggering 200 Million Addresses Now Hold Digital Dollars,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoin-addresses-surpass-200-million/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Adoption Soars: A Staggering 200 Million Addresses Now Hold Digital Dollars Global, March 2025 – The cryptocurrency landscape has reached a pivotal milestone, as the number of unique blockchain addresses holding stablecoins has officially surpassed 200 million. This staggering figure, reported by crypto analytics platform Token Terminal and highlighted in the Milk Road newsletter, represents a doubling of the user base in just four years. Consequently, this explosive growth signals a fundamental shift in how people worldwide interact with digital assets and value transfer systems. Stablecoin Addresses Surpass 200 Million: Decoding the Data Token Terminal’s on-chain data provides a clear, verifiable snapshot of this adoption surge. The metric counts unique wallet addresses with a non-zero balance of major stablecoins like Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI). Importantly, this 200 million figure does not equate to 200 million individual users, as one person can control multiple addresses. However, it serves as a powerful proxy for ecosystem activity and wallet creation. Furthermore, the doubling since 2021 underscores a consistent, accelerating trend rather than a fleeting spike. Analysts point to several concurrent drivers for this growth. Primarily, stablecoins have become the essential on-ramp and off-ramp for the broader crypto economy. Traders use them to hedge volatility on exchanges. Remittance services leverage them for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. Additionally, developers integrate them as the primary medium of exchange within decentralized finance (DeFi) applications for lending, borrowing, and earning yield. The Real-World Utility Driving Adoption The growth is not merely speculative. In countries experiencing high inflation or currency instability, dollar-pegged stablecoins offer a digital sanctuary for savings. Similarly, freelancers and global businesses increasingly use them for seamless international settlements. This utility-focused adoption creates a more resilient foundation for growth compared to periods driven purely by asset price speculation. Comparative Analysis and Market Evolution To understand the scale, a comparison is instructive. In early 2021, the total number of such addresses hovered around 100 million. The climb to 200 million illustrates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 19% over this period. This pace significantly outpaces the growth rate of traditional digital payment user bases in many regions. A brief analysis of the dominant stablecoins reveals a competitive landscape: Tether (USDT): Maintains the largest market share and is most prevalent on the Tron and Ethereum blockchains, often favored for trading and liquidity. USD Coin (USDC): Known for its regulated, transparent reserves, USDC sees heavy usage in DeFi protocols and corporate treasury operations. Decentralized Stablecoins (e.g., Dai): While smaller in market cap, these algorithmically-backed tokens represent a growing segment focused on censorship resistance. Expert Insights on Sustainable Growth Industry researchers emphasize the qualitative change behind the numbers. “The narrative has shifted from ‘crypto for speculation’ to ‘crypto for utility,'” notes a fintech analyst from a major university’s blockchain research initiative. “Stablecoins are the workhorse enabling that utility. This 200-million-address milestone reflects their entrenched role as the plumbing for digital asset ecosystems and a new layer for global value transfer.” Regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions, though evolving, has also provided a more certain environment for institutional and developer participation. Technical and Economic Impacts of Widespread Stablecoin Use The proliferation of stablecoin-holding addresses has tangible effects on blockchain networks and financial markets. On one hand, it increases transaction volume and fee revenue for underlying networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. On the other hand, it places greater emphasis on scalability and low-cost transactions to maintain usability for everyday payments. Economically, the sheer volume of capital flowing through stablecoins—often in the hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization—has drawn the attention of central banks and policymakers globally. Many are now accelerating their own central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects in response. The data suggests stablecoins are effectively conducting a large-scale, real-world stress test of digital money infrastructure. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities Despite the growth, challenges persist. Regulatory frameworks remain a patchwork globally, creating compliance complexity. The stability of the peg is perpetually tested by market stress, as past de-pegging events have shown. Moreover, the industry must continue improving user experience and security to onboard the next 200 million addresses. Opportunities, however, are vast. Integration with traditional finance (TradFi) rails, use in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), and programmable money applications are all active frontiers for development. Conclusion The milestone of 200 million stablecoin-holding addresses marks a definitive phase in the maturation of digital assets. It reflects a move beyond niche adoption toward broader, utility-based integration into global finance. This growth, documented by Token Terminal, is fueled by tangible needs for efficient cross-border payment solutions, volatility hedging, and access to decentralized financial services. As the underlying technology and regulatory environment continue to evolve, the trajectory of stablecoin adoption will likely remain a critical barometer for the health and expansion of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What does ‘200 million stablecoin-holding addresses’ actually mean? It means that blockchain data shows over 200 million unique digital wallet addresses currently contain a balance of at least one stablecoin. This is a measure of wallet penetration, not unique individual users. Q2: Why has the number of addresses doubled in four years? Key drivers include the explosion of DeFi (decentralized finance), which uses stablecoins as its base currency; increased use for remittances and global trade; and their role as a safe haven asset in regions with unstable local currencies. Q3: Does this growth make stablecoins safe? Not inherently. Growth indicates adoption, not safety. Each stablecoin has its own risk profile based on its backing (e.g., cash reserves, algorithms) and the regulatory standing of its issuer. Users must perform due diligence. Q4: How does this affect traditional banking and finance? It presents both competition and opportunity. Stablecoins challenge traditional cross-border payment systems on speed and cost. Conversely, many banks are exploring how to use similar blockchain technology and even issue their own digital currencies. Q5: What is the main challenge facing stablecoin growth now? The primary challenge is regulatory clarity. Governments worldwide are crafting rules for stablecoin issuers regarding reserves, redemption, and consumer protection. Consistent, sensible regulation is seen as key to the next phase of institutional adoption. Q6: Can one person be counted multiple times in this 200 million figure? Yes. Since the data tracks addresses, not verified identities, one individual controlling multiple wallets (e.g., for different purposes or on different blockchains) would be counted multiple times. The figure is best interpreted as a measure of network activity.

Based on reports , this unexpected withdrawal sharpened existing tensions between senators on debates of this bill and lawmakers who were trying to revamp critical phrases. Republicans’ Concerns In Oversight The Republicans in the Senate, under the leadership of Sen. Tim Scott, have strongly countered . They have expressed reservations about whether it is intended to help ordinary investors or just a few companies. While some representatives expressed their concerns that broad oversight authority could stymie growth in addition to proposed net yields for stablecoins, reports have indicated that Republicans want more defined enforcement authority in opposition to broad regulatory language. Crypto builders need clear rules of the road. Over the past five years, Republicans, Democrats, and the Trump Administration have worked closely with members across the crypto industry to protect decentralization, support developers, and give entrepreneurs a fair shot. ​At its… — Chris Dixon (@cdixon) January 15, 2026 Bitcoin Unfazed By The Standoff Despite the confusion, crypto prices remained firm. Bitcoin held its ground and climbed 1.5%. The top crypto asset retained its grip on the $96,000 level, while other top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and USDT likewise notched similar gains in the last 24 hours, based on the latest market tracking figures. Meanwhile, investors followed speeches and congress sessions. Market volatility heightened. Some investors opted to go to the sideline position as lobbyists and exchanges sought to shape the draft that will come next. After reviewing the Senate Banking draft text over the last 48hrs, Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written. There are too many issues, including: – A defacto ban on tokenized equities– DeFi prohibitions, giving the government unlimited access to your financial… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 14, 2026 As a response to the new draft bill issued by the Senate, several industry representatives vocally objected to its provisions and expressed their belief that it could have a negative impact on tokenized equities and Decentralized Finance. In fact, there are enough concerns in the blockchain sector raised by Armstrong, that he stated he would prefer to see no bill than see a bad bill passed, indicating that even some members of his industry agree with Republican concerns regarding possible overreach by Congress. These industry groups said they will likely withdraw their support unless the Senate makes the necessary changes to allow for continued innovation and cross-border competition regarding blockchain technology. Negotiations Continue To Take Place Behind Closed Doors Some Senate leaders still want to move toward a committee vote, even though disagreement remains deep. Republican and Democratic legislators are currently negotiating or trading potential amendments on issues such as stablecoin legislation, DeFi protections and investor protections in an effort to reach an agreement on an acceptable version of the bill by both parties. Democrats have identified a need to address regulatory issues regarding ethics, potential Money Laundering, and DeFi over-regulation as top priorities. On the other side of the aisle, the Republican Party continues to push for legislation that clearly defines the guardrails for federal regulators regarding blockchains. As a result of ongoing negotiations, there is currently no set timeline for a Senate floor vote on the new legislation.

In fact, the crypto asset lagged gold and the Nasdaq in the same period. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes cited declining US dollar credit as the primary driver of underperformance. Tight Dollar Credit In his latest essay, “Frowny Cloud,” Hayes attributed Bitcoin’s weak showing last year primarily to a contraction in US dollar liquidity. He explained that dollar credit, described as the “most important force in 2025,” directly influenced the price dynamics of Bitcoin, gold, and US equities. He noted that while gold and the Nasdaq 100 rose during the year, Bitcoin underperformed relative to these assets due to the decline in fiat liquidity. The prominent market observer added that sovereign nations increased their purchases of gold in response to geopolitical risks and US policy actions, including restrictions on Russia’s treasury holdings. These nations sought to reduce exposure to US treasuries, which ended up accelerating gold buying and strengthening its role as a global reserve asset. Looking forward to 2026, Hayes expects a rebound in US dollar liquidity, driven by several factors. First, he anticipates an expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet through continued money creation and Reserve Management Purchases (RMP). According to his estimates, this will inject at least $40 billion per month into the system. This expected rise in dollar liquidity could provide support for risk assets, including Bitcoin, as the central bank balance sheet grows and lending activity expands. He noted that BTC’s value historically correlates with fiat monetary expansion, as its proof-of-work blockchain benefits from an increased supply of US dollars. Hayes suggested that with liquidity poised to expand in 2026, Bitcoin could follow the upward trend established by other assets during periods of credit growth. 2026 Could Look Very Different Hayes also mentioned that his firm has positioned for leveraged exposure to Bitcoin via equity instruments in companies such as Strategy and Metaplanet, which he believes could outperform Bitcoin if the cryptocurrency rises above key price levels. He additionally observed continued accumulation of Zcash (ZEC) and expressed confidence in the project’s development roadmap despite recent developer departures. He compared Bitcoin and other assets to snow patterns and liquidity flows. Hayes concluded that while Bitcoin underperformed in 2025, the anticipated increase in US dollar credit in 2026, including growth in the Fed’s balance sheet, stronger bank lending, and lower mortgage rates, could provide renewed support for the cryptocurrency and other risk assets.

This development raises critical questions about political influence on financial regulation. SEC Crypto Investigations Face Political Scrutiny Representatives Maxine Waters, Sean Casten, and Brad Sherman recently sent a detailed letter to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. Consequently, they documented at least 12 cryptocurrency-related cases that the agency dismissed or closed since early 2024. These cases included significant actions against major exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. The lawmakers presented compelling evidence suggesting the SEC had strong legal grounds for these cases. Moreover, they highlighted the timing correlation between case closures and cryptocurrency industry political contributions. This situation creates apparent conflicts between regulatory enforcement and political fundraising activities. Cryptocurrency Regulation and Political Donations Timeline The cryptocurrency industry dramatically increased political contributions during the 2024 election cycle. Simultaneously, the SEC began scaling back enforcement actions against major digital asset platforms. This parallel timeline has raised legitimate concerns among regulatory observers and legal experts. Expert Analysis of Regulatory Enforcement Patterns Former SEC enforcement attorneys note that case dismissal patterns appear unusual. Typically, the agency pursues investigations with strong evidence vigorously. However, the sudden closure of multiple high-profile cryptocurrency cases represents a significant departure from standard enforcement protocols. Financial regulation experts point to several concerning factors: Case Strength: The SEC reportedly possessed substantial evidence in these investigations Timing Correlation: Case closures coincided with increased political contributions Industry Impact: Major cryptocurrency exchanges benefited directly from these decisions Precedent Setting: These actions could establish problematic enforcement patterns Cryptocurrency Industry Political Contributions Analysis The cryptocurrency sector allocated millions in political donations during the 2024 election period. Significantly, these contributions flowed primarily to political action committees supporting Trump administration policies. This financial support created apparent conflicts with ongoing regulatory enforcement actions. Campaign finance records reveal substantial increases in cryptocurrency industry political giving. Furthermore, these contributions targeted key committees and lawmakers overseeing financial regulation. This strategic giving pattern suggests deliberate attempts to influence regulatory outcomes. Comparative Analysis of Enforcement Actions Exchange Investigation Status Timeline Political Context Coinbase Case Closed Q2 2024 During donation surge Binance Investigation Halted Q3 2024 Post-major contributions Kraken Enforcement Dropped Q1 2025 Following political giving Regulatory Impact and Market Consequences These enforcement decisions carry significant implications for cryptocurrency markets. Regulatory certainty represents a crucial factor for institutional investment decisions. However, perceived political influence undermines market confidence in regulatory consistency. Market analysts observe several immediate consequences: Investor Uncertainty: Questions about regulatory predictability Market Volatility: Increased price fluctuations amid political developments Compliance Challenges: Confusion about enforcement priorities International Implications: Global regulatory coordination concerns Legal Framework and Enforcement Authority The SEC operates under specific statutory mandates for securities regulation. Its enforcement authority derives from multiple federal securities laws. These laws provide clear guidelines for investigation procedures and enforcement actions. Legal experts emphasize that political considerations should not influence enforcement decisions. The agency maintains statutory independence for precisely this reason. Nevertheless, the current allegations suggest potential breaches of this fundamental principle. Historical Context of SEC Enforcement The SEC has historically pursued enforcement actions based on legal merits. Political considerations typically remain separate from case decisions. This separation ensures consistent application of securities laws across administrations. However, the cryptocurrency sector presents unique regulatory challenges. Digital assets often fall into regulatory gray areas. This ambiguity creates opportunities for political influence on enforcement priorities. Conclusion The allegations regarding SEC crypto investigations highlight critical issues in financial regulation. Political influence on enforcement decisions threatens regulatory integrity. Furthermore, these developments could undermine investor confidence in cryptocurrency markets. The SEC must address these concerns transparently. Regulatory consistency remains essential for market stability. Ultimately, the cryptocurrency industry requires clear, predictable enforcement frameworks free from political interference. FAQs Q1: What specific cases did Democrats allege the SEC dropped? The lawmakers identified at least 12 cryptocurrency-related cases, including investigations into Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, that were reportedly closed or dismissed since early 2024. Q2: How do political donations relate to SEC enforcement decisions? Democrats allege that case closures coincided with increased cryptocurrency industry donations to political committees supporting Trump administration policies, suggesting potential influence on regulatory actions. Q3: What evidence supports these allegations? The allegations reference timing correlations between case closures and donation patterns, along with documented case strength that suggested high probability of successful enforcement actions. Q4: How might this affect cryptocurrency markets? Perceived political influence on regulation could increase market volatility, create investor uncertainty, and complicate compliance efforts for cryptocurrency businesses. Q5: What response has the SEC provided? As of publication, the SEC has not issued a formal response to the allegations, though standard procedure typically involves internal review of such congressional communications.

InfoFi projects, which proliferated non-organic bot content, will be cut off from the social network. X cut API access to InfoFi projects, after a period of increased non-organic traffic with AI-based content. InfoFi was another use case for on-chain activity, which still relied on the traditional X feed. Users were rewarded for posting, and ended up overloading the social media platform with AI-generated content. In another round of reinventing the X relationship with crypto content, the site’s product manager, Nikita Bier, explained the changes coming for InfoFi projects. The changes effectively ban rewards for posting, especially for explicit promises to earn points or airdrop access. ‘ We will no longer allow apps that reward users for posting on X (aka “infofi”). This has led to a tremendous amount of AI slop & reply spam on the platform. ’ ‘ We have revoked API access from these apps, so your X experience should start improving soon (once the bots realize they’re not getting paid anymore ,’ announced Bier in an X post . The changes come just a day after X boosted exposure to crypto projects through cashtags , offering more accurate labeling for projects and tickers. The changes came after the crypto community accused X of decreasing reach for crypto projects, apps, and influencers. In the past year, some projects complained of lower reach, while X tried to fight scams and low-quality content. InfoFi tokens crash after X ban Immediately after the news of the API ban, almost all InfoFi tokens wiped out a part of their value. The overall market is small, valued at under $400K, reflecting the relative novelty of InfoFi projects. KAITO crashed immediately after the news that InfoFi projects will loose access to X API. No more rewards for posting are allowed, to keep the social network from spam and AI-generated posts. | Source: Coingecko In the past day, the whole token class crashed by 11.6% , with near-vertical losses immediately after Bier’s statement. KAITO, one of the leading InfoFi and mindshare apps, lost 15.2% to trade near its lowest range at $0.57. ZachXBT criticized InfoFi campaigns ZachXBT has been tracking various InfoFi campaigns, believing they harmed the crypto community rather than popularizing the projects. While Kaito offered useful data on influence, it also encouraged frequent posting that bloated the content in the crypto space. A short story. Shame on all of the projects that ran AI slop campaigns via InfoFi platforms. The inorganic activity / fake metrics was obvious if you have common sense and it made X borderline unusable for everyone else. pic.twitter.com/9ECfOG3b7W — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 15, 2026 InfoFi creation followed a previous attempt to rebuild social media for niche projects. However, InfoFi apps decided to use the exposure of X, the most widely used social network. The recent API ban showed that even projects claiming to be decentralized relied heavily on Web2 rails for their exposure. Before the ban, InfoFi projects spent widely on API access and encouraged posting as a way of farming airdrop points. The Kaito airdrop was the most notorious case, later establishing multiple circles of influencers. Soon after the ban, InfoFi faced an uncertain fate. For some, Kaito and other apps were doomed to be abandoned, similar to FriendTech apps. For others, InfoFi would seek ways to adapt and find more favorable platforms or new tasks for point farming, such as testnet usage. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This movement represents a crucial test for investor confidence following an extended period of bullish momentum. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing volume patterns and macroeconomic indicators to understand the underlying drivers. Bitcoin Price Drop: Analyzing the Immediate Market Data Market monitoring data from Bitcoin World confirms the BTC decline. The drop below $96,000 marks a key psychological level for traders. Furthermore, trading volume on major exchanges like Binance has increased by approximately 18% in the last 24 hours. This suggests heightened activity, potentially indicating both selling pressure and opportunistic buying. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced similar corrections during bull markets. For instance, the 2021 cycle saw multiple drawdowns exceeding 20% before reaching new highs. Therefore, current volatility remains within historical norms. Market structure analysis shows strong support forming near the $94,500 level based on previous consolidation zones. Metric Value Context Current Price (Binance) $95,992.6 USDT Trading Pair 24-Hour Change -2.8% Against the US Dollar Key Support Level $94,500 Previous Resistance Turned Support Market Dominance 52.3% Bitcoin’s Share of Total Crypto Market Cap Contextual Factors Behind Cryptocurrency Market Volatility Several interconnected factors typically influence Bitcoin’s price action. Understanding these provides crucial context for the current dip. Macroeconomic Signals: Recent statements from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rate policy can affect liquidity flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Institutional Activity: Flows into and out of spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a transparent gauge of institutional sentiment and capital movement. Network Fundamentals: On-chain metrics such as hash rate, active addresses, and exchange reserves provide a health check for the underlying network. Regulatory Developments: Global regulatory clarity, particularly in major economies, continues to impact long-term investor outlook. Additionally, the broader digital asset market often moves in correlation. Notably, Ethereum and other major altcoins have shown similar downward pressure. This points to a macro-driven event rather than a Bitcoin-specific issue. Market technicians are now watching the 50-day moving average, which currently sits near $93,800. Expert Perspectives on Market Corrections Seasoned analysts emphasize that volatility is inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Dr. Anya Sharma, a financial economist at the Global Digital Finance Institute, notes, “Periodic corrections are healthy. They shake out leverage and establish stronger foundations for the next leg up. The key metrics to watch are exchange net flows and derivatives funding rates.” Her research indicates that a reset in overly optimistic futures markets often precedes stability. Historical data supports this view. For example, the 2023-2024 bull run included seven separate pullbacks of 10% or more. Each was followed by a period of consolidation and then a resumption of the upward trend, assuming core bullish narratives remained intact. Currently, narratives around Bitcoin as a digital store of value and institutional adoption appear unchanged. Potential Impacts and Forward-Looking Scenarios The immediate impact of this Bitcoin price fall is multifaceted. Retail investors may experience portfolio drawdowns, while institutional players might see a buying opportunity. Derivatives markets show a slight increase in put option volume, indicating some traders are hedging against further downside. Looking ahead, several scenarios could unfold. A swift recovery above $98,000 would suggest strong underlying demand. Conversely, a prolonged consolidation between $94,000 and $96,000 would indicate a battle between buyers and sellers. Critical monitoring points include: Daily closing prices relative to the $96,000 level. Changes in Bitcoin holdings on centralized exchanges. US Dollar Index (DXY) movements, which often inversely correlate with crypto. Moreover, the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle, though recently completed, continues to frame long-term supply dynamics. The enforced scarcity from halving events has historically led to increased price appreciation over multi-year timeframes, despite short-term volatility. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $96,000 serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. However, this movement occurs within a well-established historical pattern of bull market corrections. Key on-chain and macroeconomic indicators suggest the core investment thesis for Bitcoin remains robust. Therefore, investors should focus on long-term fundamentals, risk management, and diversified exposure rather than reacting to single-day price fluctuations. The market’s next steps will depend heavily on broader financial conditions and sustained network adoption. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $96,000? Market corrections are common in volatile assets. This specific move likely results from a combination of profit-taking after a strong rally, adjustments in macroeconomic expectations, and routine volatility within the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions depend on individual strategy. Some view dips as buying opportunities based on long-term conviction, while others wait for confirmed trend reversals. Always conduct personal research and consider your risk tolerance. Q3: How does this drop compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? The current decline is relatively modest within historical context. Previous bull markets have experienced deeper drawdowns (often 20-30%) without breaking the primary upward trend. Q4: What key levels should traders watch now? Analysts are monitoring the $94,500 support level closely. A sustained break above $98,000 would be considered bullish, while holding above $94,000 would suggest underlying strength. Q5: Does this price fall affect the entire cryptocurrency market? Typically, yes. Bitcoin’s market dominance means its price action often influences the broader digital asset sector. Most major altcoins show high correlation with Bitcoin’s short-term movements.

Instead, GLXY shares are pushing higher on January 15th, mostly on infrastructure expansion. The company has secured approval to add 830 megawatts of power at its Helios Data Center Campus. According to the New York-headquartered firm, this ERCOT approval effectively doubles its total capacity to 1.6 gigawatts. Year-to-date, Galaxy Digital stock is now up more than 30%. Why this ERCOT approval is positive for GLXY stock Galaxy Digital shares are being rewarded because the approval to expand Helios by 830 megawatts is more than a technical milestone for the Nasdaq-listed firm – it’s a strategic leap. Data centers are the “backbone” of both crypto mining and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads – and power capacity on both fronts is the ultimate constraint. By doubling its footprint to over 1.6 gigawatts, GLXY is reinforcing that it can scale alongside the most demanding industries of the decade. Over time, this could attract institutional clients, diversify revenue streams, and position the firm as a hybrid player straddling two explosive growth markets. In short, investors are viewing this infrastructure expansion as a transformative moment, positioning Galaxy Digital not only as a crypto powerhouse but also as a serious contender in the AI infrastructure race. Crypto remains a long-term tailwind for Galaxy Digital stock While today’s rally is mostly tied to AI infrastructure, crypto remains an important component of the GLXY story. Bitcoin has resumed its upward trajectory this month, driven by institutional inflows, ETF adoption, and renewed interest in digital assets as a hedge against monetary uncertainty. Moreover, the US Senate introduced a long-awaited crypto bill, adding to the momentum in crypto prices. All in all, both macro factors and structural demand are driving BTC up – and if momentum holds, GLXY stock could benefit directly through its trading, custody, and mining operations. The key takeaway is: crypto doesn’t need to be the driver every day for Galaxy Digital to thrive – but when it does rally, it provides a powerful secondary tailwind that reinforces the bull case. How technicals suggest you should play Galaxy Digital Investors should also note that the rally on Thursday pushed GLXY shares decisively past a major resistance, coinciding with their longer-term moving average (100-day). This signals continued upward momentum in the weeks ahead, especially since the stock’s relative strength index (RSI) currently sits at 53, only significantly below overbought territory. What’s also worth mentioning is that Wall Street analysts recommend sticking with Galaxy Digital stock as well. According to the Wall Street Journal , consensus rating on this crypto and AI stock remains at “buy” with the mean target of about $49, indicating potential upside of another 50% from here.

57193440,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261970,1768503612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Federal Reserve Chair Decision Looms: Trump’s Pivotal Choice for US Economy Nears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-federal-reserve-chair-decision/,"BitcoinWorld Federal Reserve Chair Decision Looms: Trump’s Pivotal Choice for US Economy Nears WASHINGTON, D.C. – The White House confirmed this week that President Donald Trump will select the next chair of the Federal Reserve within the coming weeks, a decision poised to shape U.S. monetary policy for years. This imminent announcement follows a statement sourced to Walter Bloomberg, noting the President has several suitable individuals in mind for the role. Consequently, financial markets and policymakers globally now keenly await a choice with profound implications for interest rates, inflation, and economic stability. The Stakes of the Federal Reserve Chair Decision Selecting a Federal Reserve chair represents one of a president’s most consequential economic appointments. The chair leads the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the benchmark federal funds rate. This rate influences everything from mortgage costs and business loans to the value of the U.S. dollar and global capital flows. Therefore, the nominee’s philosophical approach to inflation, employment, and financial regulation will establish the central bank’s trajectory. Historically, Fed chairs have navigated crises, from the Great Recession to the pandemic, underscoring the role’s critical importance. Moreover, the decision arrives at a complex economic juncture. The U.S. economy shows robust job growth but persistent concerns about inflation above the Fed’s 2% target. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and evolving global supply chains create uncertainty. The next chair must balance fostering maximum employment with maintaining price stability, a dual mandate Congress assigned to the Fed. This context makes President Trump’s impending decision a focal point for Wall Street analysts, Main Street businesses, and international observers alike. Historical Precedent and Appointment Process The process for appointing a Fed chair is well-established but politically sensitive. First, the President nominates a candidate. Subsequently, the Senate Banking Committee holds confirmation hearings. Finally, the full Senate must approve the nominee by a simple majority. Recent chairs, like Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen, received bipartisan support, highlighting the role’s traditional non-partisan stature. However, the political climate can influence confirmation dynamics, especially with a closely divided Senate. Past transitions offer valuable context. For instance, President Barack Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke in 2009 during the financial crisis, signaling continuity. Conversely, President Trump nominated Jerome Powell in 2017, selecting a Republican but not reappointing Janet Yellen, a Democrat. This history shows that while presidents typically appoint chairs aligned with their economic views, institutional credibility remains paramount. The coming weeks will reveal if President Trump opts for continuity with a Powell reappointment or a shift in monetary policy direction with a new candidate. Potential Candidates and Their Policy Leanings The White House statement identified several suitable individuals, though it did not name them. Financial and political analysts consistently mention a shortlist of potential nominees based on past statements and reporting. Understanding their backgrounds provides insight into possible policy shifts. Jerome Powell (Incumbent): Appointed as Chair by President Trump in 2018, Powell initially faced criticism for rate hikes but later won praise for aggressive pandemic-era stimulus. His recent focus has been on battling inflation through rapid interest rate increases. Lael Brainard: Currently Vice Chair, Brainard has served as a Fed Governor since 2014. She has often emphasized the risks of high inflation but also highlighted the importance of labor market gains and financial stability. John Williams: President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Williams holds a permanent vote on the FOMC. He is a respected economist known for data-dependent policy models and clear communication. Kevin Warsh: A former Fed Governor, Warsh has been a critic of the Fed’s post-2008 policies. He might advocate for a rules-based approach to monetary policy and a faster reduction of the Fed’s balance sheet. Glenn Hubbard: A former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, Hubbard is an academic known for market-oriented views on regulation and fiscal policy. The table below contrasts key policy leanings of the leading speculated candidates: Potential Candidate Current/Past Role Perceived Monetary Policy Stance Key Consideration Jerome Powell Sitting Fed Chair Centrist; Data-Dependent Continuity vs. Desire for Change Lael Brainard Fed Vice Chair Dovish-Leaning; Pro-Regulation Would be first woman appointed as Chair John Williams NY Fed President Centrist; Technocratic Deep institutional experience Kevin Warsh Former Fed Governor Hawkish; Rules-Based Could signal major policy shift Immediate Market and Economic Impacts Financial markets react sensitively to signals about Federal Reserve leadership. The mere announcement of a decision timeline can increase volatility in bond and equity markets. Investors meticulously parse the backgrounds of potential nominees for clues on future interest rate paths. A perceived hawkish candidate, likely to favor higher rates to combat inflation, might strengthen the U.S. dollar but pressure stock prices. Conversely, a dovish candidate could boost equity markets on hopes for easier financial conditions. Beyond markets, the decision affects Main Street economics. Interest rates directly influence the cost of borrowing for homes, cars, and business expansion. For example, small business owners seeking loans for growth monitor Fed policy closely. Furthermore, the chair’s approach to bank regulation influences credit availability. The Fed also plays a crucial role in overseeing payment systems and promoting financial stability, areas of growing importance with the rise of digital assets. Thus, the appointment’s impact extends far beyond Wall Street trading floors. Global Repercussions of the Choice The U.S. Federal Reserve functions as the world’s de facto central bank due to the dollar’s reserve currency status. Policy shifts in Washington ripple through global financial systems. Emerging markets, in particular, are vulnerable to changes in U.S. monetary policy. Tighter policy can trigger capital outflows from those nations, depreciating their currencies and increasing debt servicing costs. International bodies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) will analyze the nominee’s views on global economic cooperation. Additionally, the Fed chair often coordinates with peers at the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England. The next chair’s stance on currency swaps and international liquidity provisions will be critical during future crises. Therefore, allies and trading partners await this decision, understanding that U.S. monetary policy is a cornerstone of the global economic order. The choice will signal America’s economic priorities on the world stage for the coming term. Conclusion President Trump’s impending decision on the next Federal Reserve chair represents a defining moment for U.S. economic policy. Within weeks, a selection will set the course for interest rates, inflation control, and financial regulation. The choice between continuity and change carries weight for investors, businesses, and consumers domestically and internationally. As the White House deliberates, the core principles of the Fed’s dual mandate—maximum employment and stable prices—remain the ultimate benchmarks for success. The coming announcement will undoubtedly be one of the most scrutinized developments of the economic calendar. FAQs Q1: Who currently holds the position of Federal Reserve Chair? A1: Jerome Powell currently serves as the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. President Trump originally appointed him, and his term is subject to renewal or conclusion. Q2: What is the typical term length for a Federal Reserve Chair? A2: A full term for the Federal Reserve Chair is four years. However, a Chair may serve multiple terms if reappointed by the sitting President and confirmed by the Senate. Q3: How does the Federal Reserve Chair influence interest rates? A3: The Chair leads the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which votes on the target for the federal funds rate. This rate is the benchmark for short-term interest rates throughout the U.S. economy, influencing borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Q4: Why is the appointment of the Fed Chair considered non-partisan? A4: While appointed by the President, the Fed Chair is expected to make monetary policy decisions based on economic data and the Fed’s statutory mandates, independent of short-term political pressures. This independence is designed to maintain credibility in financial markets. Q5: What happens if a new Fed Chair is not confirmed by the Senate? A5: If a nominee is not confirmed, the President must put forward a new candidate. In the interim, the Vice Chair of the Fed would typically act as the presiding officer, ensuring the continuity of the central bank’s operations.

The CLARITY Act’s Legislative Journey Faces Unexpected Hurdles The Senate Banking Committee’s scheduled markup session for January 15th faced postponement following Coinbase’s dramatic withdrawal of support. This development created immediate uncertainty around the bipartisan legislation’s timeline. Committee members, however, maintain their commitment to finding common ground. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a leading Republican voice on digital assets, confirmed ongoing discussions aimed at reaching bipartisan agreement. These negotiations continue despite the recent complications. Transitioning from proposal to law requires navigating complex political terrain. The CLARITY Act represents years of legislative effort to establish clear cryptocurrency regulations. Lawmakers designed the bill to address regulatory gaps that have persisted since Bitcoin’s emergence. Market participants have long demanded regulatory certainty. This legislation attempts to provide that framework while balancing innovation with consumer protection. Coinbase’s Opposition: Four Critical Concerns Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, outlined specific objections that prompted its withdrawal of support. The company’s concerns center on four major provisions within the current bill draft: Tokenized Securities Ban: Coinbase argues the legislation creates a de facto prohibition on tokenized securities DeFi Restrictions: The bill potentially blocks decentralized finance while allowing unlimited financial information access Regulatory Framework: The proposed structure would subordinate the CFTC to the SEC, weakening commodities oversight Stablecoin Features: The legislation might ban reward features for stablecoins, limiting innovation These concerns reflect broader industry tensions about regulatory overreach. Market participants worry about stifling innovation through excessive restrictions. Conversely, regulators prioritize consumer protection and financial stability. This tension creates the central challenge for lawmakers crafting effective legislation. Historical Context: Crypto Regulation’s Evolving Landscape The CLARITY Act emerges from a decade of regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets. Previous legislative efforts have stalled repeatedly. The 117th Congress saw multiple cryptocurrency bills introduced without passage. Regulatory agencies have pursued enforcement actions instead of comprehensive legislation. This approach created a patchwork of guidance and legal uncertainty. Several key events shaped the current regulatory environment: Year Event Impact 2013 FinCEN issues first crypto guidance Established money transmission rules 2017 SEC’s DAO Report Applied securities laws to token sales 2020 OCC crypto custody letters Allowed banks to custody digital assets 2022 Executive Order on Digital Assets Coordinated whole-of-government approach 2024 Multiple enforcement actions Increased regulatory pressure on exchanges This historical context explains the urgency behind current legislative efforts. Market growth has outpaced regulatory frameworks. The CLARITY Act attempts to address this regulatory lag. Its passage would represent the first comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation in U.S. history. Bipartisan Negotiations Continue Despite Setbacks Senate Banking Committee members from both parties continue working toward compromise. These discussions address Coinbase’s concerns while maintaining core regulatory objectives. The legislation’s sponsors recognize industry input’s importance. They also balance consumer protection priorities. This delicate negotiation requires careful consideration of multiple stakeholders. Several factors contribute to ongoing optimism about eventual passage: Strong bipartisan support exists for clear cryptocurrency regulations Multiple committee members have digital asset expertise Previous legislative efforts established groundwork for compromise International regulatory developments create pressure for U.S. action Growing institutional adoption increases demand for regulatory clarity Transitioning from opposition to support requires addressing substantive concerns. Lawmakers must modify provisions causing industry alarm. They must also maintain regulatory effectiveness. This balancing act defines the current negotiation phase. Expert Perspectives on Legislative Prospects Financial regulation experts note several factors influencing the bill’s prospects. Former CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad emphasizes the need for clear jurisdictional lines. He argues that regulatory uncertainty harms both innovation and consumer protection. Academic researchers highlight international competitive considerations. Other nations have advanced comprehensive crypto frameworks. The United States risks falling behind without legislative action. Industry analysts point to growing institutional participation. Major financial firms now offer cryptocurrency services. These institutions require regulatory certainty for scaling operations. Their lobbying efforts support balanced legislation. This institutional pressure differs from earlier industry dynamics. It may influence legislative outcomes significantly. Market Implications of Regulatory Clarity The CLARITY Act’s passage would create immediate market impacts. Regulatory certainty typically increases institutional investment. Clear rules reduce compliance uncertainty for market participants. This reduction in regulatory risk could accelerate cryptocurrency adoption. Specific provisions would affect different market segments distinctly. Stablecoin regulation represents one critical component. The bill addresses concerns about payment system stability. It also considers consumer protection for stablecoin users. These provisions respond to previous stablecoin-related market disruptions. Properly designed regulations could enhance stablecoin utility and safety. DeFi provisions present particular complexity. Regulators must address decentralized systems’ unique characteristics. Traditional regulatory approaches may prove inadequate. The legislation attempts to balance innovation with necessary oversight. This balance remains challenging to achieve effectively. Conclusion The CLARITY Act’s legislative journey continues despite recent delays and industry opposition. Key senators maintain optimism about eventual passage. Bipartisan negotiations address substantive concerns while preserving regulatory objectives. This cryptocurrency market structure legislation represents a critical step toward comprehensive digital asset regulation. Its successful passage would provide much-needed clarity for market participants. The United States would establish a framework for responsible innovation in digital assets. This outcome remains achievable through continued negotiation and compromise. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act is proposed U.S. legislation establishing comprehensive cryptocurrency market structure regulations. It addresses jurisdictional questions between regulatory agencies and creates frameworks for digital asset oversight. Q2: Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the bill? Coinbase cited four main concerns: potential tokenized securities prohibition, DeFi restrictions, regulatory framework weakening the CFTC, and possible stablecoin reward feature bans. Q3: When will the Senate consider the CLARITY Act again? The January 15th markup session was postponed. No new date has been announced, but bipartisan negotiations continue toward reaching compromise language. Q4: How would the CLARITY Act affect cryptocurrency investors? The legislation would provide regulatory clarity, potentially increasing institutional participation and reducing compliance uncertainty for all market participants. Q5: What happens if the CLARITY Act doesn’t pass? Without comprehensive legislation, regulatory uncertainty would persist. Agencies would continue enforcement-based regulation, potentially creating inconsistent standards across jurisdictions.

Consequently, the investment banking giant is accelerating infrastructure development and regulatory engagement to capture these emerging opportunities. This strategic pivot, confirmed by CEO David Solomon, underscores a broader institutional shift toward digital assets, provided that clear regulatory frameworks, like the proposed CLARITY Act, establish necessary market certainty. Goldman Sachs Accelerates Asset Tokenization Infrastructure Asset tokenization, the process of converting rights to a real-world asset into a digital token on a blockchain, represents a core focus for Goldman Sachs. The bank is currently building dedicated internal infrastructure to support this technology. This development follows years of cautious exploration within the traditional finance sector. Tokenization promises significant efficiency gains, including enhanced liquidity, fractional ownership, and streamlined settlement processes for assets ranging from real estate and private equity to fine art and bonds. Goldman Sachs anticipates that institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets will begin in earnest during 2025. However, this timeline remains contingent upon regulatory clarity from U.S. policymakers. The bank’s strategy involves creating a seamless bridge between traditional capital markets and the evolving digital asset ecosystem. For instance, a tokenized private fund could enable faster capital calls and provide secondary market liquidity for qualified investors, fundamentally altering private market dynamics. The Regulatory Imperative: Engaging with Washington CEO David Solomon confirmed that Goldman Sachs has directly communicated its views on the proposed Crypto Market Structure Bill, known as the CLARITY Act, to lawmakers in Washington. This engagement is crucial. The banking sector requires well-defined rules concerning custody, issuance, trading, and compliance for digital assets. Clear regulations would mitigate operational and legal risks, thereby unlocking institutional capital at scale. Goldman’s proactive stance reflects its belief that regulatory frameworks, rather than technology alone, will dictate the pace of mainstream adoption. Exploring Prediction Markets as a Strategic Collaboration Parallel to its tokenization efforts, Goldman Sachs is exploring prediction markets as a novel growth area. Solomon stated the bank is in direct contact with leaders of major prediction market platforms to explore potential collaborations. Prediction markets allow participants to trade contracts based on the outcome of future events, aggregating crowd-sourced information into a price that reflects collective probability. From a financial institution’s perspective, these markets offer potential applications in risk assessment, hedging, and gauging market sentiment on geopolitical or economic events. A collaboration could involve providing liquidity, structuring financial products based on market data, or integrating prediction market insights into traditional investment research. This exploration signals Goldman’s interest in data-driven, alternative sources of alpha and market intelligence. Asset Tokenization: Digitizing real-world assets (RWAs) like bonds, real estate, and commodities on blockchain networks. Prediction Markets: Platforms for trading outcome-based contracts, useful for hedging and sentiment analysis. CLARITY Act: Proposed U.S. legislation aiming to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Institutional Infrastructure: The custody, trading, and compliance systems needed for large-scale crypto participation. Goldman Sachs’ Digital Asset Focus Areas: 2025 Outlook Strategic Area Primary Goal Key Dependency Asset Tokenization Unlock liquidity & efficiency for private markets Regulatory clarity on token classification & custody Prediction Markets Access new data & create structured products Establishing compliant partnerships & frameworks Regulatory Engagement Shape a workable digital asset market structure Bipartisan support for legislation like CLARITY Institutional Adoption Onboard traditional finance clients to crypto Mature infrastructure and proven use cases The Broader Context: Wall Street’s Digital Transformation Goldman Sachs’ announcement is not an isolated event. Instead, it reflects a calculated acceleration within a multi-year trend. Major global banks, including JPMorgan, BNY Mellon, and Citigroup, have all invested heavily in blockchain and digital asset divisions. The difference now is the transition from research and pilot projects to building scalable, revenue-generating business lines. The total value of tokenized real-world assets has seen compound growth, attracting institutional attention. This shift is driven by client demand, competitive pressure, and the maturation of underlying technology. Furthermore, jurisdictions like the EU with its MiCA regulation and Hong Kong with its licensing regime are creating viable regulatory environments, increasing the urgency for U.S. action. Goldman’s move positions it to capture first-mover advantages in servicing high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients seeking exposure to these new asset classes. Evidence and Expert Perspectives on the Trend Analysis from firms like Boston Consulting Group projects the tokenized asset market could reach $16 trillion by 2030. Similarly, major asset managers like BlackRock have launched tokenized funds on public blockchains. These developments provide tangible evidence supporting Goldman’s strategic direction. Experts note that banks possess the client relationships, regulatory expertise, and capital necessary to bridge the old and new financial worlds. Their entry is often seen as a validation of the technology’s long-term viability, moving beyond speculative crypto trading to foundational financial infrastructure. Conclusion Goldman Sachs’ focused push into asset tokenization and prediction markets marks a pivotal moment for institutional crypto adoption. By building infrastructure, engaging with regulators on the CLARITY Act, and seeking strategic collaborations, the bank is preparing for a future where digital and traditional finance converge. The success of this strategy hinges on clear regulations and the demonstrable economic benefits of tokenization. Ultimately, Goldman’s actions signal that the institutional adoption of blockchain technology is transitioning from a possibility to an imminent reality, with 2025 poised as a critical launch year. FAQs Q1: What is asset tokenization? Asset tokenization is the process of creating a digital representation of a real-world asset, like real estate or a bond, on a blockchain. This digital token can then be divided, traded, and settled with greater efficiency and transparency. Q2: Why are prediction markets relevant to a bank like Goldman Sachs? Prediction markets aggregate crowd-sourced information on event outcomes. Banks can use this data for risk modeling, sentiment analysis, and potentially to create new financial products for clients seeking to hedge against specific outcomes. Q3: What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act is proposed U.S. legislation aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and digital assets. It seeks to clarify rules for issuers, exchanges, and custodians, which institutions like Goldman Sachs require before fully committing capital. Q4: When does Goldman Sachs expect institutional crypto adoption to take off? Goldman Sachs anticipates institutional adoption could begin in earnest in 2025, but explicitly states this depends on the establishment of clear regulatory guidelines from U.S. policymakers. Q5: Is Goldman Sachs building its own blockchain? The available reporting indicates Goldman is building related infrastructure, which typically refers to custody, trading, and compliance systems. This likely involves integrating with existing blockchain networks rather than building a wholly new proprietary chain.

The immediate market reaction was led by KAITO, the token linked to the Kaito platform, which slid roughly 20% in a single day as investors digested what many saw as a structural threat rather than a short-term policy tweak. X Cracks Down on Rewarded Posting, Shaking InfoFi Projects The shift began with a public statement from Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, who said the company was revising its developer API rules to block applications that reward users for posting on the platform. We are revising our developer API policies: We will no longer allow apps that reward users for posting on X (aka “infofi”). This has led to a tremendous amount of AI slop & reply spam on the platform. We have revoked API access from these apps, so your X experience should… — Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) January 15, 2026 Bier said that these incentives had fueled a surge in low-quality replies, automated posts, and what he described as “AI slop,” degrading the overall user experience. X confirmed that API access had already been revoked for affected apps, with Bier adding that developers whose accounts were terminated could seek help transitioning their businesses to other platforms such as Threads or Bluesky. The announcement landed hard in crypto circles because many InfoFi projects are built around harvesting, analyzing, and monetizing X data. Platforms like Kaito aggregate posts from large crypto accounts to identify trending narratives and then reward users, often in tokens, for producing content or engagement. That model left them exposed to any restriction on API access or posting incentives. While X has not declared an outright ban on InfoFi as a category, the practical effect of cutting off rewarded posting has been to disrupt the core mechanics of several projects overnight. Market data reflected that shock as KAITO token fell from around $0.70 to about $0.57 within hours, down roughly 17% to 20% on the day, while trading volume jumped nearly 87% to more than $121 million, suggesting forced repositioning rather than thin liquidity. Source: Coingecko The token now trades more than 80% below its all-time high of $2.88. Cookie DAO’s COOKIE token followed a similar path, dropping more than 20% in 24 hours to roughly $0.038, with volume also rising, a sign that holders were reassessing exposure as uncertainty spread. Source: Coingecko Kaito, Cookie, Xeet Rethink structure After X Policy Shift Behind the price action lies a deeper debate about whether InfoFi’s incentive structures were sustainable. Critics had long argued that paying users to post encouraged attention farming and automated content, an accusation that gained credibility as timelines filled with repetitive, AI-generated replies. Following the announcement, Kaito founder Yu Hu said the company would sunset its “Yaps” and open incentive leaderboards, replacing them with Kaito Studio, a more selective, tier-based marketing platform designed to work across X, YouTube, TikTok, and other channels. https://t.co/K1J71SYCpy — Yu Hu (@Punk9277) January 15, 2026 Hu framed the shift as an alignment with both X’s policies and brands’ growing preference for targeted campaigns over mass distribution. Other platforms echoed that reassessment, with Cookie announcing it was shutting down its Snaps creator campaigns after discussions with X, citing the need to protect the integrity of its data products and remain compliant with platform rules. InfoFi is changing, and it’s time to sunset Snaps. This is our official announcement. pic.twitter.com/fUIzTZpTa8 — Cookie DAO (@cookiedotfun) January 15, 2026 Xeet, another project caught in the change, said all campaigns had been paused while it evaluated next steps and worked through outstanding payouts.

We have been assessing our next steps forward, and will send a communication on that soon. In the… — xeet (@xeetdotai) January 15, 2026 In each case, teams stressed that their broader analytics or data businesses would continue, but the rewarded-posting layer was no longer viable in its previous form. The episode has shown how dependent large parts of crypto’s social layer remain on a single Web2 platform. X’s use of automated moderation tools and AI-driven detection has turned it into a powerful gatekeeper, capable of reshaping entire business models with policy updates. It has also intensified discussion about alternatives, including decentralized social networks and multi-platform strategies, as builders seek to reduce single-point risk.

BlackRock has now raised $12.5 billion of its total $30 billion goal for its AI infrastructure partnership with Microsoft. BlackRock is investing in the power grids and energy sources needed to keep modern data centers running. They require so much constant and high-voltage power that industry experts estimate that data centers could consume up to 4% of all global energy by 2029. How is BlackRock supporting Microsoft’s AI plan? BlackRock Inc. has successfully raised $12.5 billion as part of its massive “Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership” with Microsoft Corp. The firm is now closer to its $30 billion goal for private equity investment. The company combined Global Infrastructure Partners’ (GIP’s) expertise with Microsoft’s technology to solve the “energy bottleneck” that threatens to slow down AI development. Larry Fink told analysts that mobilizing private money for these projects is the only way to meet the demand, as the costs are too high for any single government or company to handle alone. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink explained to analysts during a fourth-quarter earnings call that the AI partnership continues to attract a lot of money from investors who want to profit from the current tech boom. BlackRock recently reported that its total assets under management have hit $14 trillion for the first time due to record net inflows of nearly $700 billion over the full year of 2025. Fink described the current period as a time of “accelerating momentum.” He also added that clients are increasingly approaching BlackRock to handle complex infrastructure projects that require billions of dollars in upfront cash. Companies are investing in physical AI infrastructure Microsoft recently signed a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The project, called the Crane Clean Energy Center, will provide carbon-free electricity for Microsoft’s data centers. Investments like these in AI infrastructure have hurt Microsoft’s stock, with its shares dropping to $459 from a high of $555 in 2025. Investors have grown wary of the company’s strategy after it spent nearly $35 billion in a single quarter to build AI infrastructure. Through its partnership with BlackRock , Microsoft will be able to scale and develop its AI technology without putting the burden fully on its balance sheet. Meta also recently announced its own deals with three nuclear energy companies to secure 6.6 gigawatts of power. BlackRock’s partnership with Microsoft also includes Nvidia Corp. and the Abu Dhabi-backed investment group MGX. Additionally, Elon Musk’s xAI joined the partnership in early 2025. Nvidia functions as a technical advisor and helps to design the data centers so they are optimized for AI chips, while MGX provides massive amounts of capital from the United Arab Emirates. This collaboration allows the group to use “leverage,” which means taking on debt to increase their total spending power. While the initial goal is $30 billion in private equity, the partnership expects to eventually reach $100 billion in total investments. This money will primarily be spent in the United States, but some will also go to U.S. partner countries. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

If this prediction holds true, XRP could reach a new all-time high of $18.40 per coin. Forecast Indicates XRP Might Rival Ethereum Bird’s forecast hinges on the XRP/BTC ratio, which he predicts will reach 1:5,000 by the end of 2026. This means that 5,000 XRP would be equivalent to 1 Bitcoin (BTC). Currently, the XRP/BTC ratio trades at approximately 0.00002235. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bill Draft Criticized For Allowing Continued Developer Prosecution For Bird’s envisioned target to materialize, the ratio must increase to 0.0002 BTC per token, representing a substantial gain of around 794% from current levels. With a total supply of 100 billion coins, this price projection implies an overall valuation of approximately $1.84 trillion for XRP. Such a figure would place the cryptocurrency in close competition with Ethereum—and striking distance of Bitcoin’s market cap. Additional Price Scenarios For The Altcoin Market expert Sam Daodu also outlined alternative scenarios for XRP’s future performance. In a base case, where the altcoin garners continued institutional support but doesn’t close the gap with Bitcoin’s market capitalization, the price could range between $3 and $4. This outcome would depend on exchange traded funds (ETFs) attracting a “few billion in assets” while Bitcoin’s dominance falls to the 40–50% range during a broader altcoin rotation. Related Reading: Zcash Foundation Investigation Closed: SEC Decision Sparks 12% Jump In ZEC Price Conversely, there exists a bear case where macroeconomic challenges or obstacles within the crypto ecosystem could hinder XRP’s price growth. Factors such as geopolitical instability could redirect capital back to Bitcoin and gold, while banks might opt for private ledgers and established stablecoins instead of adopting XRP. Monthly escrow releases from Ripple of 1 billion coins, accompanied by a potential diminishing exchange-traded fund demand, might cap any potential upside action for the cryptocurrency, leaving it to trade around its current trading prices of $2.

It has moved above several resistance zones, and analysts are tracking a possible move toward higher levels. Breakout Pattern Signals Shift in Trend According to analyst Marzell, ETH has come out of a falling wedge pattern and is maintaining above the breakout point. Such a pattern, coupled with alignment at Fibonacci levels, can be a good indication that a trend change is in progress. ETH has also cleared the 0.382 retracement level, which normally favors continuation upon retention. Marzell shared target projections for ETH at $4,950, $5,760, and $6,690, based on Fibonacci extension levels. They stated, “Momentum is turning bullish as key fib levels align,” indicating that the structure remains favorable unless key levels break down. ETH has yet to confirm a move above the $3,400 level. If that happens, analysts expect higher upside potential. If not, a return to the $3,200 support range could follow. CW reported that a new CME gap has formed near $3,330, and another remains open closer to $3,000. These areas may attract the price action in the short term, depending on broader market moves. A new $ETH CME gap has formed. This gap exist since $3,325.

This zone is marked as a key area by analysts watching for continued strength across altcoins. Moreover, another setup shared by Kamran Asghar shows ETH breaking out of a symmetrical triangle after several months of sideways movement. Current price action has cleared the triangle’s upper range, with a move toward the $4,200 resistance zone now in view. Activity on the Ethereum network is also rising. DustyBC Crypto reported a new high of 2.6 million daily transactions. Meanwhile, as CryptoPotato recently reported , futures data shows open interest on Binance rising to $8.6 billion, the highest level since October 2025. This follows a recovery from lower levels after recent liquidations.

The spokesperson emphasized the project's commitment to moving forward despite the exploit that affected users of the Plasma Bridge. The marketing lead shared details about the ”SHIB Owes You” initiative through her X account. This compensation framework aims to address losses suffered by users during the hack. An AI-generated video accompanied the announcement, featuring major tokens from the ecosystem, including SHIB, LEASH, BONE, and TREAT, along with the WoofSwap decentralized exchange. Understanding the SOU Compensation Framework The SOU system represents a dual-layer approach to recovering user funds lost in the exploit. Lucie described the initiative as centered on accountability and transparency. The framework provides on-chain proof of claims and establishes a clear path for recovery. As previously mentioned in our report, the first layer operates on the Ethereum blockchain. SOU NFTs serve as an accounting mechanism that documents individual user losses. The Shiba Inu development team manages this component directly. Each NFT represents a verified claim tied to the Plasma Bridge incident. The second layer functions on the Binance Smart Chain as a community-driven recovery effort. This component focuses on fundraising to reimburse affected users. The separation between accounting and recovery allows for transparent tracking while enabling broader community participation in the restoration process. Lucie's message stressed that the development team continues building despite setbacks. Her statement ”builders rebuild” reflects the project's determination to restore trust and functionality. The SOU initiative demonstrates a structured response to the crisis rather than abandoning affected users. SHIB Burn Rate Surges Over 900 Percent Community activity has shown renewed vigor in token burning efforts. Data from Shibburn reveals a dramatic increase in the daily burn rate. The metric jumped 910.98% in a 24-hour period, signaling coordinated action from SHIB holders. The community destroyed 4,369,584 SHIB tokens during this timeframe. Four separate transactions sent these coins to permanently inaccessible wallet addresses. The largest single burn removed 2,717,708 tokens from circulation. Another transaction eliminated 1,000,000 SHIB. This spike follows three consecutive days of zero burning activity. The burn rate had remained in negative territory during that period. An earlier update from January 9 showed minimal activity, with only 19,000 SHIB burned and a burn rate decline of 98.56%. At the time of writing, SHIB trades at around $0.00000834, down 5.01% in the last 24 hours.

After months of wide swings and failed follow-throughs above $3,000, the structure on the monthly timeframe chart is beginning to look bullish in a way that traders should take seriously. A recent technical breakdown shared by Merlijn The Trader on X shows that Ethereum is approaching a moment where consolidation could give way to forceful expansion, with $5,000 as the most important inflection point. Bullish Pennant Says Bullish Momentum About To Be Unlocked The chart showing the technical analysis from Merlijn shows a bullish pennant forming on Ethereum’s monthly timeframe. This bullish pennant shows that price action has been compressing between a rising support line and a descending resistance line, and this has created a narrowing structure since 2021. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Are Surging Today Ethereum briefly pushed above the upper boundary of this pennant in 2025, rallying to just under the $5,000 mark before momentum faded and corrective moves followed. Since then, price action appears to be gravitating back toward the former resistance line, now acting as a key area of interest. As it stands, Ethereum is now retesting the upper trendline of this bullish pennant for a final upward move. Based on this projection, the first major barrier for Ethereum to break is around $3,300. A clean break above that level would likely open a path toward $3,600, an area that previously acted as a turning point during past rallies. The most consequential zone, however, is around the August 2025 all-time high of $5,000. A break above this zone would unlock bullish momentum based on the bullish pennant and play out in the majority of 2026. How Can This Breakout Play Out? Merlijn’s chart doesn’t stop at the breakout trigger once it breaks above the upper trendline of the pennant. It sketches a full road map for how the move could unfold once Ethereum leaves the pennant. The first step in that projection is a push above $3,600 before a more meaningful test around $5,000. Once Ethereum is able to break above $5,000, then the door is open for new price highs. Related Reading: Why The Ethereum Price Could Bounce Above $3,500 Soon However, the breakout is expected to come with volatility and retests, not a straight line upward, but still resolves higher if the pennant thesis holds. From $5,000, the projection turns into a two-stage expansion. The first stage shows a force move, where Ethereum goes on a rally to as high as $6,000, then chops through another sharp dip to $4,000 and another recovery sequence before the larger leg higher. The larger leg, higher projected on the chart, points to $8,400 as the final price target zone for Ethereum.

The landmark trial demonstrates how tokenized bonds can be seamlessly issued, exchanged, settled, and serviced across both traditional financial systems and blockchain platforms, all while facilitating payments in fiat currency and digital currencies, including stablecoins. Swift goes all-in on tokenized assets According to the announcement shared on X, Swift’s recent work with Chainlink and UBS Asset Management has successfully demonstrated that connecting tokenized assets to existing payment rails is possible. Swift reportedly worked closely with SG-FORGE, leveraging their digital asset platform and euro-donominated stablecoin EURCV. This trial was focused on critical capital markets processes, including delivery-versus-payment settlement of tokenized bonds, interest payouts, and redemption of the bonds, and support for fiat and stablecoin payments. According to the post, BNP Paribas Securities Services and Intesa Sanpaolo played critical roles during the trial, acting as paying agents and custodians, handling standard institutional functions, and in the process, confirming what blockchain adoption proponents already knew: tokenized assets can integrate with established market roles and infrastructure. This trial has been described as the first time Swift has orchestrated tokenized asset transactions as a single coordinated process bridging blockchain and tradfi systems. The pilot has also highlighted Swift’s goal of acting as a neutral coordination layer between traditional finance systems and emerging blockchain ecosystems. It builds on Swift’s broader montage of digital asset experiments, which have involved various partners, including UBS and Chainlink. Citi, HSBC, and several others, while leveraging standards like ISO 20022 . What’s next after the Swift pilot? According to Swift, since this series of successful trials is now completed, they are now focused on adding a blockchain-based ledger to their technology infrastructure. This ledger is expected to initially focus on enabling real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments, designed in collaboration with over 30 banks worldwide. “In a multi-modal world where new assets and platforms are proliferating, we’re working alongside our community to drive a new era of interoperability,” official documents read. “Our aim is to seamlessly interconnect emerging networks and new forms of value, delivering a best-in-class experience aligned with the G20 objectives for cross-border payments.” All of that is supposed to be built on a critical foundation of trust and operational excellence, enabling instant and frictionless transactions across the global financial ecosystem. The move is a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of tokenization in capital markets and is expected to connect fragmented digital ecosystems without needing existing institutions to abandon their current rails and models.

Regulatory Clarity and Whale Moves in Focus,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/01/when-will-xrp-price-increase-regulatory-clarity-and-whale-moves-in-focus,"XRP’s price outlook remains closely tied to regulatory developments in the United States and positioning by large holders. While short-term volatility continues to shape price action, longer-term catalysts—particularly legal clarity and institutional access—could play a decisive role in determining the token’s next major move. Communication becomes more effective when it reflects what the market is paying attention to, and Outset PR incorporates this principle into its workflow. The agency follows ongoing developments to understand when a narrative is most likely to resonate. Regulatory Clarity as a Potential Turning Point One of the most significant factors hanging over XRP is the pending U.S. Clarity Act, with a decision expected by March 2026. If approved, the legislation could formally classify XRP as a non-security, removing a long-standing source of uncertainty that has limited broader institutional adoption. Such a designation would reduce litigation risk for exchanges and financial institutions, potentially opening the door to wider banking integrations and regulated investment products. Historically, regulatory clarity has acted as a strong tailwind for assets that transition from legal ambiguity to formal recognition. Institutional Catalysts and ETF Expectations Beyond legislation, the possibility of XRP-related exchange-traded products remains a key market focus. Any acceleration in ETF approvals or filings could materially improve liquidity and demand dynamics. In this scenario, XRP could test its 200-day moving average near $2.57, a level that has capped upside attempts in recent months. However, the derivatives market introduces counterbalancing risks. Elevated leverage leaves XRP vulnerable to sharp corrections if positions unwind, particularly during periods of broader market stress. Whale Activity and Key Price Levels Large-holder behavior continues to influence short-term price direction. Accumulation or distribution by whales often precedes directional moves, making on-chain activity an important signal to monitor alongside macro developments. From a technical standpoint, the $2.30–$2.40 range has emerged as a critical zone. A sustained breakout above this area could confirm a new upward leg, especially if accompanied by rising spot volume and reduced derivatives funding rates. On the downside, failure to hold this range may expose XRP to a pullback toward the $1.80 support level, where previous demand has absorbed selling pressure. Why Timing and Narrative Matter in Regulation-Driven Markets Markets driven by regulatory catalysts tend to reward precision rather than volume—both in capital deployment and in communication. According to Outset PR , a crypto-focused public relations agency working closely with founders and C-level teams, regulatory inflection points require messaging that aligns with market readiness rather than broad, untargeted exposure. Outset PR builds PR strategies using both retrospective and real-time metrics, allowing campaigns to align with moments when regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and market structure converge. Instead of vague visibility goals, campaigns are structured around concrete outcomes: publication timing, narrative relevance, and measurable impact. The agency avoids standardized outreach models in favor of tailored strategies calibrated to a project’s growth stage, budget, and regulatory positioning. This approach becomes particularly relevant during periods like XRP’s current phase, where legal developments shape not only price action but also media demand and investor perception. Outset PR Uses Proprietary Analytics for Market-Aware Distribution A core part of Outset PR’s methodology lies in its internal media analytics, Outset Data Pulse. By combining organic editorial placements with SEO and targeted distribution, the agency aims to place client narratives where discovery is highest—rather than where coverage is simply easiest to obtain. This data-led approach has delivered measurable results. For example, crypto exchange ChangeNOW recorded a sustained 40% increase in reach after Outset PR amplified organic coverage through Google Discover using its proprietary distribution engine. XRP Long-Term Price Outlook XRP’s trajectory in 2026 appears less dependent on timing and more on catalyst resolution. Regulatory clarity through the Clarity Act, progress toward ETF approval, and decisive whale positioning will likely determine whether XRP can transition from range-bound trading into a sustained uptrend. Until those factors align, price action may remain reactive rather than directional, with traders closely watching regulatory headlines and large-scale flows for confirmation of the next move.

The allegations center on Sun’s substantial financial ties to the Trump family and the subsequent pause in the civil fraud case against him. Representative Maxine Waters sent a detailed letter to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins on January 15, highlighting what she describes as a “ troubling ” pattern of dropped enforcement actions following significant crypto industry donations to President Trump’s campaign and businesses. The letter demands answers about whether political considerations influenced regulatory decisions. Source: House Financial Services Committee Democrats Financial Connections Raise Red Flags The Democrats’ letter outlines Sun’s extensive financial relationship with Trump family ventures , noting his $75 million investment in World Liberty Financial through multiple purchases and his position as an official adviser to the project. Sun became the top holder of Trump’s memecoin, earning an invitation to a May 2025 White House dinner for major investors. Waters wrote that Sun’s activities “ create the unmistakable appearance of a pay-to-play arrangement: a defendant to an SEC enforcement action pours tens of millions into ventures tied to the President’s family, and shortly thereafter his case is stayed. “ The letter emphasizes that crypto companies donated at least $85 million to Trump’s reelection campaign, with firms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Ripple contributing at least $1 million each to his inauguration. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has announced a donation of $25 million to the pro-crypto super PAC Fairshake. #Coinbase #Fairshake https://t.co/4YOGU6AekK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 3, 2024 The timeline proves particularly significant. The SEC filed its fraud lawsuit against Sun in March 2023 , alleging he orchestrated unlawful token sales and manipulated trading volumes. Despite building, as Waters describes, a strong case with favorable judicial rulings, the agency requested a stay in February 2025 to explore a settlement. Strong Legal Case Put on Hold The original SEC complaint detailed serious allegations against Sun and his companies. Regulators claimed Sun “ engineered the offer and sale of two crypto asset securities ” without proper registration while directing “ hundreds of thousands of TRX wash trades ” that generated approximately $31 million from unsuspecting investors. According to Waters, Judge Vernon Broderick of the Southern District of New York sustained core allegations in a parallel private class action, finding that plaintiffs plausibly alleged Sun and Tron illegally sold TRX as an unregistered security. Several celebrities who promoted Sun’s tokens settled SEC charges and paid fines totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars . Waters emphasized the case’s strength, stating “ the SEC’s case was not speculative or marginal—it was built on a rigorous investigation that resulted in detailed allegations of systematic securities violations confirmed by judicial rulings and co-defendant settlements. “ No adverse rulings had impaired the SEC’s position before the stay. Broader Enforcement Retreat Questioned Beyond the Sun case, Democrats expressed alarm over the SEC’s dismissal of major enforcement actions against Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken . The agency dropped its Binance case in May 2025 “ as an exercise of discretion ” despite favorable court rulings, while Coinbase and Kraken cases ended through joint stipulations citing the agency’s “ ongoing efforts to reform its regulatory approach. “ Waters wrote that “ the unjustified decision by the SEC to walk away from these and other meritorious enforcement cases against crypto firms has created the unmistakable inference of a pay-to-play scheme. “ She warned that this retreat “ has left a vacuum whereby securities violations by crypto firms are not enforced and U.S. investors are not protected. “ The letter demands that the SEC either request that the court lift the stay and litigate Sun’s case in accordance with its original complaint or reach a settlement reflecting the case’s strength.

This funding milestone, announced in early 2025, underscores the explosive demand for professional-grade AI video tools and marks Higgsfield’s rapid ascent from launch to unicorn status in under a year. Higgsfield AI Secures Major Funding and Unicorn Status The recent $80 million investment represents a significant extension to Higgsfield’s initial $50 million Series A round, which closed in September 2024. Consequently, the company’s total Series A funding now stands at $130 million. Leading venture firms Accel, AI Capital Partners, Menlo Ventures, and GFT Ventures participated in this latest round. This substantial capital infusion validates the platform’s technology and its aggressive growth trajectory within the competitive AI video generation market. Founded by Alex Mashrabov, Higgsfield benefits deeply from his expertise. Previously, Mashrabov served as Head of Generative AI at Snap, following the social media giant’s $166 million acquisition of his prior venture, AI Factory, in 2020. His background provides Higgsfield with critical insights into both cutting-edge AI development and the practical needs of social media platforms and creators. Exponential User and Revenue Growth Trajectory Higgsfield’s growth metrics reveal a company scaling at a breathtaking pace. Merely five months after its public launch, the platform amassed 11 million users. Currently, just nine months post-launch, its user base has swelled to over 15 million. More impressively, the company reports it is now operating at a $200 million annual revenue run rate. This figure doubled from a $100 million trajectory in approximately two months, indicating remarkable monetization velocity. The startup contends that this growth rate places it in rare company, outpacing the early trajectories of notable firms like Lovable, Cursor, OpenAI, Slack, and Zoom. This claim, while bold, is supported by its publicly disclosed user and financial data. The platform’s primary tool allows consumers, creators, and professional teams to generate and edit videos using artificial intelligence, streamlining content production for digital media. Strategic Pivot to Professional Social Media Marketing A key strategic shift is evident in Higgsfield’s recent positioning. Initially perceived as a consumer-focused “AI slop” engine for casual content, the company now emphasizes its adoption by professional social media marketers. This repositioning aims to distance the platform from associations with low-quality, automated content and align it with serious business applications. Company statements highlight that professional use is a “major sign that the platform adoption has evolved beyond casual content creation.” However, the platform’s capability for generating controversial content remains a noted challenge. For instance, last month, users employed Higgsfield to create a video titled “Island Holiday,” which depicted individuals mentioned in the Epstein files alongside fictional characters. This incident highlights the ongoing ethical and moderation dilemmas facing powerful generative AI tools. Conversely, the platform also hosts a vast array of professional projects focused on fashion, storytelling, and branded content, showcasing its legitimate utility. The Competitive Landscape of AI Video Generation Higgsfield’s rise occurs within a fiercely competitive arena. The AI video generation market includes established players and well-funded newcomers, all vying for market share. The table below contrasts Higgsfield’s recent position with general market dynamics: Market Factor Higgsfield’s Position Industry Context Valuation & Funding $1.3B valuation; $130M Series A. High investor confidence in generative AI verticals. User Growth 15M+ users in 9 months. Demonstrates strong product-market fit and virality. Revenue Model $200M annual run rate. Focus on B2B and professional creator monetization. Key Differentiator Founder’s Snap & AI Factory expertise. Deep integration insights for social media workflows. Primary Challenge Content moderation and brand safety. Universal issue for generative AI platforms. This competitive context requires Higgsfield to continuously innovate. Its focus on serving professional social media teams could provide a durable moat, as these users demand reliability, brand-safe outputs, and seamless integration into existing content calendars and publishing tools. Founder Expertise and Technology Backbone The credibility of Higgsfield is inextricably linked to its founder, Alex Mashrabov. His journey from co-founding AI Factory to leading generative AI at Snap provides a unique blend of startup and corporate-scale AI experience. This expertise is crucial for developing complex video generation models that are both technologically robust and practically usable. The company’s underlying technology likely builds upon advancements from both AI Factory’s computer vision work and the large-scale AI infrastructure challenges Mashrabov encountered at Snap. Industry analysts note that successful AI startups often combine technical brilliance with acute understanding of a specific domain. Higgsfield’s apparent domain is the social media content creation pipeline. By tailoring its AI to the needs of marketers and creators who must produce high volumes of engaging video, the company addresses a clear and pressing pain point in the digital economy. Future Roadmap and Industry Implications With $130 million in new capital, Higgsfield’s immediate roadmap will likely focus on several key areas: Technology R&D: Enhancing video quality, realism, and controllability for professional users. Enterprise Features: Developing collaboration tools, API access, and compliance suites for larger marketing teams. Global Expansion: Scaling infrastructure and localization to support its growing international user base. Ethical AI Development: Investing in more sophisticated content moderation and usage policy enforcement systems. This funding round signals sustained venture capital interest in applied generative AI beyond just text and image models. Video, as a richer and more complex medium, represents a significant frontier.

Citron Research claimed the exchange fears tokenization rival Securitize more than unclear regulation. The short seller argued that Coinbase pulled back support for the CLARITY Act because cleaner rules could strengthen competitors. The dispute surfaced as Securitize moves closer to public markets through a planned SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners II. Citron Claims Coinbase Wants Control, Not Competition Citron Research criticized Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong after he discussed tokenized assets on CNBC. The firm said Coinbase wants lawmakers to clarify crypto rules while limiting rivals. Hence, Citron framed Coinbase’s stance as defensive rather than industry focused. Citron argued that Coinbase earns meaningful revenue from stablecoin yield programs. Consequently, it claimed Coinbase fears losing that edge if tokenized securities grow faster. Tokenized equities could unlock new trading options for investors. However, they could also reduce Coinbase’s influence in key areas. Coinbase withdrew support for the CLARITY Act late Wednesday. The company said the bill could block tokenized equity products in practice. Additionally, the Senate Banking Committee canceled a scheduled markup session shortly after. Securitize Holds Licenses and Moves Toward a SPAC Listing Securitize operates as a tokenization platform that focuses on securities. Citron said that model already fits existing legal frameworks. Moreover, it argued the firm holds the licenses needed to issue tokenized securities. That gives Securitize an advantage if lawmakers create clearer rules. Securitize has already issued more than $4 billion worth of tokenized assets. Besides, it has support from major financial names. Citron highlighted BlackRock as a key backer. It described the situation as a clash between Coinbase and powerful Wall Street allies. Wider Battle Over Tokenized Markets The clash adds pressure to the debate around tokenized equities in the United States. Tokenized shares could shorten settlement times and expand access. Significantly, they could also reshape how investors lend and trade securities. Coinbase sits in a complicated spot in that race. Coinbase Ventures invested in Securitize during a 2018 fundraising round. However, Citron suggested the strategic alignment has shifted as tokenization moves mainstream. Cantor Equity Partners II plans to take Securitize public through a SPAC deal. The timeline points to the first half of 2026.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-15 19:52:28

Over the past two years, some of the most popular cards have achieved monthly volumes of $1.5B. Crypto card usage has picked up since 2023, expanding from $100M in monthly payments to over $1.5B. Crypto cards were attempted multiple times, with projects facing difficulties due to unclear regulations. On average, annual growth reached 106%, driven by both adoption and an improved tech stack. Crypto cards use the infrastructure of VISA and Mastercard, while facilitating crypto payments. Usage picked up as stablecoins became the main payment infrastructure. While initial crypto cards could spend other tokens, stablecoins were the perfect fit for predictable payments. Payments in 2025 reached $18B, almost even with the $19B in payments from P2P stablecoin usage, based on Artemis data . VISA carries more than 90% of crypto cards Cards now rely on a stabilized stack, using the established VISA and Mastercard networks. The next layer includes card program managers, who have become more reliable and less likely to cancel cards. The consumer-facing elements are the apps and products that tie the card to crypto wallets. VISA, through early legacy partnerships, took over 90% of the on-chain card volume. The card issuer established links with the earliest infrastructure providers. VISA uses program managers that handle the banking side of settlement and the swap between crypto assets and fiat. Additionally, cards expanded through companies like Rain and Reap, which offer full-stack services, including card issuance. Mastercard expands its crypto cards through direct partnerships with exchanges. Issuers include Revolut, Bybit, and Gemini. Mastercard’s volumes reflect the size of the exchange user bases, resulting in a smaller volume. Crypto cards often circumvent bank dependencies and offer cheaper transactions. Full-stack issuers are also capturing the trend of fintech apps with a blockchain component. Crypto cards capture emerging markets, stablecoin whales Crypto cards are used as a way to offset inflation or find a more convenient payment tool. As a result, crypto cards found wide adoption in India and Argentina, especially for spending USDC. For developed markets, crypto cards solve the problem for large-scale stablecoin owners. Cards allow more convenient spending without the need to swap or move funds. Crypto cards also boost the adoption of stablecoins for merchants. A card remains the best-known interface, while stablecoin apps face slower adoption. Cards already offer the acceptance, while VISA and the fintech apps handle the payment process seamlessly. Crypto card payments still settle through fiat, but require no special merchant integration. The conversion of stablecoins to fiat happens before settlement, making the transaction similar to any other VISA or Mastercard transfer. Partner banks usually settle the fiat side of the payment, and include Lead Bank and Cross River Bank. Apps like Rain handle the stablecoin liquidation or the selling of crypto assets.

57194558,657996,1768506952,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57194558.jpeg,House Democrats Push SEC Chair To Resume Crypto Enforcement Actions,https://bitcoinist.com/democrats-push-sec-chair-resume-crypto-enforcement/,"In a critical week for the cryptocurrency industry, following the delayed markup of the Crypto Market Structure bill (CLARITY Act), House Democrats are calling on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, Paul Atkins, to reinstate enforcement actions against crypto firms. The letter , dated January 15, was signed by Representatives Maxine Waters, Sean Casten, and Brad Sherman, who expressed concerns regarding the SEC’s recent retreat to investigate and prosecute alleged violations related to “digital asset securities.” House Democrats’ Allegations The representatives highlighted that since January 2025, the SEC has dismissed or closed more than a dozen cases involving crypto-related activities, including litigations against major players like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Just this week, the SEC also closed its case against the Zcash Foundation. In their letter, the lawmakers alleged that given the industry’s “troubling history of harming investors,” the SEC’s decision to pull back raises serious questions about its priorities and effectiveness. They warned that this shift puts both investors and the broader US economy at considerable risk. Moreover, the representatives highlighted unprecedented lobbying and monetary contributions to political figures, including President Trump and his associates, from the digital asset sector. They pointed out that this could have influenced the SEC’s decision to abandon a majority of its crypto enforcement actions. Alleged Conflicts Of Interest Between Trump And Crypto These concerns follows months of allegations from the Democratic Party suggesting conflicts of interest between the Trump administration and the crypto industry, particularly highlighted by last year’s pardon for former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and connections to the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial (WLFI). According to the lawmakers, the SEC’s choice to walk away from these enforcement cases has raised suspicions of a possible pay-to-play dynamic. They argued that allowing violators of securities laws to escape without repercussions contradicts the SEC’s primary responsibility. Furthermore, the Representatives claim that recent statements by Chair Atkins, who said that ‘most crypto tokens are not securities’, have caused confusion. The Democrats further pointed out that this lack of enforcement against digital assets leaves investors “vulnerable” and allegedly fails to protect them from potential violations in the market.

Among the rising projects, GeeFi stands out for its decentralized wallet that prioritizes privacy, security, and a user-friendly experience. The most recent update to the GeeFi app brings $GEE token presale integration, and paves the way for a decentralized exchange (DEX) and crypto-to-fiat card features, signaling a thoughtful push toward an all-in-one digital asset platform. GeeFi’s approach is less about following hype and more about delivering meaningful improvements to the digital asset management landscape. With a focus on real user needs and steady platform development, GeeFi is positioning itself as a strong candidate for future growth. A Wallet Designed with the User in Mind GeeFi’s decentralized wallet addresses a core challenge in crypto: making asset management simple and secure. Whether you’re new to digital currencies or experienced with DeFi, the current GeeFi interface is designed for accessibility. Enhanced encryption and privacy protocols ensure users maintain full control over both their funds and personal information. The latest app update is already live, reflecting the team’s ongoing commitment to privacy, security, and transparency. These features are essential in today’s environment, where users want effective solutions without sacrificing security standards. Presale Progress: What to Know The $GEE token presale has made considerable progress, with Phase 3 now well underway. Over 90% of tokens for this phase have been sold, equating to less than 3 million tokens remaining and more than $2.6 million raised so far. While demand has been strong, there is still an opportunity for interested investors to participate before the price adjusts in the next round. The presale structure offers early participants a fixed price of $0.10 per token, ahead of the scheduled listing price of $0.40 . It’s important to remember that while early access can present advantages, GeeFi’s core value remains rooted in the usability and security of its platform, not just short-term scarcity or trends. Understanding the Investment Potential GeeFi’s vision extends beyond the current presale. As the ecosystem grows with the introduction of a DEX and the Crypto Card, the token’s utility and demand are expected to increase. Market analysts have suggested the potential for $GEE to reach $3.00 in the future, enhanced by the platform’s expanding features and user base. For those considering an investment, a $1,000 purchase at the current price would secure 10,000 tokens. As GeeFi hits these projected milestones, the growth potential is undeniable, driven by the platform’s consistent development and the rapidly accelerating adoption of its ecosystem. Added Value: Bonus Programs and Community Engagement GeeFi values its early supporters by offering an upcoming bonus program for initial investors. Alongside this, staking options enable token holders to earn additional returns over time, and a 5% referral system encourages community growth and rewards those who help expand the network. These programs reflect GeeFi’s broader mission of building an active, invested community around its platform, supporting organic network effects as adoption continues. Looking Ahead GeeFi’s development signals more than a passing trend, it represents a dedicated effort to create a secure and accessible decentralized wallet. By combining user-friendly design with high security and privacy standards, the project is set to resonate with a broad range of crypto users. As Ethereum highlights the increasing market appetite for decentralized solutions, GeeFi offers an intriguing option for those seeking both innovation and practicality. The current presale stage presents a chance to be an early supporter, but the long-term value rests on the platform’s commitment to quality and user empowerment.

As the crypto prices decline, traders tend to divert capital to projects with more defined utility or more fundamentals. That change is currently becoming reflected in interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cheap cryptocurrency with protocol launch catalysts. Market pundits are wondering whether this is a change in terms of what crypto to buy now. Pepecoin (PEPE) One of the higher-ranking meme tokens in the crypto world is pepecoin (PEPE). It is trading at around $0.000006 and it has a market cap of about $2.5B. PEPE has emerged due to community interest and viral attention like many other meme coins. These can rest on the prices without much hesitation but they may not be a good long term price support. Considering the crypto charts, PEPE has resistance at major levels. A zone traders resistance is observed to be in the range, around $0.000008 and this is where the previous rallies have leveled and profit squeegee has been used. The stronger resistance band seems to have been nearer to $0.000010 as this is the nearest mark to both the psychological and technical barrier. When PEPE ruptures on these levels with volume, the sentiment may be enhanced. However, with no obvious drivers of growth, it may be difficult to emerge out of these zones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an upcoming cheap crypto pegged to a decentralized lending protocol which is anticipated to launch its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet in early 2026. The system is developed to enable the lending and borrowing of assets by pooled contracts as opposed to matching individually. When the protocol is operational, suppliers will get mtTokens which will reflect their percentage of a pool and their interest in this pool. The presale of MUTM started with an opening price of $0.01 in early 2025 and has risen in stages until it reaches $0.04 which is approximately 300% higher than its initial stages. It is estimated that at the time of launch, prices will be $0.06, and therefore early presale holders will be at a 500% upside opportunity at the time of launch, provided the markets and adoption work. Mutuum Finance has collected a total of $19.8M to date, and over 18,800 of the holders have been sold and 830M of the tokens have sold. PEPE vs MUTM Price Predictions The market commentators tracking meme coins will tend to warn that PEPE has a finite ceiling because of its design. In the absence of a roadmap that is connected with actual utilization, analysts believe PEPE could continue to trade within sideways movements or within the regions that are already known to have resistance without any real breakouts. There are predictions that even in a robust bull cycle, PEPE may not break out of the $0.000010 level without another outburst of viral hype or a massive burn of a large number of tokens. Such a move is but a short-term payoff to risk when it comes to the investors posing questions on what they can buy as long-term returns on crypto. In contrast, the price prospectus of Mutuum Finance indicates the design of its protocol. Since the token will be pegged to a lending market which is likely to be launched, analysts expect the crypto to perform better than most of the meme coins once it starts being used. In a bullish case, certain predictions indicate that MUTM could be trading more than $0.20 in 12-18 months after launch in case the revenue begins to flow and exchanges list the token. Whale Allocations and Security One reason that Mutuum Finance appears in some lists of cheap crypto to buy now is because of its security and community incentives. The protocol passed an independent audit by Halborn and received 90/100 in a CertiK scan of the token. It also has a code bug bounty program with a reward of $50,000 to find code vulnerabilities before release of the mainnet. There is increased investor activity. Whale allocations have been rising in the presale stages, a fact that some market commentators view as confidence. Another feature of the project is a 24 hour leaderboard where the best contributor is rewarded with $500 of MUTM which could be used as a form of gamification and therefore increase participation. With the volatile crypto prices and the changing stories, a comparison of the developed meme coins such as PEPE to the ones currently being developed in protocols will show the line of thought of the investors. Traders seeking crypto to purchase at the moment can put emphasis on not just the charts and resistance zones but also fundamentals and protocol execution. The presale and future V1 launch of Mutuum Finance may have a varying risk-reward curve in comparison to a token using community sentiment as a primary driver.

This micro-level focus can obscure the larger trends that truly drive the token’s growth. Understanding XRP’s broader liquidity flows and institutional accumulation is essential for positioning effectively and capturing long-term gains. Egrag Crypto highlighted this perspective in a recent post on X, drawing attention to a “great divergence” in XRP’s current market behavior. While retail panic selling pushed the price down to $2.05, institutional flows painted a dramatically different picture. ETF holdings steadily increased, and smart money inflows reached $1.22 billion—an all-time high. Egrag Crypto emphasized that these macro trends signal sustained accumulation by professional investors, advising traders to zoom out and focus on broader liquidity dynamics rather than reacting to daily volatility. #XRP – You won’t make it if you keep zooming into the micro and ignoring the bigger picture. pic.twitter.com/MGo0yHdcy6 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 15, 2026 Institutional Accumulation Driving Momentum Institutional interest has played a key role in XRP’s 2026 performance. Bitwise reported $4.51 million in net inflows on January 9, 2026, contributing to year-to-date XRP gains of approximately 25%. This influx of institutional capital demonstrates that major financial players continue to strategically acquire XRP, anticipating its growing adoption and utility. Egrag Crypto points out that understanding these inflows is vital for discerning long-term market trends, which often diverge from short-term retail sentiment. Integration with Financial Hubs XRP’s integration into European banking systems and global financial hubs further strengthens its resilience. These partnerships enhance the token’s utility in cross-border payments and liquidity management, supporting price levels around $2.20 despite temporary retail-driven dips.

This development, emerging from the company’s global headquarters without an official public statement, marks the second major staff reduction in recent years and signals a profound strategic realignment towards its Open Money Stack initiative. Consequently, the blockchain industry is now closely analyzing the implications of this consolidation for one of Ethereum’s leading scaling solutions. Polygon Labs Layoffs Signal Deep Strategic Restructuring The recent workforce reduction at Polygon Labs represents a substantial shift in the company’s human resource strategy. Reportedly affecting nearly one-third of employees, this action follows a previous 20% staff cut implemented in 2024. Importantly, neither reduction received a formal announcement from the company’s leadership. This pattern suggests a consistent, albeit quiet, approach to organizational streamlining. Industry analysts immediately began connecting these layoffs to Polygon’s aggressive acquisition strategy. Specifically, the company integrated Coinme, a crypto cash network, and Sequence, a wallet infrastructure provider, into its ecosystem. These acquisitions directly support the development of the Open Money Stack, a modular framework designed for efficient cross-border stablecoin payments. Therefore, the layoffs appear less about financial distress and more about reallocating resources towards this core, long-term vision. The Driving Force Behind the Open Money Stack Polygon Labs is fundamentally redirecting its engineering and development focus toward the Open Money Stack. This ambitious project aims to create a seamless, interoperable system for global value transfer. The framework’s modular design allows developers to build customized payment solutions. Key components include stablecoin rails, identity verification layers, and compliance tools. For instance, the acquisition of Coinme brings extensive fiat on-ramp and off-ramp capabilities. Meanwhile, Sequence contributes critical wallet and key management infrastructure. Integrating these technologies requires significant internal reorganization. As a result, the company is consolidating teams to eliminate redundancy and accelerate development. This strategic pivot reflects broader trends in the blockchain sector, where projects are moving beyond speculative assets to solve real-world financial inefficiencies. The Open Money Stack positions Polygon not just as a scaling layer, but as a foundational protocol for the future of open finance. Expert Analysis on Crypto Industry Consolidation Market observers note that Polygon’s restructuring aligns with a wider industry movement towards sustainability and core product focus. Following the market cycles of 2022 and 2023, many leading blockchain organizations have shifted from rapid expansion to operational efficiency. Workforce adjustments, while difficult, have become a common tool for this refinement. The focus on stablecoin infrastructure and cross-border payments taps into a high-growth potential market, as identified by several financial technology reports. By streamlining operations now, Polygon Labs aims to build a leaner, more agile organization capable of executing its complex technical roadmap. The lack of an official statement, while unusual, may indicate the company’s desire to manage the transition internally before communicating a new strategic vision to the public and its partners. Comparative Impact and Market Context The blockchain industry has witnessed similar strategic workforce adjustments from other major players. To provide clear context, the table below outlines recent notable actions: Company Approx. Reduction Stated Reason Year Polygon Labs 30% Strategic focus on Open Money Stack & acquisitions 2025 Polygon Labs 20% Operational efficiency (not formally announced) 2024 Multiple Major Exchanges 10-15% (Avg.) Post-bull market correction & regulatory prep 2023-2024 Various Metaverse Projects Up to 50% Pivot from speculative VR to enterprise/B2B tools 2024 This comparative view shows Polygon’s moves are part of a sector-wide maturation process. The company’s consecutive reductions, however, highlight a particularly intense period of refocusing. The integration of Coinme and Sequence likely created overlapping roles in departments like business development, general marketing, and even some engineering teams. Streamlining these areas frees capital and management attention for the core protocol teams working on zero-knowledge proofs, chain interoperability, and the Open Money Stack modules. Market data suggests investor sentiment often differentiates between layoffs driven by financial weakness versus those driven by strategic repositioning for future growth. Operational and Ecosystem Implications The immediate effects of the Polygon Labs layoffs extend beyond internal HR matters. Partners and projects built on the Polygon network are assessing the impact on developer relations, grant programs, and technical support. Historically, Polygon has maintained a robust ecosystem team. A reduction here could shift more responsibility onto the community and foundation arms. On the operational side, a leaner company may achieve faster decision-making cycles. Key areas of continued investment likely include: ZK-Proof Development: Essential for scaling and privacy. Chain Abstraction: Making multi-chain interactions seamless for users. Stablecoin Infrastructure: The core of the Open Money Stack vision. Developer Tooling: Ensuring the builder experience remains top-tier. Furthermore, the broader Ethereum scaling landscape remains competitive. Rivals like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync continue to innovate and attract developers. Polygon’s strategic bet is that by owning a critical piece of the cross-border payment stack, it can create a durable competitive advantage beyond mere transaction speed and cost. This long-term play requires disciplined resource allocation, explaining the significant workforce restructuring reported. Conclusion The reported 30% workforce reduction at Polygon Labs represents a pivotal moment in the company’s evolution. Driven by strategic acquisitions and a focused commitment to the Open Money Stack, this move underscores a transition from broad-based growth to targeted execution on a specific vision for global financial infrastructure. While the human impact of such layoffs is considerable, the industry context suggests this is a calculated step towards sustainability and market leadership in the blockchain-based payments sector. The success of this Polygon Labs restructuring will ultimately be measured by the adoption and functionality of its Open Money Stack, positioning the company for the next phase of real-world blockchain utility.
