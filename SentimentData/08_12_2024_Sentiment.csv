Flows into meme coins flipped green after days in the woods as bulls look to end the year on a high note. Data from IntoTheBlock shows whales moved from a 534 billion net outflow to 580 billion net inflows, setting the tint for individual acquisitions. The recent crypto uprising has seen large holders ramp up activity, swooping 9 trillion PEPE tokens and igniting price projections to new levels. According to Lookonchain data , a whale withdrew 337 billion PEPE worth $6.92 million from Binance. The movement of assets out of centralized exchanges is a bull signal of long-term holdings. This ignited other solo holders to look towards the asset, sparking a huge 24-hour rally. Whale activities swing the market with a positive effect on retail traders. In the last 24 hours, small-scale traders have also moved into PEPE and other meme coins to partake in the rebound. PEPE Jumps 8% Recent heavy buys on the asset have significantly impacted the price. In the last 24 hours, PEPE gained 8.2% to trade at $0.00002649, as its market cap tops $11 billion. Daily trading volumes are at an inc redible high of 34%, hitting $5.3 billion. Longer-term price fluctuations are also in the green zone, alongside sentiments. In the last seven days, PEPE surged 6% and a massive 167% in 30 days. Meanwhile, yearly growth stands at 1,517%. The recent jump in PEPE price has flipped wallets from losses to gains. “ A whale bought 240B $PEPE($3.64M) at a high price on May 29, and the price of $PEPE dropped afterward. But instead of panic selling, he held on for 6 months. Just 30 minutes ago, he sold his 240B $PEPE($4.95M), making a profit of $1.31M,” Lookonchain wrote. Meme Coins Record Gains Meme coins have recovered after days of slow trading across various asset classes. Due to high volatility, these assets tend to record heavy swings in line with the direction of market sentiments. Meme coin leader Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 4.9% today, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FLOKI soared 6.8% and 4.4%, respectively. Some lower market cap assets skyrocketed as high as 100% on a larger community rally.

The ETFs have recorded ten consecutive days of positive inflows, beginning from November 22. Ethereum ETF Inflows Signal Growing Interest Farside Investor data shows that the Ethereum ETFs finished the week with $83.8 million inflow on Friday. Friday’s inflow came from five asset managers, namely BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale Mini Trust. Notably, Fidelity’s FETH led with a total inflow of $47.9 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA with $34.6 million. Bitwise’s ETHW, VanEck’s ETHV, and Grayscale’s ETH raked in $13.4 million, $1.5 million and $22.9 million respectively. Friday’s inflow marks ten consecutive days of favorable inflows into Ethereum ETF. This ten-day streak is the longest the funds have achieved since they commenced trading in July. Additionally, Friday’s inflow marks the fourth-highest volume trading day as over $992 million worth of assets were traded, according to SoSoValue data . Meanwhile, all nine ETF products except Grayscale’s ETHE have had a good run and are registering positive inflows. ETHE has suffered massive outflows since November 18, with only two days of zero flow on November 27 and 29, respectively. Experts have attributed these outflows to the huge transaction fees of 2.50% Ethereum’s Price Rally and Market Sentiment The growing institutional interest in Ethereum ETF syncs with the recent price spike of ETH in the market. Ethereum climbed into the $4,000 level following sustained investors’ interest in the altcoin. The coin crossed the psychologically significant level a day after Bitcoin hit $100,000. As of this writing, CoinMarketCap data shows ETH exchanging hands at $4,000.79. Ethereum had reached $4,089 in earlier trading before dropping to their current levels. Despite this drop, analysts still anticipate Ethereum to test $5,000 in the ongoing bull cycle. Fundamentals Fuelling Optimism for the Future The growing institutional interest in Ethereum ETF, after having a slower start when compared with Bitcoin ETFs, has fuelled optimism for a brighter future. Furthermore, the industry has a positive outlook due to the nomination of pro-crypto individuals to head key positions by President-elect Donald Trump. Analysts believe these fundamentals might support Ethereum’s quest to test the $5,000 level before the second quarter of 2025 ends.

For weeks, the crypto leader has circled the $90K zone, leaping as high as 99K before a series of corrections amid volatility. A jump above the $100K level was just a matter of time for most bulls as institutions kept ramping up assets. The break past $100K psychological resistance level has set the token for a new market drive, as projected by several large holders and analysts. Notably, all holders are tipping a higher sky surge for the asset. BTC price trades at $100,260, a massive 7% growth in the last 24 hours, extending weekly and monthly numbers. Bitcoin Enthusiasts Pitch Higher Price Across crypto spaces, Bitcoin holders opine that $100K is a building point over the next few months. Several traders have pointed to positive regulations for a higher upswing above $150k in 2025. Crypto user Danheld explained that $100K Bitcoin is more than a price as it shows the world moving towards financial freedom. “ $100,000 a Bitcoin doesn’t just represent a price. It represents that the world is gradually acknowledging Bitcoin as the reserve currency of the future. It represents a rejection of the existing financial system. It represents financial freedom.” According to Bernstein , the asset’s price will hit $200k by 2025, ushering in a new institutional era for the crypto leader. The last 11 months have seen surging flows to Bitcoin from traditional firms following the approval of spot ETFs, which created a new investment window. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered has maintained a projection for $200K. While most firms pitch around this margin, bears say a correction could still be on the cards. US Macro Factors Spark BTC Price The outcome of the United States election set Bitcoin on an upward trajectory, with its price soaring. President-elect Donald Trump set out plans for the crypto space after years of regulatory uncertainty.

Despite the correction, many analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s potential to regain momentum, while others predict a deeper retrace before any significant rally. The market appears divided, with bulls eyeing a potential breakout and skeptics bracing for a quiet sell-off. Related Reading: Dogecoin Still In Consolidation – Analyst Expects $0,63 If We Get A Breakout Crypto analyst Harry weighed in on the discussion, sharing a detailed technical analysis on X. He highlighted that XRP could target a $4 price once it completes a deeper retracement. Harry’s analysis suggests that while bullish sentiment remains valid, the path forward might require additional consolidation or even a short-term dip to reset market conditions. This divergence of opinions underscores the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s price action. Will the retrace provide a launchpad for the next rally, or will it pave the way for prolonged bearish pressure? As XRP hovers near key levels, the coming days will determine whether bulls or bears gain control. For now, XRP holders and traders must watch these movements closely, as the token’s future hinges on breaking this current stalemate. Price Action Signals Storm Before The Run XRP has recently faced a significant retrace, and many analysts believe further correction or consolidation could be on the horizon before a bullish continuation occurs. After reaching high levels, the token pauses, with some experts forecasting a stabilization period. However, the bullish camp remains hopeful, anticipating new highs in the coming months as buy-side pressure builds. Top analyst Harry shared his insights on X, pointing out that XRP has yet to retest the critical $1.96 breakout level. Currently, the price is hovering between $1.96 and the 2017 all-time high of $2.77. According to Harry’s technical analysis, this positioning indicates growing bullish momentum. He further suggests that if XRP’s current flag formation breaks to the upside, the token could be poised for a powerful rally toward new highs. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week? This analysis follows weeks of speculation surrounding XRP’s price trajectory, especially in the wake of Bitcoin’s volatile movements. BTC has fluctuated around the $100K psychological level, repeatedly breaking and losing it. These conditions have added an extra layer of uncertainty to the market, leaving traders uncertain of what to expect next. XRP Showing Indecision XRP is trading at $2.40, marking a 14% recovery from its recent local lows of $2.16. Despite this bounce, the token’s price action remains uncertain as market sentiment remains divided. Traders and investors are closely monitoring the next moves, with no definitive signs pointing to either a bullish continuation or the formation of a cycle top. The key levels to watch are $2.25 and $2.50. If XRP manages to hold above the $2.25 support and reclaim the $2.50 level in the near term, it could signal the start of a renewed bullish rally. This scenario would likely attract additional buying pressure, pushing XRP closer to retesting its recent highs. However, the market’s current indecision reflects broader uncertainty, and any failure to reclaim these levels could lead to further consolidation or a potential downside.

If you’re looking to maximize your returns, the BTFD presale is undoubtedly one of the best meme coin presales on the market right now. Now, let’s talk numbers.

This token has its fans and has made some noise in the meme coin arena, but it hasn’t quite achieved the same level of excitement as BTFD Coin. While it rides the coattails of the meme coin phenomenon, Brett lacks the innovative features that make BTFD stand out. Without a P2E game or robust staking options, investors might not find the same level of engagement or potential returns. Brett’s community is passionate, but it feels more like a casual hangout than a powerhouse ready to propel its coin skyward. The project has tried to tap into meme culture, but it hasn’t fully embraced the community-driven spirit that fuels the success of tokens like BTFD. Investors looking for serious gains might find themselves questioning whether Brett is the right choice for their portfolio. In short, while Brett has its merits and a dedicated following, it may not be positioned well enough to compete with the innovative offerings of BTFD Coin. If you’re serious about making an investment that could pay off big time, the best meme coin presale right now is clearly BTFD. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Bus!

Chainlink (LINK) has staged a late rally this week and currently needs to gain just 10% to recapture a three-year high following its peak in January 2022, according to the analytics firm. Despite the rise, the analytics firm claims that there is very little FOMO in LINK. The company interprets this as a positive sign. According to Santiment, markets tend to move in a direction contrary to the community’s expectations, and therefore the community’s lack of faith in this token could be fuel for the rally.

However, the latest decrease of 85,503 BTC observed in the last 48 hours was recorded as the largest decline observed since February. The other sudden decline in February occurred 2 weeks before the all-time high of $ 73,000. However, the analytics firm added that the level of these wallet balances has not shown any correlation with the price of Bitcoin for most of the year. According to the firm, whales and smaller investors, sharks, who are not involved in mining, are still accumulating BTC. The firm reported that these two signals are a net neutral signal in total. *This is not investment advice.

In a conversation about Justin Sun’s journey through the cryptocurrency world, the founder of Tron reflected on his early days in the industry. He reveals how he bought Bitcoin when it was worth less than $1 and helped pioneer the concept of smart contracts. Justin Sun’s early crypto investments Sun’s journey into crypto began in 2012 when Bitcoin was still in its infancy and could be purchased for less than $1. He recalls that at the time, even platforms like Taobao, a major e-commerce site in China, were selling Bitcoin. This was a far cry from today’s massive crypto exchanges and skyrocketing Bitcoin prices. JUSTIN SUN: ""I BOUGHT BITCOIN AT $1 AND WORKED ON THE IDEA OF SMART CONTRACTS"" “I got into crypto in 2012, Bitcoin was less than $1. You could even buy Bitcoin from Taobao, an eBay e-commerce platform in China. Ripple Labs at the time, started a new company, a new token name… https://t.co/j27tRQASr6 pic.twitter.com/b1EnXVMO95 — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 7, 2024 Sun also joined Ripple Labs, where the team was focused on creating a new token called XRP. During this time, Sun began to see the massive potential of blockchain technology. By 2014, Sun and his team began focusing on a new vision building a blockchain to support smart contracts. At that time, smart contracts were a completely new idea in the crypto space. No existing cryptocurrencies had implemented them, but Sun and his team believed in this feature and thought that it could greatly improve blockchain technology’s flexibility and use cases. From Ripple to Ethereum In 2015, Ethereum came onto the scene, successfully raising funds through its initial coin offering (ICO). This confirmed the validity of Sun’s vision, he and his team invested heavily in Ethereum’s ICO, recognizing its potential to revolutionize the blockchain space. Around the same time, platforms like Poloniex also emerged, allowing users to buy and trade Ethereum, helping them to establish the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi). With the rise of Ethereum and the launch of ERC-20 tokens, Sun and his team began to develop their own blockchain by focusing on making smart contract implementation faster and more affordable. The idea is to create a more efficient and scalable blockchain than Ethereum. Reflecting on the early days, Sun also spoke about Bitcoin’s volatility. At the time, Bitcoin’s price constantly fluctuated, making it hard to judge its true value. Bitcoin’s price was often measured in terms of Ethereum, as there were no stable fiat pairings for Ethereum at that time. For Sun, the early crypto years were about innovation, taking risks, and working towards a vision that helped build today’s blockchain ecosystem. By buying Bitcoin for under $1, investing in Ethereum’s ICO, and leading the charge for smart contract development, Sun’s impact on the crypto world continues to resonate today.

I understand why a century ago, we accumulated gold in Fort Knox,” he added. “Of all the prices to support, why would the government choose to support, by accumulating a sterile inventory, a bunch of Bitcoin?” “There’s no reason to do that other than to pander to generous special interest campaign contributors.” Trump proposed that the U.S. government hold onto its seized Bitcoin, currently amounting to approximately 198,000 BTC worth over $19 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence. Some Trump-aligned Republicans, like Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, are pushing for legislation to acquire 1 million BTC — about 5% of the total supply — and hold it for at least 20 years. Despite his criticism, Summers acknowledged some validity in Trump’s views on cryptocurrency. “I think we need to support financial innovation wherever it may go, and there are probably respects in which crypto has been over-regulated by overzealous regulators,” he said. Summers, who served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Clinton, also had a brief advisory role with the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG) in 2016. Lummis’s push for a Bitcoin reserve aims to address the $36 trillion national debt. However, Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, cautioned that the proposal is not a comprehensive solution. “The Bitcoin reserve is good, but it does not solve the problem,” Roy stated at a crypto summit. “You still have to actually do the budgetary reforms to get us out of this $2 trillion a year of federal deficits.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|REGULATION|ARKM,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 22:02:00

The meme-based cryptocurrency surged by 20% in the past 24 hours, achieving an all-time high of $0.00002622. As its market capitalization surpasses $11 billion, the crypto community is closely watching for further price movement, with some analysts predicting a potential 150% rally. PEPE Reaches New ATH in Market Cap and Price After hitting an all-time high today, PEPE has crossed a $10 billion market capitalization, cementing its position as the third-largest meme coin by market value. Pepe’s market cap has since climbed to over $11 billion, making it the 20th largest digital asset across the entire crypto market. This comes on the back of sustained growth since early November, when PEPE price began a notable rally. During that period, the coin experienced a 100% weekly surge, driven by major exchange listings, including Coinbase and Robinhood. Although it retraced by 25% in subsequent weeks, whale accumulation provided support for the asset, leading to its recent resurgence. Whale Accumulation Sparks Renewed Rally Recent on-chain data shows that whales have played a significant role in PEPE’s latest rally. Reports indicate substantial accumulation of PEPE by large investors in recent weeks, with several high-value purchases recorded. Such activity has reduced available supply on the market, creating upward pressure on the price. Increased trading activity in the derivatives market has also fueled the rally. PEPE’s derivatives trading volume rose by 78%, reaching $1.67 billion, while open interest jumped by 39% to $368 million. These metrics reflect growing interest from traders and investors, further boosting the asset’s upward trajectory. PEPE Eyes 150% Surge Amid Bullish Projections As PEPE’s price continues to rise, market analysts suggest the possibility of a 150% increase in the coming weeks. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.00002622, with some analysts like JAVON MARKS projecting a potential move to $0.000063. PEPE’s recent performance has sparked discussions about its potential to overtake SHIB should it rally to $1 . SHIB currently holds a $19 billion market cap, leaving an $8 billion gap between the two tokens. While some investors view this as a challenging goal, others believe the ongoing market cycle could enable PEPE to close the gap.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 22:23:00

Is it a thrilling community, jaw-dropping presale success, or sheer utility? For BTFD Coin (BTFD), the answer is all of the above! As this next-gen meme coin races through its presale, it’s already raising eyebrows and expectations with its innovative Play2Earn game, staking rewards, and bold community-first ethos. Alongside established favourites like Bonk (BONK) and Cheems (CHEEMS), BTFD Coin is creating waves as one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in today. For those seeking alternative investment avenues to traditional stocks or bonds, meme coins like BONK and CHEEMS have consistently delivered excitement and opportunity. But with over $1.35 million raised in under 10 days, BTFD Coin is proving it’s not just another meme coin but a movement. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Built for Bold Investors BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the hype; it’s crafting a legacy. Currently, in the 8th stage of its presale, BTFD has already sold over 29 billion tokens to more than 3,100 investors, raising $1.35 million. By the time the presale ends, BTFD is set to rise from its current $0.000064 price to $0.0006—a clear win for early adopters. Here are some reasons that set it apart: Play2Earn Game Launching in stage 8, the BTFD Play2Earn (P2E) game takes centre stage. Players will join the Bulls Squad, navigate immersive levels, and convert in-game coins into BTFD tokens. Imagine playing a game where every power-up and challenge brings real-world financial rewards! This feature alone sets BTFD apart, making it a magnet for gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Staking Rewards for Long-Term Growth Unlike many meme coins, BTFD rewards loyalty. Investors staking their BTFD tokens enjoy an average annual percentage yield (APY) of 90%, turning short-term bets into long-term gains. Picture this: staking 1,000 tokens today could grow into thousands more in just a few years, thanks to compounding returns. A Community-Driven Ethos At its core, BTFD is built for the people. Its roadmap includes robust incentives like community airdrops, a locked liquidity pool for stability, and token burns to ensure sustainable growth. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or a first-timer, the BTFD community welcomes all Bulls ready to ride the market waves. With 48% of its total supply allocated for presale and 17% reserved for gaming rewards, BTFD is more than a coin—it’s an ecosystem designed for resilience and growth. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Community Darling Bonk has carved out a unique space as the meme coin for the Solana blockchain. Launched as a community-first initiative, BONK has built a reputation as a symbol of unity and fun within the crypto space. Bonk (BONK) is a community-focused token on Solana, ensuring fair distribution and supporting NFTs and dApps. Its fast, low-cost transactions make it ideal for micro-payments and tipping. BONK stands out as more than just a meme coin in the decentralised ecosystem. While BONK may not offer staking or gaming utilities like BTFD, its strong community engagement and established market presence make it a go-to alternative investment for those seeking a lighter entry into the crypto world. Cheems (CHEEMS): A Meme Coin with a Cult Following Cheems isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a cultural icon. Inspired by the late Balltze, the beloved Shiba Inu, CHEEMS has built a legacy that goes beyond price charts and market caps. CHEEMS stays in the spotlight with Binance’s Meme Zone offering up to 75x leverage, appealing to risk-tolerant traders. Its strong cultural ties to Balltze’s iconic meme keep it relevant, blending fun with solid growth potential in the crypto market. CHEEMS’ long-standing appeal and established market position make it an excellent counterpart to newer entrants like BTFD. However, its lack of unique utilities, such as gaming or staking, leaves space for projects like BTFD to innovate. Why BTFD Stands Out Among the Best New Meme Coin Presales to Invest in Today When it comes to meme coins, each has its charm—BONK’s community focus, CHEEMS’ cultural legacy, and BTFD Coin’s bold vision. But based on our research, BTFD Coin stands out as the best new meme coin presale to invest in today. With over $1.35 million raised in under 10 days, a revolutionary Play2Earn game, and robust staking rewards, BTFD is more than a meme—it’s a movement.

Despite an earlier report of the asset inching closer to gaining regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), things have stalled. Competitive Challenges in a Crowded Stablecoin Market However, David Schwartz, Ripple CTO, remains optimistic that something could shift and see the launch of RLUSD. Schwartz maintained that notwithstanding the challenges, he remains hopeful RLUSD will launch this year. He expressed concerns about the rapidly approaching holiday season, which could cause delays. As per the timeline, many anticipated RLUSD might launch as early as December 4. However, the regulatory nod has yet to be given. Ripple, however, remains determined to enter the stablecoin market. Notable players dominating the sector include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). When given the green light, Ripple will have to find a way to thrive in the highly competitive stablecoin market. RLUSD’s Strategic Market Entry In April 2024, Ripple announced its planned launch of a stablecoin. As per the announcement, RLUSD will initially be accessible on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Four months later in August, Ripple commenced testing ahead of the anticipated launch. Ripple Labs’ target is to integrate RLUSD into its cross-border payment arrangement along with XRP. That is, RLUSD will serve as a complementary product to XRP. The goal is to enhance liquidity solutions across borders. It appears the green light is all that stands in the way of Ripple’s RLUSD to hit the market. Monica Long, Ripple Labs President , recently stated that RLUSD has been designed to meet the growing need for USD-based stablecoin, particularly in Latin America. Regulatory Scrutiny and Ripple Lab’s RLUSD Launch Readiness The New York State Department of Financial Services is still subjecting Ripple’s application to scrutiny. Schwartz, however, assures that efforts were ongoing to ensure that all Ripple’s partners launch in an organized way without any challenges. He maintains that Ripple will make it happen despite the difficult regulatory process. Besides XRP Ledger and Ethereum, Ripple has secured partnerships with other notable exchanges. These include Bitso, Uphold, Moonpay, and Bitstamp to facilitate the adoption of RLUSD when it launches. Meanwhile, market makers B2C2 and Keyrock will support RLUSD’s liquidity.

The court’s ruling in favor of Ripple in July 2023 has been hailed as a pivotal event, with many suggesting it could reshape how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the U.S. Despite multiple losses and a conclusion to the lawsuit in August of this year, the SEC filed an appeal, attempting to pull Ripple back into the courts and potentially suppress XRP. During the interview, Garlinghouse would discuss the company’s issues with the SEC, and potential steps forward now that Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration is about to take over the White House. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Influence in Politics The teaser video shared by 60 Minutes highlights Ripple’s growing influence in U.S. politics. This is a major reason Ripple is getting featured on 60 Minutes. 85% of candidates for U.S. Congress supported by Ripple won their elections. This incredible feat shows that the voices of the crypto community matter in U.S. politics. This could be a major talking point during the interview, along with broader issues within the cryptocurrency sector, including the ongoing regulatory debate in the United States. Garlinghouse has been vocal about the need for clear and consistent guidelines to support innovation while protecting consumers. 60 Minutes is the longest-running investigative news show in the U.S. This well-respected platform will give Garlinghouse a chance to tell Ripple’s side of the story to a broad audience and act as a voice for the crypto market in America.

XRP is currently trading between $1.60 and $2.67, showing impressive growth with a 1-week price change of 49.95% and a 1-month surge of 348.85%. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.04. If it breaks through, it could target the second resistance at $4.12. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.33, slightly below the 100-day average of $2.50, hinting at a potential upward trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 44.58, indicating that XRP is not overbought. With the crypto market anticipating an altcoin season and a global bull run, XRP could see significant gains in the near future. TRON (TRX) Ready for a Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches TRON's price is currently between $0.19 and $0.22, showing strong growth over the past six months with an increase of over 180%. The nearest resistance is at $0.23, and breaking this level could push the price toward $0.26. In the last week alone, TRX has risen nearly 60%, and over the past month, it has surged by more than 100%. The Relative Strength Index is around 43, indicating room for further growth. The low stochastic value suggests potential for an upswing. If TRX moves above the simple moving averages, which are currently higher than the price, we could see significant bullish movement as altcoin season gains momentum. Dogecoin Set to Soar as Altcoin Season Nears and Bull Run Gains Momentum Dogecoin is showing signs of upward momentum with its current price between $0.3868 and $0.4724. Over the past month, it has surged by over 155%, indicating strong investor interest. The 10-day simple moving average is slightly above the 100-day average, suggesting a positive trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 50, implying the coin is not overbought. If Dogecoin breaks the nearest resistance level at $0.5042, it could target the next resistance near $0.5898, potentially increasing by another 20%. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish crypto market, Dogecoin may be set for significant growth in the coming weeks. Conclusion While XRP, TRX, and DOGE show limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering 700% ROI in its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility through governance, rewards, and staking, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains.

In a statement, South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) says BRICS is not working on a currency that could be used as an alternative to USD, reports Bloomberg. According to DIRCO, reports have misinterpreted the intentions of the economic bloc about trade settlements between member nations. “Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency. This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.” In May of last year, reports emerged that BRICS was working on a new currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets in a push to abandon the US dollar. Despite those reports, South Africa is now saying that BRICS has no intention of promoting de-dollarization efforts. “South Africa supports the increased use of national currencies in international trade and financial transactions to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, rather than focusing on dedollarization. The strengthening of correspondent banking networks and the development of infrastructure for settlements in national currencies could further this aim.” South Africa’s statements come as President-elect Donald Trump issued an ultimatum against BRICS. Trump says on the social media platform Truth Social that he plans to take severe measures if BRICS creates or backs a dollar alternative. “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy. They can go find another ‘sucker!’ There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the US dollar in international trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America.” As a whole, BRICS nations have expressed varying levels of support for a common currency, with leaders in Russia and Brazil firmly behind the idea. South Africa is the most conservative, expressing the need for a cautious approach while emphasizing the importance of the US dollar.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto analyst Jelle forecasts a new ATH for Solana, as Cardano and IntelMarkets soar 800%. Table of Contents Jelle: The price of Solana may reach a new ATH Expert makes a bullish Cardano price prediction IntelMarkets riding a bullish wave with 610% surge What may come for Solana, Cardano & IntelMarkets? The crypto space is filled with confidence, as many tokens are on the rise. Crypto analyst Jelle has confidently forecasted that Solana (SOL) will hit a new ATH, which adds to its bullishness. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) and the new phase seven presale star IntelMarkets (INTL) saw a combined price growth of over 800%. While many analysts, like Trend Rider, have made bold price predictions for ADA, some are also noticing INTL. Since this project has already surged by 500% in its crypto ICO event, they think another 1,000% surge may come in 2025. Jelle: The price of Solana may reach a new ATH Solana is currently among the top 10 altcoins. CoinMarketCap shows that the Solana price surged from $163 to $231 on the one-month chart. This is over a 40% rise in just a few weeks. Crypto analyst Jelle remains optimistic for Solana. According to his X post, this altcoin has bounced from its 200-day EMA and broke out of its falling wedge. In his Solana price prediction, he foresees a new ATH coming for this token. This would mean a rise past $263. The technical analysis for the Solana crypto is also bullish. TradingView shows that this altcoin is trading above its 30-day EMA ($223) and its 50-day EMA ($208). Plus, its bull-bear power sits at 2.58, which is in the buy zone and suggests bulls may push this value up. You might also like: Ripple moves past Solana, IntelMarkets price pumps to $0.064091 Expert makes a bullish Cardano price prediction Cardano has also been turning some heads recently. Over the past 30 days, the price of Cardano soared over 250%. CoinMarketCap shows that its value moved between $0.33 and $1.20 during that time. TradingView data also shows that this bullish trend may continue. For instance, Cardano (ADA) is valued above its 20-day EMA ($0.96) and its 30-day EMA ($0.86). Moreover, its MACD level shows a 0.16 indicator in the buy zone, suggesting a good entry point for buyers. Market expert Trend Rider made a bullish Cardano price prediction. In his X post, he said that this altcoin could see a price surge to $3 soon. Therefore, many traders are getting excited for the Cardano coin. IntelMarkets riding a bullish wave with 610% surge IntelMarkets is riding a bullish wave in the crypto market, mainly because of its performance in the presale. It’s in the seventh phase, but the crypto ICO has already given early investors a 610% return. There is still plenty of room for growth, with several phases left to go. IntelMarkets’ long-term mission is to change how trading is done by combining artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. This new method will provide traders with access to self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time, omnichannel processing, and more. The INTL token will power this platform. It is now in phase seven of its presale with a value of only $0.064. But, this altcoin price will reach $0.073 once phase eight begins. Plus, traders are waiting for a new Tier-1 CEX listing for INTL, which could push the value to $0.11. What may come for Solana, Cardano & IntelMarkets? Solana, Cardano and IntelMarkets may all see big price gains soon. However, experts are paying close attention to INTL since it will have connections to the AI market, which Statista predicts will be worth $826B by 2030. This fact, plus its smaller market cap, could mean faster price growth with less money and more stability in the future. Thus, many experts foresee a potential 1,000% surge for this altcoin in 2025.

The government has approved a new tax policy exempting Bitcoin from capital gains tax , provided these assets have been held for at least three years. The updated tax policy also exempts individuals from paying taxes if income from digital currencies exceeds 100,000 Czech crowns. The tax policy amendment granting exemptions to Bitcoin holders was passed on December 6th, with all members of the parliament approving the proposal, and takes effect on January 1st, 2025. According to analysts, these latest amendments are comparable to the tax exemptions on securities, which cap gains from shares, securities, and cryptos at CZK 40 million. New Tax Policy Simplifies Taxation, But Some Issues Linger While the new policy integrates crypto into existing tax regulations that cover most financial instructions, it doesn’t cover electronic cash tokens. The tax amendment only applies to digital assets not used in business for at least 36 months immediately after self-employment. Also, approving this new policy has created a few issues and problems that require immediate answers for some. The Czech Republic actively promotes HODLing by cancelling capital gains tax on #Bitcoin held for longer than 3 years in a unanimous vote! @BraiinsMining Chief of Propaganda @KristianCsep has the details https://t.co/YXUzcDBbbn — BTC Prague (@BTCPrague) December 6, 2024 Currently, the country imposes a 15% tax rate on Bitcoin revenues and 19% for businesses. High-income individuals are taxed at 23%. Based on the new policy, assets purchased before they are effective can be exempted from the provisions. However, the approved rules introduced a few grey areas for some. For example, some taxpayers are asking how they will establish the period of ownership. Also, many are asking if the new tax law covers all digital assets. Experts and observers say that even the country’s Income Tax Act doesn’t offer a specific definition of cryptocurrencies. Experts Okay With New Bitcoin Tax Policy Although there were initial concerns, experts and the tax community have welcomed the amended tax policy. The government’s move to update the tax policy on BTC aligns with the campaign to clarify taxation on cryptocurrencies . With this new tax policy, the Czech Republic is ready for the ongoing regional digitalization and European Union-level regulations on crypto. The new tax policy on Bitcoin may also spur investor participation, in addition to the support of tax experts and regulators. According to some experts, this new rule can encourage individuals to buy and hold Bitcoin longer. Czech Republic Joins Other Countries In Updating Tax Rules This parliament move puts the Czech Republic on the list of countries that have updated their tax rules to reflect the growing popularity of digital assets. Italy, for example, has reduced the capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies from 42% to 28%. The government’s tax treatment of Bitcoin and other digital assets comes when Bitcoin is leading a market surge. Two days ago, Bitcoin hit the $100k mark and is trading near this level. Also, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US are now the biggest holders of Bitcoin today, overtaking “Satoshi Nakamoto.” According to on-chain data, these funds now hold around 1.104 million Bitcoins.

Last December 1st, XRP briefly went below $2.00 and has consolidated above this level for days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Days At The Top Numbered? Cardano Set To Take Over — Analyst Like most digital assets in recent days, XRP is undergoing extreme market volatility. However, for Vincent Van Code, a software engineer, the Ripple’s altcoin is poised to hit $5 under these market conditions. Van Code’s comments come when the broader crypto market is experiencing a substantial downturn, driven by Bitcoin’s erratic price movements, which briefly breached the $100k mark. The world’s top asset briefly hit $104,088 on Thursday but immediately suffered a “flash crash,” dropping to $90,500. As of this writing, Bitcoin has regained strength and is trading above $98k. #XRP is not dumping, it’s a whole market thing. Triggered by #BTC dump. Fundamentals are very strong for XRP, if you’re a holder, my gut is telling me it will hit $5 by Feb 2025. All this is noise. Not Financial Advice. I am not qualified to give any advice. pic.twitter.com/33dtboWwRl — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 5, 2024 Rising Market Concerns On Bitcoin And Crypto? The sudden Bitcoin crash was felt throughout the crypto market, spooking many retailers and investors. While the drop significantly affected the greater crypto market, the loss among top altcoins isn’t as big as Bitcoin’s. Ripple’s XRP is one of the top tokens that declined during Bitcoin’s brief crash. XRP’s price dropped from a high of $2.48 to $2.23, reflecting a 10% loss. Traditionally, altcoins often suffer massive price breakdowns every time Bitcoin corrects in price. Current Price Corrections Just ‘Noises’ For Long-Term Holders Market observers, including Van Code, have weighed in on the situation, highlighting XRP’s resilience amid Bitcoin’s slump. He attributed this outcome to the coin’s strong fundamentals, emphasizing that they remain solid despite market turbulence. Van Code analyzed the situation and shared his optimism on XRP, and he expects the token’s value to hit $5 by February 2025. According to the commentator, the current price corrections are just “noises” that can be ignored if you’re on XRP for the long haul. Ripple’s token has been following a range pattern for four days after momentarily hitting $2.85. Since then, XRP’s momentum has slowed, pushing the price to revisit $2.10. XRP Holders And Traders Getting Ready For Another Run XRP holders are holding on to their optimism and looking for the next drivers to push the asset to revisit its all-time high and enter a price discovery mode. At $2.36, Ripple’s XRP needs to surge by at least 112% to hit $5. Interestingly, XRP has increased by more than four times over the past month, keeping the hopes of holders and investors alive. #XRPHolders🚨 Get Ready #XRP Is About To Make New All Time High Of 3.50$ Very Soon. #XRP Printed Bull Flag Pattern 👀 pic.twitter.com/UyiMuGO6s3 — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 5, 2024 Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP?

Meanwhile, the broader altcoin market has been on a tear, riding bullish sentiment and speculative energy. Yet, history warns us that parabolic runs often end with equally dramatic corrections. Source: coinmarketcap.com Enter Brett ($ BRETT ), a bold challenger on Base, and Pepe ($ PEPE ), the Ethereum-based heavyweight memecoin. These tokens represent contrasting approaches to memecoins: nimble upstart versus entrenched giant. This article explores their fundamentals, technicals, and what’s next for traders navigating this volatile arena. Fundamental Breakdown Brett: The Base Network Underdog Brett is a compact package of memecoin hype, rooted in the Base blockchain, a fast-growing ecosystem optimized for low fees and scalability. With a circulating supply of 9.91 billion tokens out of a 10 billion maximum, Brett enjoys the advantage of limited inflation risk. Its fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $2.16 billion closely mirrors its current market cap of $2.13 billion, reflecting maturity in its tokenomics. Additionally, the token’s trading volume has spiked to $110 million in the past 24 hours, signaling robust liquidity and growing interest. The controlled supply ensures Brett doesn’t drown in oversaturation. Base’s scalability has provided a perfect platform for the token’s meteoric rise, drawing parallels with other efficient, low-cost blockchains such as Solana in its early days. Pepe: The Ethereum Heavyweight Pepe’s credentials are indisputable: a 420.69 trillion circulating supply (the entire maximum supply) and a market cap of $10.95 billion, reflecting its dominance in the memecoincategory. With $6.05 billion in daily volume, Pepe dwarfs most competitors, yet its size could be its Achilles’ heel. Ethereum’s reliance on higher gas fees often deters smaller investors, especially during network congestion. Moreover, Pepe’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) aligns with its market cap, implying that the token is in its final form—there’s no additional supply left to be released, but it raises concerns over whether its growth can sustain at these lofty valuations. Pepe, though dominant, carries the risk of being ""too big to grow."" Its Ethereum ($ ETH ) base offers prestige but also inherent weight, slowing its upward trajectory compared to more agile competitors like Brett. Can it defy gravity, or will it face the laws of diminishing returns? Technical Analysis Brett: Poised for a Breakout Brett recently completed a textbook Cup and Handle breakout, smashing through the critical $17.5-$18.5c resistance zone last week. With a confirmed breakout, the token’s price surged to $21.5c today, eyeing the 27.5c Cup & Handle target. Brett has retained strong momentum, aided by high volume-to-market cap ratio (5.15%), which signals sustained buyer interest. Dynamic support from the 200 moving average (4H) adds confidence, aligning with key support levels near $15.7c. The downside risk lies in losing $14c, which would expose Brett to a retest near $11c. However, a measured pullback to the $18.5c-$20c zone could offer fresh dip-buying opportunities for traders aiming to ride the next leg up. Key takeaway: Brett is in prime shape technically, with potential for further upside if bullish momentum continues. Short-term corrections might present the last chance for disciplined entries. Pepe: Stretching the Limits? Pepe also made waves, breaking through its $0.000026 ATH on Saturday (Dec 7). While its trajectory seemed unstoppable, RSI on the 4H chart shows a worrying divergence: price is making higher highs, but RSI is slumping, a potential warning of waning momentum. A correction back to $0.0000225, a key retest level, could stabilize the token for another push higher, while a fall below $0.000017 (Fair Value Gap’s upper band) risks further downside to $0.000013. Volume spikes on the breakout lacked follow-through, raising questions about sustained buying interest. Pepe’s massive supply and Ethereum's high gas fees add to the risks, making it more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks or altcoin market corrections. While its 420T supply can scare away some (but also attract – one gets more coins per 1 dollar spent), it thrives on sheer brand recognition. Key takeaway: Pepe must hold $0.0000225 in the short term to maintain its bullish narrative. However, risks of overextension and declining volume signal the need for caution. Comparison and Key Conclusions Market Structure: Brett’s compact supply on Base contrasts sharply with Pepe’s gargantuan tokenomics on Ethereum. Brett’s nimbleness could enable it to outperform in speculative bursts, while Pepe’s dominance offers stability but slower growth. Momentum: Brett benefits from a fresh breakout pattern with technical clarity. Pepe’s momentum is intact but beginning to flash warning signs of fatigue. Risk-Reward: Brett appears better positioned for short-term gains, while Pepe may require patience, especially at these lofty levels. Both tokens have explosive potential, but Brett’s lighter framework and Base affiliation make it a more aggressive speculative play, whereas Pepe’s scale requires a longer-term mindset. Summary and Final Thoughts Memecoins are the ultimate speculative instruments, thriving on hype, community-driven narratives, and outsized risk-reward potential. Brett and Pepe encapsulate these qualities but with vastly different styles. Brett’s base on the efficient Base network and lean tokenomicsmake it a sniper shot in a speculative market. Pepe, meanwhile, is Ethereum’s titan, commanding attention but lumbering under its own weight. Caution is key in this environment. Dogecoin’s continued strength sets a bullish tone, but as altcoins surge, the likelihood of a sharp correction grows. BTC holding $100K as support is critical, and any rejection there could trigger a cascade, disproportionately affecting speculative plays like memecoins. For traders, the roadmap is clear: avoid chasing pumps, accumulate during corrections, and always take partial profits. Brett offers nimble trading opportunities, while Pepe demands strategic patience. As we head into December, a historically volatile period for crypto, stay sharp and stay disciplined. Next, we dive into the memecoin rivalry between Shiba Inu and Floki, exploring whether the old guard can stand up to the next-gen contenders.

Looking for more 1000x calls, it’s only fair that Ethereum (ETH) and other crypto whales are investing in new opportunities that will multiply their portfolio. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA), once an investor favorite, has faced challenges and underperformance in Q4. As a result, investors are turning their attention elsewhere. One coin gaining significant attention is PropiChain , a token that aims to revolutionize the real estate investment industry by storm. It tokenizes real-world assets, enabling fractional property ownership and management. Let’s see why PropiChain (PCHAIN) is becoming the preferred choice for smart investors. The Current Overview of Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is not a newcomer to the crypto landscape. It broke into the space in 2017. With its promise of solving cryptocurrency issues involving scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance, Cardano (ADA) quickly rose to the limelight. It did so well that by May 2021, the coin had reached a market cap of $77 billion , ranking among the highest-performing cryptocurrencies . However, recent trends show that Cardano (ADA), despite its ambitious promises, has yet to deliver key features, leaving some investors exploring newer opportunities. A cryptocurrency that once traded at an all-time high of $3.099 currently sells for $1.203 and has a market cap of $42.64B . In the last 24 hours alone, Cardano (ADA) has experienced a significant drop of over 4.4%. Of course, this could be due to Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) whales selling off ahead of the next big thing. If Cardano (ADA) continues to surge and hits the all-time high (ATH) of $3.099, investors can expect an ROI of about 220%. However, PropiChain offers a more promising solution. It promises an ROI of over 10,000x and practical real estate investment opportunities. Can Ethereum Hold the Momentum? The market has been looking bullish for holders of Ethereum (ETH) as the coin continues to target new resistance levels. Ethereum (ETH) currently trades at $3790 , and the market seems primed. As more investors get in on the pump, Ethereum (ETH) is expected to continue to trade at even higher prices. However, even with this bullish forecast, Ethereum investors are increasingly exploring tokens with tangible utility. As a result, they are shifting to PropiChain (PCHAIN), the future of real estate investing. PropiChain uses smart contracts to automate lease agreements, making them more efficient and user-friendly. BlockAudit’s independent audit has confirmed PropiChain’s strong security posture, giving investors confidence in the platform’s ability to protect their assets. Is PropiChain the Next Big Thing? On the other hand, PropiChain (PCHAIN) ‘s future is looking even brighter as more investors flock to the platform. Due to its focus on real estate and the advanced technologies it uses, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) whales are starting to see the appeal. The platform is all about making buying, selling, and managing real estate easier. Offering practical, real-life applications, holders of PropiChain tokens can access a marketplace that features advanced technological integration, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Metaverse, and Virtual Reality (VR). As a user, you enjoy predictive market analysis that leverages the power of AI. You can now predict market trends, price changes, and top-performing properties and do much more in the real estate market. Investors will benefit from its fractional ownership feature. Through the platform, they can buy real estate, manage, and even transfer or sell properties to others—all on the blockchain. PropiChain covers everything related to property management, from token issuance to ownership transfer. It uses smart contracts that eliminate third parties, leading to faster and more secure contracts. Beyond that, PropiChain features automated payments and automatic reminders and even supports multi-currency payment options. The real estate token is also tied to tangible assets, providing a stable store of value unaffected by market volatility. Furthermore, PropiChain’s Metaverse integration will allow users to view and interact with their properties in immersive 3D environments. You don’t have to travel long distances or undergo stressful technical processes to participate in the real estate trend. These attributes underlie why Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) whales are rushing to join the PropiChain (PCHAIN) project. PropiChain (PCHAIN) also got listed on CoinMarketCap evidencing its credibility and expected success. Join the PropiChain Presale and Look Forward to Potential Returns of Over 1000%! PropiChain’s native token (PCHAIN) further makes a compelling case for PropiChain. As an early investor in PCHAIN, you can be looking at a high ROI potential. Projections go as high as 801% profit for first-round buyers. This is even better because $0.004 is the lowest PCHAIN will ever be priced. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is still in its first presale round, so getting in this early would be a smart investment. By investing $1500 now, you’re potentially looking at a return of over $15000. 45% of 1.5 billion tokens will be issued throughout PropiChain’s presale phase, and you can join as an early investor and enjoy massive ROI. Secure your stake in real estate with PropiChain. Don’t let this opportunity pass–connect your wallet today.

With meme coins taking the crypto world by storm, it’s no surprise they’ve become the favourite alternative to traditional investments. From wild speculation to genuine utility, projects like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Sudeng (HIPPO) have set the standard, and now BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, shaking up the scene with its explosive presale. Jumping into stage 8 of its presale, BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin launches. Having already raised over $1.35 million in under ten days, with 29 billion coins sold to 3,100 holders, it’s no exaggeration to say this is one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in this week. With utilities like staking rewards and a bold Play2Earn game, BTFD Coin offers more than just a shot at the moon—it’s a full-blown movement. BTFD Coin: A Bullish Movement in the Making BTFD isn’t just another crypto; it’s a lifestyle, a mindset, and a rallying cry for those ready to seize the dip. With roots in Ethereum’s secure and scalable blockchain, BTFD promises decentralisation, liquidity, and a chance for all traders—newbies and veterans alike—to enter at prime prices. Breaking Down the Numbers In its seventh presale stage, BTFD Coin is selling for $0.000064. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, nearly half—48%—is allocated for the presale. By the 10th stage, the price is projected to climb to $0.0006, presenting an unparalleled entry point. Play2Earn Game & Staking Rewards One of BTFD’s most exciting features is its upcoming Play2Earn game. Launching in phase 8, the game transforms crypto engagement into an immersive experience, letting players earn tokens while competing in a vibrant digital world. Add staking rewards into the mix, boasting an impressive 90% APY, and you’ve got a coin that not only entertains but builds wealth for the long haul. Why Meme Coins Matter Meme coins thrive on community-driven momentum. Think of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu—what started as jokes quickly turned into a cultural phenomena. BTFD leverages this power, uniting dip-buyers in a bold movement that’s already turning heads in the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Meme Coin Powerhouse Dogwifhat is more than a quirky name; it’s a community-driven project that has earned its place as one of the go-to investments in the meme coin space. Launched on Solana, WIF capitalises on low transaction fees and high-speed processing to attract a devoted following. WIF isn’t just surviving the meme coin frenzy; it’s thriving. With 53% green days in the past month, Dogwifhat has become a beacon of stability in a volatile market. Its Fear & Greed Index consistently sits in “Extreme Greed,” highlighting strong investor confidence. Dogwifhat is known for its meme-heavy branding and its ability to foster a sense of belonging among its holders. Social media buzz and gamified features keep its community engaged, ensuring WIF’s place as a long-term contender in the crypto space. Sudeng (HIPPO): The Meme Coin With a Purpose Inspired by Thailand’s beloved baby pygmy hippo, Moo Deng, Sudeng (HIPPO) combines the whimsy of meme coins with a real-world mission. Built on the Sui blockchain, it supports wildlife conservation efforts, making it a coin with a conscience. Sudeng’s explosive 90% surge following its Binance futures listing is a testament to its staying power. By blending meme culture with philanthropic causes, HIPPO taps into a unique niche, offering investors both emotional and financial returns. HIPPO thrives on a vibrant community that rallies around its mascot and mission. From themed campaigns to international collaborations, Sudeng’s strategy shows how meme coins can transcend the digital world, creating real-world impact. Conclusion Based on the current market dynamics, it’s clear that meme coins are here to stay. Whether it’s the stability and growth of Dogwifhat, the philanthropic charm of Sudeng, or the bold ambition of BTFD Coin, each offers unique opportunities for investors. However, BTFD Coin’s presale is where the real excitement lies.

How The Ethereum Price Could Reach $18,000 In a TradingView post, BallaJi predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $18,000. The crypto analyst explained that based on logarithmic projections, the measured move of this HVF could send Ethereum to the target. He provided a caveat, stating that the price rally to the target might not happen in 2025.

A rally to this price target would give Ethereum a market cap of around $2 trillion based on its circulating supply of 120.44 million ETH. Meanwhile, BallaJi highlighted three logarithmic targets on the chart, with $18,000 being the third and last target. The first and second targets are at $3,818 and $6,236 respectively. In an update on the trade setup, the crypto analyst noted that the Ethereum price has reached, broken, and retested the first target at $3,818. With the trade now active, BallaJi provided insights into how the Ethereum price could continue this upward trend using linear measured moves. The accompanying chart he shared showed that the next linear target is at $5,193; a rally to that target would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for ETH, with its current ATH at $4,800. Meanwhile, the next linear target is at $7,299. BallaJi’s chart showed that the Ethereum price should hit these price targets by next year. A rally to the $7,299 target could then pave the way for ETH to reach $18,000, although the analyst already warned that it might not happen in 2025. Countdown To New ATH Has Begun In an X post, crypto analyst Justin Bennett stated that the countdown to a new ATH for the Ethereum price has begun. According to the analyst, ETH could rally quickly above $5,000 as it breaks several levels this week. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the quick rally above $5,000 could lead Ethereum to hit $6,300.

He stated that ETH’s market structure mirrors BTC’s from a few weeks ago. He remarked that the $5,000 target is just the minimum as he believes that Ethereum will likely go higher. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,980, up almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Due to high volatility and hundreds of factors affecting the market, including macroeconomic events like the US election, it is quite unpredictable. One such event brought the crypto market rally with Donald Trump’s win in the election. With such events, the PEPE token has brought enormous gains for its holders, including one crypto investor, which turned $70M to $7M within two years. Here’s How Crypto Trader Turned $70 Into $7M In an impressive crypto trading experience, a crypto investor turned his 0.035 Ethereum into millions of dollars after investing in a PEPE token. The Frog-themed token has been leading the popular meme coins list for years. However, the demand grew even higher in 2024, when it formed multiple ATH peaks, making heavy profits for its holders. It includes this one investor who spent 0.035 ETH ($70.4) to buy 2.61T PEPE worth $58.7M today. An early buyer who spent only 0.035 $ETH ($70.4) to buy 2.61T $PEPE ($57.3M currently) deposited the remaining 189.4B $PEPE ($4.15M) to #Kraken 50 minutes ago. Even though he sold most of his $PEPE early on, he turned $70.4 into $7.06M—a return of over 100,000x.… pic.twitter.com/VfzBTY0LcO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2024 However, he sold a portion of these from time to time and managed to turn these $70.4 into $7.06M. The crypto investor’s most recent transaction was the deposition of 189.4B PEPE($4.15M) on Kraken on December 5, 2024. Regardless, this person has made a 100,000x return over this $70, surprising the crypto trading community. Similar Crypto Trading Experience In PEPE Token PEPE is the 23rd biggest cryptocurrency in the market thanks to its market capitalization of $9.42B. In the last 12 months alone, its price has increased 1424%, creating the ATH of $0.00002524 just 24 days ago. However, it has moved 11% away from that currently trading at $0.0000224 with a trading volume of $3.12B. It clearly indicates the high demand for the token. Interestingly, such a profitable investor’s experience is growing its demand further. A memecoin investor turned $26 into $61.5M is another prime example of successful crypto trading in PEPE tokens. Interestingly, in the last few days alone, Lookonchain has revealed two more crypto investors with high returns. One invested $241.5K and turned that into $7.53M after holding his token for a year. Another trader made $1.31M in profits after selling his 240B PEPE token. A whale bought 240B $PEPE ($3.64M) at a high price on May 29, and the price of $PEPE dropped afterward. But instead of panic selling, he held on for 6 months. Just 30 minutes ago, he sold his 240B $PEPE ($4.95M), making a profit of $1.31M! https://t.co/PBnbhDLhjf pic.twitter.com/MPyfSkYMWs — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 4, 2024 Interestingly, there are many similar cases in this and various other meme coins, as 2024 has witnessed heavy returns from this category. What’s In There For You? Meme coins have become the biggest attraction for the crypto trading industry in 2024. However, some memecoins scams are also equally repelling the new crypto investors, including this Hawk Tuah Girl memecoin controversy , where the Hawk coin pumped and crashed within a few hours, concerning the community over the possibility of a rug pull scam. That is why, investing in any cryptocurrencies, including PEPE tokens, requires intense research and strategies to stay profitable, like this crypto investor who turned $70 into $7M over two years.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 00:33:35

According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s short-term price action may now enter a phase of consolidation and “choppy” movements. “The 14-day Choppiness Index is in an early zone showing corrective moves during consolidation,” wrote CryptoQuant contributor Percival in a blog post on Dec. 6. The Choppiness Index (CI) measures market conditions on a scale of 0-100. Higher values indicate more erratic or “choppy” price action, while lower values suggest trending movements. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s daily CI was at 56.7, its highest level since mid-August, suggesting ongoing consolidation after the recent price swings. “One thing to take into account is the time factor of consolidation. In the 2020/2021 cycles, there were 20 days of downtime, and in the consolidation since March, the average decline was ~20 days,” Percival explained. “The greater the consolidation, the greater the rise.” While this period of cooling off may frustrate Bitcoin bulls, analysts predict that longer consolidation could lead to a stronger breakout. Potential BTC Targets: $110,000 and Beyond Looking ahead, CryptoQuant highlights potential price targets for Bitcoin once the consolidation ends. Percival suggests that key resistance levels will emerge at $110,000 and $120,000, based on market psychology and the realized price of short-term holders (STHs). “The first level will be $110K (+1.5 standard deviations), a considerable profit zone for STH,” he noted. “As traders connect to psychological numbers, $120K has a very impactful psychological and emotional charge, and being a value within +2 standard deviations makes this floor a deeper consolidation camp.” Bitcoin’s next major move remains to be seen, but patient bulls could be rewarded with significant price gains.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 00:57:50

Binance rolled out trading services for the interoperability protocol Across ( ACX ) and the Solana ( SOL )-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Orca ( ORCA ). The native tokens of both platforms witnessed massive gains on Friday, with ACX surging by nearly 88% and ORCA jumping by almost 80%. Those represented the largest gains of any top 1,000 tokens by market cap that day, according to CoinGecko . Across aims to be a “new paradigm in cross-chain experiences” and is powered by cross-chain intents, which are types of orders where users specify outcomes instead of execution paths. Meanwhile, Orca aims to offer “the most user-friendly environment for traders and LPs (liquidity providers) of varying experience levels.” Binance will attach seed tags to both assets, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. The platform requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens. ACX, the 244th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $1.07 at time of writing. OCRA, the 282nd-ranked asset, is trading at $6.98.
