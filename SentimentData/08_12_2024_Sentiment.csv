Flows into meme coins flipped green after days in the woods as bulls look to end the year on a high note. Data from IntoTheBlock shows whales moved from a 534 billion net outflow to 580 billion net inflows, setting the tint for individual acquisitions. The recent crypto uprising has seen large holders ramp up activity, swooping 9 trillion PEPE tokens and igniting price projections to new levels. According to Lookonchain data , a whale withdrew 337 billion PEPE worth $6.92 million from Binance. The movement of assets out of centralized exchanges is a bull signal of long-term holdings. This ignited other solo holders to look towards the asset, sparking a huge 24-hour rally. Whale activities swing the market with a positive effect on retail traders. In the last 24 hours, small-scale traders have also moved into PEPE and other meme coins to partake in the rebound. PEPE Jumps 8% Recent heavy buys on the asset have significantly impacted the price. In the last 24 hours, PEPE gained 8.2% to trade at $0.00002649, as its market cap tops $11 billion. Daily trading volumes are at an inc redible high of 34%, hitting $5.3 billion. Longer-term price fluctuations are also in the green zone, alongside sentiments. In the last seven days, PEPE surged 6% and a massive 167% in 30 days. Meanwhile, yearly growth stands at 1,517%. The recent jump in PEPE price has flipped wallets from losses to gains. “ A whale bought 240B $PEPE($3.64M) at a high price on May 29, and the price of $PEPE dropped afterward. But instead of panic selling, he held on for 6 months. Just 30 minutes ago, he sold his 240B $PEPE($4.95M), making a profit of $1.31M,” Lookonchain wrote. Meme Coins Record Gains Meme coins have recovered after days of slow trading across various asset classes. Due to high volatility, these assets tend to record heavy swings in line with the direction of market sentiments. Meme coin leader Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 4.9% today, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FLOKI soared 6.8% and 4.4%, respectively. Some lower market cap assets skyrocketed as high as 100% on a larger community rally.

The ETFs have recorded ten consecutive days of positive inflows, beginning from November 22. Ethereum ETF Inflows Signal Growing Interest Farside Investor data shows that the Ethereum ETFs finished the week with $83.8 million inflow on Friday. Friday’s inflow came from five asset managers, namely BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale Mini Trust. Notably, Fidelity’s FETH led with a total inflow of $47.9 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA with $34.6 million. Bitwise’s ETHW, VanEck’s ETHV, and Grayscale’s ETH raked in $13.4 million, $1.5 million and $22.9 million respectively. Friday’s inflow marks ten consecutive days of favorable inflows into Ethereum ETF. This ten-day streak is the longest the funds have achieved since they commenced trading in July. Additionally, Friday’s inflow marks the fourth-highest volume trading day as over $992 million worth of assets were traded, according to SoSoValue data . Meanwhile, all nine ETF products except Grayscale’s ETHE have had a good run and are registering positive inflows. ETHE has suffered massive outflows since November 18, with only two days of zero flow on November 27 and 29, respectively. Experts have attributed these outflows to the huge transaction fees of 2.50% Ethereum’s Price Rally and Market Sentiment The growing institutional interest in Ethereum ETF syncs with the recent price spike of ETH in the market. Ethereum climbed into the $4,000 level following sustained investors’ interest in the altcoin. The coin crossed the psychologically significant level a day after Bitcoin hit $100,000. As of this writing, CoinMarketCap data shows ETH exchanging hands at $4,000.79. Ethereum had reached $4,089 in earlier trading before dropping to their current levels. Despite this drop, analysts still anticipate Ethereum to test $5,000 in the ongoing bull cycle. Fundamentals Fuelling Optimism for the Future The growing institutional interest in Ethereum ETF, after having a slower start when compared with Bitcoin ETFs, has fuelled optimism for a brighter future. Furthermore, the industry has a positive outlook due to the nomination of pro-crypto individuals to head key positions by President-elect Donald Trump. Analysts believe these fundamentals might support Ethereum’s quest to test the $5,000 level before the second quarter of 2025 ends.

For weeks, the crypto leader has circled the $90K zone, leaping as high as 99K before a series of corrections amid volatility. A jump above the $100K level was just a matter of time for most bulls as institutions kept ramping up assets. The break past $100K psychological resistance level has set the token for a new market drive, as projected by several large holders and analysts. Notably, all holders are tipping a higher sky surge for the asset. BTC price trades at $100,260, a massive 7% growth in the last 24 hours, extending weekly and monthly numbers. Bitcoin Enthusiasts Pitch Higher Price Across crypto spaces, Bitcoin holders opine that $100K is a building point over the next few months. Several traders have pointed to positive regulations for a higher upswing above $150k in 2025. Crypto user Danheld explained that $100K Bitcoin is more than a price as it shows the world moving towards financial freedom. “ $100,000 a Bitcoin doesn’t just represent a price. It represents that the world is gradually acknowledging Bitcoin as the reserve currency of the future. It represents a rejection of the existing financial system. It represents financial freedom.” According to Bernstein , the asset’s price will hit $200k by 2025, ushering in a new institutional era for the crypto leader. The last 11 months have seen surging flows to Bitcoin from traditional firms following the approval of spot ETFs, which created a new investment window. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered has maintained a projection for $200K. While most firms pitch around this margin, bears say a correction could still be on the cards. US Macro Factors Spark BTC Price The outcome of the United States election set Bitcoin on an upward trajectory, with its price soaring. President-elect Donald Trump set out plans for the crypto space after years of regulatory uncertainty.

Despite the correction, many analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s potential to regain momentum, while others predict a deeper retrace before any significant rally. The market appears divided, with bulls eyeing a potential breakout and skeptics bracing for a quiet sell-off. Related Reading: Dogecoin Still In Consolidation – Analyst Expects $0,63 If We Get A Breakout Crypto analyst Harry weighed in on the discussion, sharing a detailed technical analysis on X. He highlighted that XRP could target a $4 price once it completes a deeper retracement. Harry’s analysis suggests that while bullish sentiment remains valid, the path forward might require additional consolidation or even a short-term dip to reset market conditions. This divergence of opinions underscores the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s price action. Will the retrace provide a launchpad for the next rally, or will it pave the way for prolonged bearish pressure? As XRP hovers near key levels, the coming days will determine whether bulls or bears gain control. For now, XRP holders and traders must watch these movements closely, as the token’s future hinges on breaking this current stalemate. Price Action Signals Storm Before The Run XRP has recently faced a significant retrace, and many analysts believe further correction or consolidation could be on the horizon before a bullish continuation occurs. After reaching high levels, the token pauses, with some experts forecasting a stabilization period. However, the bullish camp remains hopeful, anticipating new highs in the coming months as buy-side pressure builds. Top analyst Harry shared his insights on X, pointing out that XRP has yet to retest the critical $1.96 breakout level. Currently, the price is hovering between $1.96 and the 2017 all-time high of $2.77. According to Harry’s technical analysis, this positioning indicates growing bullish momentum. He further suggests that if XRP’s current flag formation breaks to the upside, the token could be poised for a powerful rally toward new highs. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week? This analysis follows weeks of speculation surrounding XRP’s price trajectory, especially in the wake of Bitcoin’s volatile movements. BTC has fluctuated around the $100K psychological level, repeatedly breaking and losing it. These conditions have added an extra layer of uncertainty to the market, leaving traders uncertain of what to expect next. XRP Showing Indecision XRP is trading at $2.40, marking a 14% recovery from its recent local lows of $2.16. Despite this bounce, the token’s price action remains uncertain as market sentiment remains divided. Traders and investors are closely monitoring the next moves, with no definitive signs pointing to either a bullish continuation or the formation of a cycle top. The key levels to watch are $2.25 and $2.50. If XRP manages to hold above the $2.25 support and reclaim the $2.50 level in the near term, it could signal the start of a renewed bullish rally. This scenario would likely attract additional buying pressure, pushing XRP closer to retesting its recent highs. However, the market’s current indecision reflects broader uncertainty, and any failure to reclaim these levels could lead to further consolidation or a potential downside.

If you’re looking to maximize your returns, the BTFD presale is undoubtedly one of the best meme coin presales on the market right now. Now, let’s talk numbers.

This token has its fans and has made some noise in the meme coin arena, but it hasn’t quite achieved the same level of excitement as BTFD Coin. While it rides the coattails of the meme coin phenomenon, Brett lacks the innovative features that make BTFD stand out. Without a P2E game or robust staking options, investors might not find the same level of engagement or potential returns. Brett’s community is passionate, but it feels more like a casual hangout than a powerhouse ready to propel its coin skyward. The project has tried to tap into meme culture, but it hasn’t fully embraced the community-driven spirit that fuels the success of tokens like BTFD. Investors looking for serious gains might find themselves questioning whether Brett is the right choice for their portfolio. In short, while Brett has its merits and a dedicated following, it may not be positioned well enough to compete with the innovative offerings of BTFD Coin. If you’re serious about making an investment that could pay off big time, the best meme coin presale right now is clearly BTFD. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Bus!

Chainlink (LINK) has staged a late rally this week and currently needs to gain just 10% to recapture a three-year high following its peak in January 2022, according to the analytics firm. Despite the rise, the analytics firm claims that there is very little FOMO in LINK. The company interprets this as a positive sign. According to Santiment, markets tend to move in a direction contrary to the community’s expectations, and therefore the community’s lack of faith in this token could be fuel for the rally.

However, the latest decrease of 85,503 BTC observed in the last 48 hours was recorded as the largest decline observed since February. The other sudden decline in February occurred 2 weeks before the all-time high of $ 73,000. However, the analytics firm added that the level of these wallet balances has not shown any correlation with the price of Bitcoin for most of the year. According to the firm, whales and smaller investors, sharks, who are not involved in mining, are still accumulating BTC. The firm reported that these two signals are a net neutral signal in total. *This is not investment advice.

In a conversation about Justin Sun’s journey through the cryptocurrency world, the founder of Tron reflected on his early days in the industry. He reveals how he bought Bitcoin when it was worth less than $1 and helped pioneer the concept of smart contracts. Justin Sun’s early crypto investments Sun’s journey into crypto began in 2012 when Bitcoin was still in its infancy and could be purchased for less than $1. He recalls that at the time, even platforms like Taobao, a major e-commerce site in China, were selling Bitcoin. This was a far cry from today’s massive crypto exchanges and skyrocketing Bitcoin prices. JUSTIN SUN: ""I BOUGHT BITCOIN AT $1 AND WORKED ON THE IDEA OF SMART CONTRACTS"" “I got into crypto in 2012, Bitcoin was less than $1. You could even buy Bitcoin from Taobao, an eBay e-commerce platform in China. Ripple Labs at the time, started a new company, a new token name… https://t.co/j27tRQASr6 pic.twitter.com/b1EnXVMO95 — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 7, 2024 Sun also joined Ripple Labs, where the team was focused on creating a new token called XRP. During this time, Sun began to see the massive potential of blockchain technology. By 2014, Sun and his team began focusing on a new vision building a blockchain to support smart contracts. At that time, smart contracts were a completely new idea in the crypto space. No existing cryptocurrencies had implemented them, but Sun and his team believed in this feature and thought that it could greatly improve blockchain technology’s flexibility and use cases. From Ripple to Ethereum In 2015, Ethereum came onto the scene, successfully raising funds through its initial coin offering (ICO). This confirmed the validity of Sun’s vision, he and his team invested heavily in Ethereum’s ICO, recognizing its potential to revolutionize the blockchain space. Around the same time, platforms like Poloniex also emerged, allowing users to buy and trade Ethereum, helping them to establish the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi). With the rise of Ethereum and the launch of ERC-20 tokens, Sun and his team began to develop their own blockchain by focusing on making smart contract implementation faster and more affordable. The idea is to create a more efficient and scalable blockchain than Ethereum. Reflecting on the early days, Sun also spoke about Bitcoin’s volatility. At the time, Bitcoin’s price constantly fluctuated, making it hard to judge its true value. Bitcoin’s price was often measured in terms of Ethereum, as there were no stable fiat pairings for Ethereum at that time. For Sun, the early crypto years were about innovation, taking risks, and working towards a vision that helped build today’s blockchain ecosystem. By buying Bitcoin for under $1, investing in Ethereum’s ICO, and leading the charge for smart contract development, Sun’s impact on the crypto world continues to resonate today.

I understand why a century ago, we accumulated gold in Fort Knox,” he added. “Of all the prices to support, why would the government choose to support, by accumulating a sterile inventory, a bunch of Bitcoin?” “There’s no reason to do that other than to pander to generous special interest campaign contributors.” Trump proposed that the U.S. government hold onto its seized Bitcoin, currently amounting to approximately 198,000 BTC worth over $19 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence. Some Trump-aligned Republicans, like Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, are pushing for legislation to acquire 1 million BTC — about 5% of the total supply — and hold it for at least 20 years. Despite his criticism, Summers acknowledged some validity in Trump’s views on cryptocurrency. “I think we need to support financial innovation wherever it may go, and there are probably respects in which crypto has been over-regulated by overzealous regulators,” he said. Summers, who served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Clinton, also had a brief advisory role with the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG) in 2016. Lummis’s push for a Bitcoin reserve aims to address the $36 trillion national debt. However, Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, cautioned that the proposal is not a comprehensive solution. “The Bitcoin reserve is good, but it does not solve the problem,” Roy stated at a crypto summit. “You still have to actually do the budgetary reforms to get us out of this $2 trillion a year of federal deficits.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|REGULATION|ARKM,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 22:02:00

The meme-based cryptocurrency surged by 20% in the past 24 hours, achieving an all-time high of $0.00002622. As its market capitalization surpasses $11 billion, the crypto community is closely watching for further price movement, with some analysts predicting a potential 150% rally. PEPE Reaches New ATH in Market Cap and Price After hitting an all-time high today, PEPE has crossed a $10 billion market capitalization, cementing its position as the third-largest meme coin by market value. Pepe’s market cap has since climbed to over $11 billion, making it the 20th largest digital asset across the entire crypto market. This comes on the back of sustained growth since early November, when PEPE price began a notable rally. During that period, the coin experienced a 100% weekly surge, driven by major exchange listings, including Coinbase and Robinhood. Although it retraced by 25% in subsequent weeks, whale accumulation provided support for the asset, leading to its recent resurgence. Whale Accumulation Sparks Renewed Rally Recent on-chain data shows that whales have played a significant role in PEPE’s latest rally. Reports indicate substantial accumulation of PEPE by large investors in recent weeks, with several high-value purchases recorded. Such activity has reduced available supply on the market, creating upward pressure on the price. Increased trading activity in the derivatives market has also fueled the rally. PEPE’s derivatives trading volume rose by 78%, reaching $1.67 billion, while open interest jumped by 39% to $368 million. These metrics reflect growing interest from traders and investors, further boosting the asset’s upward trajectory. PEPE Eyes 150% Surge Amid Bullish Projections As PEPE’s price continues to rise, market analysts suggest the possibility of a 150% increase in the coming weeks. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.00002622, with some analysts like JAVON MARKS projecting a potential move to $0.000063. PEPE’s recent performance has sparked discussions about its potential to overtake SHIB should it rally to $1 . SHIB currently holds a $19 billion market cap, leaving an $8 billion gap between the two tokens. While some investors view this as a challenging goal, others believe the ongoing market cycle could enable PEPE to close the gap.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-07 22:23:00

Is it a thrilling community, jaw-dropping presale success, or sheer utility? For BTFD Coin (BTFD), the answer is all of the above! As this next-gen meme coin races through its presale, it’s already raising eyebrows and expectations with its innovative Play2Earn game, staking rewards, and bold community-first ethos. Alongside established favourites like Bonk (BONK) and Cheems (CHEEMS), BTFD Coin is creating waves as one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in today. For those seeking alternative investment avenues to traditional stocks or bonds, meme coins like BONK and CHEEMS have consistently delivered excitement and opportunity. But with over $1.35 million raised in under 10 days, BTFD Coin is proving it’s not just another meme coin but a movement. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Built for Bold Investors BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the hype; it’s crafting a legacy. Currently, in the 8th stage of its presale, BTFD has already sold over 29 billion tokens to more than 3,100 investors, raising $1.35 million. By the time the presale ends, BTFD is set to rise from its current $0.000064 price to $0.0006—a clear win for early adopters. Here are some reasons that set it apart: Play2Earn Game Launching in stage 8, the BTFD Play2Earn (P2E) game takes centre stage. Players will join the Bulls Squad, navigate immersive levels, and convert in-game coins into BTFD tokens. Imagine playing a game where every power-up and challenge brings real-world financial rewards! This feature alone sets BTFD apart, making it a magnet for gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Staking Rewards for Long-Term Growth Unlike many meme coins, BTFD rewards loyalty. Investors staking their BTFD tokens enjoy an average annual percentage yield (APY) of 90%, turning short-term bets into long-term gains. Picture this: staking 1,000 tokens today could grow into thousands more in just a few years, thanks to compounding returns. A Community-Driven Ethos At its core, BTFD is built for the people. Its roadmap includes robust incentives like community airdrops, a locked liquidity pool for stability, and token burns to ensure sustainable growth. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or a first-timer, the BTFD community welcomes all Bulls ready to ride the market waves. With 48% of its total supply allocated for presale and 17% reserved for gaming rewards, BTFD is more than a coin—it’s an ecosystem designed for resilience and growth. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Community Darling Bonk has carved out a unique space as the meme coin for the Solana blockchain. Launched as a community-first initiative, BONK has built a reputation as a symbol of unity and fun within the crypto space. Bonk (BONK) is a community-focused token on Solana, ensuring fair distribution and supporting NFTs and dApps. Its fast, low-cost transactions make it ideal for micro-payments and tipping. BONK stands out as more than just a meme coin in the decentralised ecosystem. While BONK may not offer staking or gaming utilities like BTFD, its strong community engagement and established market presence make it a go-to alternative investment for those seeking a lighter entry into the crypto world. Cheems (CHEEMS): A Meme Coin with a Cult Following Cheems isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a cultural icon. Inspired by the late Balltze, the beloved Shiba Inu, CHEEMS has built a legacy that goes beyond price charts and market caps. CHEEMS stays in the spotlight with Binance’s Meme Zone offering up to 75x leverage, appealing to risk-tolerant traders. Its strong cultural ties to Balltze’s iconic meme keep it relevant, blending fun with solid growth potential in the crypto market. CHEEMS’ long-standing appeal and established market position make it an excellent counterpart to newer entrants like BTFD. However, its lack of unique utilities, such as gaming or staking, leaves space for projects like BTFD to innovate. Why BTFD Stands Out Among the Best New Meme Coin Presales to Invest in Today When it comes to meme coins, each has its charm—BONK’s community focus, CHEEMS’ cultural legacy, and BTFD Coin’s bold vision. But based on our research, BTFD Coin stands out as the best new meme coin presale to invest in today. With over $1.35 million raised in under 10 days, a revolutionary Play2Earn game, and robust staking rewards, BTFD is more than a meme—it’s a movement.

Despite an earlier report of the asset inching closer to gaining regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), things have stalled. Competitive Challenges in a Crowded Stablecoin Market However, David Schwartz, Ripple CTO, remains optimistic that something could shift and see the launch of RLUSD. Schwartz maintained that notwithstanding the challenges, he remains hopeful RLUSD will launch this year. He expressed concerns about the rapidly approaching holiday season, which could cause delays. As per the timeline, many anticipated RLUSD might launch as early as December 4. However, the regulatory nod has yet to be given. Ripple, however, remains determined to enter the stablecoin market. Notable players dominating the sector include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). When given the green light, Ripple will have to find a way to thrive in the highly competitive stablecoin market. RLUSD’s Strategic Market Entry In April 2024, Ripple announced its planned launch of a stablecoin. As per the announcement, RLUSD will initially be accessible on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Four months later in August, Ripple commenced testing ahead of the anticipated launch. Ripple Labs’ target is to integrate RLUSD into its cross-border payment arrangement along with XRP. That is, RLUSD will serve as a complementary product to XRP. The goal is to enhance liquidity solutions across borders. It appears the green light is all that stands in the way of Ripple’s RLUSD to hit the market. Monica Long, Ripple Labs President , recently stated that RLUSD has been designed to meet the growing need for USD-based stablecoin, particularly in Latin America. Regulatory Scrutiny and Ripple Lab’s RLUSD Launch Readiness The New York State Department of Financial Services is still subjecting Ripple’s application to scrutiny. Schwartz, however, assures that efforts were ongoing to ensure that all Ripple’s partners launch in an organized way without any challenges. He maintains that Ripple will make it happen despite the difficult regulatory process. Besides XRP Ledger and Ethereum, Ripple has secured partnerships with other notable exchanges. These include Bitso, Uphold, Moonpay, and Bitstamp to facilitate the adoption of RLUSD when it launches. Meanwhile, market makers B2C2 and Keyrock will support RLUSD’s liquidity.

The court’s ruling in favor of Ripple in July 2023 has been hailed as a pivotal event, with many suggesting it could reshape how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the U.S. Despite multiple losses and a conclusion to the lawsuit in August of this year, the SEC filed an appeal, attempting to pull Ripple back into the courts and potentially suppress XRP. During the interview, Garlinghouse would discuss the company’s issues with the SEC, and potential steps forward now that Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration is about to take over the White House. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Influence in Politics The teaser video shared by 60 Minutes highlights Ripple’s growing influence in U.S. politics. This is a major reason Ripple is getting featured on 60 Minutes. 85% of candidates for U.S. Congress supported by Ripple won their elections. This incredible feat shows that the voices of the crypto community matter in U.S. politics. This could be a major talking point during the interview, along with broader issues within the cryptocurrency sector, including the ongoing regulatory debate in the United States. Garlinghouse has been vocal about the need for clear and consistent guidelines to support innovation while protecting consumers. 60 Minutes is the longest-running investigative news show in the U.S. This well-respected platform will give Garlinghouse a chance to tell Ripple’s side of the story to a broad audience and act as a voice for the crypto market in America.

XRP is currently trading between $1.60 and $2.67, showing impressive growth with a 1-week price change of 49.95% and a 1-month surge of 348.85%. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.04. If it breaks through, it could target the second resistance at $4.12. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.33, slightly below the 100-day average of $2.50, hinting at a potential upward trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 44.58, indicating that XRP is not overbought. With the crypto market anticipating an altcoin season and a global bull run, XRP could see significant gains in the near future. TRON (TRX) Ready for a Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches TRON's price is currently between $0.19 and $0.22, showing strong growth over the past six months with an increase of over 180%. The nearest resistance is at $0.23, and breaking this level could push the price toward $0.26. In the last week alone, TRX has risen nearly 60%, and over the past month, it has surged by more than 100%. The Relative Strength Index is around 43, indicating room for further growth. The low stochastic value suggests potential for an upswing. If TRX moves above the simple moving averages, which are currently higher than the price, we could see significant bullish movement as altcoin season gains momentum. Dogecoin Set to Soar as Altcoin Season Nears and Bull Run Gains Momentum Dogecoin is showing signs of upward momentum with its current price between $0.3868 and $0.4724. Over the past month, it has surged by over 155%, indicating strong investor interest. The 10-day simple moving average is slightly above the 100-day average, suggesting a positive trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 50, implying the coin is not overbought. If Dogecoin breaks the nearest resistance level at $0.5042, it could target the next resistance near $0.5898, potentially increasing by another 20%. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish crypto market, Dogecoin may be set for significant growth in the coming weeks. Conclusion While XRP, TRX, and DOGE show limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering 700% ROI in its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility through governance, rewards, and staking, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains.

In a statement, South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) says BRICS is not working on a currency that could be used as an alternative to USD, reports Bloomberg. According to DIRCO, reports have misinterpreted the intentions of the economic bloc about trade settlements between member nations. “Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency. This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.” In May of last year, reports emerged that BRICS was working on a new currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets in a push to abandon the US dollar. Despite those reports, South Africa is now saying that BRICS has no intention of promoting de-dollarization efforts. “South Africa supports the increased use of national currencies in international trade and financial transactions to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, rather than focusing on dedollarization. The strengthening of correspondent banking networks and the development of infrastructure for settlements in national currencies could further this aim.” South Africa’s statements come as President-elect Donald Trump issued an ultimatum against BRICS. Trump says on the social media platform Truth Social that he plans to take severe measures if BRICS creates or backs a dollar alternative. “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy. They can go find another ‘sucker!’ There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the US dollar in international trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America.” As a whole, BRICS nations have expressed varying levels of support for a common currency, with leaders in Russia and Brazil firmly behind the idea. South Africa is the most conservative, expressing the need for a cautious approach while emphasizing the importance of the US dollar.

Table of Contents Jelle: The price of Solana may reach a new ATH Expert makes a bullish Cardano price prediction IntelMarkets riding a bullish wave with 610% surge What may come for Solana, Cardano & IntelMarkets? The crypto space is filled with confidence, as many tokens are on the rise. Crypto analyst Jelle has confidently forecasted that Solana (SOL) will hit a new ATH, which adds to its bullishness. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) and the new phase seven presale star IntelMarkets (INTL) saw a combined price growth of over 800%. While many analysts, like Trend Rider, have made bold price predictions for ADA, some are also noticing INTL. Since this project has already surged by 500% in its crypto ICO event, they think another 1,000% surge may come in 2025. Jelle: The price of Solana may reach a new ATH Solana is currently among the top 10 altcoins. CoinMarketCap shows that the Solana price surged from $163 to $231 on the one-month chart. This is over a 40% rise in just a few weeks. Crypto analyst Jelle remains optimistic for Solana. According to his X post, this altcoin has bounced from its 200-day EMA and broke out of its falling wedge. In his Solana price prediction, he foresees a new ATH coming for this token. This would mean a rise past $263. The technical analysis for the Solana crypto is also bullish. TradingView shows that this altcoin is trading above its 30-day EMA ($223) and its 50-day EMA ($208). Plus, its bull-bear power sits at 2.58, which is in the buy zone and suggests bulls may push this value up. You might also like: Ripple moves past Solana, IntelMarkets price pumps to $0.064091 Expert makes a bullish Cardano price prediction Cardano has also been turning some heads recently. Over the past 30 days, the price of Cardano soared over 250%. CoinMarketCap shows that its value moved between $0.33 and $1.20 during that time. TradingView data also shows that this bullish trend may continue. For instance, Cardano (ADA) is valued above its 20-day EMA ($0.96) and its 30-day EMA ($0.86). Moreover, its MACD level shows a 0.16 indicator in the buy zone, suggesting a good entry point for buyers. Market expert Trend Rider made a bullish Cardano price prediction. In his X post, he said that this altcoin could see a price surge to $3 soon. Therefore, many traders are getting excited for the Cardano coin. IntelMarkets riding a bullish wave with 610% surge IntelMarkets is riding a bullish wave in the crypto market, mainly because of its performance in the presale. It’s in the seventh phase, but the crypto ICO has already given early investors a 610% return. There is still plenty of room for growth, with several phases left to go. IntelMarkets’ long-term mission is to change how trading is done by combining artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. This new method will provide traders with access to self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time, omnichannel processing, and more. The INTL token will power this platform. It is now in phase seven of its presale with a value of only $0.064. But, this altcoin price will reach $0.073 once phase eight begins. Plus, traders are waiting for a new Tier-1 CEX listing for INTL, which could push the value to $0.11. What may come for Solana, Cardano & IntelMarkets? Solana, Cardano and IntelMarkets may all see big price gains soon. However, experts are paying close attention to INTL since it will have connections to the AI market, which Statista predicts will be worth $826B by 2030. This fact, plus its smaller market cap, could mean faster price growth with less money and more stability in the future. Thus, many experts foresee a potential 1,000% surge for this altcoin in 2025.

Last December 1st, XRP briefly went below $2.00 and has consolidated above this level for days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Days At The Top Numbered? Cardano Set To Take Over — Analyst Like most digital assets in recent days, XRP is undergoing extreme market volatility. However, for Vincent Van Code, a software engineer, the Ripple’s altcoin is poised to hit $5 under these market conditions. Van Code’s comments come when the broader crypto market is experiencing a substantial downturn, driven by Bitcoin’s erratic price movements, which briefly breached the $100k mark. The world’s top asset briefly hit $104,088 on Thursday but immediately suffered a “flash crash,” dropping to $90,500. As of this writing, Bitcoin has regained strength and is trading above $98k. #XRP is not dumping, it’s a whole market thing. Triggered by #BTC dump. Fundamentals are very strong for XRP, if you’re a holder, my gut is telling me it will hit $5 by Feb 2025. All this is noise. Not Financial Advice. I am not qualified to give any advice. pic.twitter.com/33dtboWwRl — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 5, 2024 Rising Market Concerns On Bitcoin And Crypto? The sudden Bitcoin crash was felt throughout the crypto market, spooking many retailers and investors. While the drop significantly affected the greater crypto market, the loss among top altcoins isn’t as big as Bitcoin’s. Ripple’s XRP is one of the top tokens that declined during Bitcoin’s brief crash. XRP’s price dropped from a high of $2.48 to $2.23, reflecting a 10% loss. Traditionally, altcoins often suffer massive price breakdowns every time Bitcoin corrects in price. Current Price Corrections Just ‘Noises’ For Long-Term Holders Market observers, including Van Code, have weighed in on the situation, highlighting XRP’s resilience amid Bitcoin’s slump. He attributed this outcome to the coin’s strong fundamentals, emphasizing that they remain solid despite market turbulence. Van Code analyzed the situation and shared his optimism on XRP, and he expects the token’s value to hit $5 by February 2025. According to the commentator, the current price corrections are just “noises” that can be ignored if you’re on XRP for the long haul. Ripple’s token has been following a range pattern for four days after momentarily hitting $2.85. Since then, XRP’s momentum has slowed, pushing the price to revisit $2.10. XRP Holders And Traders Getting Ready For Another Run XRP holders are holding on to their optimism and looking for the next drivers to push the asset to revisit its all-time high and enter a price discovery mode. At $2.36, Ripple’s XRP needs to surge by at least 112% to hit $5. Interestingly, XRP has increased by more than four times over the past month, keeping the hopes of holders and investors alive. #XRPHolders🚨 Get Ready #XRP Is About To Make New All Time High Of 3.50$ Very Soon. #XRP Printed Bull Flag Pattern 👀 pic.twitter.com/UyiMuGO6s3 — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 5, 2024 Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP?

Meanwhile, the broader altcoin market has been on a tear, riding bullish sentiment and speculative energy. Yet, history warns us that parabolic runs often end with equally dramatic corrections. Source: coinmarketcap.com Enter Brett ($ BRETT ), a bold challenger on Base, and Pepe ($ PEPE ), the Ethereum-based heavyweight memecoin. These tokens represent contrasting approaches to memecoins: nimble upstart versus entrenched giant. This article explores their fundamentals, technicals, and what’s next for traders navigating this volatile arena. Fundamental Breakdown Brett: The Base Network Underdog Brett is a compact package of memecoin hype, rooted in the Base blockchain, a fast-growing ecosystem optimized for low fees and scalability. With a circulating supply of 9.91 billion tokens out of a 10 billion maximum, Brett enjoys the advantage of limited inflation risk. Its fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $2.16 billion closely mirrors its current market cap of $2.13 billion, reflecting maturity in its tokenomics. Additionally, the token’s trading volume has spiked to $110 million in the past 24 hours, signaling robust liquidity and growing interest. The controlled supply ensures Brett doesn’t drown in oversaturation. Base’s scalability has provided a perfect platform for the token’s meteoric rise, drawing parallels with other efficient, low-cost blockchains such as Solana in its early days. Pepe: The Ethereum Heavyweight Pepe’s credentials are indisputable: a 420.69 trillion circulating supply (the entire maximum supply) and a market cap of $10.95 billion, reflecting its dominance in the memecoincategory. With $6.05 billion in daily volume, Pepe dwarfs most competitors, yet its size could be its Achilles’ heel. Ethereum’s reliance on higher gas fees often deters smaller investors, especially during network congestion. Moreover, Pepe’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) aligns with its market cap, implying that the token is in its final form—there’s no additional supply left to be released, but it raises concerns over whether its growth can sustain at these lofty valuations. Pepe, though dominant, carries the risk of being ""too big to grow."" Its Ethereum ($ ETH ) base offers prestige but also inherent weight, slowing its upward trajectory compared to more agile competitors like Brett. Can it defy gravity, or will it face the laws of diminishing returns? Technical Analysis Brett: Poised for a Breakout Brett recently completed a textbook Cup and Handle breakout, smashing through the critical $17.5-$18.5c resistance zone last week. With a confirmed breakout, the token’s price surged to $21.5c today, eyeing the 27.5c Cup & Handle target. Brett has retained strong momentum, aided by high volume-to-market cap ratio (5.15%), which signals sustained buyer interest. Dynamic support from the 200 moving average (4H) adds confidence, aligning with key support levels near $15.7c. The downside risk lies in losing $14c, which would expose Brett to a retest near $11c. However, a measured pullback to the $18.5c-$20c zone could offer fresh dip-buying opportunities for traders aiming to ride the next leg up. Key takeaway: Brett is in prime shape technically, with potential for further upside if bullish momentum continues. Short-term corrections might present the last chance for disciplined entries. Pepe: Stretching the Limits? Pepe also made waves, breaking through its $0.000026 ATH on Saturday (Dec 7). While its trajectory seemed unstoppable, RSI on the 4H chart shows a worrying divergence: price is making higher highs, but RSI is slumping, a potential warning of waning momentum. A correction back to $0.0000225, a key retest level, could stabilize the token for another push higher, while a fall below $0.000017 (Fair Value Gap’s upper band) risks further downside to $0.000013. Volume spikes on the breakout lacked follow-through, raising questions about sustained buying interest. Pepe’s massive supply and Ethereum's high gas fees add to the risks, making it more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks or altcoin market corrections. While its 420T supply can scare away some (but also attract – one gets more coins per 1 dollar spent), it thrives on sheer brand recognition. Key takeaway: Pepe must hold $0.0000225 in the short term to maintain its bullish narrative. However, risks of overextension and declining volume signal the need for caution. Comparison and Key Conclusions Market Structure: Brett’s compact supply on Base contrasts sharply with Pepe’s gargantuan tokenomics on Ethereum. Brett’s nimbleness could enable it to outperform in speculative bursts, while Pepe’s dominance offers stability but slower growth. Momentum: Brett benefits from a fresh breakout pattern with technical clarity. Pepe’s momentum is intact but beginning to flash warning signs of fatigue. Risk-Reward: Brett appears better positioned for short-term gains, while Pepe may require patience, especially at these lofty levels. Both tokens have explosive potential, but Brett’s lighter framework and Base affiliation make it a more aggressive speculative play, whereas Pepe’s scale requires a longer-term mindset. Summary and Final Thoughts Memecoins are the ultimate speculative instruments, thriving on hype, community-driven narratives, and outsized risk-reward potential. Brett and Pepe encapsulate these qualities but with vastly different styles. Brett’s base on the efficient Base network and lean tokenomicsmake it a sniper shot in a speculative market. Pepe, meanwhile, is Ethereum’s titan, commanding attention but lumbering under its own weight. Caution is key in this environment. Dogecoin’s continued strength sets a bullish tone, but as altcoins surge, the likelihood of a sharp correction grows. BTC holding $100K as support is critical, and any rejection there could trigger a cascade, disproportionately affecting speculative plays like memecoins. For traders, the roadmap is clear: avoid chasing pumps, accumulate during corrections, and always take partial profits. Brett offers nimble trading opportunities, while Pepe demands strategic patience. As we head into December, a historically volatile period for crypto, stay sharp and stay disciplined. Next, we dive into the memecoin rivalry between Shiba Inu and Floki, exploring whether the old guard can stand up to the next-gen contenders.

Looking for more 1000x calls, it’s only fair that Ethereum (ETH) and other crypto whales are investing in new opportunities that will multiply their portfolio. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA), once an investor favorite, has faced challenges and underperformance in Q4. As a result, investors are turning their attention elsewhere. One coin gaining significant attention is PropiChain , a token that aims to revolutionize the real estate investment industry by storm. It tokenizes real-world assets, enabling fractional property ownership and management. Let’s see why PropiChain (PCHAIN) is becoming the preferred choice for smart investors. The Current Overview of Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is not a newcomer to the crypto landscape. It broke into the space in 2017. With its promise of solving cryptocurrency issues involving scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance, Cardano (ADA) quickly rose to the limelight. It did so well that by May 2021, the coin had reached a market cap of $77 billion , ranking among the highest-performing cryptocurrencies . However, recent trends show that Cardano (ADA), despite its ambitious promises, has yet to deliver key features, leaving some investors exploring newer opportunities. A cryptocurrency that once traded at an all-time high of $3.099 currently sells for $1.203 and has a market cap of $42.64B . In the last 24 hours alone, Cardano (ADA) has experienced a significant drop of over 4.4%. Of course, this could be due to Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) whales selling off ahead of the next big thing. If Cardano (ADA) continues to surge and hits the all-time high (ATH) of $3.099, investors can expect an ROI of about 220%. However, PropiChain offers a more promising solution. It promises an ROI of over 10,000x and practical real estate investment opportunities. Can Ethereum Hold the Momentum? The market has been looking bullish for holders of Ethereum (ETH) as the coin continues to target new resistance levels. Ethereum (ETH) currently trades at $3790 , and the market seems primed. As more investors get in on the pump, Ethereum (ETH) is expected to continue to trade at even higher prices. However, even with this bullish forecast, Ethereum investors are increasingly exploring tokens with tangible utility. As a result, they are shifting to PropiChain (PCHAIN), the future of real estate investing. PropiChain uses smart contracts to automate lease agreements, making them more efficient and user-friendly. BlockAudit’s independent audit has confirmed PropiChain’s strong security posture, giving investors confidence in the platform’s ability to protect their assets. Is PropiChain the Next Big Thing? On the other hand, PropiChain (PCHAIN) ‘s future is looking even brighter as more investors flock to the platform. Due to its focus on real estate and the advanced technologies it uses, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) whales are starting to see the appeal. The platform is all about making buying, selling, and managing real estate easier. Offering practical, real-life applications, holders of PropiChain tokens can access a marketplace that features advanced technological integration, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Metaverse, and Virtual Reality (VR). As a user, you enjoy predictive market analysis that leverages the power of AI. You can now predict market trends, price changes, and top-performing properties and do much more in the real estate market. Investors will benefit from its fractional ownership feature. Through the platform, they can buy real estate, manage, and even transfer or sell properties to others—all on the blockchain. PropiChain covers everything related to property management, from token issuance to ownership transfer. It uses smart contracts that eliminate third parties, leading to faster and more secure contracts. Beyond that, PropiChain features automated payments and automatic reminders and even supports multi-currency payment options. The real estate token is also tied to tangible assets, providing a stable store of value unaffected by market volatility. Furthermore, PropiChain’s Metaverse integration will allow users to view and interact with their properties in immersive 3D environments. You don’t have to travel long distances or undergo stressful technical processes to participate in the real estate trend. These attributes underlie why Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) whales are rushing to join the PropiChain (PCHAIN) project. PropiChain (PCHAIN) also got listed on CoinMarketCap evidencing its credibility and expected success. Join the PropiChain Presale and Look Forward to Potential Returns of Over 1000%! PropiChain’s native token (PCHAIN) further makes a compelling case for PropiChain. As an early investor in PCHAIN, you can be looking at a high ROI potential. Projections go as high as 801% profit for first-round buyers. This is even better because $0.004 is the lowest PCHAIN will ever be priced. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is still in its first presale round, so getting in this early would be a smart investment. By investing $1500 now, you’re potentially looking at a return of over $15000. 45% of 1.5 billion tokens will be issued throughout PropiChain’s presale phase, and you can join as an early investor and enjoy massive ROI. Secure your stake in real estate with PropiChain. Don’t let this opportunity pass–connect your wallet today.

With meme coins taking the crypto world by storm, it’s no surprise they’ve become the favourite alternative to traditional investments. From wild speculation to genuine utility, projects like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Sudeng (HIPPO) have set the standard, and now BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, shaking up the scene with its explosive presale. Jumping into stage 8 of its presale, BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin launches. Having already raised over $1.35 million in under ten days, with 29 billion coins sold to 3,100 holders, it’s no exaggeration to say this is one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in this week. With utilities like staking rewards and a bold Play2Earn game, BTFD Coin offers more than just a shot at the moon—it’s a full-blown movement. BTFD Coin: A Bullish Movement in the Making BTFD isn’t just another crypto; it’s a lifestyle, a mindset, and a rallying cry for those ready to seize the dip. With roots in Ethereum’s secure and scalable blockchain, BTFD promises decentralisation, liquidity, and a chance for all traders—newbies and veterans alike—to enter at prime prices. Breaking Down the Numbers In its seventh presale stage, BTFD Coin is selling for $0.000064. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, nearly half—48%—is allocated for the presale. By the 10th stage, the price is projected to climb to $0.0006, presenting an unparalleled entry point. Play2Earn Game & Staking Rewards One of BTFD’s most exciting features is its upcoming Play2Earn game. Launching in phase 8, the game transforms crypto engagement into an immersive experience, letting players earn tokens while competing in a vibrant digital world. Add staking rewards into the mix, boasting an impressive 90% APY, and you’ve got a coin that not only entertains but builds wealth for the long haul. Why Meme Coins Matter Meme coins thrive on community-driven momentum. Think of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu—what started as jokes quickly turned into a cultural phenomena. BTFD leverages this power, uniting dip-buyers in a bold movement that’s already turning heads in the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Meme Coin Powerhouse Dogwifhat is more than a quirky name; it’s a community-driven project that has earned its place as one of the go-to investments in the meme coin space. Launched on Solana, WIF capitalises on low transaction fees and high-speed processing to attract a devoted following. WIF isn’t just surviving the meme coin frenzy; it’s thriving. With 53% green days in the past month, Dogwifhat has become a beacon of stability in a volatile market. Its Fear & Greed Index consistently sits in “Extreme Greed,” highlighting strong investor confidence. Dogwifhat is known for its meme-heavy branding and its ability to foster a sense of belonging among its holders. Social media buzz and gamified features keep its community engaged, ensuring WIF’s place as a long-term contender in the crypto space. Sudeng (HIPPO): The Meme Coin With a Purpose Inspired by Thailand’s beloved baby pygmy hippo, Moo Deng, Sudeng (HIPPO) combines the whimsy of meme coins with a real-world mission. Built on the Sui blockchain, it supports wildlife conservation efforts, making it a coin with a conscience. Sudeng’s explosive 90% surge following its Binance futures listing is a testament to its staying power. By blending meme culture with philanthropic causes, HIPPO taps into a unique niche, offering investors both emotional and financial returns. HIPPO thrives on a vibrant community that rallies around its mascot and mission. From themed campaigns to international collaborations, Sudeng’s strategy shows how meme coins can transcend the digital world, creating real-world impact. Conclusion Based on the current market dynamics, it’s clear that meme coins are here to stay. Whether it’s the stability and growth of Dogwifhat, the philanthropic charm of Sudeng, or the bold ambition of BTFD Coin, each offers unique opportunities for investors. However, BTFD Coin’s presale is where the real excitement lies.

Ethereum currently boasts a bullish outlook, having recently broken above $4,000 for the first time since March of this year. How The Ethereum Price Could Reach $18,000 In a TradingView post, BallaJi predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $18,000. The crypto analyst explained that based on logarithmic projections, the measured move of this HVF could send Ethereum to the target. He provided a caveat, stating that the price rally to the target might not happen in 2025. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price At $100,000 Is A ‘Dangerous Zone’, Predicts Massive Crash However, he is confident that if this bullish pattern is completed, then the Ethereum price could reach this $18,000 price target later on this decade. A rally to this price target would give Ethereum a market cap of around $2 trillion based on its circulating supply of 120.44 million ETH. Meanwhile, BallaJi highlighted three logarithmic targets on the chart, with $18,000 being the third and last target. The first and second targets are at $3,818 and $6,236 respectively. In an update on the trade setup, the crypto analyst noted that the Ethereum price has reached, broken, and retested the first target at $3,818. With the trade now active, BallaJi provided insights into how the Ethereum price could continue this upward trend using linear measured moves. The accompanying chart he shared showed that the next linear target is at $5,193; a rally to that target would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for ETH, with its current ATH at $4,800. Meanwhile, the next linear target is at $7,299. BallaJi’s chart showed that the Ethereum price should hit these price targets by next year. A rally to the $7,299 target could then pave the way for ETH to reach $18,000, although the analyst already warned that it might not happen in 2025. Countdown To New ATH Has Begun In an X post, crypto analyst Justin Bennett stated that the countdown to a new ATH for the Ethereum price has begun. According to the analyst, ETH could rally quickly above $5,000 as it breaks several levels this week. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the quick rally above $5,000 could lead Ethereum to hit $6,300. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Analysis: Ascending Triangle On 2-Hour Chart Shows DOGE Is Still Very Bullish Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also predicted that an Ethereum price rally to $5,000 is imminent. He stated that ETH’s market structure mirrors BTC’s from a few weeks ago. He remarked that the $5,000 target is just the minimum as he believes that Ethereum will likely go higher. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,980, up almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Frog-themed token has been leading the popular meme coins list for years. However, the demand grew even higher in 2024, when it formed multiple ATH peaks, making heavy profits for its holders. It includes this one investor who spent 0.035 ETH ($70.4) to buy 2.61T PEPE worth $58.7M today. An early buyer who spent only 0.035 $ETH ($70.4) to buy 2.61T $PEPE ($57.3M currently) deposited the remaining 189.4B $PEPE ($4.15M) to #Kraken 50 minutes ago. Even though he sold most of his $PEPE early on, he turned $70.4 into $7.06M—a return of over 100,000x.… pic.twitter.com/VfzBTY0LcO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2024 However, he sold a portion of these from time to time and managed to turn these $70.4 into $7.06M. The crypto investor’s most recent transaction was the deposition of 189.4B PEPE($4.15M) on Kraken on December 5, 2024. Regardless, this person has made a 100,000x return over this $70, surprising the crypto trading community. Similar Crypto Trading Experience In PEPE Token PEPE is the 23rd biggest cryptocurrency in the market thanks to its market capitalization of $9.42B. In the last 12 months alone, its price has increased 1424%, creating the ATH of $0.00002524 just 24 days ago. However, it has moved 11% away from that currently trading at $0.0000224 with a trading volume of $3.12B. It clearly indicates the high demand for the token. Interestingly, such a profitable investor’s experience is growing its demand further. A memecoin investor turned $26 into $61.5M is another prime example of successful crypto trading in PEPE tokens. Interestingly, in the last few days alone, Lookonchain has revealed two more crypto investors with high returns. One invested $241.5K and turned that into $7.53M after holding his token for a year. Another trader made $1.31M in profits after selling his 240B PEPE token. A whale bought 240B $PEPE ($3.64M) at a high price on May 29, and the price of $PEPE dropped afterward. But instead of panic selling, he held on for 6 months. Just 30 minutes ago, he sold his 240B $PEPE ($4.95M), making a profit of $1.31M! https://t.co/PBnbhDLhjf pic.twitter.com/MPyfSkYMWs — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 4, 2024 Interestingly, there are many similar cases in this and various other meme coins, as 2024 has witnessed heavy returns from this category. What’s In There For You? Meme coins have become the biggest attraction for the crypto trading industry in 2024. However, some memecoins scams are also equally repelling the new crypto investors, including this Hawk Tuah Girl memecoin controversy , where the Hawk coin pumped and crashed within a few hours, concerning the community over the possibility of a rug pull scam. That is why, investing in any cryptocurrencies, including PEPE tokens, requires intense research and strategies to stay profitable, like this crypto investor who turned $70 into $7M over two years.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 00:33:35

According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s short-term price action may now enter a phase of consolidation and “choppy” movements. “The 14-day Choppiness Index is in an early zone showing corrective moves during consolidation,” wrote CryptoQuant contributor Percival in a blog post on Dec. 6. The Choppiness Index (CI) measures market conditions on a scale of 0-100. Higher values indicate more erratic or “choppy” price action, while lower values suggest trending movements. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s daily CI was at 56.7, its highest level since mid-August, suggesting ongoing consolidation after the recent price swings. “One thing to take into account is the time factor of consolidation. In the 2020/2021 cycles, there were 20 days of downtime, and in the consolidation since March, the average decline was ~20 days,” Percival explained. “The greater the consolidation, the greater the rise.” While this period of cooling off may frustrate Bitcoin bulls, analysts predict that longer consolidation could lead to a stronger breakout. Potential BTC Targets: $110,000 and Beyond Looking ahead, CryptoQuant highlights potential price targets for Bitcoin once the consolidation ends. Percival suggests that key resistance levels will emerge at $110,000 and $120,000, based on market psychology and the realized price of short-term holders (STHs). “The first level will be $110K (+1.5 standard deviations), a considerable profit zone for STH,” he noted. “As traders connect to psychological numbers, $120K has a very impactful psychological and emotional charge, and being a value within +2 standard deviations makes this floor a deeper consolidation camp.” Bitcoin’s next major move remains to be seen, but patient bulls could be rewarded with significant price gains.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 00:57:50

Binance rolled out trading services for the interoperability protocol Across ( ACX ) and the Solana ( SOL )-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Orca ( ORCA ). The native tokens of both platforms witnessed massive gains on Friday, with ACX surging by nearly 88% and ORCA jumping by almost 80%. Those represented the largest gains of any top 1,000 tokens by market cap that day, according to CoinGecko . Across aims to be a “new paradigm in cross-chain experiences” and is powered by cross-chain intents, which are types of orders where users specify outcomes instead of execution paths. Meanwhile, Orca aims to offer “the most user-friendly environment for traders and LPs (liquidity providers) of varying experience levels.” Binance will attach seed tags to both assets, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. The platform requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens. ACX, the 244th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $1.07 at time of writing. OCRA, the 282nd-ranked asset, is trading at $6.98.

This breakout in PEPE follows a prolonged consolidation phase lasting more than three weeks. PEPE Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, PEPE has broken out of a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern, closing a strong daily candle above the pole of the pattern. However, this breakout has shifted the overall sentiment among traders and investors. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that PEPE could soar by 45% to reach the $0.000036 level in the coming days. However, this price prediction is entirely based on the pattern breakout. Additionally, this breakout has propelled PEPE to a new all-time high, and it is expected to continue its upward rally, potentially setting another record. On the positive side, PEPE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61, which is below the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that PEPE has sufficient room to rise significantly in the coming days. Bullish On-Chain Metrics Following this breakout, traders’ and whales’ interest and confidence in the meme coin have skyrocketed, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Massive PEPE Outflow PEPE’s spot inflow/outflow data reveals that exchanges have experienced a significant outflow of $9.10 million since the breakout. In the cryptocurrency context, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses for long-term holding. Outflows from exchanges often indicate potential buying opportunities, reduce the likelihood of a price decline, and suggest the possibility of an upside rally. Rising Open Interest In addition to the interest from whales and institutions, traders’ participation has surged since the meme coin broke out of its bullish pattern. According to the data, PEPE’s open interest (OI) has increased by 40%, indicating heightened trader activity and the formation of new positions. Current Price Momentum At press time, PEPE is trading near $0.000025 and has experienced a price surge of over 16% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 110%, reflecting heightened participation from traders and investors driven by the recent breakout.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-08 01:45:39

Among these rapid developments on the largest digital asset, blockchain analytics company Santiment has observed a massive decline in mining balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH Above $104,000, Yet Investors Don’t Want To Sell Bitcoin Miners Offload 85,503 BTC In 48 Hours On Friday, Santiment shared a report on Bitcoin mining wallets activity in correlation to the asset’s price. According to the analytics firm, there has been a consistent decrease in the Bitcoin collective mining balances since April 2024 indicating that miners have been gradually selling their BTC or moving funds to another wallet. However, Santiment states these mining wallets have now transferred out 85,503 BTC, valued at $8.56 billion, over the last 48 hours, which represents the largest drop in miner balances since late February prior to Bitcoin’s surge to $73,000. Generally, increased outflows from miners could indicate a bearish shift in price momentum. However, the team at Santiment postulates the recent BTC offload should be considered a net-neutral signal with no inking on Bitcoin’s price movement. This notion is based on Bitcoin miner balances showing a weak correlation with price for the majority of 2024. Moreover, non-mining whales and sharks continue to accumulate Bitcoin signaling confidence among investors in the asset’s profitability despite miner activity. Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently provided some update on this accumulation trend stating that BTC whales have acquired 20,000 BTC, valued at $2 billion, over the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the constant decline in miner balances remains an important concern for Bitcoin investors. Aside from an ability to induce a bearish sentiment, miners transferring out BTC may draw speculations over mining profitability, which is critical to sustaining the Bitcoin network. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Trades Above $100K—Analysts Reveal What Could Be Next Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $100,119 following a 3.67% price increase in the past 24 hours. On larger time frames, Bitcoin is equally in profit as evidenced by gains of 2.92% and 32.60% in the last seven days and 30 days, respectively. The largest digital asset is preparing to face minor resistance at $102,000 following an earlier rejection. If the market bulls are able to produce a breakout, Bitcoin maintains a prolonged price rally that began in early October. Based on previous bull cycles, the premier cryptocurrency is touted to gain by an average of 38.86% in December, with the potential to trade as high as $140,000 before 2024 runs out.

With traditional investments becoming old news for Millennials and Gen Z, savvy investors are turning to top-tier crypto projects to secure their financial futures. If you’ve been on the hunt for the best coins to invest in now, you’re in the right place. The market is packed with innovative projects pushing the boundaries of blockchain tech. Among them, Qubetics is making waves with its presale success, Polkadot is cementing its status as a staple in the crypto ecosystem, and SEI is driving decentralised finance (DeFi) innovation like a pro. So, which one should you bet your chips on? Let’s break it down. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Aggregation If you haven’t heard about Qubetics yet, it’s time to get with the programme. Dubbed the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is rewriting the rulebook with its multi-functional ecosystem designed to make Web3 tools accessible to everyone. And let’s be honest—nobody likes juggling ten different platforms just to keep up with the blockchain. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for developers. Imagine this: You’re a coder creating smart contracts, and instead of wasting hours figuring out which chain to deploy them on, QubeQode IDE lets you do it all in one place. It’s the ultimate shortcut. For example, a small business could deploy a tokenised rewards programme on Ethereum and Polygon without breaking a sweat. For more on how QubeQode IDE works, watch this video . The project doesn’t stop there. Qubetics is also diving into Real World Asset Tokenization, which is fancy talk for turning tangible assets like real estate or art into blockchain tokens. This isn’t just geeky tech—it’s the future of making investing in high-value assets easier for everyday people. Think of being able to own a piece of a skyscraper in Manhattan or a Picasso painting without needing millions in the bank. But wait, there’s more. Qubetics offers a Decentralized VPN, ideal for privacy-conscious individuals or businesses tired of snooping eyes. Picture freelancers securely connecting with international clients or gamers avoiding bandwidth throttling during heated online matches. And let’s not sleep on its Multi-Chain Wallet, which makes managing assets across multiple blockchains feel as easy as Venmoing your roommate for pizza. With its presale already raising over $4.8 million, selling more than 280 million tokens to 7,200 holders, and analysts predicting major surges in $TICS value, Qubetics is the crypto equivalent of a ticket to Coachella before the lineup drops. Currently priced at $0.0282 in its 11th stage, this is one opportunity you don’t want to miss before the price jumps again. For more insights, watch this video . Polkadot: The OG of Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot has been on the scene for a while, and let’s just say it’s not going anywhere. Known for its trailblazing tech in blockchain interoperability, Polkadot acts like a translator at the UN, connecting blockchains so they can finally speak the same language. This makes it a go-to for developers and investors who are tired of siloed networks. Polkadot’s unique parachain model allows multiple blockchains to operate simultaneously, offering scalability and speed. It’s like turning a single-lane highway into a multi-lane freeway—no more traffic jams. This tech is why Polkadot consistently ranks among the best coins to invest in now for both long-term hodlers and day traders. Investors love Polkadot for its staying power. Over the years, it’s not just survived crypto winters—it’s thrived. Think of it as the dependable, all-terrain vehicle of crypto. Whether you’re looking to dip your toes into DeFi or explore NFT markets, Polkadot has you covered. Its robust ecosystem supports hundreds of projects, from decentralised apps (dApps) to cross-chain DeFi protocols. For Millennials and Gen Z, Polkadot isn’t just about tech—it’s about vibes. It’s seen as the reliable yet innovative option, offering strong potential returns while keeping its risks in check. If you’re searching for a coin that’s already proven its worth but still has room to grow, Polkadot should definitely be on your radar. SEI: Redefining DeFi with High-Speed Innovation If Polkadot is the old guard, SEI is the scrappy newcomer making all the right moves. SEI Network is carving its niche in DeFi with a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for decentralised finance applications. Think of SEI as a luxury sports car in a world of sedans—it’s sleek, fast, and designed for performance. What sets SEI apart is its order-book model, which is built directly into the blockchain. This unique feature makes trading as seamless as swiping right on your dating app. The speed? Unmatched. SEI can process thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for high-frequency traders and liquidity providers. Since its launch, SEI has gained a cult following among DeFi enthusiasts, and it’s easy to see why. With traditional financial systems becoming less appealing to younger generations, SEI offers a decentralised alternative that’s as efficient as it is innovative. Projects built on SEI range from derivatives trading platforms to yield farming protocols, proving that it’s more than just hype. For crypto investors who believe DeFi is the future (and let’s be real, who doesn’t?), SEI is a no-brainer. Its focus on creating a seamless user experience and fostering developer-friendly tools makes it one of the best coins to invest in now. Conclusion: Make Your Move Before It’s Too Late So, there you have it: three crypto heavyweights making waves in 2024. Whether you’re intrigued by Qubetics’ all-in-one Web3 solutions, Polkadot’s battle-tested blockchain tech, or SEI’s DeFi innovations, the opportunities are endless. But here’s the kicker—crypto doesn’t wait for anyone. The best moves are made early, and the window to grab a piece of these projects at their current value won’t stay open forever. Ready to dive in? Start your crypto journey now with Qubetics , Polkadot, or SEI—before the rest of the world catches on.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 02:18:05

In addition, the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, another critical inflation metric considered by the US Federal Reserve to decide their rate cut plans, is also scheduled for this week. Notably, investors eagerly await this figure as Bitcoin as well as the altcoins sector is gearing up for further rally, potentially hitting new records ahead. Crypto Market Awaits US CPI Inflation Figures The crypto market has noted a strong rally recently, with investors anticipating the rally to continue ahead. Now, with the robust Labor market, as evidenced by last week’s Job data, traders are eagerly waiting for the upcoming US CPI inflation figures. For context, the US added 227K jobs in November, up from the market expectations of 220K. Besides, the US unemployment rate also rose to 4.2% in November, up from 4.1% in the prior month. Notably, the economic indicators tend to influence the broader financial market, let alone the digital assets space. Having said that, inflation and other key figures play a key role in shaping the market sentiment. Now, investors eagerly await the US Consumer Price Index data, which is scheduled for Wednesday, December 11. According to the market forecast, the inflation is expected to come in at 2.7%, as compared to 2.6% in the prior month. Simultaneously, the Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to cool down to 3.2% from 3.3% noted in October. A hotter-than-anticipated inflation figure usually results in a waning risk-bet appetite of the traders. On the other hand, the US PPI data, another key metric to gauge inflationary pressure, is scheduled for Thursday, December 12. The market participants would also keep close track of these figures for clarity on the current inflationary pressures in the nation. Notably, the market is expecting the US PPI figures to remain unchanged from last month. Will Bitcoin & Altcoins Continue To Rally? The crypto market, along with Bitcoin and the top altcoins has noted a robust rally recently, indicating strong market confidence. Notably, BTC has recently soared past the $100K mark, touching its ATH of $103,900 last week. Notably, the rally started as optimism soared toward pro-crypto regulations in the US after Donald Trump’s election win. Now, despite anticipation over hot US CPI inflation figures, the market anticipates the Bitcoin and altcoins rally to continue ahead. Although some analysts warned over short-term pullbacks during these bull phase, the digital assets are likely to set new records ahead. In addition, historical data suggests that Q4 tends to be positive for the financial markets, especially cryptocurrencies. It’s worth noting that so far, the crypto market also showed a similar performance this year as well. Considering that, the economic indicators are not likely to weigh much on the investors’ sentiment ahead. What’s Next For BTC & Other Crypto? In a recent analysis, top crypto market analyst Ali Martinez said that Bitcoin is poised to reach $112,926, citing technical trends. This has sparked optimism among investors, especially as BTC whales are on a buying spree in recent days. Source: Ali Martinez, X Martinez also said in another post that “Bitcoin whale accumulation is going parabolic.” He noted that recently the whales have purchased 20,000 BTC, worth around $2 billion. In addition, the soaring retail interest also hints toward a further rally ahead. Notably, Marathon Digital (MARA) has accelerated its BTC buying strategy, gaining investors’ attention. Source: Ali Martinez, X So far, the altcoins have also followed Bitcoin’s run towards the north. Talking about the altcoin season, CryptoQuant CEO and Founder Ki Young Ju showed confidence in the altcoin market, citing the crypto trading trend in South Korea. In a recent X post, he stated: “South Korea: The world’s second-largest crypto market, where 93% of trades are altcoins and only 4% are Bitcoin. Every season is alt season.” Source: Ki Young Ju, X The post US CPI In Focus As Bitcoin & Altcoins Gear Up For Further Rally appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Bitcoin News|Altcoin news|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|US CPI|US Inflation,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-08 02:30:45

From Dogecoin’s mainstream breakthrough to Shiba Inu’s viral success, these coins have become a cornerstone of the crypto world. Why? Because they offer more than just laughs—they deliver serious opportunities for high returns. Over the years, meme coins have evolved from simple internet jokes to full-blown financial movements with loyal communities, innovative ecosystems, and staggering ROI potential. One name that’s making waves right now is BTFD Coin (BTFD) . It’s not just a meme—it’s a mindset. BTFD coin speaks directly to crypto enthusiasts who thrive on market dips and love making bold plays. With its explosive presale already breaking records, BTFD is taking the meme coin frenzy to a whole new level. And for those who missed out on Goatseus Maximus, BTFD Coin is the ultimate redemption story waiting to be written. Meme coins like Goatseus Maximus proved that quirky branding and a strong community can create waves in the crypto space. But with BTFD’s innovative features and skyrocketing presale numbers, it’s clear that this coin isn’t just following the meme coin trend—it’s redefining it. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins BTFD Coin isn’t here to play—it’s here to dominate. Sure, the name might get a chuckle, but behind the meme lies a serious investment opportunity that’s got crypto enthusiasts buzzing. The presale has already raised over $1.35, with 29 billion coins sold and counting. Currently priced at $0.000064 in Stage 8, BTFD is set to list at $0.0006 when it hits the exchanges. That’s a massive opportunity for anyone looking to cash in early. What makes BTFD Coin stand out in a sea of meme coins? Let’s start with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game . Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD is building a fully interactive gaming experience where players can earn $BTFD tokens just by having fun. Imagine gaming not just for entertainment but for financial growth. That’s a game-changer, and it’s one of the reasons BTFD is being touted as the best ongoing meme coin presale to join now. Then there’s staking, which is perfect for those who want to earn while holding. With an impressive APY, BTFD Coin rewards its holders for staying loyal. Staking isn’t just about earning more—it’s about being part of the Bulls Squad, a thriving community that’s already 3,100 members strong and growing by the day. But let’s get real about the numbers because that’s where things get spicy. Imagine you’d invested $4,000 during Stage 5 of the presale when BTFD was priced at $0.00005. That would’ve snagged you 80 million tokens. Fast forward to its exchange listing at $0.0006, and your initial investment could skyrocket to $48,000. That’s the kind of upside that makes BTFD the ultimate play in today’s meme coin market. BTFD isn’t just another coin; it’s a movement that blends fun, finance, and community like never before. And with the presale heating up, now’s the time to grab your piece of the action. Goatseus Maximus: A Meme Coin with Legendary Status If you’ve been following meme coins, you’ve probably heard of Goatseus Maximus. With its bold branding and larger-than-life persona, this coin managed to carve out its place in the meme coin hall of fame. Goatseus Maximus tapped into the mythical vibe, building a loyal following of investors who believed in its epic potential. Goatseus Maximus wasn’t just a meme—it was a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts who love a good underdog story. Its community was tight-knit, its branding was unforgettable, and its early gains were jaw-dropping. For a while, it seemed like Goatseus Maximus was unstoppable. But as with many meme coins, the hype eventually cooled off. While Goatseus Maximus remains a fan favorite, its ecosystem didn’t evolve in the way investors hoped. With newer projects like BTFD Coin bringing more features, utility, and innovation to the table, Goatseus Maximus feels more like a nostalgic icon than a cutting-edge opportunity. That said, Goatseus Maximus is proof that meme coins aren’t just about the money—they’re about the culture, the community, and the thrill of being part of something bigger. If you missed the Goatseus Maximus train, don’t sweat it. There’s always another chance to strike gold, and BTFD Coin is offering exactly that. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Explosive Presale Meme coins have redefined what it means to invest in crypto. They’re fun, they’re bold, and when you play your cards right, they’re incredibly rewarding. Goatseus Maximus showed us the power of a strong community and creative branding, but BTFD Coin is taking things to the next level with its P2E game, staking rewards, and record-breaking presale numbers. With over $1.35 already raised and more than 29 billion coins sold, BTFD Coin is the best ongoing meme coin presale to join now. The presale price is rising fast, and the listing price of $0.0006 promises significant returns for early investors. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto trader or just dipping your toes into the market, BTFD Coin is the kind of opportunity you don’t want to miss. So what are you waiting for? Join the Bulls Squad today and claim your stake in the next big thing in crypto. Sign up with your email, grab your BTFD tokens, and get ready to ride this rocket to the moon.

Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 03:20:00

While Ethereum has remained the leading force in DeFi, its growth and adoption are creating ripples, attracting attention from some of the biggest players in the space. What’s driving this momentum? And how could it impact your next move in crypto investments? We’ll break down the growing interest in Ethereum’s ecosystem, its implications for DeFi enthusiasts, and explore how this evolution ties into groundbreaking tech like the Lightchain Protocol AI . The Role Ethereum Plays in DeFi Growth Ethereum has long been the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. Its ability to execute smart contracts, support dApps (decentralized applications), and foster innovation has consistently made it a top pick for investors. What truly sets Ethereum apart and attracts “whales”—wealthy individuals or large entities controlling significant volumes of crypto—is its multi-functionality. More than 70% of DeFi projects are built on Ethereum, ranging from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to lending platforms like Aave and Compound. The result? Ethereum’s ecosystem isn’t just growing; it’s revolutionizing traditional finance by offering borderless, programmable money. But Ethereum’s dominance is about more than convenience—it’s also about trust. Investors know that Ethereum is here to stay. With Ethereum whales increasing their holdings, a signal of confidence in the platform, the blockchain cements its relevance in a space that’s constantly evolving. Why Are Ethereum Whales Accumulating? 1. Stability Amid Volatility Crypto markets are known for their volatility, but Ethereum offers a relatively stable asset due to its widespread adoption. The Ethereum Merge, which transitioned the network to Proof of Stake (PoS), reduced energy consumption by over 99%. This aligned Ethereum with ESG (environmental, social, and governance) priorities, making it a safer bet for long-term holders. 2. The Rise of Layer-2 Solutions Whales also see potential in Ethereum’s Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. These upgrades drastically lower gas fees and transaction times, making Ethereum-based applications faster and more affordable. The boom in Layer-2 adoption has injected new life into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative. 3. The Development of Ethereum 2.0 The promised enhancements of Ethereum 2.0—like lower fees, increased speed, and even better network security—are another catalyst. Smart investors don’t want to wait on the sidelines while the platform transforms into an even more powerful decentralized network armed with scalability and sustainability. Ethereum vs. Competition What’s pushing Ethereum above its competitors in the DeFi race? While blockchains like Solana and BNB Chain offer high throughput and lower costs, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage and ecosystem depth remain unmatched. Furthermore, innovations like the development of Ethereum’s zk-Rollups (zero-knowledge proof technology) and compatibility with other blockchain ecosystems ensure it retains a competitive lead. Ethereum whales recognize that projects leveraging these technologies are laying the foundation for mainstream blockchain adoption. What This Means for Investors Ethereum’s growing momentum is a wake-up call for the crypto-curious and seasoned investors alike. For smaller investors, following whale movements offers unique insights into strategic investments. When whales invest in Ethereum, it creates a ripple effect, inspiring confidence across the market. This is not only about holding ETH—it’s also an invitation to dig into Ethereum-powered opportunities such as DeFi applications, staking, and exploring Web3 innovations. Each application represents a platform for investors to diversify and grow alongside Ethereum. Exciting Synergies with Technological Evolution The growth of Ethereum also aligns seamlessly with innovations like the Lightchain Protocol AI —a trailblazing platform revolutionizing the blockchain and AI landscape. Why Consider Lightchain AI? Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms, Lightchain rewards nodes for valuable AI computations. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): This groundbreaking computational layer directly integrates AI into blockchain infrastructures, elevating Ethereum’s use cases even further. Decentralized Governance: Lightchain merges blockchain functionality with community-driven governance, empowering investors with transparent, equitable decision-making. With ventures like Lightchain revolutionizing AI-powered decentralized applications, Ethereum ecosystems will continue to evolve, providing greater flexibility for developers and users alike. Worth noting, Lightchain Protocol AI tokens are currently in presale —meaning early adopters are uniquely positioned to benefit. What’s Next for Crypto Enthusiasts? The signals are clear—Ethereum whales are making intentional moves, and the shift in momentum highlights the incredible capabilities of this DeFi blockchain. Whether you’re a first-time investor or a seasoned pro navigating Web3, Ethereum offers endless opportunities to participate, profit, and innovate. But why stop at Ethereum? Platforms like Lightchain are bridging blockchain and artificial intelligence, creating synergies that will define the next phase of DeFi. The future belongs to projects that push boundaries, and this is your chance to get ahead of the curve. Don’t miss your next big investment opportunity.

With the bulls maintaining their grip on this critical support level, speculation is rising about whether this could be the calm before a bullish storm. As market sentiment remains optimistic, this analysis examines UNI’s current price action by evaluating technical indicators to determine if it can gather enough momentum for a breakout rally. Could this period of stabilization set the stage for further upside? Let’s explore the technical setup and market dynamics that are shaping this crucial moment for Uniswap. Analyzing Uniswap Consolidation Phase And Market Signals UNI’s price on the 4-hour chart shows signs of upside momentum as it eyes a potential breakout toward the critical $20 resistance level. Holding above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) strengthens the bullish case, indicating growing confidence among buyers. This positioning highlights UNI’s capacity to push higher and sustain its upward trajectory, provided key resistance levels are cleared. Additionally, an examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable climb, with the indicator reaching the 72% threshold after rebounding from a recent low of 69%. This sharp increase reflects a robust surge in bullish momentum, as intensified buying pressure has propelled the RSI into overbought territory. Such a shift indicates a significant change in market sentiment, signaling heightened confidence among traders and investors. Related Reading: Uniswap Processes Over $2 Trillion On Ethereum: UNI Bull Run Inevitable? The move into overbought levels suggests that demand for Uniswap has surged, often indicative of potential near-term price growth. However, the elevated RSI also calls for caution, as it may hint at a correction period or a minor pullback before the uptrend resumes. UNI’s Path Forward: Momentum Builds Above $17 Uniswap’s price has firmly stabilized above the $17 level, demonstrating a shift in market dynamics as upbeat momentum starts to gain traction. This crucial support zone provides a solid base for further upward movement, with technical indicators pointing to growing buying pressure. If the bulls can sustain this uptrend, a breakout toward higher resistance levels, such as $20, may be imminent. Related Reading: Uniswap: Market Swing Yields 12% Gains – Can UNI Sustain The Momentum? However, traders should closely monitor market conditions, as a failure to sustain the current bullish momentum could lead to a correction or pullback, causing the price to drop toward the $17 support level. If Uniswap fails to hold above this key level, a break below $17 could signal a deeper decline, with the next possible support zones being the 100-day SMA and the $11.8 level. Such a scenario would indicate weakening market sentiment and an extended drop could set the stage for additional bearish pressure.

XRP is currently holding above the 2021 high, which was around $1.96. The price recently broke above this key level and has not dropped back below it yet. Current Wave Structure: In terms of market structure , XRP is likely in the fourth wave of a larger third wave within an ongoing bullish cycle. The recent pullback has followed a three-wave pattern, and this is seen as a correction that should lead into a fifth wave that could push the price into the $5 to $10 range. While it’s possible the price could move slightly higher, this remains the most reasonable expectation for now, but it may change as more data becomes available. Support and Resistance Levels: Looking at support, the critical range lies between $1.50 and $1.79. As long as the price stays above this support area, the bullish scenario remains valid. In terms of resistance, the next levels to watch are $2.60, $2.73, and $2.81. These levels could act as potential points where the price may face selling pressure if the upward trend continues. Price Action and Expectations: At the moment, XRP is likely experiencing a correction within the larger uptrend, which is part of the fourth wave. This wave is expected to complete before the price moves higher. If the price breaks below the $2.38 and $2.17 levels, this would suggest that a downside move is incoming. However, there is strong support around the 2021 high, which should help stabilize the price. Even though the market is currently in a temporary correction, there’s no sign of a crash.

According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, Bitcoin is forming a new pattern in the short term that we should keep an eye on. Here’s a breakdown of his analysis: Bitcoin’s Bullish Market Overview The analyst said that Bitcoin is clearly still in a bull market. The weekly RSI is signaling a strong bullish trend, which has led to major bull runs in the past. The MACD is also showing bullish signs, similar to last year when it predicted a major rally that lasted for months. Based on these indicators, it’s likely that the bull market could continue into 2025. Resistance and Price Targets for Bitcoin Currently, Bitcoin is facing resistance level at around $102,000, which is the 1618 Fibonacci extension level. If Bitcoin can break above this, we could see a move towards $113,000. The next key price target is $113,000, but it’s still a while before Bitcoin might reach $300,000, which could take a few more years and possibly the next bull market. For support, Bitcoin is holding at around $89,000. Short-term, the price is consolidating around $100,000, and we might see sideways movement for a while as the market cools off. Bitcoin is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, with support around $99,000 and resistance around $102,000. A breakout above $102,000 could push the price towards $108,000, while a break below support could lead to a move down to around $93,000. Bitcoin Liquidity Heat Map The Bitcoin liquidation heat map shows significant liquidity building around $104,000 to $105,000. If Bitcoin breaks above this level, we could see a short squeeze, pushing the price higher. There are also other liquidity levels between $102,000 and $105,000, which could play a role in future price action. Bitcoin Dominance Drops, Altcoin Season Begins The Bitcoin dominance chart is showing a decline, currently at around 55%, after breaking a key support level at 57%.

This was somewhat expected, given Trump’s pro-bitcoin stance during his campaign as he appeared at the annual BTC conference in the States and even paid for a burger with the asset. Although several altcoins registered impressive gains within the same timeframe, bitcoin’s dominance shot up to nearly 60% on CoinGecko and well above that number on other resources like CoinMarketCap and TradingView. Now, though, the landscape seems to be changing even though BTC flew past $100,000 earlier this week and painted a fresh all-time high of over $103,500. The first major signs of altcoin season became clear this week, with altcoins reclaiming a significant share of the overall market dominance pic.twitter.com/S5PeAcnbq6 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 6, 2024 The community has long speculated about the start of a new altcoin season – a time period in which alternative coins are registering massive gains, especially compared to BTC. These periods, usually lasting a few months, come after a noteworthy surge from bitcoin itself. The declining BTC market dominance in the past week is among the strongest indicators that alts’ time has arrived. Perhaps this is most evident in ETH’s performance. The largest altcoin was somewhat sluggish after the elections and increased in a modest fashion from around $2,600 to $3,000, where it stood for a while. However, it began to increase in value more substantially in the past ten days or so and jumped above $4,000 for the first time since March on Friday evening. Consequently, it caught up to other massive gainers during this cycle, such as XRP, DOGE, XLM, HBAR, and many more. In fact, CoinGecko’s data shows that BTC is near the bottom in terms of the biggest gainers in the past month from the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Its ‘modest’ increase of 32% is far away from the leaders like HBAR (612%), XLM (403%), XRP (350%), ALGO (309%), IOTA (307%), SAND (250%), etc. Many industry experts have speculated about the environment around this cycle’s altcoin season. Earlier this month, CryptoQuant’s CEO said the altseason will be a lot different than previous ones, as only a handful of assets will exceed the expectations.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 04:45:00

In the few hours after crossing above this psychological threshold, the Bitcoin price faced rejection and corrected until it reached $94,000. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself However, this correction does not necessarily signal a bleak outlook for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, especially as investor sentiment continues to hover in the extreme greed zone. According to technical analysis, the Bitcoin price is still open to climbing well above $100,000 by the end of December 2024. Record Bitcoin Liquidations Shake The Market Bitcoin’s broader market dynamics and investor sentiment suggest that Bitcoin’s failure at $100,000 could be a temporary pause rather than a long-term reversal. Interestingly, a detailed analysis posted on the TradingView platform supports this outlook and offers a bold prediction for the year’s end. The analysis highlighted December 5, 2024, as a historic day for cryptocurrency liquidations. Total liquidations reached a staggering $1.1 billion, surpassing the previous record of $950 million set on August 5, 2024. The breakdown included $820 million in liquidated long positions and $280 million in liquidated short positions. Although price data from Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko shows a bottom around $93,600, the Bitcoin price dipped to $89,000–$90,000 depending on the exchange. According to the analysis, such a dramatic move is described as a “helicopter” on the BTCUSDT chart, and it reflects a cooling-off period due to overheating from all technical indicators. Despite the correction and crazy liquidations, the analyst maintained that Bitcoin’s uptrend remains intact. This is because the Fear and Greed Index, a popular sentiment indicator, remained in the “greed” zone at 71 despite Bitcoin’s sharp drop. At the time of writing, the Fear and Greed Index has increased to the “extreme greed” zone at 82, suggesting that market participants are still optimistic about Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Bold Year-End Price Prediction Interestingly, the altcoin market barely reacted to the Bitcoin price reaction, which also creates the possibility of another wave downwards before a broader market recovery. The analyst outlined a scenario for the Bitcoin price probably going on another decline and break below $90,000. The forecast suggests Bitcoin could drop further to the $84,000–$85,000 range before rallying to $110,000. Adding to the bullish narrative is the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is scheduled to take place on December 18. Market expectations point to a 0.25% rate cut by the Federal Reserve, a move that could inject further momentum into Bitcoin’s price recovery much like the September and November rate cuts.

Particularly, addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have increased their collective holdings by 20,000 BTC in the past 24 hours, valued at $2 billion.

Here’s when,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-clo-predicts-ripple-will-become-most-trusted-source-for-enterprise-support-heres-when/,"Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer at Ripple, recently expressed optimism about the future of the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, provided regulatory clarity is achieved. In a video shared by crypto enthusiast JackTheRippler on X, Alderoty emphasized Ripple’s readiness to become the leading provider of enterprise crypto solutions in the United States once the regulatory “cloud” over the industry dissipates. “When this regulatory cloud is lifted, and we get some policy clarity in the U.S., we will then be the most trusted source for enterprise support for crypto solutions in the U.S.,” Alderoty stated. His comments underscore the significance of a clear and consistent regulatory framework for fostering innovation and ensuring trust in the cryptocurrency sector. The Challenge of Regulatory Ambiguity The lack of regulatory clarity has long been a point of contention within the U.S. cryptocurrency industry. For years, industry participants have criticized the absence of well-defined policies, arguing that the current approach stifles innovation and deters investment. This sentiment was echoed by an X user, Marcus, in response to Alderoty’s remarks. “Stuart Alderoty is 100% right. The Crypto Industry has been operating under an unregulated cloud since its inception,” Marcus commented . He highlighted the complexity of categorizing digital assets like NFTs, which function differently from traditional financial instruments. Marcus argued that inconsistent classifications and potential loopholes in regulatory frameworks complicate enforcement, further underscoring the need for comprehensive legislation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Legal Battle: A Turning Point? Ripple has been at the forefront of the regulatory debate, primarily due to its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s lawsuit, initiated in December 2020, accuses Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through its sale of XRP. Ripple has maintained that XRP is not a security and has called for clearer guidelines to govern the classification and regulation of digital assets. Alderoty’s recent comments align with Ripple’s broader narrative of advocating for regulatory clarity. The company’s legal team has repeatedly argued that ambiguity in U.S. regulations hampers Ripple and the wider industry, leaving businesses and investors uncertain about compliance requirements. The Potential for U.S. Leadership Alderoty’s confidence in Ripple’s ability to lead the U.S. market for enterprise crypto solutions stems from the company’s global track record. Ripple has established itself as a pioneer in blockchain-based payment solutions, focusing on fostering efficiency and transparency in cross-border transactions . Regulatory clarity in the U.S. would enable Ripple and similar companies to expand their operations domestically, unlocking new opportunities for growth and innovation. The implications extend beyond Ripple. Clear policies could position the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, attracting talent and capital while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity.

Over the past 13 days, the whale deposited its remaining 284.71 billion PEPE tokens into the Kraken exchange, drawing considerable attention from the crypto community. This activity coincides with a heightened interest in PEPE, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency based on the iconic “Pepe the Frog” meme. JUST IN: A $PEPE whale who turned $74 into $6.16M has made its final move. After 2 years of inactivity, the whale deposited its remaining 284.71B $PEPE into Kraken over the past 13 days. pic.twitter.com/RwSwoFgWgZ — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) December 5, 2024 A recent Coinbase announcement , the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, says the token is now available for trading. The exchange marked this milestone with a succinct tweet: “Wen? Now. PEPE is available for trading.” The listing on Coinbase represents a pivotal moment for PEPE, which has experienced rapid adoption since its creation earlier this year. Alongside Coinbase, Robinhood, a platform known for its accessibility to retail investors, has also added PEPE to its trading offerings. These dual listings have significantly increased the token’s accessibility and visibility, attracting a mix of retail traders and institutional investors to the market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Impact of Whale Activity on the Market The whale’s movement of PEPE tokens to Kraken raises questions about potential selling pressure on the market. Historically, substantial deposits by large holders often precede periods of increased volatility, as the tokens may be sold, introducing liquidity and potentially affecting the asset’s price. However, the broader context of PEPE’s recent listings on major platforms could offset such pressure by driving demand. The timing of the whale’s deposits suggests strategic intent, aligning with the recent surge in interest and trading volumes for PEPE. These movements have added to speculation about the token’s future price trajectory and market stability, given its history of dramatic price fluctuations. Meme Coins Gain Momentum The rise of PEPE reflects the growing popularity of meme coins, a category of cryptocurrencies often driven by community engagement and internet culture rather than traditional utility. Despite their speculative nature, meme coins like PEPE have captured a significant share of market attention, especially with the backing of mainstream exchanges such as Coinbase and Robinhood . Both platforms have contributed to a notable increase in PEPE’s trading volumes, with the token gaining a broader user base and enhanced liquidity. The listings also underscore a shift in the perception of meme coins, as they become more integrated into the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Notably, the flagship crypto saw events unfold in favor of its future movements, whereas XRP and Shiba Inu mirrored immense optimism in light of community advancements. The meme coin saw notable burn sagas over the past week, whereas the ripple effect of Trump’s reelection ignited optimism over the Ripple Labs-backed asset. Here’s a brief collection of some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Bitcoin Eyes Further Gains Amid Bullish Q4 Crypto Market Notably, a stockpile of events unfolded in Bitcoin’s favor this week, sparking market optimism. BTC miner MARA revealed plans to raise $700 million in an effort to amplify its ongoing Bitcoin buying endeavor. Simultaneously, healthcare-focused firm Semler Scientific announced that it bought $29 million worth of the crypto, bringing heightened buying pressure to the digital asset. Additionally, MicroStrategy announced that it acquired 15,400 BTC For $1.5 billion this week, solidifying investor optimism over the coin. Also, Bitcoin miner Hut 8 unveiled plans to raise $500 million in an effort to buy the flagship coin. These chronicles, altogether, underscored heightened market interest in the asset and heavy buying, paving a bullish road for future movements. However, it’s also noteworthy that beleaguered crypto firm Mt Gox shifted heavy amounts of the same coin, raising concerns as its creditor reimbursement plans have not yet been concluded. Besides, the U.S. Government also moved $1.9 billion worth of the digital asset to a new address, adding a layer of intrigue among market participants. Meanwhile, Donald Trump appointed Paul Atkins as the next US SEC Chair, further bolstering market optimism over the future of the cryptocurrency landscape. Ripple’s Crypto Gains Traction Simultaneously, XRP emerged as the talk of the crypto town this week, overtaking Solana and USDT in terms of market cap. Intriguingly, amid this rising action, Ripple whales shifted $177 million worth of the crypto, sparking optimism amid renewed market interest as legal maneuvers aided the American blockchain firm. Trump’s White House AI & Crypto Czar pick , David Sacks, has birthed optimistic sentiments surrounding the XRP lawsuit, hinting that an end looms. Further, this is supported by the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair. In turn, market participants eagerly await as the new picks under Trump’s presidency could further urge a pro-cryptocurrency wave. Also, it’s noteworthy that XRP Ledger (XRPL) validators and developers are making a move to update the mainnet with transaction optimization in view. Overall, these developments have aided the native coin in witnessing significant gains recently. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attributed XRP’s rally to SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation and a major legal win, further cementing market optimism. Shiba Inu Coin Mirrors Bullishness Meanwhile, the renowned dog-themed meme crypto Shiba Inu also echoed a market buzz this week, witnessing bullish developments. Notably, the SHIB burn mechanism incinerated nearly 3 billion coins over the past seven days. In the interim, CoinGape reported the 1 CENT DREAM project contributed to the massive burn, incinerating 250 million tokens. Simultaneously, in light of the supply decline due to burns, SHIB price surged 15% weekly and reached the $0.00003 level. Also, it’s noteworthy that the coin’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, recently spotlighted the SHIFU coin launch , adding a layer of intrigue to ecosystem advancements. In conclusion, mentioned above are some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week, which appear to have considerably impacted investor sentiment.

Let’s find out what is behind this reversal in fortunes and investigate whether the Ethereum-based GambleFi protocol Rollblock ($RBLK) represents a better buy at these levels, as experts predict incredible 50x moves ahead… Ethereum ($ETH) Sees A Bullish Reversal As ETF Flows Ramp Up Ethereum finally turned the corner after months of disappointing chop, adding over 8.6% this week to reach $3.88k. This rounds off an incredible monthly candle for Ethereum, which currently stands at a 60% gain for this largest smart contract chain. The Ethereum market cap has now grown to $468.8 billion, consolidating its place behind Bitcoin as the biggest altcoin. It is also currently the only cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin to have its own dedicated spot ETF on Wall Street. While inflows into these funds were disappointing throughout the summer, recently they have begun to increase rapidly, with recent inflows adding $428 million and counting. This is an incredibly bullish sign and reflects the vast appetite for Ethereum among institutional buyers. Ethereum has been pumping recently, although its current elevated price is still 19% below its all time high. The next move for Ethereum will need to target the elusive $4k level to break out from here. Recently, Ethereum whale wallets with at least 1,000 ETH rose sharply from 5.52k to 5.59k, suggesting that large whales have been accumulating quietly for some time. Rollblock ($RBLK) Presale Blazing A Trail For Gaming Transparency Rollblock ( $RBLK ) is one of the leading presale projects on the Ethereum chain and has been attracting tens of thousands of investors recently with the strength of its potential to disrupt the enormous online gambling industry. This sector is valued at over $450 billion and growing by the year, which means that Rollblock has an enormous addressable market to tap into with its blockchain-backed betting. With a fully functioning casino platform already live and generating masses of revenue, the Rollblock offer is an enticing one. Rollblock has a varied offering of over 7,000 casino classics, from poker to roulette and many exclusive new games to explore. Recently, its sports betting feature went live to great acclaim, allowing sports pundits to place bets on a massive range of international tournaments. $RBLK is set for stratospheric growth this year as the Rollblock revenue-sharing scheme will ensure a deflationary token supply going forward. Each week, the platform will take a significant portion of its operating profits and use them to buy up $RBLK tokens in huge numbers. 60% of these buys will be immediately destroyed to reduce the supply, with the remaining tokens forming a pool of staking rewards. Stage 9 coins are already selling rapidly at the presale discount of $0.041 and look set for further price hikes in the weeks ahead.

37363802,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107765,1733636052,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Market Cap Unlikely to Hit $10 Trillion This Cycle, Says Analyst",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-market-cap-10t-unlikely/,"Prominent crypto analyst Chris Burniske , former head of crypto at ARK Invest and managing partner at Placeholder , believes that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is unlikely to reach $10 trillion during the current market cycle. Burniske’s analysis comes as the total crypto market cap stands at approximately $3.48 trillion , according to TradingView data . Chris Burniske’s Perspective on Market Realities 1. Caution Amid Frenzy Burniske emphasized the importance of maintaining a realistic outlook as the market enters a period of increasing enthusiasm: “As we enter a period of increasing frenzy, it’s important to be realistic.” 2. Lessons from 2021 Predictions Burniske reminded investors of overly ambitious price targets set during the last bull cycle: BTC: Calls for $100,000 in 2021, only achieved recently. ETH: Calls for $10,000, which remain unmet. These examples underscore the potential for inflated expectations during bullish phases. Key Market Insights 1. Current Market Cap The total cryptocurrency market cap is around $3.48 trillion . While substantial, this is far below the $10 trillion target . 2. Historical Trends Past market cycles have shown significant growth, but reaching $10 trillion would require exponential gains in a short timeframe. Burniske’s Advice to Investors 1. Balance Between Holding and Profit-Taking Burniske urged investors to adopt a balanced approach: “Sure, hodl some coin forever, but also take profits in frenzies and live your life.” 2. Value of Time Over Wealth Burniske highlighted the importance of prioritizing personal well-being and time over relentless accumulation: “Time is more precious than even $BTC.” Factors Limiting a $10 Trillion Market Cap 1. Market Saturation With a growing number of crypto projects, capital is more distributed, reducing the likelihood of dramatic growth across the board. 2. Regulatory Challenges Global scrutiny and regulatory barriers can hinder rapid market expansion. 3. Macroeconomic Conditions Economic uncertainties and interest rate policies could dampen investment enthusiasm in risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Opportunities Despite Limitations 1. Continued Growth Potential Despite the unlikely $10 trillion target, the crypto market has demonstrated robust growth and innovation, particularly in areas like DeFi , NFTs , and Web3 . 2. Room for Realistic Gains Even incremental growth in the market cap represents significant opportunities for investors. Conclusion While the $10 trillion market cap may be out of reach this cycle, Chris Burniske’s insights remind investors to stay grounded and avoid over-optimistic expectations. The crypto market’s current value of $3.48 trillion reflects its significant progress and potential for steady growth. As the industry continues to mature, balancing long-term holds with strategic profit-taking remains a prudent approach.

Pepe price was up by over 20%, while other popular ones like Floki, Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Popcat rose by double digits. So, will these coins continue doing well in the coming weeks? Pepe price forecast Pepe, the third-biggest meme coin in the industry, had a great performance this weekend as it made a strong bullish breakout. It jumped to a high of $0.00002685, a record high. Moving to that level was important because it crossed the important resistance level at $0.00002567, its highest level on November 14. It invalidated the double-top pattern that was forming, and whose neckline was at $0.00001730. That price was a few points above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Pepe has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Also, oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have all pointed upwards. It also formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish sign. Therefore, the coin’s path of least resistance is bullish, with the next point to watch being $0.000035. The stop-loss of this trade will be at the 23.6% retracement level at $0.0000210. PEPE chart by TradingView Floki price analysis The daily chart shows that the FLOKI token has done well in the past few weeks. After bottoming at $0.00009857 in August, the coin has rallied to $0.00026, its highest level since November 23. Floki has bounced back above the key support at $0.00021, its highest swing on July 22 and the neckline of a double-top pattern at $0.0002880. It has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) crossed each other. A golden cross is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. Also, the MACD and the RSI have all pointed upwards. The coin is also a few points below the 23.6% retracement point. Therefore, in this case, more gains will be confirmed if the coin rallies above the key resistance level at $0.00028, the upper side of the double-top. Such a move will lead to more gains to $0.0003478. Dogwifhat price analysis WIF, the biggest meme coin in Solana ecosystem, has done well this year as it jumped by over 4,200% from its lowest point in January. This growth has pushed its market cap to over $3.8 billion. Dogwifhat price jumped to a high of $4 on Saturday as the meme coin season gained steam. It has moved above the key support levels at $2.87 (upper side of the cup and handle). WIF price has moved above the Ichimoku cloud indicator, while all oscillators have pointed upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the next point at $4.73, its highest level in November.

37366076,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51642,1733637135,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP to $8 and $11? Top Analyst Reveals Key Dates and Projections,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-8-and-11-top-analyst-reveals-key-dates-and-projections/,"An influential market analyst has outlined projections for XRP’s price trajectory, identifying potential milestones at $8.1 and $11 within the current market cycle. The forecast leverages historical patterns associated with Bitcoin halving events to provide a timeline for these targets. Recent XRP Performance and Market Correction XRP recently achieved a significant milestone, surging to $2.9 on December 3—its highest level in seven years. This milestone followed an extended bullish run but was short-lived as the asset faced a sharp retracement. Over the past three days, XRP has dropped by over 18%, partially driven by Bitcoin’s correction from its record-breaking $100,000 price level. Despite this downturn, Master Kenobi, a prominent analyst, emphasized that XRP’s upward journey remains intact. By examining historical trends in XRP’s performance relative to Bitcoin halving events, Kenobi has predicted that the asset could reach $11 during this cycle. Initial Rally and Current Pullback Kenobi observed that during previous cycles, XRP experienced significant rallies approximately 224 days after Bitcoin’s halving. In the current cycle, however, the rally began earlier, around 204 days post-halving, and culminated in XRP’s rise to $2.9. The analyst noted that historical price trends often involve a correction following an initial parabolic movement. For this cycle, the pullback began on December 3 and has since pushed XRP into the lower $2 range. Kenobi projects that this phase could drive the asset’s price down to $1.39, which he identified as a critical support zone. According to him, this level could serve as a launchpad for a subsequent rally, allowing market participants to prepare for the next upward momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The projection for a Second Rally to $8.1 Kenobi anticipates that once XRP stabilizes at lower levels, it will enter a fresh rally. Based on his analysis, the asset could surpass $8.1 by late February 2025, drawing parallels with the 2017 bull market rather than the most recent cycle. He attributed this to XRP’s tendency to mirror older patterns under specific conditions. The six-year white trendline, identified as a crucial resistance point, is expected to play a pivotal role in this rally. According to Kenobi, XRP’s interaction with this trendline could trigger price movements that align with historical trends, propelling the asset to new highs. If XRP achieves this $8.1 milestone , its market capitalization will rise to $461.7 billion, setting a new record. Kenobi highlighted that this valuation aligns with historical precedents, noting, “Ethereum reached a $548 billion market cap during its previous peak,” suggesting that similar levels for XRP are achievable. Potential for a Final Surge to $11 Following the anticipated peak at $8.1, Kenobi predicts an extended consolidation phase that could last several months. This period, he explained, is crucial for stabilizing the market and preparing for the next price movement. Approximately 200 days after this consolidation phase begins, XRP could experience its final rally in this cycle, potentially reaching $11 by mid-October 2025. If this projection materializes, XRP’s market capitalization will approach $627 billion, marking a significant achievement. However, Kenobi cautioned that broader market conditions would heavily influence this outcome. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.40, reflecting a 6.14% increase from its recent lows as the market shows signs of recovery following the recent correction.

Daily trading volumes in the space have also risen steadily, averaging $46 billion, driven by heightened community engagement and broader market momentum. Market Leaders Gain Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to lead the meme token category with a market capitalization of $66.39 billion. The token has recorded a 10% gain in the last 24 hours and a weekly increase of 11.7%, supported by a $15.06 billion trading volume. DOGE’s first-mover advantage and integration into payment systems have helped maintain its dominance. Shiba Inu (SHIB), valued at $18.87 billion, posted a 7.7% daily increase and 25.7% growth over the past week. SHIB’s expansion into decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, alongside its Shibarium layer-2 scaling network, has bolstered investor sentiment. Pepe (PEPE), another community-driven meme coin, saw its market cap rise to $9.33 billion with a 7.9% daily and 12.7% weekly gain. Its success is attributed to a combination of speculative trading and robust community support. DOGEN Enters the Scene With Explosive Growth DOGEN , a Solana-based meme token, is gaining traction in its presale phase, boasting a 300% increase in price from $0.0003 at Stage 1 to $0.0011 currently.

The project has successfully undergone rigorous audits by leading blockchain security firms, SpyWolf and SmartState , reinforcing its credibility and commitment to security. Positioned for Long-Term Success DOGEN’s rise signals a shift in the meme token landscape, as it combines speculative appeal with a forward-looking strategy. Its emphasis on transparency, community rewards, and product development distinguishes it from competitors that often rely solely on viral popularity. As the presale progresses, DOGEN’s mix of strategic planning and robust community engagement positions it as a standout project within the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. For investors eyeing the next big opportunity on the Solana blockchain, DOGEN offers both immediate potential and a long-term growth story.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 06:13:00

As the world’s leading cryptocurrency continues to test this level, altcoins are surging to record highs. BTC remains the undisputed leader of the crypto world and maintains its reputation as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC is the go-to choice for institutional investors, and spot BTC ETFs witness record inflows. While BTC asserts its position as the top investment choice, many altcoins have surpassed its profit potential. Despite BTC reaching a new ATH of $103,900 earlier this week, its dominance is declining, and investors are turning their attention to smaller assets, signalling the start of the altcoin season. Let’s delve into some of the top altcoins to own as Bitcoin makes these historic gains. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin by market cap and is the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $68.4 billion. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $354 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters and has long endorsed Dogecoin . Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” DOGE is expected to surge after DeFi Technologies introduced Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. The ETP will allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning the asset. Amid Dogecoin’s increasing popularity and momentum, the token managed to flip luxury car maker Porsche’s market cap. With a market cap exceeding $68 billion , Dogecoin surpassed Porsche’s $56.1 billion market capitalization. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) PNUT , inspired by a pet squirrel named Peanut that was euthanized by New York authorities against its owner’s wishes, has become a viral sensation, causing an unprecedented social media frenzy amid the election. The memecoin was listed on Binance in November and has skyrocketed since. PNUT gained over 1,325% in the month and is up over 32% in the past week. PNUT’s rally came after tech mogul Elon Musk referenced Peanut’s death in a post on X (formerly Twitter). PNUT’s rally resulted in it entering the top 100 altcoins, and it is now the 89th largest crypto with a market cap of over $1.5 billion. Bonk (BONK) Bonk (BONK), like other memecoins, has exploded in popularity thanks to its strong community backing and viral potential. Initially seen as a mere speculative token, Bonk (BONK) has surprised many by delivering significant returns to early investors. Much like Pepe (PEPE) before it, Bonk (BONK) is capitalizing on the memecoin phenomenon, where projects with robust community support can achieve meteoric gains. While Bonk's (BONK) success is mainly tied to social media hype and community engagement, it offers high-risk, high-reward opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on short-term gains. BONK has gained over 106% in the past month and is poised for immense growth in the upcoming alt season. Husky Inu (HINU) As BTC trades at a whopping $99,600 and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $610,000, completing its third presale round. 🚀 A huge THANK YOU to all our $HINU holders! Stage 3 is officially complete, and the price has increased significantly. We’re now aiming for even bigger targets and greater success. As 1Q 2025 approaches, so does our highly anticipated launch. Stay tuned for the exciting… pic.twitter.com/zuP8T1IxTD — Husky Inu (@huskyinureal) December 5, 2024 Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

37366078,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51647,1733639238,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Trillion-Dollar Coin Idea: Expert Reveals Why He Will Never Sell XRP,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-trillion-dollar-coin-idea-expert-reveals-why-he-will-never-sell-xrp/,"In a recent tweet , crypto analyst Egrag Crypto raised a thought-provoking idea about the potential use of XRP, the digital asset majorly distributed by Ripple, as a solution for the U.S. national debt. This notion touches on a broader concept, the so-called “trillion-dollar coin” idea, and suggests that XRP might be pivotal in addressing U.S. financial challenges. While the idea may sound far-fetched at first, it’s worth examining the details and implications that Egrag Crypto points to, particularly the influence of key players in the U.S. administration and the potential for a shift in the nation’s financial system. The Trillion-Dollar Coin Concept The concept of a trillion-dollar coin emerged during the 2011 U.S. debt ceiling crisis when the government faced the possibility of defaulting on its obligations. The idea proposed by Carlos Mucha, also known as “Beowulf,” was rooted in a 1997 law that allowed the U.S. Treasury to mint platinum coins of any value. This idea gained traction among economists like Paul Krugman and Rohan Grey, who explored its potential as a solution to bypass the debt ceiling and avoid default. However, despite its legal feasibility, the trillion-dollar coin was never minted, as it was considered an impractical and controversial solution. Egrag Crypto’s Proposal: XRP as the U.S. Debt Solution In his tweet, Egrag Crypto proposes an alternative to the trillion-dollar coin by suggesting that XRP could be used to settle U.S. national debt. According to this hypothesis, the remaining XRP in escrow, controlled by Ripple, could be used to address the nation’s financial obligations. XRP has a significant reserve of tokens locked in escrow , designed to gradually release a set amount of XRP into circulation over time. Egrag Crypto speculates that the U.S. government could access this escrow under a “force majeure” situation, bypassing standard procedures in extraordinary circumstances to utilize XRP for the country’s financial needs. This idea hinges on the belief that the U.S. government could revalue XRP and use it to pay down debt, leveraging the asset’s growing value in global markets. The proposal presents an alternative to traditional financial tools such as printing money or issuing debt. In this framework, XRP could become the cornerstone of a new economic strategy, addressing national debt and broader financial instability. The Influence of the PayPal Mafia Egrag Crypto also points to the growing influence of the “PayPal Mafia”—a group of influential tech entrepreneurs and investors who were integral to the founding of PayPal. Members of this group, including figures like Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, and Elon Musk , have gone on to shape the landscape of modern technology and finance. Their increasing influence on U.S. administration and financial policy raises questions about their potential role in promoting cryptocurrency adoption and integrating digital assets into mainstream financial systems. The involvement of these individuals could signal a shift toward crypto-based solutions, including the potential use of XRP to address longstanding financial issues. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Escrow and the “Force Majeure” Scenario One of the more intriguing elements of Egrag Crypto’s theory is the possibility of a “force majeure” status that would allow the U.S. government to take control of the XRP escrow . This concept is grounded in the idea that in extreme situations, such as a national financial emergency, the government could step in and alter or take control of assets otherwise out of its reach. In this case, XRP could be revalued and leveraged for purposes beyond its current role in Ripple’s ecosystem. While such an action would likely face legal and political challenges, it presents an interesting scenario in which the government could rapidly deploy a significant cryptocurrency reserve to solve pressing financial problems. Egrag Crypto’s tweet presents a speculative, yet intriguing scenario about the potential role of XRP in addressing U.S. national debt. While using cryptocurrency to settle the country’s financial obligations remains untested and controversial, the growing influence of tech entrepreneurs and the evolving landscape of digital assets make it a topic worth considering.

In October 2021, Shiba Inu hit its peak price of 0.000048845. To reach that level again, Shiba Inu would need to rise by 178%. The technical analysis suggests this is a possibility, as the market conditions are starting to improve. Majority of the top 10 cryptocurrencies have drifted into the green zone and Bitcoin is once again trading above the $100k level. Current Resistance Levels According to analyst Austin Hilton , the altcoin needs to break through a major resistance level of 0.00004033. Right now, Shiba Inu is trading at 0.00003247 and is up by more than six percent in the last 24 hours. Once this resistance is broken, the analyst believes we’ll see a significant price increase. The Three-Year Down Cycle Shiba Inu has been in a downtrend for about three years, but that’s changing. The market conditions are improving, and with new leadership and pro-crypto policies in place, the crypto market is heading into a new phase starting in January. This could trigger one of the biggest bull runs for crypto, and Shiba Inu, as a top meme coin, is positioned to benefit. Shiba Inu’s Market Position Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are the leading meme coins, with market caps of $18 billion and $66 billion, respectively. The meme coin sector is worth over $130 billion, a significant part of the $3.67 trillion global crypto market. This shows the potential for growth in Shiba Inu’s market cap. Breakout Pattern Shiba Inu tends to consolidate and then break out, as seen in previous charts. After consolidation, the coin often experiences significant price movements. For example, there was a 60% gain in just eight days during one breakout. With more capital entering the crypto market, similar movements could occur.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-08 06:29:33

Lunex Network Soars 216% As Pepe’s Price Surge Aims For New Heights,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-to-lose-two-zeros-by-2026-lunex-network-soars-216/,"Shiba Inu has crossed the $0.00003 mark, following Bitcoin’s $100K milestone and the Heimdall Hard Fork upgrade announcement. This move has seen Shiba Inu attract bullish sentiments, with a YTD gain of over 200%. The surge has attracted positive price predictions for Shiba Inu , as a leading think tank predicts that the SHIB token is gearing up for a massive rally in 2025 and could delete two zeros by 2026. Similarly, Pepe coin has also shown significant gains, doubling its price in November. This impressive PEPE surge has been driven by favorable sentiments, leading to an over 130% monthly rally. Lunex Network , on the other hand, aims to mirror the two coins’ price performance, having surged by over 216% to hit the $0.0038 price target. Lunex Network Price Surges By Over 216% Lunex Network is a hybrid DeFi platform that offers investors a wide range of tools and perks. Among the unique tools offered are a mobile exchange app that makes it easy for traders to make swaps on the go and a modernized portfolio tracker.

These unique features have been attributed to Lunex Network’s impressive presale performance. The LNEX token has already reached $0.0038, representing over 216% surge from its starting price of just $0.0012. Shiba Inu Could Delete Two Zeros To Hit $0.0017 in 2026 A leading on-chain metrics and price prediction company, Gov Capital , has made a unique price forecast for Shiba Inu, suggesting it could hit the $0.0017 target in 2026. This will be two years from now, making it a long-term target. Additionally, if SHIBA Inu hits $0.0017, it will be an uptick in its ROI of around 5,600%. This bullish Shiba Inu prediction comes as the SHIB token is gearing up for a significant rally. Shiba Inu bulls aim for a 2020 and 2021 repeat of the rally in which the token’s price surged by over 85 million percent, printing life-changing gains. If this rally repeats in 2025 and 2026, present-day Shiba Inu investors could lock in millions. Technical indicators , including the RSI at 63, support bullish momentum, as the meme coin has maintained a bullish outlook since early November. According to SHIB KNIGHT , the coin has prepared for a significant breakout. This could see it surpass its critical resistance level of $0.0000348 while aiming for higher gains in 2025. Pepe Price Analysis Pepe coin, one of the most traded meme coins, continues to record impressive gains, with a weekly surge of over 7%. The Pepe token also hovers between the $0.000017 and $0.000020 region while trading above the 200-day simple moving average. This suggests a robust Pepe price performance over the long term, reinforcing a bullish sentiment around the token. Moreover, Pepe’s market indicators reflect optimism. The Fear and Greed Index 84 signals extreme greed, as Pepe price prediction sentiments are bullish. The RSI , at 69, suggests building buying pressure that could lead to a significant price breakout. Pepe coin has recorded 17 green days over the past month, adding to its positive performance. A continuous upward momentum might see Pepe’s price target at $0.000035 in the short term, with support around the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. Its listing on major exchange platforms such as Upbit and Robinhood could provide Pepe with increased capital and broader audience access, leading to further gains in its price. Lunex Network Price Surge Attracts Major Attention With an appealing price of $0.0038, Lunex Network ensures a low barrier to entry for all investors looking to enjoy significant gains. With its cutting-edge technology and many benefits for developers, traders, and businesses, analysts have also projected more gains for the LNEX token, which could mirror the price performance of standout cryptos, including Shiba Inu and Pepe.

This upswing has been closely tied to a broader rally in the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin (BTC), which recently reached new all-time highs. Ethereum Surges 61% As ETF Demand Grows According to Bloomberg, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States experienced unprecedented demand, recording a daily inflow of $428 million on Thursday alone. This surge in investment interest reflects a growing confidence in Ethereum, particularly following Donald Trump’s election victory on November 5, which ignited a bullish sentiment across the crypto landscape. Since then, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin, boasting a staggering 61% increase in value. Related Reading: Trump’s Crypto Czar David Sacks Is Super Bullish For Solana: Here’s Why The appointment of Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has further bolstered enthusiasm for Ethereum. Atkins, a proponent of pro-crypto regulation and a member of the advisory board for the advocacy group Token Alliance, is seen as a positive force for the crypto industry. Bloomberg suggests that under his leadership, the restrictions preventing investors from earning yield on staked Ether through ETFs could be reconsidered, enhancing the appeal of these investment vehicles. Altcoin Season In Full Swing Nick Forster, founder of the crypto trading platform Derive.xyz, noted, “Now that Bitcoin has hit $100,000, it appears that investors are seeking the next opportunity.” Forster highlighted that Ethereum remains significantly below its all-time high of $4,878 reached in November 2021, prompting many investors to shift their focus and explore the potential for gains in altcoins like ETH. The increasing interest in Ethereum is also evident in the derivatives market, where open interest in Ether futures contracts on CME Group Inc. has reached record levels, significantly outpacing the growth in Bitcoin futures. Le Shi, managing director at market-making firm Auros, remarked that US institutions tend to favor regulated investment vehicles, resulting in a higher concentration of activity in CME Ether futures and ETH ETFs. Additionally, the founders of Glassnode—Yan Allemann, Jan Happel, and Rafael Schutlze-Kraft—have pointed to the resilience of altcoins amid Bitcoin’s recent volatility.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With SEC clarity, XRP leads the bull cycle as DTX Exchange eyes gains with a feature tied to XRP’s ETF potential. With regulatory clarity from the SEC, XRP is leading this bull cycle, reigniting investor confidence in long-term investments. Meanwhile, market attention is turning to DTX Exchange as it launches a new feature poised to capitalize on XRP’s probable ETF launch. As institutional and retail investors evaluate these opportunities, the crypto market’s focus highlights a potential shift toward platforms that combine innovation with regulatory approval, signaling new frontrunners in the race for dominance. You might also like: DTX Exchange bound for rally, draws in Cardano and Hedera holders Ripple’s XRP balances hype and history in current rally In one month, XRP accumulated more than $130 billion in market cap to become the 4th largest cryptocurrency. Currently trading above $2.30, XRP is up 37% this week, driven by optimism surrounding Ripple’s planned RLUSD stablecoin and potential XRP ETF approval. There’s also the expansion of cross-border payment in partnership with the NYDFS. Despite bullish momentum and predictions of reaching new all-time highs, XRP faces skepticism. Analysts warn of volatility and note Ripple’s significant reserves of 38.9 billion tokens, raising concerns about market supply. Recent price consolidation, including a 2.9% dip in the past 24 hours, suggests profit-taking and waning short-term momentum. Experts are divided: some foresee further surges due to ecosystem growth, while others anticipate a pullback below $0.60, citing XRP’s history of sharp declines, such as its 75% drop post-2021 peak. Nevertheless, market sentiment remains largely bullish as XRP continues to lead this bull cycle. At the press time, XRP is trading above its moving averages with a “buy” signal on its momentum indicator. DTX Exchange Capitalizes on ETF buzz with new features DTX Exchange is the latest example of a unique approach to decentralized finance, poised to disrupt the ETF market. By introducing tokenized ETFs, traders gain access to fractional ownership of various assets, spanning from stocks and commodities to cryptocurrencies. This lowers the entry barrier for retail traders, finally letting them enter the markets reserved for institutional investors. The distributed liquidity pools on the platform also guarantee the best execution of trades, tighter spreads, and smooth price discovery. Global access is another advantage since DTX Exchange operates without the geographic or regulatory restrictions seen in traditional platforms. Blockchain transparency ensures real-time tracking of ETF components, fostering trust and security among users. Moreover, traders can use up to 1,000x leverage and leverage advanced on-chain analytics to inform their trading decisions. Retail investors are encouraged with tools and educational material to stand squarely with institutions in the markets. DTX Exchange blends the best of DeFi accessibility with the stability of traditional ETFs to provide a next-generation gateway into the markets. Currently, one DTX token is sold for $0.12 in the sixth stage of its ongoing presale. Early DTX holders have access to premium features like enhanced analytics and priority customer support. Interested investors who get in now can join a growing DeFi ecosystem that has already raised nearly $10 million and is rumored to be the dark horse of the next cycle.

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency created in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional digital currencies. Featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo, it was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin’s value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and exceeding $50 billion in total value. This growth was propelled by social media influence and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s open-source technology and strong community support contribute to its potential. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and investor sentiment. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB’s profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These features contribute to its potential in the crypto space, making it a notable project in the current market cycle. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, it offers security and resistance to censorship or counterfeiting, and does not require a bank account for settlements. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for development and liquidity support. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., placed 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across currencies, making it suitable for global financial transactions. Its features make it a significant player in the current market landscape. Cardano’s ADA: A Sustainable and Scalable Cryptocurrency Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which enhances energy efficiency compared to proof-of-work systems. The platform is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts, improving scalability and transaction speed. In 2021, Cardano introduced native tokens that offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. With its focus on sustainability and scalability, ADA has significant potential in the cryptocurrency market. Its innovative technology makes it an important player in the current market cycle. Conclusion As global barriers ease, the crypto market is set for unprecedented growth. While tokens like DOGE, SHIB, XRP, and ADA may see modest short-term gains, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN promises significant growth and real benefits, building a community of leaders and following the path of previous successful tokens.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-on-the-verge-of-the-most-explosive-phase-heres-why/,"Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Egrag Crypto recently shared an intriguing technical analysis, speculating about a potential explosive price movement for XRP. His post titled, “The 3 Mountains: And So It Begins,” suggests that XRP might be approaching a critical breakout phase, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. The “Three Mountains” Theory Egrag Crypto’s analysis revolves around a chart illustrating three prominent macro triangle patterns, named the “three mountains.” According to his interpretation, these patterns may signal impending bullish momentum for XRP. In technical analysis, triangle formations often indicate periods of consolidation before a significant price move. If XRP breaks out of these formations, it could trigger a substantial rally. He added, “What if the 3 mountains represent the three massive macro triangle ranges? What if we’re on the verge of #XRP’s most explosive phase yet?” His optimistic outlook has resonated with many within the XRP community, reinforcing long-held bullish expectations. #XRP – The 3 Mountains: And So It Begins What if the 3 mountains represent the three massive macro triangle ranges?

These events could influence the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, especially for XRP, considering its protracted legal battle with the SEC. Many analysts believe a more favorable regulatory framework could unlock new investment inflows into the crypto market. XRP could benefit significantly from such developments as one of the most established cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Response and Market Sentiment The XRP community , known for its strong support and engagement, reacted positively to Egrag Crypto’s post. His call to “STAY STEADY and STAY STRONG” resonated with long-term holders, many of whom have endured market volatility and legal uncertainty over the past few years. While technical analysis alone cannot guarantee future price movements, Egrag Crypto’s perspective underscores the growing anticipation surrounding XRP’s future. The potential convergence of technical indicators and macroeconomic events could set the stage for significant market activity. As ChatGPT previously stated in an XRP price prediction , “Market dynamics in the cryptocurrency sector are often influenced by a blend of technical analysis, market sentiment, and macroeconomic events.” If these factors align as anticipated, XRP could be poised for one of its most impactful market phases.

Make Up for Lost Time with BTFD Coin,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-your-shot-at-book-of-memes-beginnings-make-up-for-lost-time-with-btfd-coin/,"If you were one of the crypto enthusiasts who missed the Book of Meme ICO, you probably feel a little like someone who walked out of a party just as the DJ dropped the hottest track of the year. You know, the one that everyone will be talking about for months. But here’s the good news: it’s not too late to turn things around. If you missed the Book of Meme launch, BTFD Coin is here to give you a second chance at getting in on something big—and trust me, you don’t want to let this one slip through your fingers. Instead of wondering “what could have been,” why not shift your focus to BTFD Coin? This meme coin isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan project. With a presale that’s absolutely killing it, BTFD Coin is the next big thing—and the perfect second chance you’ve been waiting for. Book of Meme: An Awesome ICO When Book of Meme first hit the market, it caused a major stir in the meme coin space. The ICO was a resounding success, where the presale alone raised 50% of its current allocation (think along the lines of 34 billion BOME tokens!) The community surrounding Book of Meme grew rapidly, with thousands of followers across various social media platforms within the first month of launch. Its promise of creating a unique platform dedicated to meme culture and providing engaging experiences for users helped build significant hype. However, even with its early success, the token faced challenges in maintaining its value post-ICO. Despite these hurdles, Book of Meme continues to develop its platform and remains a notable presence in the meme coin space. BTFD Coin: A Second Chance You Won’t Want to Miss If there’s one thing that BTFD Coin has in its favour, it’s timing. Coming in strong after the dust settled from Book of Meme’s rollercoaster, BTFD Coin has been a breath of fresh air for investors who are ready to make a fresh start. The presale is currently in full swing, and the figures are looking great. With over $1.35 raised and 29 billion coins sold, BTFD Coin is off to an impressive start. At a current price of $0.000064, BTFD Coin is still in its early stages, meaning you can still get in at a very affordable price before the coin hits the open market. And here’s the best part: the coin has a solid community backing, with over 3,100 Bulls already holding their tokens. It’s not just a meme coin with hype—it’s a meme coin with staying power. Whether it’s the high staking rewards (with an APY that could make your bank account jealous), the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, or the growing global community, BTFD Coin is putting in the work to ensure that it’s not just another meme coin destined to disappear. If you’re feeling the FOMO after Book of Meme’s ICO, now’s the time to strike while the iron is hot. The current price of $0.000064 per coin is a bargain, and early investors are already starting to see the value in being part of something that’s showing real promise. What $800 Could Do for You So, let’s talk investment. You’ve got $800 to throw into BTFD Coin, and you’re wondering what kind of return you could expect. Well, based on the current presale price of $0.000064, your $800 would buy you 12.5 million BTFD coins. Now, if the price hits $0.0006 (which is a realistic projection considering the presale performance), you could potentially turn that $800 into $7,500. That’s a potential return of 837.5%. Not bad, right? This investment example isn’t just some pipe dream. With BTFD Coin’s presale success, we’re seeing some solid growth potential. Of course, no investment is a guarantee, but the signs are there that BTFD Coin could provide some seriously high rewards for those who get in early. Final Thoughts: Time for You to Finally Shine If you missed out on Book of Meme’s ICO, now’s your chance to turn that regret into something worthwhile. BTFD Coin is offering a second chance to get in on a meme coin that has real potential and serious community backing. With a presale that’s already making waves, a price that’s still incredibly affordable, and rewards that could seriously fatten your wallet, this is one opportunity you don’t want to miss. So go ahead—grab your BTFD Coin and make up for lost time. The second chance is here, and it’s got your name written all over it.

ChatGPT Answers,https://cryptopotato.com/can-pepe-surpass-shiba-inu-by-2024s-end-chatgpt-answers/,"TL:DR; PEPE continues to make the headlines as it broke its November all-time high yesterday and charted a fresh one following a 20% daily surge. Although it has closed the gap with Shiba Inu in terms of market cap, it’s still pretty significant. However, the question arises of whether it can become the second-biggest in its niche. PEPE vs SHIB CryptoPotato reported yesterday PEPE’s impressive run. After a few weeks of sideways trading and even retracements from its November 13 peak , the meme coin went on an impressive run that resulted in tapping a new high of over $0.000026. Although it has lost some traction since then, PEPE is still well above $0.000025, and its market cap is just shy of $11 billion. This is still far from SHIB’s $19 billion, but PEPE has continuously outperformed in the past month with gains of 135% compared to Shiba Inu’s more modest 70%. This has led the community to speculate on whether it is a question of when and not if PEPE will surpass SHIB and become the second-largest meme coin by market cap. there is no timeline where $pepe doesn’t flip shib this cycle. global pepe recognition and mindshare is too big, absolutely inevitable imo. pic.twitter.com/EzZU9IE2oE — Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) November 17, 2024 During its surge on Saturday, PEPE also managed to outplace SHIB in terms of trading volume, and by a significant margin, according to on-chain data. $PEPE is now the 5th most traded cryptocurrency, excluding stablecoins, with an almost 3x larger 24-hour volume than $SHIB . pic.twitter.com/NgBL6QIoC0 — Chandler Bing (@chandlerbingpl) December 7, 2024 What Does ChatGPT Say? While the community is highly bullish now for PEPE, perhaps driven by the hype from the latest ATH, we decided to ask the popular AI chatbot about its opinion on the matter. It admitted that PEPE has “demonstrated significant growth potential in 2024,” adding that it has “frequently outperformed Shiba Inu (SHIB) in various timeframes.” It noted that PEPE has attracted substantial whale activity and high trading volumes, but Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, including the Layer-2 network , “provides it with more tangible utility than PEPE, which primarily relies on community momentum and market hype.” Consequently, ChatGPT concluded that such a flippening is ‘unlikely,’ at least in this timeframe. “While analysts expect strong gains for PEPE, Shiba Inu’s entrenched position as a larger and more established meme coin makes a complete flip unlikely in the short term unless a significant shift occurs in their respective ecosystems.” The post Can PEPE Surpass Shiba Inu by 2024’s End?

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 07:32:00

XRP has gained momentum in recent weeks, attracting renewed investor interest following its strong market performance since early November. Identifying Key Entry Levels Market analyst EGRAG recently outlined crucial entry points for XRP investors, emphasizing that the asset still holds long-term growth potential despite recent market pullbacks. He highlighted several strategic price levels where investors might consider accumulating XRP. EGRAG recalled urging investors to buy XRP before its latest price surge when it traded below $1. He maintains that the current market phase continues to offer attractive investment opportunities. In his analysis, he pointed to $2.00 as a significant buying level amid ongoing market volatility. Additionally, the $1.60 to $1.70 range was identified as another potential accumulation zone, particularly if XRP experiences a price correction due to a rounding top pattern. He further noted that if XRP dips to $1.20, he plans to reinvest all profits into the asset, demonstrating strong confidence in its long-term potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to EGRAG, a successful breakout from the rounding top formation could push XRP beyond the $3.50 to $3.80 range, setting the stage for a rally targeting $6 to $8 in the short term. RSI Pattern Signals Potential for Further Gains EGRAG also examined XRP’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), identifying a familiar pattern that could signal more upside potential. Historical RSI data reveals a recurring trend during past bull runs characterized by two distinct peaks. The first peak typically precedes a sharp RSI decline, followed by a second peak marking the bull run’s final high. According to EGRAG, XRP has only reached its first peak in the current cycle, suggesting that a second, more substantial upward movement could be forthcoming. He projected that the current bull cycle could extend into late 2025, with a possible peak around mid-March 2025. This forecast aligns with the anticipated wave 5 cycle top, reinforcing the possibility of higher XRP prices in the coming months. By focusing on well-defined entry points and monitoring historical RSI patterns, investors may find promising opportunities as XRP’s market cycle unfolds.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB’s profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These features contribute to its potential in the crypto space, making it a notable project in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency created in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional digital currencies. Featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo, it was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin’s value surged in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and exceeding $50 billion in total value. This growth was propelled by social media influence and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s open-source technology and strong community support contribute to its potential. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and investor sentiment. Conclusion While SHIB and DOGE have less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a token for those pursuing excellence and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential massive returns during this bull run, DOGEN follows the success of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It builds a community of leaders, providing real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

This milestone has inspired speculation about Bitcoin’s short, medium, and long-term behavior in the face of increased market volatility. Expert Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $200,000 According to market expert VirtualBacon, while the $100,000 level is noteworthy, it does not represent the pinnacle of Bitcoin’s potential. He refers to the current phase as the “thrill stage,” in which retail investors are motivated by fear of missing out (FOMO) and media hype. Although Bitcoin’s march to $100,000 may not indicate an early entry point, VirtualBacon predicts it will eventually hit $200,000, citing past price cycles. However, the expert cautions that investors should be prepared for 20% to 30% corrections, but he remains confident about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Related Reading: XRP Price Marks $2.13 And $2.92 As Primary Fibonacci Levels, What Happens When Wave 2 Begins? Regarding the present bull run’s longevity, VirtualBacon alludes to previous cycles that show major price increases often last 6 to 10 months. He observes that previous bull runs often peaked 6 to 10 months after important milestones, such as Bitcoin’s halving events. VirtualBacon also drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s latest breakthrough of the $100,000 milestone and its initial breach of the $10,000 level in 2017, which resulted in a quick doubling of the price within 20 days. If history repeats itself, the analyst believes that the Bitcoin price might skyrocket to $200,000. However, if the price consolidates around $100,000, it could signal a sustained bull run, which would be beneficial to altcoins. Ethereum: A ‘No-Brainer Investment’ While the euphoria surrounding Bitcoin’s surge above $100,000 is apparent, VirtualBacon emphasizes that the real potential are in altcoins. He believes that when Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins will certainly take center stage. Ethereum (ETH), in particular, is outperforming Bitcoin, predicting an upcoming altcoin season. During past cycles, Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin by a factor of 2.5. If Bitcoin reaches $200,000, VirtualBacon predicts that Ethereum may grow to $15,000, indicating a fourfold increase. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Ethereum Golden Cross As ETH Surges Past $4,000 – Is Altseason In Sight? Interestingly, VirtualBacon considers Ethereum a “no-brainer investment” at this time, citing its “significant undervaluation” and ability to generate at least a 3x return, with realistic price targets ranging from $10,000 to $12,000. Finally, VirtualBacon advised monitoring Bitcoin’s performance in relation to its 200-day exponential moving average. He expects the bull market to continue until late 2025, creating several possibilities for wise investments.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As BTC surpasses $100K, investors eye new coins. Cutoshi trends as a major ETH whale makes a big investment post-Memefi. As BTC pushes past the long-awaited 100k mark, investors are searching the markets for the next coins to buy. After the Memefi project, Cutoshi was trending on X, a big ETH whale made a substantial investment. Smart money looks for low-cap coins with high ROI potential Bitcoin is stealing the headlines again today, with the total crypto market cap up to $3.8T, a 123% increase since the start of the year. Bitcoin leads the way for digital assets, however, Ethereum is where the focus is going to be when altcoin season gets going. Ethereum’s smart contracts make DeFi possible, in a way that Bitcoin was never intended to do. For many smart whales and investors, this presents a buying opportunity, as crypto’s second-biggest coin is unlikely to stay undervalued for long and the resulting gains will be bigger in percentage terms than coins that have already mooned. That’s the logic behind the Ethereum whale, who just put $10k into Cutoshi. Pick a new but utility-packed coin that investors are talking about at a low market cap and wait as the price increases throughout the presale.

Source: Trends24 This achievement proves that the coin is gaining community attention, something helpful for any coin and essential for a project that is partly about memes. The ERC-20 token and project is a great example of the power of Ethereum, mixing the fun of memes with the usefulness of DeFi. Cutoshi hits X trending list for the third time this month Cutoshi’s recent meme competition attracted a lot of investor attention; the coin also recently sold out of stage 3, going up by 20% and up by a total of 106% since the launch of the presale. For a coin that’s less than 2 months old, that’s impressive, and with six more stages to go before the coin launches on the Ethereum blockchain, there’s a lot more room for growth. Cutoshi is inspired by the Chinese Lucky Cat, with a DeFi perspective. The project is introducing people to the concept of farming via quests, and their plans include a cross-chain DEX, a learning academy, NFTs for trading discounts and more. Essentially, the idea is to make using DeFi as easy as possible for the beginner, while also offering advanced guidance for seasoned traders and a fair price with low slippage on swaps in the Cutoshi DEX.

Ethereum Ethereum , launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, has changed the blockchain world with its pioneering Proof-of-Stake mechanism and smart contract capabilities. Unlike traditional blockchains, Ethereum supports decentralized applications (dApps) that power a vast ecosystem, including finance, gaming, and more. Innovations like Layer 2 solutions—such as Arbitrum and Polygon—enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs, making the network more efficient. The introduction of ERC-20 tokens set a standard for creating new tokens used for governance, utility, and value storage within various applications. Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake with “The Merge” in 2022 marked a significant milestone, reducing energy consumption and setting the stage for future scalability improvements like sharding. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s potential continues to grow as it strives to address scalability and cost issues. The upcoming sharding phase aims to increase transaction throughput, making the network more accessible and efficient. In the current market cycle, Ethereum stands out not just for its technological advancements but also for its resilience and adaptability. While other cryptocurrencies face challenges, Ethereum’s strong developer community and continuous upgrades keep it at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Market trends suggest that Ethereum remains a vital asset in the crypto space, serving as collateral, rewarding stakers, and facilitating countless transactions. Its trajectory indicates a promising future, making it an attractive option for those interested in the evolution of decentralized technologies. Dogecoin Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s scarcity, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Starting as a joke, it quickly gained a following, showing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared, fueled by online buzz and endorsements from Elon Musk. It entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value over $50 billion. Is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology is simple, similar to early cryptocurrencies but without a supply limit. This means it’s less about scarcity and more about usage and community support. While some see it as a fun entry into crypto, others are cautious due to its meme origins and volatility. Compared to coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features like smart contracts. Yet, its strong community keeps it popular. In the current market, if you’re drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. XRP XRP is a cryptocurrency that sets itself apart with speed and low cost. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it was created to be a digitally native, programmable currency that’s open and borderless. Unlike traditional systems, XRP operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. You don’t need a bank account to use it, which opens up possibilities for people everywhere. Launched by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company that was gifted 80 billion XRP, uses it to improve network liquidity and supports the ecosystem by releasing supply in a controlled manner. In the current market cycle, XRP shows potential due to its focus on fast and low-cost cross-border payments. While other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained attention, XRP’s unique approach to facilitating seamless transfers across various currencies makes it stand out. Recent trends suggest that there is growing interest in efficient payment solutions, and XRP could play a key role in that space. Its resistance to censorship and counterfeiting adds to its appeal. For investors looking at the evolving crypto market, XRP presents an interesting option to consider. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike its predecessor, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, opening up possibilities in the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Launched by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain credibility, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin’s donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB’s place on Ethereum allows it to support smart contracts and decentralized apps. This led to ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. The team also plans an NFT platform and a governance system using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These features give SHIB real utility beyond being a meme. In the current market, where investors seek coins with real-world uses, SHIB’s technology and growth plans make it attractive. While sharing Dogecoin’s meme appeal, SHIB’s Ethereum foundation could give it an edge in the long run. Conclusion ETH, DOGE, XRP, and SHIB have potential, but XYZVerse combines sports and memes for massive growth, offering early adopters community-driven success and aiming to outperform top tokens.

The altcoins registered impressive gains on Saturday evening, including a new multi-year peak for DOGE, but have retraced as well. BTC Beneath $100K The primary cryptocurrency’s impressive surge following Trump’s landslide victory in the US elections pushed the asset from under $70,000 to almost $100,000 within a few weeks. However, it couldn’t penetrate into six-digit territory for a while as the bears managed to defend it. This finally transpired last Thursday when BTC went into a price discovery mode above $100,000 and tapped a fresh all-time high of almost $104,000. What followed was a sudden and violent rejection that drove it south by over ten grand in hours to $92,000 on most exchanges. After it flushed out a large number of leveraged positions, BTC went on the offensive once again and jumped to $102,000 on Friday evening. However, it has been unable to sustain that level and has lost a few grand since then. It even slipped beneath $100,000 earlier today, where it currently stands. Its market cap is just over $1.960 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts has calmed at 51.4%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 8.12.2024. Source: TradingView PEPE’s New ATH With the word altseason going viral on X, many alternative coins did well in the past 24 hours. PEPE, for example, skyrocketed by 20% at one point and painted a fresh all-time high of its own at over $0.000026 before correcting slightly. Dogecoin also jumped high and neared $0.5 for the first time in three and a half years. SHIB is well in the green today amid some dispute about whether it could lose its position to PEPE by the end of the year. XRP was heading south for a few days straight but has bounced back with a 4.5% surge to trade above $2.5 now. The rest of the larger-cap alts are much less volatile. The total crypto market cap has retraced by around $40 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.820 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP.

After struggling to keep pace with other meme coins in recent months, SHIB is now showing signs of a significant breakout. Shiba Inu’s Downtrend Nears an End Technical analyst “The Krypto King” recently announced on X that Shiba Inu’s prolonged downtrend, which began in late 2021, is coming to a close. He emphasized that SHIB is breaking out of its three-year bearish phase, potentially setting the stage for a substantial price surge. According to the analyst’s projections, SHIB could see at least 178% gains, adding approximately $0.00005602 to its market price. If this prediction materializes, SHIB could reach its all-time high of $0.00008645, last seen during its historic bull run. $SHIB Is breaking out of a 4-year downtrend The next stop will be ATH pic.twitter.com/skquLN9MwI — The Krypto King (@thekryptoking_) December 1, 2024 Recent Price Movements Shiba Inu’s price movement in December has been notably stronger than in previous months. On the day of “The Krypto King’s” forecast, SHIB traded at a low of $0.0000267 but later surged by 24% to $0.000038. Despite a brief pullback to $0.000027, the token quickly reclaimed the $0.00003 range. Currently trading at $0.00003206, SHIB has posted a 10% weekly gain, making it the top-performing meme coin in the market. In comparison, competitors such as Dogecoin, PEPE, FLOKI, and BONK reported modest weekly increases of less than 4%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Anticipated Market Moves Market watchers widely believe that SHIB is gearing up for a major price movement. Some analysts link this expectation to Ethereum’s recent breakout past the $4,000 mark, which could trigger positive momentum across the broader crypto market. Commentator “JD Updates” suggested that Ethereum’s strong performance might inspire a similar surge in SHIB’s value. Many traders are optimistic that the meme token could follow Ethereum’s lead as bullish sentiment builds. Path to a New All-Time High To sustain its upward trajectory, the token must overcome critical resistance levels. Analysts like Shib Spain believe surpassing the $0.000033 threshold would signal a significant bullish breakout. SHIB previously faced rejection at this level on December 1, underscoring its importance in the token’s price action. Overall, the growing consensus among analysts points to a promising outlook for Shiba Inu . As the broader crypto market continues to heat up, SHIB could be on the verge of reclaiming its place among the top-performing digital assets.

At 10 am CET, the hearing took place, with Durov present along with his lawyers, David-Olivier Kaminski and Christophe Ingrain. According to a source cited by Agence France-Presse (AFP), the questioning revolved around claims that Telegram was used for illicit transactions. Background of the Case Troubles for Durov started on August 24 when he was arrested at Le Bourget airport in Paris. While he was released with a bail of $6 million, the founder of Telegram has been restricted to France until March 2025. The office of the prosecutor in Paris announced preliminary charges on August 28 against Durov, saying that he had operated a platform that, in some instances, conducted illegal activities. The core of the case is a judicial inquiry launched in July 2024. If convicted, Durov faces a prison sentence of as long as 10 years and a fine of €500,000. The development has spotlighted the tension between regulatory enforcement and the operational scope of privacy-focused platforms like Telegram. Web3 and Privacy Concerns The charges against Durov have sparked a large debate within the Web3 and cryptocurrency communities. Privacy advocates and industry leaders have compared Durov’s situation to that of Alexey Pertsev, a developer of Tornado Cash, who was charged with enabling illicit activities using technology. This raises serious red flags with regards to government overreach and digital privacy,” said Nikolay Denisenko, chief technology officer of Brighty, a financial app. Vyara Savova, senior policy lead at the European Crypto Initiative, also spoke to the risks in targeting developers of privacy-preserving technologies as an uncomfortable trend. The case has raised concerns about an erosion of privacy protections against growing government scrutiny and has been seen to portend potential setbacks for both decentralized and encrypted platforms. Industry Implications In its fight against Durov, the eventual verdict on France’s allegations keeps the attention of the modern tech world. The verdict not only decides the fate of Telegram but might also set the precedent of how privacy-focused platforms should work under governmental policy and regulation frameworks. According to the advocates, it can hamper innovation and work against the very fundamentals that govern Web3 technologies, with a bias toward individual privacy and decentralization. This sets up a tension between privacy and oversight that positions the Web3 industry at a crossroads, with evolving legal and ethical challenges.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-08 09:20:00

The statements come at a time when digital assets continue to grow steadily, with interest in both cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as stablecoins. The Treasury Department acknowledged in its report that digital assets are growing rapidly, but noted that this growth is coming from a relatively small base. The report said, “Digital assets have witnessed rapid growth, albeit from a small base.” However, according to the report, the market value of cryptocurrencies remains low compared to traditional financial and real assets. According to the Treasury, adoption of digital assets across households and industries is primarily for investment purposes, with speculative interest playing a major role in market expansion. The Treasury Department noted Bitcoin’s evolving role in the financial ecosystem, noting that Bitcoin has emerged as a store of value similar to gold. “Bitcoin’s primary use case appears to be as a store of value, or ‘digital gold,’ in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi),” the report said. Related News: Binance Labs May Have Sold These Two Tokens After Altcoin Market Rise While Bitcoin has garnered attention as a speculative asset, its appeal as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty continues to grow and has been compared to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. The report also highlighted efforts to leverage blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) to develop innovative applications and improve the clearing and settlement processes of the legacy financial market. Despite the growing interest in digital assets, the Treasury noted that the rise of these assets “has not dampened demand for Treasury securities.” *This is not investment advice.

According to a Dec. 6 announcement, the four companies plan to leverage their decentralized services providing computing, internet access coverage and storage to power the initiative in question. The financial foundation will be provided by Creditcoin, the satellite internet access by Spacecoin, decentralized computing by Sui and decentralized storage by Walrus. The alliance hopes that the initiative will help address issues such as unreliable internet access and lack of financial services in some regions of the world. Spacecoin hopes to bring the service to those areas through its upcoming satellite network. According to a recent announcement , Spacecoin aims to launch its first satellite — CTC-0 — on Dec. 21. Spacecoin founder Tae Oh highlighted that this is the first in a long series of anticipated launches aiming to provide 5G coverage worldwide: “The Internet is one of the most crucial modern inventions that has revolutionized every aspect of human life – from how we get our information to how we access finance, education, and healthcare. Yet billions remain disconnected from this promise. At Spacecoin, we are committed to change that and this launch is the first step towards universal internet access.” Creditcoin is a layer one blockchain aiming to connect borrowers and lenders in emerging markets that already powers a service employing the Central Bank of Nigeria’s eNaira digital currency. This service will power the financial services through decentralized financial institutions. Thanks to Creditcoin, users will be able to develop their own credit histories while accessing modern financial and internet tools as well as a global digital economy. Sui and Walrus ensure that the system can scale while staying decentralized. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The milestone not only cements Pepe’s place among the top-tier tokens but also underscores its growing influence in the memecoin ecosystem. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals a 16.8% surge in PEPE’s value over the past 24 hours, contributing to a 26% gain over the past week. This meteoric rise, which began with a market cap of just $591 million at the start of 2024, represents an extraordinary 18x growth within the year. UNI, by contrast, stands at a market cap of around $10.6 billion, making Pepe’s climb even more significant. Historic Rally to New Heights Pepe, which launched in 2023 as an homage to Matt Furie’s iconic cartoon frog, has no intrinsic value or utility beyond being a speculative asset. Despite its whimsical origins, it has become a major player in the memecoin market , rivaling established names like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Since its inception, PEPE has delivered gains exceeding 7,000%, driven largely by retail interest and speculative trading. The memecoin’s current surge is part of a larger rally that began in September 2024 after months of price stagnation. Pepe recorded a 30% weekly gain in late September, setting the stage for its November breakout. The rally, marked by renewed investor enthusiasm, pushed the token past its previous all-time high before achieving its latest milestone. What Lies Ahead for Pepe? Binance.US played a pivotal role in amplifying PEPE’s momentum by listing the token on December 5, further validating its place in the current market cycle dominated by memecoins. The listing coincides with a broader trend of renewed interest in memecoins, making them one of the defining narratives of the ongoing crypto market revival. While PEPE’s meteoric rise highlights the speculative nature of memecoins, it also raises questions about sustainability. With no inherent utility, the token’s future remains tied to market sentiment and speculative fervor. Nevertheless, surpassing Uniswap’s UNI in market cap underscores how rapidly shifting investor priorities can disrupt even the most established players in the crypto space.

The crypto veteran tells his 312,000 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the inauguration day of President-elect Donald Trump will be a sell-on-news event. But Burniske clarifies that his expected correction on January 20th will likely not mark the end of the crypto bull market. “Dream the post-election dream now, shakedown after. Inauguration makes most sense as reality can never match the dream. But that shakedown won’t be the end, though it will scare paper hands into believing it is.” In November of 2022 just as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto were carving a cycle bottom, Burniske predicted that the total market cap of digital assets would soar to $10 trillion this cycle. But now, the investor says that his massive price target will likely not be hit, at least in this cycle. “People won’t like me saying this, but if $10 trillion is the round number target, then we likely fall short of it this cycle. It was a good rallying cry from a capitulation bottom and will prove directionally correct this cycle, only to be exceeded with time. That said, as we enter a period of increasing frenzy, where dreams grow larger by the day, and bull market geniuses abound, it’s important to be realistic. For example, $100,000 and $10,000 calls for BTC and ETH were everywhere in 2021, and we capped out at ~$70,000 and ~$5,000 respectively back then, with BTC only now reaching that target – lesson in there… Sure HODL (hold on for dear life) some coin forever, but also take profits in frenzies and live your life. Time is more precious than even BTC . Never aim for perfection, or you’ll always miss.” At time of writing the total crypto market cap stands at $3.865 trillion.

If you’re eyeing the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, it’s all about projects that solve real-world problems. Enter Qubetics , Cronos, and Internet Computer Protocol. These three are doing more than just riding the crypto wave—they’re making waves in how companies manage assets, payments, and data. Let’s unpack how Qubetics is revolutionizing supply chain logistics, while Cronos and ICP offer unique advantages in their own right. Qubetics ($TICS): Streamlining Payments and Logistics Supply chains are the backbone of global trade, but they’re notoriously messy—think delayed payments, lost shipments, and complex international transactions. Qubetics is stepping in to clean up the mess with its No KYC, non-custodial, multi-chain wallet . Designed for simplicity and security, this wallet is perfect for businesses that want to embrace crypto without the usual headaches. Imagine you’re running an e-commerce company. Your suppliers are overseas, and they want payment in crypto. Qubetics’ smart contract conversion automatically turns crypto into fiat at the point of sale , protecting both parties from market volatility. No more worrying about fluctuating Bitcoin prices eating into your profits. The wallet also integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making it incredibly easy to use. Whether you’re handling payments on an iPhone, Android, or desktop, Qubetics ensures transactions are as smooth as butter. It’s like PayPal for crypto—but better, because there’s no middleman taking a cut. Here’s why now is the time to invest: Qubetics is in Presale Phase 11, with 1 $TICS token priced at $0.0282. Over $4.8M has been raised, with 280M tokens sold to 7,200+ holders. With a 10% price increase every week and a final phase hike of 20%, early investors could see a jaw-dropping 900% ROI post-launch. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Qubetics is a no-brainer for both businesses and individual investors. Cronos (CRO): Building the Blockchain Ecosystem Cronos, the blockchain platform backed by Crypto.com, is all about creating an ecosystem that supports DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions. While it’s best known for powering Crypto.com’s payment system, Cronos has been making big moves in supply chain management, too. What sets Cronos apart? Its interoperability. Cronos is built on the Cosmos SDK, allowing it to communicate seamlessly with other blockchains. This is a game-changer for supply chains, where different systems often need to exchange data. Imagine tracking a shipment from factory to warehouse to retail store—all powered by Cronos’ decentralized infrastructure. Cronos also shines in the DeFi space, offering low fees and fast transaction speeds. Businesses can use CRO to settle payments, stake tokens, or even participate in decentralized insurance pools. And with Crypto.com’s massive marketing push, Cronos is quickly gaining traction as a top-tier blockchain platform. Price-wise, CRO has been holding strong, with analysts predicting steady growth as adoption increases. If you’re looking for a crypto that combines enterprise readiness with retail appeal, Cronos is easily one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): Decentralizing the Internet The Internet Computer Protocol is like the rebel of the crypto world, aiming to decentralize the internet itself. While traditional supply chains rely on centralized systems that can be slow and costly, ICP offers a decentralized alternative that’s faster, cheaper, and more secure. How does it work? ICP allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that run directly on the blockchain, eliminating the need for traditional cloud services. For supply chains, this means better data transparency and fewer middlemen. Imagine tracking inventory in real-time or verifying supplier contracts without needing a third-party service. One of ICP’s latest upgrades focuses on scalability, making it more appealing for large enterprises. Its network can handle massive amounts of data, making it ideal for industries like logistics and manufacturing. Whether it’s tracking goods or ensuring compliance, ICP is showing that blockchain can handle the heavy lifting. While ICP’s price has been somewhat volatile, its long-term potential is undeniable. As more companies look to decentralize their operations, ICP is well-positioned to become a key player. If innovation and scalability are on your checklist, ICP is one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. The Future of Business-Ready Crypto As December 2024 rolls on, it’s clear that crypto isn’t just for tech geeks and investors anymore—it’s a critical tool for businesses. Qubetics ($TICS) is revolutionizing payments with its No KYC wallet, making it a perfect fit for supply chains. Cronos (CRO) is building an ecosystem that supports everything from DeFi to enterprise solutions. And Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is decentralizing the internet, offering unparalleled scalability and transparency. If you’re serious about investing in the future of blockchain, these three projects should be on your radar. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Cronos (CRO), and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for business-ready solutions.

The total value of the digital asset market rose by almost 9% to $2.54 trillion in October. Bitcoin ETPs saw their Assets Under Management (AUM) increase to $83.2 billion, while Ethereum ETPs rose by 1.4% to $10.3 billion. ETPs' AUM has risen by 102.9% year-on-year, outpacing the underlying cryptocurrency growth. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a type of ETP with stricter regulations, made the most notable contribution to this result. They have accumulated net inflows of more than $24 billion since launching in January 2024. The perpetual appeal of exchange-traded products Spot Bitcoin ETFs purport improved liquidity and price efficiency for investors, as well as more convenient access to the flagship crypto compared to other means of trading in spot markets. Bitcoin holdings are also an opportunity to diversify portfolios due to Bitcoin's spectacular rise, having recently broken past $100,000. The fees are also much lower. Expense ratios on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Bitcoin futures ETFs ranged from 0.95% to 2%, in addition to expenses generated from replacing expiring futures contracts. By comparison, the fees for the spot Bitcoin ETFs were 0.2-0.5% at launch. Grayscale's converted Bitcoin ETF was the costliest at 1.5% but still lower than non-ETP alternatives. After significant regulatory hurdles, the SEC approved Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. Grayscale is a prominent player who spent years growing a trust holding ether worth more than $9 billion. That trust was converted to an ether ETF in July 2024. The next evolution of crypto investment products Solana is emerging as the next iteration in niche investment products. Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Canary Capital, and 21shares have all announced plans to launch spot Solana ETFs. However, Solana ETFs won't launch this year in all likelihood, with hopes deferring to 2025. The US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed to at least two candidates that their applications would be rejected. Its crypto-unfriendly chairman, Gary Gensler, is likely to step down after Donald Trump takes office. ""Grayscale's recent application to convert its Solana Trust into an ETF could signal the next major evolution in crypto investment products,"" confirms Iliya Kalchev, Nexo Dispatch Analyst. ""As the market buzzes with speculation on which asset might follow Bitcoin and Ethereum into the ETF spotlight, Solana emerges as a uniquely compelling contender. Solana's burgeoning popularity makes it a natural candidate for such a transition. Known for its high-speed, low-cost transactions and vibrant ecosystem, Solana has fostered a vast, passionate community that's driving real-world adoption."" What's going to be different once Solana ETFs launch? Bitcoin ETFs have a combined AUM of over $49 billion , with ether ETFs lagging behind ($7.3 billion). This disparity reflects Bitcoin's more extended history in the ETF space, broader institutional acceptance, and its status as a ""store of value"" compared to Ethereum. Despite the gap, Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction, particularly following the 2024 launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, which allow direct tracking of ether's price. Leading products include the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, with over $4.86 billion in AUM. What would the prospects of Solana ETFs be once the SEC approves them? Solana's price hit an all-time high of $262 on November 22, but experts believe this is just the beginning. The world's fourth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap reached this record just three years after breaking its previous one, leading UK bank Standard Chartered to predict it would approach $700 by the end of 2025. The optimistic predictions come against the backdrop of bullish macroeconomic factors. Solana handled transactions worth over $40 billion in mid-November after a weekly record of $17.5 billion in March. It's not only high speed and efficiency fueling the surge. Soaring interest in memecoins should definitely not be underestimated. The number of active Solana users has risen by over 1,500% since January, with new daily addresses increasing elevenfold over the same period. Beyond riding the coattails of crypto ETFs' historical successes, a Solana ETF could bring additional momentum as the go-to blockchain for memecoin projects, as Mr. Kalchev is quick to point out: ""Solana's community has carved out an entirely new niche within the ecosystem: the memecoin hype. Unlike other blockchains, where memecoins are often seen as fringe projects, Solana has cultivated an environment where these playful assets thrive. This trend has not only spurred increased activity on the network but has arguably turned memecoins into an asset class of their own, representing the hottest phenomenon in crypto after Bitcoin itself."" The question practically begs itself: ""Could it be memecoins that have propelled Solana into the ETF conversation? Arguably so. And if Grayscale's application is approved, it could provide a fresh, accessible gateway for institutional and retail investors to tap into Solana's growing ecosystem and, by extension, the broader crypto market. It's the most inclusive market cycle we've ever seen."" A Solana ETF would gauge market sentiment and blockchain innovation Solana ETFs would be unique in their ability to measure sentiment and innovation simultaneously. ""A Solana ETF would serve as a twofold barometer: one that measures investor sentiment towards crypto at large, and another that gauges interest in Solana as a cornerstone of blockchain innovation. From the memecoin mania to its broader appeal as a fast, scalable blockchain, Solana encapsulates the spirit of the current market cycle,"" Mr. Kalchev concludes.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 10:20:00

While these crypto units are more stable than their counterparts, a recent Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC) report suggests they can pose risks to the financial markets. Specifically, the FSOC 2024 Annual Report argues that issuers lack trustworthy information about their holdings and policies on reserve management practices. The Council contends that transparency may compromise the holders and prevent analysts from making accurate market analyses. As such, the Council is urging the US Congress to discuss and pass new legislation that can regulate stablecoins and their issuers. FSOC Calls For New Regulatory Framework On Stablecoins This isn’t the first time there’s a call for regulation , and a comprehensive federal framework for these digital assets is not new. Outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also called for reviewing and passing new legislation in February 2024. Yellen’s recommendations last February were based on an FSOC report and recommendations made two years earlier. The latest FSOC report about the potential impacts of stablecoins on the financial system was released on Friday, December 6th. According to the council, these stablecoins threaten the country’s economic stability and are at risk of running due to the absence of risk management standards. The council also raises the question of transparency, which is lacking among stablecoins and their issuers. The FSOC says the lack of transparency in holdings and reserves policies will affect holders and prevent them from making an informed market analysis. Tether Remains In The Crypto Spotlight Tether remains the top stablecoin, with a $138 billion market capitalization as of this writing. While the FSOC report did not specifically identify Tether as a problem, this stablecoin has faced issues and industry scrutiny. 2/17) The potential for collapse here is greater than Terra Luna!

Even after the CFTC fined Tether for lying about their reserves in 2021… pic.twitter.com/KoJFbyjRj1 — Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) September 14, 2024 Tether has been hit for its failure to provide transparent audits that verify that its token is backed 1:1 by the USD or other assets. Some critics say Tether may collapse if it doesn’t hold sufficient reserves, which can disrupt the broader crypto market. Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons hit Tether last September 14th for its lack of third-party audits. In a Twitter/X post, Bons argued that Tether is an “existential threat” to the cryptocurrency sector,” and added that the issuer has failed to provide an audit since 2015. Calls For Legislations Intensify Aside from increased calls for scrutiny and accountability, many in the industry call for new stablecoin legislation. The FSOC is warning against the market dominance of some stablecoin issues, saying that these can disrupt the industry and may also impact the financial system. While some issuers are under supervision, many companies work outside a federal framework. As a response, the FSOC is recommending new legislation to cover stablecoins to address the potential risks and issues. The council calls on the US Congress to draft a stablecoin framework for issuers and authorize the federal financial regulators with rulemaking powers over the spot market for digital assets. The FSOC warns that if no legislation is passed, it is ready to consider other steps available to manage the risks.

This price rally follows an unprecedented surge in Ethereum Spot ETF inflows, which hit a record $428 million on December 5 as investors continue to anticipate crypto-positive regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. Related Reading: Dogecoin Days At The Top Numbered? Cardano Set To Take Over — Analyst Interestingly, this bullish momentum has seen the Ethereum price play out an interesting motion on its price chart. Particularly, Ethereum has broken above a massive triangle on the weekly timeframe chart, which points to an incoming price rally. $10,000 Target In Sight As Bull Run Builds Up Steam According to technical analysis posted on social media platform X by crypto analyst Captain Faibik, the recent Ethereum price rally has seen the cryptocurrency breaking out of the upper trendline of a triangle formation. This breakout is particularly significant, as it is out of a triangular formation that has been in play for three years. As shown by the ETHUSDT weekly timeframe chart below, the triangular pattern has been in play since the Ethereum price reached its current all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021. This pattern has been highlighted by a series of lower highs and higher lows, which have seen the Ethereum price trading in an increasingly tightening range. However, in light of the recent breakout to the upper end, Captain Faibik declared that Ethereum’s long-anticipated 2024-2025 bull run has “officially started.” In terms of a price target, the analyst highlighted a run towards $10,000, which would see the Ethereum price breaking into new all-time highs. On-Chain Data Points To New All-Time High The bullish momentum for Ethereum is supported by strong on-chain metrics, particularly a notable rise in large transactions. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the volume of transactions worth $100,000 or more has increased by over 300% in the past week, reaching a cummulative $86.15 billion in the past seven days and $17.15 billion in the last 24 hours. This surge in high-value transactions indicates growing participation from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, further bolstering Ethereum’s price outlook to $10,000. Additionally, Ethereum’s profitability metrics highlight favorable conditions for further growth. As crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out, there is nothing preventing the Ethereum price from reaching new all-time highs. As it stands, the only minor resistance level ahead is at $4,540. Regardless, with the $3,560 demand zone acting as a strong support level, Ethereum’s trajectory appears firmly tilted toward the bulls.

The Dombivli resident fell for the scam after the high-yield return on investment promised by the criminals enticed him. According to reports, the 33-year-old Indian native of Thane district subsequently reported to the police upon realizing that he had been scammed. Reports said the Indian national, whose identity remains undisclosed, was contacted via his mobile phone. The other phone number was an international number posing as a representative of a lucrative crypto investment company. The police said that the caller spent time convincing the man to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets, promising high-yield returns in a short time. Indian man falls for fake crypto investment scheme According to reports, the first contact was initiated days earlier before the man started to transfer money to the caller. He began transferring funds on November 8, and the criminal continued to influence him to make more investments before he stopped on December 3. While he trusted the criminal’s assurances, he sent funds totaling over $25,000 in local currency during the period. Things turned sour when the victim wanted to take out his earnings. According to sources, the representative stopped picking up his phone calls and stopped giving him updates on his investments after he signified his intention. Following the disappointment, the victim has since reported to the police, who have formally acknowledged his complaint. His complaint has been registered under the Information Technology Act, the regulation that covers these sorts of criminal offenses. Although the police are yet to give any major update on the issue, an official noted that investigations are already underway. He mentioned that moves are being made to track the international number to determine its origin. This would lead the police to identify the individuals or group associated with the criminal activities. Meanwhile, the official is confident that the case will be wrapped up, and that the victim will recover his funds. The surge in crypto investment scams in the industry According to sources, the police have always warned the general public on the need for caution before making investments. The authorities have urged the people to verify the legitimacy of any platform before sending funds to invest in products. India has also seen its share of increased crypto frauds , with criminals exploiting the lack of regulation to carry out their evil acts. Sources mentioned that the victims are always contacted using phishing emails, fake high yield platforms, and cold calls. This case also showcases the growing trend of criminal activities in the wider crypto industry. While the crypto sector promises innovation in the financial landscape, the activities of these bad actors are some of the few things disrupting wide-range adoption. For example, in this case, unsuspecting users are lured with the promise of high yields . In the spirit of not wanting to miss out on profits, most will invest without background checks, leading to them being scammed. Meanwhile, the police have urged residents to be cautious and stay vigilant. Residents are also asked to report all suspicious activities, messages, emails, and phone calls they may see. They also advised residents to see people with knowledge in the financial investment landscape, as they will guide them to make the right choices.

Friday’s jobs report sealed the deal, offering the Fed enough breathing room to act without looking reckless. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 227,000 in November, blowing past expectations, while unemployment inched up to 4.2%. Markets barely blinked, with CME Group now pricing in a 90% likelihood of a cut. But here’s the thing: this isn’t the good news it might seem. Critics are already piling on, accusing the Fed of setting the stage for risky speculation. Inflation is still alive and kicking, wages are climbing, and some say financial conditions have become too loose. Meanwhile, the central bank faces tough questions about just how far it can push without throwing the economy off balance. Why the timing looks shaky Economists are split, and the skeptics are loud. Chris Rupkey, an economist, argued the Fed doesn’t need to meddle, especially when jobs are plentiful. He called the central bank’s strategy “increasingly unwise” and warned that inflation hasn’t been tamed. The numbers back him up. Core inflation , measured by the Fed’s favorite yardstick, ticked up to 2.8% in October. That’s far above the Fed’s 2% target. Wage growth isn’t helping either. At 4%, it’s significantly higher than pre-pandemic norms. Jason Furman, a former Obama administration economist, isn’t buying the Fed’s optimism either. He pointed out that the pace of wage growth aligns more with 3.5% inflation, not the 2% the Fed wants. “This is another data point in the no-landing scenario,” Furman said. He predicts more rate cuts will follow, but only after unemployment climbs further. Financial conditions are looser than they look Fed officials like to call their 4.5%-4.75% interest rate “restrictive,” but financial conditions tell a different story. Stocks are up, bond yields are down, and mortgage rates have dipped. By the Fed’s own metrics, financial conditions are now at their loosest since January. This raises a crucial question: Is the Fed cutting rates in an already loose environment, and if so, what happens next? Jerome Powell , the Fed’s chair, has been bullish on the U.S. economy. He recently called it “the envy of the developed world,” suggesting there’s enough cushion to recalibrate policy slowly. But not everyone on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) shares his enthusiasm. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack wants to pump the brakes. Speaking Friday, she said she needs more evidence that inflation is heading toward the Fed’s 2% goal. Hammack has been vocal about slowing the pace of rate cuts, and her comments suggest the Fed might pause after December. If the December cut goes through, it will mark a full percentage point drop since September. That’s a lot of easing in a short time. Hammack believes the Fed is approaching the so-called neutral rate—the level that neither boosts nor restricts economic growth . She thinks it’s time to reassess. “It makes sense to slow the pace of rate reductions,” she said. The clock is ticking. Once these numbers are in, the Fed enters a quiet period, meaning no policy addresses until the meeting concludes.

Crenshaw, who has been a prominent skeptic of cryptocurrency, has faced backlash from key players in the digital asset industry. Notably, Crenshaw was one of two commissioners who opposed the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. Her stance has drawn sharp criticism from industry leaders. Coinbase president and COO Emilie Choi voiced her frustration on December 7, stating, “Caroline Crenshaw is anti-crypto. She even embarrassingly opposed Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC has to change.” Alexander Grieve, VP of government affairs at crypto investment firm Paradigm, accused Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown of forcing through Crenshaw’s renomination. He described it as “one last gift for crypto on the way out the door.” A History of Opposition to Bitcoin ETFs Crenshaw’s dissent against Bitcoin ETFs has become a focal point for her critics. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted her vehement opposition, noting that even Jaime Lizárraga, another dissenting commissioner, did not align with her on the matter. Seyffart pointed to Crenshaw’s January dissent letter, describing her arguments as more extreme than those of outgoing SEC chair Gary Gensler. Crenshaw’s criticism of the SEC’s decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs in January reflected her belief that the move was “unsound and ahistorical.” Her stance has fueled concerns within the crypto industry about the potential implications of her renomination for the future of digital asset regulation. WSPN CEO Austin Campbell went further, accusing Crenshaw of undermining the rule of law. He referenced her decision to oppose BTC ETFs even after a federal court ordered their approval. Campbell reminded Democrats of her controversial vote, emphasizing its legal and ethical implications. A Shift in SEC Leadership Looms The renomination debate comes amid broader changes at the SEC. Current SEC chair Gary Gensler, another polarizing figure in the crypto space, will step down on Jan. 20, 2025. His anticipated replacement, Paul Atkins, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump , has been received positively by crypto advocates. While Crenshaw’s potential renomination signals continuity in the SEC’s hardline stance on crypto, the industry hopes that new leadership will usher in more balanced regulatory approaches. The upcoming vote will be a key indicator of the direction the SEC might take in its oversight of digital assets.

As Bitcoin hits new highs, its ownership dynamics have shifted, largely due to regulatory changes, depicting a diverse range of stakeholders, from early miners to major companies and individuals. At the moment, Bitcoin boasts a market cap of $1.97 trillion, with 19.79 million BTC already in circulation—nearing the maximum supply of 21 million, pointing to the digital asset’s growing scarcity. Bitcoin top holders When examining Bitcoin holders, the top spot is held by the mysterious Patoshi entity, likely tied to the anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, with an untouched stash of 1.12 million BTC (5.68% of the total supply), according to data retrieved by Finbold from the Time Chain Index on December 8. Following closely are cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase , which holds 1.05 million BTC (5.34%), and Binance , which has 687,000 BTC (3.47%). Beyond custodians, institutions also hold a significant chunk of Bitcoin. The world’s largest investment management company, BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ), leads the pack, with 521,000 BTC (2.63%) held through its exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) follows, boasting 402,000 BTC (2.03%) as part of its treasury holdings. Legacy miners, such as the Unspent Coinbase Rewards wallets, contribute over 436,000 BTC (2.21%). Other notable owners include the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with 212,000 BTC (1.07%), Fidelity, with 201,000 BTC (1.02%), and the U.S. Government, which accounts for 199,000 BTC (1.01%), mostly acquired from criminal seizures, such as those linked to the Silk Road marketplace. Bitcoin top 20 holders as of December 8. Source: Time Chain Index Impact of changing Bitcoin ownership dynamic on BTC price Entities such as BlackRock and MicroStrategy have been instrumental in driving institutional interest in the maiden cryptocurrency. This interest and optimism, stemming from Donald Trump’s re-election and the anticipated rollout of crypto-friendly policies, propelled Bitcoin to its current six-figure valuation. Once Trump officially resumes office, the market will focus on potential changes to the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings. Trump has vowed to spearhead the inclusion of Bitcoin as part of the strategic reserve. This potential shift could involve a commitment to retaining, rather than selling, the Bitcoin currently held by government authorities. Looking ahead, analysts believe institutional investors are likely to help sustain Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. In this regard, Finbold reported that Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin hitting $200,000 by 2025, driven by institutional demand. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was battling resistance at the $100,000 level, trading at $99,009—a 0.7% decline in the last 24 hours. However, in the weekly timeframe, BTC is up 4.7%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding its next price movement, prominent cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe offered a mixed outlook in a December 7 X post . On the bullish side, Poppe noted that Bitcoin’s uptrend remains intact. If it successfully breaks through the $102,000 resistance, the next target is a new high of $110,000. However, investors need to be cautious, as losing the current uptrend could trigger a major Bitcoin price correction. As per the analyst, such a correction has the potential to impact the broader crypto market and trigger an altcoin rally. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s outlook remains bullish, particularly with the asset trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ). However, attention should remain on its interaction with the long-term support level at $95,000. A drop below this spot could spell trouble for the digital asset.

Regulatory developments included Trump's pro-crypto appointments and the Czech Republic's tax reforms, alongside major business moves like Grayscale's Solana ETF filing and Binance's DeFi push. Bitcoin Bitcoin ($BTC) is currently holding above $95,000 , and its imminent breakout of a short-term triangle could be up or down. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has just bought another $1.5 billion BTC, and the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also chipped in on Monday with $ 4.22 billion in BTC. From a high of over $98,000 on Monday, the $BTC price sank to a low of $93,600 on Tuesday. However, the bulls stepped in and buoyed the price back up to $96,700. Bitcoin broke through the $100,000 psychological barrier on December 5, allowing it to achieve a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. According to blockchain firm Arkham Intelligence, the United States government has moved $1.9 billion worth of seized Bitcoin (BTC) to Coinbase Prime. Altcoins Amid the highly volatile crypto landscape that includes Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), a new Ethereum DeFi coin stands out with its advanced hybrid trading platform, providing an ideal blend of decentralized and centralized exchange features. A new Ethereum-based token, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), is capturing attention, with analysts predicting it could follow Bitcoin's parabolic trajectory in the coming years. With its revolutionary innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain Protocol AI is working on combining blockchain and AI. 22-year-old internet sensation known for her viral ""Hawk Tuah"" TikTok video, Haliey Welch, is facing criticism after her memecoin $HAWK crashed 91% post-launch amid allegations of insider trading and poor management. Business Joining a competitive race amid Solana’s significant market growth, Grayscale Investments has filed with the SEC to convert its Solana Trust into a spot ETF on NYSE Arca. Web3 Backed, Chainlink, Sonic, and Fortlake Asset Management announced a partnership to tokenize Fortlake's Sigma Opportunities Fund, marking a significant milestone in taking traditional financial assets to the blockchain. Binance is making a bold move into decentralized finance (DeFi) with the launch of its On-Chain Yields program , set to debut on December 9. Camino Network is joining forces with e-money provider Monerium to advance on-chain payments in the travel industry by bringing Monerium and its popular EURe, the on-chain euro, to the Camino Network, allowing users to execute transactions for travel businesses.

Regulation The Czech Republic is working on advancing legislation to simplify crypto tax obligations and abolish capital gains tax on Bitcoin (BTC) held for at least three years starting in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump has picked former PayPal COO David Sacks as his White House AI and Crypto Czar, which is a significant step towards overhauling US policy towards crypto.

Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that at least two of the five potential issuers have been notified of the SEC’s potential rejection. Sources suggest the regulator is unwilling to approve any new cryptocurrency ETFs in the final months of the Biden administration. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas called Gensler’s stance a “parting gift” to the crypto industry. Another Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, James Seyffart, echoed that view, pointing to the SEC’s continued classification of Solana as a security or a securities offering as a significant hurdle. “If I were Gensler, I wouldn’t accept any of this. I would leave it to the next executive to sort out this mess,” he said. Despite regulatory uncertainty, institutional interest in Solana ETFs is growing, with major firms including Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital filing applications. Solana’s appeal stems from its high-speed and scalable blockchain, which should lead to significant user activity and ecosystem growth through 2024. Eliezer Ndinga, 21.co’s chief strategy officer, highlighted Solana’s growing institutional momentum: “Solana is sending a message that the smart money is coming this way.” SOL is up 160% year-to-date, further solidifying its position as a rising star in the crypto space. Looking ahead, analysts are predicting a significant shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation under President-elect Trump. New SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, a known advocate of digital asset innovation, is expected to bring a more cohesive stance to the agency. Related News: Binance Labs May Have Sold These Two Tokens After Altcoin Market Rise Trump’s pro-crypto regulatory team, which includes Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, points to a potential green light for crypto-focused financial products. Analysts like Seyffart believe that Solana ETF approval is a matter of “when, not if” under the new administration. Gary Gensler’s term as SEC Chairman ends on Jan. 20, and crypto market participants will be closely watching how the new administration handles the Solana ETF applications. Bloomberg’s Balchunas expects issuers to refile under Paul Atkins’ leadership if Gensler blocks approvals before he leaves office. *This is not investment advice.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 11:44:00

The pro-digital asset President-elect Donald Trump said at a Bitcoin Conference in July that he would create a Bitcoin “national stockpile,” adding to the US government’s existing Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings of about 203,000, which has been sourced via asset forfeitures from high-profile criminal sting operations, to ensure that the US will be “the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.” You might also like: Digital asset investors embrace a bullish optimism | Opinion To lead the US Treasury Department, one of the most influential roles in government with comprehensive oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance, and sanctions, Trump, after announcing that he would issue a USD-backed stablecoin, nominated a former George Soros macro hedge fund manager Scott Bessent who back on Sept. 16, 1992, shorted the fiat currency sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism [ Information based on my interview of Scott Bessent at Soros Management in year 2000 .] Since the US elections, BTC’s price has thrust upwards 40%, touching a record high of $99,121 on Thursday, November 21, close to the $100,000 milestone (reaching $100,000 for the first time in December). As whales sold and guppies bought the historic BTC rally, taking a cue from Scott Bessent, some BTC whales shorted MicroStrategy stock , BTC ETF shares , and BTC mining stocks too. “As the use of cryptocurrencies grows in popularity for investors, criminals are deploying increasingly complex tactics to deceive and exploit the public,” warned Wayne A. Jacobs, special agent in charge of FBI Philadelphia.

As a result of increased cybercrime, more people are becoming increasingly wary of handing over private personal data to centralized businesses due to security concerns. For example, upon downloading or signing up for an internet service, users most likely have to register some combination of the following: personal name, email address, home address, phone number, etc. However, these centralized businesses and applications have not been able to consistently securely store this personal information against hacker attacks.

Scattered Spider drew particular notoriety in September 2023 when its community members broke into and locked up the networks of casino operators Caesars Entertainment and MGM and demanded hefty ransom payments. Caesars paid about $15 million to restore its network, but MGM did not and incurred $100 million in loss of profits, according to news reports. Does Scattered Spider seem to be everywhere?

He continued: “ As this case shows, phishing and hacking have become increasingly sophisticated and can result in enormous losses. If something about the text or email you received or the website you’re viewing seems off, it probably is .” DDID networks protect against identity theft and data leaks Over 100 countries use national IDs, and many countries are exploring to operate decentralized digital identity (DDID) networks. Because identity impacts virtually every aspect of one’s life, from using online services, attending school, opening a financial account, voting in elections, obtaining medical services, buying property, securing employment, and getting concert/airline tickets. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum ( ETH ), at the Devcon 2024 event in Bangkok, pointed out that DDID networks are key to the global economy which is tokenizing, with “Ethereum [becoming] the world computer, an incredibly large and diverse on-chain economy, and an incredibly large and diverse global community…all at once.” Digital identity is one of the world’s most significant technology trends, with the total addressable market for reusable identity in 2026 estimated to be somewhere between $133B and $533B globally. Governments worldwide recognize the strategic advantages of transitioning from traditional physical identification to more adaptable digital ID systems that include reusable identity designed to keep data under the control of its owner, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and preventing identity theft. These systems allow individuals to securely control their personal data, storing it in a digital wallet on their own device and only sharing specific information with verified entities when needed, thus eliminating a central point of vulnerability where hackers could steal large amounts of data. As more governments adopt DDID networks, traditional document-based identity verification that is subject to identity theft and data leaks will move toward obsolescence.

The unique relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China has spurred innovation in blockchain-based decentralized identity systems. Launched last year by China’s official identity management authority, RealDID is a national-level blockchain-based decentralized identifier system built by China’s state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN)’s Red Date Technology, which is a decentralized cloud infrastructure company. Source: Red Date Technology The RealDID system, which uses real-name verification for cryptographic keys for both online and offline interactions while ensuring zero personal identifiable information exposure, allows Hong Kong residents to enter Mainland China and Chinese residents to enter China without providing physical entry documents. RealIDID system is expected to issue 5 million IDs through 2024. “China RealDID represents a monumental shift in how government-issued digital identity is managed, and we are proud to lead its first application trials outside Mainland China,” said Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology. As he continued: “ This milestone lays a solid foundation for anonymous identity authentication and verification across two shores, reflecting the international potential of Chinese blockchain technology to safeguard user privacy without compromising compliance. ” Tim Bailey, the vice president of global business and operations for Red Date Technology, explained to me in an interview: “ China RealDIDs can be used across different platforms and services, enabling seamless identity verification across borders. Currently, China RealDID presents the only practical and cost-effective approach to achieving privacy-preserving identity authentication and verification, which can be a blueprint for worldwide adoption, where each country builds its own national DID system, fostering both domestic and cross-border anonymous identity data exchange .” Track #2 Anonymous registration on a regulated stablecoin wallet app and Track #3 Purchase of token-based financial products with built-in tax compliance were run by blockchain firms Flare, IDA, and Red Date Technology. Source: Red Date Technology Source: Red Date Technology Tim Bailey said: “These two use cases demonstrated the China RealDID system’s ability to verify identities across borders while maintaining anonymity in know your customer and tax compliance processes. Users could sign up for regulated stablecoin apps and purchase tokenized financial products, with identity verification through China’s RealDID platform, and without submitting passport or ID document information.” “The trial showed we can blend compliance with privacy,” said Hugo Philion, CEO of Flare Labs. “We are excited to lead the way in bringing decentralized solutions to new markets, particularly China , where the potential is unmatched.” Track #4: Anonymous “Travel Rule” compliance between financial institutions. Source: Red Date Technology Through RealDID the Travel Rule compliance between financial institutions for anonymous stablecoin transfers was implemented.” Tim added: “ These four trials each tackled a real-world scenario in privacy and identity verification using China RealDID. It demonstrated how a Chinese visitor to Hong Kong, by using their China RealDID instead of a physical travel permit, was able to leverage this encrypted identity—represented by a random string of numbers—to enter Hong Kong and complete KYC, tax compliance procedures for regulated digital asset financial services. During these four trials, the Chinese visitor’s identity remained fully anonymous and was protected against any data leaks or hackers, with only designated government authorities able to link the visitor’s DID to his or her real identity after going through legal due process. ” Read more: The inevitable future of the global financial system is tokenization | Opinion",Opinion|Blockchain|China|decentralization|digital identity|Technology,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-08 11:47:30

Jon Collins-Black, a lifelong fan of fantasy novels and games, has used a portion of his early Bitcoin investments, worth some $2 million at the average BTC price today, to fill five treasure chests hidden throughout the United States. Millionaire Bitcoin investor hides crypto prizes on the map The early Bitcoin-era cryptocurrency investor went to auctions to create the unique collection of loot. Moreover, he says the treasure boxes contain rare Pokémon cards, historical shipwreck artifacts, sports memorabilia, and gold and precious metals. “I was like a kid in a candy store,” he said. Collins-Black said he was inspired in part by the treasure hunt launched by US Air Force veteran and eccentric art collector Forrest Fenn. Like Collins-Black, the larger-than-life figure self-published a book to promote the treasure hunt in 2010, “The Thrill of the Chase: A Memoir.” That hunt was for a single trove and it contained gold nuggets, rare metal coins, and valuable jewelry and gemstones. How does hunting for Fenn’s treasure compare to Bitcoin mining/or buying BTC for a risk-reward profile? Any of the lucky treasure hunters who successfully find one of the treasure boxes may come up in the money profit-wise. That is—if they don’t overspend the value of the loot they find in order to locate it. Think of it like the SETI formula for the probability of finding intelligent life on other planets. Doing The Math His book has been available now in hardcover on Amazon since Nov. 2024 for $47.44. But it’s the time and energy spent hunting for the Collins-Black treasure that will really cost bounty hunters. It wasn’t until 2020 that a treasure hunter managed to solve the hunt and find the Forrest Fenn treasure. During the ten years since Fenn launched it, there were many unsuccessful attempts to find the gold and other prizes. From 2016 to 2020, five people even died in weird accidents while reportedly searching for the Fenn treasure. A treasure hunt of this nature is a lot of fun for the blockchain sector because the way it works is much like the Bitcoin core protocol that secures money on the network and manages transaction orders. In order to harness the cost of electricity to the publicly verifiable state of an entire decentralized ledger of accounts, Bitcoin requires BTC mining computers to guess a random number by checking guesses through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Like the treasure hunters, only one will find the correct number and win the Bitcoin reward. But when it does, the miner can use that reward to defray the costs of electricity and usually find a profit left over to keep. Assuming electricity costs of $0.05 per kWh, at the current mining hash rate of $390 terahashes per second—running $8.66 of electricity through a Bitcoin miner will produce an average mining revenue of $22.48, according to CoinWarz data accessed on Tuesday, Dec. 3. That’s a 59% marginal return on investment for each unit of electricity applied.

According to sources, the bank’s approval of the ‘Policy and Regulatory Framework for Cryptocurrencies’ puts it in the role of the industry’s regulator in the country, with the responsibility of regulating and balancing its oversight with economic development. The framework details providing licenses to brokers and crypto custodians, which will be overseen by the CBI. The bank will also ensure that these firms follow anti-money laundering (AML), crypto tax, and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) laws. According to the CBI’s governor, Mohammadreza Farzin, the bank will work with agencies like the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs to create an industry-friendly regulatory framework for the crypto sector. CBI governor details benefits of crypto to Iran According to the CBI governor, the country wants to use the crypto regulatory framework to leverage the potential of the assets in the space. Minister of Economic Affairs Abdolnasser Hemmati also echoed the same sentiments, noting that the government has no intention of stifling the asset’s potential. “Attempts to impose limitations have failed. Instead, we aim to manage their risks and capitalize on their benefits, including job creation and bypassing sanctions,” Hemmati said. Hemmati mentioned that instead of looking at the negative aspect, it is better to look into its impact on the economy. He also called for support as regulators make key moves to expand Iran’s digital economy. Hemmati also urged crypto stakeholders to create a unified association that will protect their interests while helping the country expand its digital footprints. He hailed the development as a positive one that will benefit the country and its residents who wish to embrace the new technology. Over the years, Iran has turned to Bitcoin and other digital assets in the face of sanctions from the United States. With the sanctions limiting its financial scope, the country has opened up to crypto mining, albeit under strictly regulated conditions. The country, according to several reports, sees mining as a way to generate income and turn its economic situation around for good. Iran has also tried to use crypto to settle international trade, bypassing sanctions. Iran has had to deal with regulating crypto and US sanctions The crypto industry in Iran has been under regulatory scrutiny as part of efforts to prevent illegal activities. Many consider the latest framework approved by the country’s government and central bank as a set toward integrating its financial system with others around the world. Iran made crypto mining legal in 2019, urging interested miners to register for licenses to operate. The government gave the miners stringent conditions, which included paying higher for electricity, providing different kinds of identifications, and selling most of their mined assets to the government. However, in December 2021, it asked miners to shut down operations, citing the adverse effects of their operations on the national grid during the chilly period. A few months later, the government reversed course and gave the green light for miners to resume their activities in September 2022. In 2022, Iran created a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry in an attempt to use the digital asset to bypass United States sanctions. At the time, the country was sanctioned by the United States due to its nuclear program in its capital city of Tehran. It made the announcement on August 29, weeks after the country approved the import of $10 million worth of cars using digital assets. While the previous rule focused on mining activities, this new rule gives the central bank the power to oversee other crypto activities.
