The cryptocurrency with a total value of $201,400 was traced to fundraising addresses allegedly controlled by Hamas and used to launder more than $1.5 million in digital assets since October 2024. The laundering occurred through a series of “virtual currency exchanges and transactions by leveraging suspected financiers and over-the-counter brokers,” the DOJ said. The funds are currently held in a combination of at least 17 wallets. Affidavit to seize the Hamas-linked cryptocurrency. Source: US DOJ In January 2024, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, along with corresponding organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia, announced sanctions against networks and facilitators of crypto transactions linked to Hamas. Those sanctions were built on US Treasury sanctions from October 2023. In January 2024, three families of victims of the Hamas attack against Israel sued Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao , alleging that the exchange had provided “substantial assistance” to terrorists. In oral arguments, a lawyer representing Binance claimed the exchange had “no special relationship [with] Hamas .” Binance has faced scrutiny from the US government over alleged shortcomings in its Anti-Money Laundering controls. The exchange settled with the DOJ for $4.3 billion in November 2023. More regulation needed? According to a December 2024 report by the Congressional Research Service, Hamas has allegedly sought cryptocurrency donations since at least 2019, although the “scale and effectiveness” of these efforts have been unclear. Terrorist organizations using crypto for fundraising have increasingly drawn the attention of the US, with some officials questioning whether the industry needed more supervision or regulation to stop such behavior. According to a 2023 Chainalysis report, terrorism financing accounts for a very small amount of crypto usage, with illegal groups sticking to using traditional, fiat-based methods to fund operations.

This time, the spotlight was on Token2049, a prominent cryptocurrency event that is expected to attract major industry players in three separate events later this year. The alert warned members of the group to be wary of sponsors as the event approaches because conveners typically do very little due diligence on these supporters. “Just because someone is a title or platinum sponsor does not mean they are credible,” Zach wrote. Zach blow s wh istle about shady and sketchy Token2049 sponsors The report listed Spacecoin as the title sponsor of the upcoming event, but according to Zach, it is a “botted project.” Connect with @_spacecoin , Title Sponsor of #TOKEN2049 Dubai! Spacecoin is the world’s first DePIN powered by satellites, building trustless, decentralized internet connectivity on a global scale. Learn more: https://t.co/ove4Sodour pic.twitter.com/n6DMQ1rZgm — TOKEN2049 (@token2049) March 20, 2025 A quick look at Spacecoin’s page revea ls i t is aiming to be the world’s first DePIN project that is powered by satellites. It claims its “decentralized satellite constellation provides global 5G internet access to the 2.9 billion people who remain unconnected” and has lofty ambitions of connecting the world via its satellites. The term “botted” can be interpreted in a number of ways in crypto, but none is flattering. On the bright side, its name appears alongside platforms like OKX, BloFin, MEXC, KuCoi n and Binance as “title sponsors. ” The on-chain sleuth also tagged Bitunix, JuCoin, WEEX, and DWF, which Token2049 lists as platinum sponsors as “sketchy. ” Zach pointed out in his report that the teams he mentioned are the ones on his radar for now. However, he expects the list to grow longer before the first event starts in April. For the centralized exchanges that made the “sketchy” list, Zach said he checked to verify if the team is public and has a prior work history in the space. The listed platform s including Bitunix, JuCoin, & WEE X all failed this test. Bitunix, which Zach described as a “sketchy exchange,” is an actual cryptocurrency exchange registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and it offers spot and futures trading. Some days ago , a report revealed that Bitunix is being targeted by South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) for providing services to Korean customers without proper registration. The crypto platform reportedly operates Korean-language websites and provides market and customer support activities targeted to Korean investors without notifying authorities or filing for a VASP license. JuCoin, also tagged “sketchy” by Zach, is another exchange, previously known as Jubi. It may have gotten on Zach’s radar because it has a history of ownership changes, rebrand s and regulatory pivots. Ironically, the exchange announced that it had applied for its VASP license to operate in Taiwan, stating that it “is taking the lead in Taiwan’s compliance process by officially applying for regulatory licenses, implementing KYC systems. ” Another eyebrow-raiser may be that JuCoin is not regulated in the US, EU, or other major markets with strict regulatory standards, except for an exemption from Singapore’s Monetary Authority. WEEX, another sketch y company according to Zach , is a crypto futures exchange established in 2018 and registered in Singapore. The doubts about the exchange are because it is not regulated by a financial authority with strict standards. There have also been social media posts complaining of weird behavior on the exchange, such as frozen accounts and unwarranted KYC issues. DWF, tagged as a “sketchy market maker,” is a known Web3 investor and market maker, trading on over 60 exchanges and involved in high-profile investments. It may have been included on Zach’s list because of past accusations of wash trading as a market maker and the more recent rug allegation from Vite Labs. Vite Labs made the rug allegation hours ago today, March 27, 2025. The allegation was shared on the project’s X page and claimed that “the funds left for development got rugged by @DWF market making service and @binance delist decision. ” “We will only maintain the network until we can no longer support it. All roadmap plans are cancelled,” the post from Vite Labs concluded . Hi guys we want to update that the funds left for development got rugged by @DWF market making service and @binance delist decision. We will only maintain the network until we can no longer support it. All roadmap plans are cancelled. — Vite Labs 🏃🏻‍♂️ (@vitelabs) March 27, 2025 In the comments section of the post, people demanded more information on how DWF Labs may have rugged the fund s, but Vite Labs did not provide any further explanation. As for Binance, it claimed that it delisted Vite Labs’ token because it no longer met certain requirements. The wash trading allegation linked to DWF Labs came in May 2024. It accused the market maker of conducting over $300 million in wash trades across seven tokens in 2023, manipulating the price of Yield Guild Games’ native token , Y GG and other cryptocurrencies. Binance refuted the allegations, claiming that the transactions were proprietary and were free o f manipulati on while accusing the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors, leading to his termination. Binance has affirmed its strict market surveillance program and commitment to combating market abuse. The exchange has said that it does not tolerate manipulation practices and has dismissed nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of over $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past couple of years. The danger of sketchy platforms posing as sponsor s A sketch y character sponsoring an event, brand, or politician happe ns in all spheres of life, including crypto. It does not happen often at the Token204 9 eve nt but a case was recorded not too long ag o whi ch had disastrous consequences . Za ch in hi s repo rt highlighted one incident from late 2023 when a sketchy exchange known as JPEX was chosen as a platinum sponsor for that year’s Token 2049 conference. The team was flagged by the Hong Kong government during the conference as an unlicensed company with allegedly “suspiciou s features .” After victims made abou t 14 00 reports to law enforcement, about 70 people were arrested by the police in connection with the HK$1.6 billion JPEX cryptocurrenc y scand al and nearly HK$230 million (US$29.37 million) in assets were immediately frozen. The scandal was tagged Hong Kong’s biggest case of alleged financial fraud. Despite all the heat, the platform remained defiant, hitting users with an exorbitant fee for virtual asset withdrawals. Police Commissioner Raymond Siu Chak-yee later revea led the number of arrests related to the case had shot up t o 72 and about HK$228 million had been frozen. “The force has received 2,636 reports with regard to the case as of today, and the amount involved is about HK$1.6 billion,” he said. Among those previously arrested were social media influencers who had appeared in adverts for the trading platform and set up their own over-the-counter shops. These included Chan Wing-yee, Joseph La m Ch ok and Sheena Leung. We're thrilled to be partnering for TOKEN2049, a key crypto event!

Another example of a crypto project that employed this tactic is Centra Tech, a fraudulent crypto project that leveraged celebrity endorsements and event appearances to gain credibility. With its antics, it secured $32 million in funding through an ICO, claiming to offer a debit card for crypto payments. Those behind it went as far as talking about it at events, touting fake partnerships with Visa and Mastercard. The SEC charged them with fraud in 2018, and co-founder Sohrab Sharma was sentenced to eight years in prison. An even more popular example is the FTX saga. FTX, now a bankrupt exchange, used its significant political influence, which it got by sponsoring politicians, to enhance its reputation. Its form er CEO S am Bankman-Fr ied would donate millions to political campaigns in the US, including $1 million to a McConnell-aligned super PAC days before FTX’s 2022 collapse. The purpose of the spending was to keep FTX on the favorable side of regulation, but in the end, FTX was exposed for misappropriating $10 billion in customer funds, leading to Bankman-Fried’s conviction in 2023.

New processes reduce friction and simplify crypto transactions. Enhanced security and clear rules boost user confidence. This approach may widen access in underserved areas. Although Bitcoin (BTC) has long been perceived as a store of value, analysts in 2024 predicted that its next major use case could emerge in the form of payments, driven by shifting regulations and increasing infrastructure support. According to EMARKETER , crypto payment adoption was expected to grow by 82.1% over two years beginning in 2024, supported by friendlier regulations and expanding payment provider networks . Source: EMARKETER A Bitget Wallet report also highlighted security concerns as the biggest barrier to crypto payment adoption. What’s driving crypto payment adoption and what’s holding it back? We surveyed 4,599 users to uncover key trends shaping the future of PayFi Here’s the key findings from our 2025 PayFi Report! pic.twitter.com/yycmW7OcWO — Bitget Wallet (@BitgetWallet) March 25, 2025 The report, which surveyed 4,599 users, found that over 37% of respondents considered security risks the main obstacle to using cryptocurrency for payments. Other concerns included irreversible transactions and a lack of legal protection. Source: Bitget Wallet Simplifying Crypto Payments With Traditional Platforms In response to ongoing security and usability issues, some platforms have started to streamline the crypto payment process to encourage broader usage. Bakhrom Saydulloev, a product lead at payments infrastructure firm Mercuryo , told Cryptonews that crypto payments had shown consistent growth despite wider market fluctuations. “The data supports this outlook, as Mercuryo is observing steady growth in payment volumes across our ecosystem despite broader market fluctuations,” said Saydulloev. Saydulloev noted that user experience remains a major hurdle. “Many products remain unnecessarily complex, fostering friction at every step from account opening to completing transactions,” he remarked. “Beyond these issues, users simply want what they expect from any payment system: low costs, speed, and safety.” Saydulloev noted that Mercuryo had begun integrating traditional payment methods to address these issues. For example, the company partnered with Revolut Pay, a mainstream online payment platform, to make buying and selling crypto more accessible. “Revolut Pay simplifies buying crypto assets to a single click,” Saydulloev said. “The platform also has reinforced security features, including biometric technology and passcodes that secure the crypto purchasing process for users.” Crypto exchange CEX.IO has also adopted traditional methods to simplify crypto transactions. Alexander Kerya, vice president of product management at CEX.IO, said the platform recently integrated with MoneyGram to support cash-in and cash-out services for USDC. “This integration facilitates crypto cash-in and cash-out services, enabling seamless conversion of Circle’s USDC stablecoin into physical cash and vice versa,” Kerya said. Kerya added that he believes the growing collaboration between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto services is gradually blurring the lines between these two industries. Regulatory Support for Crypto Payment Adoption These platform efforts coincide with evolving regulatory frameworks that support safer adoption. Bitget Wallet’s report shows that 27% of investors are worried about the lack of legal protection. This signals the need for better safeguards and regulatory clarity around crypto payments. Saydulloev highlighted regulatory progress in the EU and UK. Frameworks such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) now allow credit institutions to issue crypto assets under their existing banking licenses. “Rather than hindering innovation, these regulations create essential trust by establishing consistent rules and protections, which are prerequisites for wider adoption,” Saydulloev commented. Coinbase has also focused on easing friction around crypto payments, particularly stablecoins. A company spokesperson noted that free USDC transfers and fiat onramps make it easier for users to send and receive crypto. Coinbase’s layer-2 network, Base, also allows near-instant crypto transactions with very low fees. Statistics from CoinGate , a payment platform, show that stablecoins are becoming a preferred method for crypto payments. In 2024, stablecoins accounted for 35.5% of transactions on the platform, with USDT making up 97.2% of those, followed by USDC at 2.5% and DAI at 0.3%. Global Demand for Faster, Accessible Crypto Payments While adoption in developed regions remains gradual, crypto payments are gaining traction in emerging markets with limited banking access. Bitget Wallet’s data showed that 46% of users prefer crypto payments over fiat due to speed and efficiency. Interest was particularly strong in Africa and Southeast Asia, where 52% and 51% of respondents, respectively, expressed interest in using crypto for payments. Rich Rine, an initial contributor at Core DAO, told Cryptonews that in developing regions, crypto is more than just an alternative—it’s often the first access to financial infrastructure. “In regions with large unbanked or underbanked populations, crypto payments are a 0 to 1 leap in trust and access,” Rine said. “It’s not about replacing a legacy system; it’s about gaining access to a system in the first place.” Rine added that for adoption to grow in the US and Europe, payment solutions must compete with existing systems that offer fraud protection and chargebacks. “This likely requires clearer regulatory frameworks – especially around stablecoins – and tighter integration between TradFi and decentralized finance (DeFi) ,” he said. For example, he suggested that banks could offer fraud protection and chargeback services on top of stablecoin rails, helping users benefit from fast infrastructure without sacrificing security. Beyond security and infrastructure, financial incentives may also shape the future of crypto-based transactions. “This adds complexity, but also introduces the idea that payments themselves could become productive, not just functional,” he said. Building Trust and Access The drive to simplify crypto payments speaks to a deeper call for secure and inclusive financial services. Traditional banks and digital providers now work side by side to build systems that users can rely on. Their combined focus on safety and usability has the power to expand access for those left behind by older models. This collaboration opens new doors for trust and participation in financial affairs. Think about how this blend of old and new might expand opportunities for you and your community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How will combining traditional banking with crypto payments alter consumer use? Integrating established banking methods with digital assets offers a smoother transaction experience. This approach combines secure, familiar processes with quicker crypto transfers, lowering hurdles for daily payments. What benefits can merchants and users expect from a streamlined crypto process? A streamlined process reduces transaction friction for both merchants and consumers. By integrating secure, known banking practices, it provides faster service and ease of use, promoting smoother digital trade. How can regulators and industry leaders work together to build trust in simplified crypto payments? Regulators and industry players must establish clear, consistent rules that merge secure traditional practices with modern digital tools. This cooperative effort fosters trust and promotes broader user confidence.

However, a new type of digital fund, yield-bearing stablecoins , is gaining traction in the industry. These tokens offer interest to investors, similar to how savings accounts in traditional banks work. JPMorgan analysts, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, believe yield-bearing stablecoins could grow massively in the coming years. Currently, these stablecoins make up just 6% of the stablecoin market. Panigirtzoglou suggests they could grow to 50% if regulatory hurdles do not slow them down. Why More Investors Are Choosing Yield-Bearing Stablecoins JPMorgan analysts say more people choose yield-bearing stablecoins because they offer interest without risk. Panigirtzoglou explained that investors do not need to trade or lend money; just holding these treasury funds is enough. These stablecoins have grown fast in recent months. Since the U.S. election in November 2024, the top five treasury-backed assets have increased in value. This includes Ethena’s USDe, Sky Dollar’s USDS, BlackRock’s BUIDL, Usual Protocol’s USD0, and Ondo Finance’s USDY. Their market cap has jumped from $4 billion to over $13 billion. As traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) platform yields have dropped, more investors are turning to them. Crypto trading platforms now accept tokenized U.S. Treasurys as collateral, making earning interest while holding assets easier. Additionally, well-known crypto projects like Frax Finance are now using these stablecoins, which is pushing the trend further. The SEC’s Approval Could Open the Door for More Growth Despite their fast growth, yield-bearing stablecoins still face challenges. They are classified as securities, which creates legal issues and limits their use, especially for everyday investors. However, things might be changing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved a new yield-bearing tokens called YLDS, which is registered as a security. This could open the door for more stablecoins like it. Traditional stables, like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, do not share their earnings with users because doing so would make them securities. That would bring stricter rules, making them harder to use in crypto transactions. More companies might follow this model with the SEC approving a yield-bearing stablecoin. Will Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Replace Traditional Ones? Unlike traditional stablecoins with a $220 billion market cap, these newer assets have lower liquidity and are not widely used. However, JPMorgan analysts believe these obstacles may fade as more traders and projects adopt them. As more traders and crypto projects use yield-bearing tokens, their liquidity could improve. This could make them widely used as collateral in crypto trading, part of DAO treasuries, or even a way for crypto investment funds to store idle cash.

After a quiet spell, the past week has brought renewed life to the market. Solana’s BONK posted double-digit gains with impressive volume, while Dragoin ($DDGN) captured growing interest with its interactive play-to-earn design. Investors are once again paying attention—not just to hype, but to tokens that offer real engagement and growth potential. BONK and Dragoin are showing they’re not just participating in the trend—they’re shaping it. BONK Posts Big Gains & Surges in Trading Activity BONK, the top meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, has staged a significant comeback. On March 24, 2025, the token gained 14.8% within a single day, bringing its price to $0.00002507. But even more notable was its trading volume, which hit $210 million—one of the highest totals across the entire crypto market that day. This wasn’t just a random bump in interest. BONK’s performance came on the back of new exchange listings, growing developer involvement within Solana, and a fresh wave of social media activity. Analysts also highlight recent token burn announcements and community-led efforts as key drivers. As BONK bounces back from a challenging earlier stretch this year, many now see it as a core part of Solana’s push into DeFi and NFTs. Still, BONK’s rapid movement reflects how quickly meme coins can respond to sudden buzz. A listing or tweet can change everything—but how long that energy lasts remains uncertain. That’s where Dragoin offers a more carefully structured alternative, built for durability. Dragoin Builds a Strong Foundation Around Utility & Engagement While BONK is making headlines, Dragoin ($DDGN) is steadily building a following. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, this Ethereum-based token is focusing on creating a lasting ecosystem. It combines entertainment with real incentives, setting it apart in a crowded field. At the center of Dragoin is a Telegram-based play-to-earn game. Players can hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens along the way. It’s not just for fun—it’s a system that turns participation into value. Users aren’t just buying and holding; they’re actively engaging, competing, and growing the network. Dragoin’s structure is another key to its appeal. It has a 200 billion token supply, with 50% allocated to a presale divided into 25 pricing stages. As each stage progresses, the price increases. Unsold tokens won’t linger—they’ll be permanently burned, increasing scarcity. The remaining tokens support liquidity, rewards, and development, with only 5% locked for the team under a two-year vesting schedule. That level of clarity and planning is still rare among meme projects. Dragoin’s next steps are already mapped out. In Q2 2025, it will roll out the full game, launch staking options, and expand with influencer collaborations. Q3 is set to bring listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, along with more in-game features. While the online buzz is growing fast, the plan behind it is focused on lasting growth—not quick spikes. Meme Coins Are Growing Up—And So Are Their Audiences The strong rise of both BONK and Dragoin signals that meme coins are evolving—and so are the expectations of those investing in them. The market is no longer driven only by names or memes. It’s about utility, community, and what comes next. BONK, already established and widely recognized, is showing how a meme coin can adapt and align with a broader blockchain vision. Its recent trading activity and increased exchange visibility suggest that it’s becoming more than just a cultural relic—it’s taking on a strategic role in Solana’s crypto growth. Dragoin, on the other hand, represents a fresh direction. It’s not leaning on nostalgia. It’s offering a hands-on experience, paired with a token model that encourages long-term engagement. The combination of gaming, decentralization, and deflationary mechanics is striking a chord with a new wave of users who want to do more than just hold. Together, these two projects highlight different paths to success. BONK reflects resilience and evolution. Dragoin, meanwhile, offers innovation and a new kind of interaction. Both are thriving—but each is writing its own unique story in the next chapter of meme coins.

42500579,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144062,1743116442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Major Crypto Seizure: US DoJ Targets Hamas Terrorism Financing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unveiling-crypto-seizure-doj/,"In a significant move highlighting the ongoing battle against illicit finance in the digital age, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has announced the seizure of approximately $200,000 in cryptocurrency. This crypto seizure targeted a digital wallet allegedly linked to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The operation underscores the increasing scrutiny on cryptocurrency’s role in funding illegal activities and the proactive measures law enforcement agencies are taking to counter it. This incident also brings to the forefront critical questions about the use of digital assets in terrorism financing and the evolving regulatory landscape. What Exactly Happened with this Crypto Seizure? According to the DoJ, the seized cryptocurrency originated from a wallet believed to be controlled by Hamas. While the immediate seizure amounted to $200,000, authorities suspect this wallet was part of a larger network responsible for laundering around $1.5 million in funds for the organization. This operation is not isolated; it’s part of a broader effort by the U.S. government to disrupt and dismantle financial networks supporting terrorist groups. The details released by the DoJ indicate a sophisticated investigation that traced the flow of funds through the blockchain to identify and ultimately seize the assets. This successful crypto seizure is a testament to the growing capabilities of law enforcement in tracking and intercepting illicit cryptocurrency transactions. Why is Hamas Crypto Usage a Concern? The use of cryptocurrency by groups like Hamas raises several red flags. Here’s why this is a significant concern: Anonymity and Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies, by nature, offer a degree of anonymity and operate outside traditional financial systems. This decentralization can be exploited to evade detection and sanctions, making it challenging for authorities to track and control financial flows. Ease of Cross-Border Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions are borderless, enabling groups to receive and transfer funds internationally without relying on traditional banking infrastructure. This ease of cross-border movement complicates efforts to monitor and intercept funds intended for illicit purposes, including terrorism financing. Lower Transaction Fees: Compared to traditional banking systems, cryptocurrency transactions often involve lower fees, making them an attractive option for frequent and large-scale money movements, even for activities like terrorism financing. Potential for Fundraising: Cryptocurrencies can be used to solicit donations globally through online platforms and social media. This fundraising mechanism can be particularly effective for groups seeking to operate outside the purview of traditional financial regulations. The recent crypto seizure highlights these vulnerabilities and underscores the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to combat the misuse of digital assets for illegal activities like terrorism financing. The Role of the DOJ in Combating Terrorism Financing The Department of Justice (DOJ) plays a crucial role in the U.S. government’s efforts to combat terrorism financing. Its responsibilities encompass a wide range of activities, including: Area Description Investigation and Prosecution The DoJ investigates and prosecutes individuals and entities involved in financing terrorism. This includes tracing financial flows, identifying facilitators, and bringing legal action against those who provide material support to terrorist organizations. Asset Forfeiture As demonstrated by this crypto seizure, the DoJ utilizes asset forfeiture laws to seize and confiscate assets derived from or used to facilitate terrorism financing. This disrupts the financial resources available to terrorist groups and prevents them from using these funds for further illicit activities. International Cooperation The DoJ works closely with international partners to share information, coordinate investigations, and extradite individuals involved in terrorism financing. This global collaboration is essential to address the transnational nature of terrorist financing networks. Policy and Strategy Development The DoJ contributes to the development of national policies and strategies to counter terrorism financing. This includes working with other government agencies and international bodies to enhance legal frameworks and improve enforcement mechanisms. The successful crypto seizure operation against Hamas is a clear example of the DOJ’s proactive approach and effectiveness in disrupting terrorist financing networks. How Does Crypto Laundering Work and How is it Being Addressed? Crypto laundering, the process of concealing the origin of cryptocurrency obtained illegally, is a growing concern for law enforcement agencies worldwide. The methods employed by criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but so are the tools and techniques to counter them. Here’s a breakdown of how crypto laundering works and the measures being taken to address it: Common Crypto Laundering Techniques: Tumblers and Mixers: These services obscure the transaction history by mixing various cryptocurrency transactions together, making it harder to trace the original source of funds. Privacy Coins: Cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash offer enhanced privacy features, making transactions more difficult to trace compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Layered Transactions: Launderers may use multiple wallets and exchanges, moving funds through a complex web of transactions to obfuscate the money trail. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): DEXs often have less stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements compared to centralized exchanges, providing avenues for laundering funds with reduced scrutiny. Cross-Chain Swaps: Converting cryptocurrencies across different blockchains can also be used to complicate tracing efforts. Addressing Crypto Laundering: Enhanced Regulations: Governments and regulatory bodies are implementing stricter regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, including robust KYC and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. Blockchain Analytics Tools: Sophisticated blockchain analytics tools are being developed and utilized by law enforcement and financial institutions to trace cryptocurrency transactions, identify suspicious patterns, and uncover laundering schemes. International Collaboration: Global cooperation among law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies is crucial for sharing information, coordinating investigations, and establishing international standards to combat crypto laundering. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies and the cryptocurrency industry is essential to develop effective solutions and best practices for preventing and detecting crypto laundering. The seizure of funds from the Hamas wallet underscores the effectiveness of these countermeasures and the ongoing efforts to refine and improve them. The fight against crypto laundering is a continuous process that requires constant adaptation and innovation. What are the Broader Implications of this Hamas Crypto Case? This particular crypto seizure case has broader implications for the cryptocurrency world and beyond: Legitimacy of Crypto Under Scrutiny: Incidents like this, where cryptocurrency is linked to terrorism financing, can fuel skepticism about the legitimacy of digital assets and strengthen calls for stricter regulation. It is crucial for the crypto industry to proactively address these concerns and demonstrate its commitment to compliance and responsible use. Increased Regulatory Pressure: Expect to see increased regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency industry globally. Governments will likely push for more stringent KYC/AML requirements, enhanced transaction monitoring, and greater oversight of crypto exchanges and service providers to prevent illicit activities. Advancements in Crypto Tracing Technology: The success of this crypto seizure will likely spur further investment and innovation in blockchain analytics and crypto tracing technologies. The ability to effectively track and intercept illicit cryptocurrency transactions is becoming increasingly vital for law enforcement and national security. Heightened Awareness of Terrorism Financing Risks: This case serves as a stark reminder of the evolving tactics used by terrorist organizations to finance their operations. It highlights the need for continuous vigilance and adaptation in strategies to counter terrorism financing, particularly in the digital realm. Actionable Insights: What Can Be Learned? For individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency, this event provides several actionable insights: Prioritize Security and Compliance: For cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, robust security measures and strict adherence to KYC/AML regulations are paramount. Proactive compliance can help prevent the misuse of platforms for illicit activities and build trust with regulators and users. Stay Informed About Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is constantly evolving. Individuals and businesses need to stay informed about new regulations and adapt their practices accordingly to remain compliant. Support Responsible Crypto Use: The cryptocurrency community has a responsibility to promote the responsible use of digital assets and actively combat illicit activities. This includes supporting initiatives that enhance transparency, improve security, and foster collaboration with law enforcement. Understand the Risks: Users of cryptocurrency should be aware of the potential risks associated with illicit activities and take precautions to protect themselves from scams and involvement in illegal transactions. Conclusion: A Warning Shot for Illicit Crypto Use The U.S. DoJ’s crypto seizure from a Hamas-linked wallet is more than just a confiscation of funds; it’s a powerful statement. It demonstrates the resolve and increasing capability of law enforcement to track and disrupt illicit financial activities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This operation serves as a clear warning to those who seek to exploit digital assets for illegal purposes, including terrorism financing and crypto laundering. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so too will the scrutiny and efforts to ensure its responsible and legitimate use. The future of cryptocurrency hinges on its ability to operate within a framework of transparency, security, and compliance, and this crypto seizure is a significant step in that direction.

Recently, pseudonymous Bitcoin market analyst Plan B ignited a fresh wave of speculation by suggesting that Bitcoin is not just valuable, but profoundly undervalued when stacked against traditional titans like gold and real estate. For those navigating the crypto landscape, Plan B’s insights offer a compelling narrative, hinting at a potentially significant upside for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Let’s dive deep into this intriguing analysis and unpack what it means for the future of digital gold. Is Bitcoin Really Undervalued? Plan B Thinks So Plan B, a well-known figure in the crypto sphere for his stock-to-flow (S2F) model, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his perspective on Bitcoin’s current market position. His core argument is simple yet powerful: Bitcoin’s market capitalization and scarcity metrics point towards a substantial undervaluation relative to gold and real estate. But what exactly does this mean, and how does he arrive at this conclusion? According to Plan B’s analysis, the numbers speak volumes: Bitcoin’s Market Cap: Currently hovering around $2 trillion. Gold’s Market Cap: A staggering $20 trillion. This ten-fold difference in market capitalization is the first red flag for Plan B. He argues that considering Bitcoin’s growing adoption, technological advancements, and its inherent scarcity, this valuation gap is simply too wide. But the comparison doesn’t stop at market cap. Plan B delves into another crucial metric: scarcity. Scarcity Showdown: Bitcoin vs. Gold Scarcity is a fundamental principle driving value in both traditional commodities like gold and digital assets like Bitcoin. Plan B highlights the concept of “stock-to-flow” ratio to illustrate this point. Stock-to-flow essentially measures the relationship between the existing supply of an asset (stock) and the rate at which new supply is produced (flow). A higher stock-to-flow ratio generally indicates greater scarcity and, theoretically, greater value retention over time. Let’s break down the stock-to-flow ratio for Bitcoin and gold as presented by Plan B: Bitcoin’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Approximately 120 years. Gold’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Around 60 years. Intriguingly, Bitcoin boasts a stock-to-flow ratio twice that of gold. This implies that Bitcoin is inherently scarcer than gold, at least based on this metric. Plan B posits that this superior scarcity should logically translate to a higher, or at least comparable, valuation. The fact that Bitcoin’s market cap is only a fraction of gold’s, despite its greater scarcity, further strengthens his argument for Bitcoin being undervalued . Real Estate Enters the Valuation Equation While gold is a traditional safe-haven asset often compared to Bitcoin, Plan B also brings real estate into the conversation. The global real estate market dwarfs both gold and Bitcoin in terms of total value. Estimates vary, but the global real estate market is often cited as being several times larger than the gold market, easily exceeding $200 trillion. Why include real estate in this comparison? Plan B’s rationale likely stems from the fact that real estate, like gold, is considered a store of value and a hedge against inflation. However, unlike Bitcoin, real estate is not inherently scarce and is significantly less divisible and portable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers digital scarcity, ease of transfer, and global accessibility. Considering the vastness of the real estate market, Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap appears even smaller in perspective. While real estate serves different purposes and has unique utility, the comparison highlights the immense potential upside if Bitcoin continues to gain traction as a global store of value. What Makes Bitcoin Potentially Undervalued? Beyond market cap and stock-to-flow, several factors contribute to the narrative of Bitcoin’s potential undervaluation: Growing Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, corporations, and even nation-states are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This institutional influx brings significant capital and validation to the Bitcoin market. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental aspect of its value proposition. This hard cap ensures digital scarcity, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust blockchain technology offer security and censorship resistance, appealing to individuals and entities seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. Network Effects: As more people adopt and use Bitcoin, its network effect strengthens, further enhancing its value and utility. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments like the Lightning Network and Taproot upgrades are improving Bitcoin’s scalability, privacy, and functionality. These factors collectively paint a picture of a maturing asset with strong fundamentals and growing adoption. If Plan B’s analysis is accurate, and Bitcoin is indeed undervalued , then the current price levels could represent a significant buying opportunity for long-term investors. Challenges and Counterarguments to Bitcoin’s Undervaluation While Plan B’s perspective is compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the counterarguments and challenges to the idea that Bitcoin is fundamentally undervalued: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Price swings can be dramatic and unpredictable, deterring some investors and raising concerns about its stability as a store of value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Unfavorable regulations in major economies could negatively impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Competition from Other Cryptocurrencies: The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with new projects and technologies emerging. Bitcoin faces competition from other cryptocurrencies that may offer faster transaction speeds, lower fees, or different functionalities. Energy Consumption Concerns: Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is energy-intensive, raising environmental concerns and attracting criticism. While solutions like the Lightning Network and layer-2 scaling aim to address this, it remains a valid concern for some. Market Sentiment and Speculation: Cryptocurrency markets are heavily influenced by market sentiment and speculation. Price movements can be driven by hype and fear, rather than solely by fundamental value. These challenges highlight the inherent risks associated with investing in Bitcoin and underscore the importance of conducting thorough research and understanding the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Undervalued Bitcoin Narrative So, what are the actionable takeaways from Plan B’s analysis and the broader discussion about Bitcoin’s potential undervaluation? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Plan B’s analysis is a valuable perspective, but it’s crucial to conduct your own independent research. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, economics, and market dynamics. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin may present a compelling investment opportunity, diversification is key to managing risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin alongside other asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Its volatility means short-term price fluctuations are inevitable. Focus on the long-term potential and avoid being swayed by short-term market noise. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency space is rapidly evolving. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and it’s essential to manage your risk appropriately. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Undervalued Potential – A Smart Investment? Plan B’s assertion that Bitcoin is undervalued compared to gold and real estate offers a thought-provoking perspective on the current cryptocurrency landscape. By highlighting the market cap disparity and superior stock-to-flow ratio, he presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s untapped potential. While challenges and risks remain, the fundamental arguments for Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition – scarcity, decentralization, growing adoption – are undeniable. Whether Bitcoin will ultimately reach the market capitalization levels of gold or real estate remains to be seen, but Plan B’s analysis certainly provides a strong incentive for investors to take a closer look and consider the smart investment opportunity that Bitcoin might represent.

Over the past 30 days, traders have deployed nearly $400 million in short-leveraged positions, preventing XRP from breaking key resistance levels. How will XRP price react in April 2025? Ripple (XRP) Stagnates at $2.35 as Traders Remain Reluctant to Sell Ripple (XRP) has delivered notable gains over the past week, largely driven by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision to drop charges against Ripple. Many market participants expected a sharp correction following the 10% rally on Monday, assuming large investors would trigger a “sell-the-news” event. However, sustained bullish sentiment, coupled with fresh volatility from Trump’s 25% auto tariff announcement, has helped XRP maintain stability. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis | March 27 | Source: Coinmarketcap Market data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Ripple price briefly dipped to $2.30 before rebounding to $2.35 at press time. This intraday recovery suggests strong buying support at current levels. $244 Million XRP Short Leverage Cluster Emerges at $2.60 as Bears Look to Avert $3 Breakout While spot market sentiment has remained optimistic, XRP derivatives data signal stiff resistance clusters that could impede further price gains. Coinglass liquidation data highlights a notable discrepancy between short and long leverage positions. Over the past 30 days, bears have placed $404 million in short-leveraged positions—30% more than the $283 million in active long positions. The most significant concentration of these short positions, totalling $244 million, is clustered around the $2.60 level. Ripple (XRP) 30-day Liquidation Map, March 27 | Coinglass This high volume of short positions at $2.60 may explain why XRP has struggled to breach this resistance level, despite strong fundamental catalysts such as the SEC dropping its case against Ripple. Whenever XRP price approaches $2.60, an influx of sell orders from leveraged short positions forces a retracement, effectively capping bullish momentum. Until short positions are liquidated or bulls muster enough demand to absorb selling pressure, XRP may continue to face strong resistance at $2.60, delaying a potential breakout toward $3. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Struggle as XRP Faces Key Resistance at $2.40, Eyes $2.00 Support XRP price remains under pressure, trading at $2.35, as it struggles to reclaim key resistance levels. The daily chart presents mixed signals, with the 50-day SMA at $2.52 acting as a key barrier to the upside, while support at $2.00 remains a critical level for bulls to defend. The declining MACD histogram suggests waning bullish momentum, as the MACD line flattens near the zero mark. This signals that buying pressure is fading, leaving room for potential downside movement. XRP Price Forecast The Parabolic SAR dots above the current price indicate a bearish trend, reinforcing the likelihood of further selling pressure. Additionally, declining volume confirms the lack of strong bullish conviction. However, if XRP reclaims $2.40 and closes above the 50-day SMA, it could spark renewed bullish momentum, targeting $2.60. Failure to hold above $2.30 could expose XRP to further declines, with bears eyeing the $2.00 psychological level as the next support. A decisive move below $2.00 would confirm a bearish breakdown, opening the door for further losses toward $1.76.

The latest report, titled “Interest Rates, the S&P 500, and Bitcoin: Lessons from the Past and Expectations in 2025,” examines historical market reactions to the Fed’s policy changes and offers important insights for investors navigating the current economic environment. Dot-Com Bubble (2000-2002): Fed rate hikes contributed to the bursting of the tech bubble, causing the S&P 500 to fall by nearly 50% as overvalued companies collapsed. Subprime Crisis (2007-2009): The S&P 500 fell nearly 57% as the Fed raised interest rates to combat inflation and excessive credit, triggering a global financial crisis. COVID-19 Crash and Recovery (2020): The Fed’s emergency rate cuts and liquidity injections initially led to a sharp 35% decline in the S&P 500, followed by a rapid recovery. Bitcoin has been volatile, but has ultimately benefited from the low-interest environment, strengthening its appeal as an alternative asset. Current Cycle (2022-2025): Divergence in Market Behavior Since 2022, the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates from near-zero to 5.5% to counter post-pandemic inflation. Unlike previous crises, the S&P 500 has remained resilient, reaching new highs in 2024-2025. Alphractal attributes this to the following reasons: Lower corporate leverage compared to 2008. Strong performance from AI and technology giants like NVIDIA and Microsoft. Expectations of gradual interest rate cuts are fueling investor optimism. However, the divergence between interest rates and stock market performance is a major concern, according to the analyst firm. Historically, such a breakout has been preceded by high volatility. Bitcoin's historical performance reveals a strong correlation with liquidity conditions: 2010-2021 (Low Interest Rate Era): Bitcoin rose from mere cents to $69,000 in 2021. 2022 Rate Hikes: BTC experienced a sharp correction and dropped to around $16,000. 2024-2025 Stabilization: Bitcoin has regained strength as interest rates have fallen slightly, consolidating its role as a hedge against expansionary monetary policy and inflation. What Happens to Bitcoin If the Fed Cuts Interest Rates? According to Alphractal, the impact of future rate cuts will depend on their nature: Emergency Cuts (Symptom of Crisis): If the Fed is forced to cut rates due to a major economic shock (similar to 2008 or 2020), initial market reactions may be bearish, with both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin experiencing sharp declines. Preemptive Cuts (Soft Landing): Gradual interest rate cuts, as seen in 1995-1996 and 2019, can support market growth, benefiting both stocks and digital assets. Market Scenarios 2025: Alphractal's Forecasts Alphractal outlines three possible scenarios for 2025: Gradual Rate Cuts: If the Fed cuts interest rates in a controlled manner without triggering a recession, the S&P 500 could maintain its upward momentum and Bitcoin could benefit from increased liquidity. External Shock: A new crisis such as geopolitical instability, banking collapse or another pandemic could cause a sharp decline in the market despite interest rate cuts. Persistently High Interest Rates: If inflation remains stubborn and the Fed maintains or raises interest rates, a severe market correction similar to 2000 or 2008 could ensue. *This is not investment advice.

The fourth-quarter GDP numbers “demonstrate that the economy is heading into this year with great momentum and profitability and is resilient to some level of policy uncertainty,” Wells Fargo economists Shannon Grein and Tim Quinlan said. But they fretted over how businesses would respond if trade conditions changed and uncertainty over where the economy is headed. That level of profitability is far above historical averages, which suggests that companies may be able to swallow persistent cost increases rather than pass them on to consumers. That could help keep inflation under control even as trade policies change. Consumer spending slows as businesses stock up Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the economy, increased at a revised 4% pace in the fourth quarter, a bit below prior estimates. And businesses raced to import goods ahead of anticipated tariffs, which helped fuel a jump in imports. The trade gap stayed elevated in February but shrank slightly from a record in January. Some economists caution that this surge of imports will lead to a slowdown in GDP growth in early 2025. Another key economic measure, gross domestic income (GDI), rose 4.5% in the fourth quarter from 1.4% in the third quarter. While GDP measures how much people and businesses spend on goods and services, GDI measures the income earned and the costs involved in producing them. Those two measures grew 3.5% on average last quarter, the fastest pace in a year. A report on Thursday showed that new unemployment claims held steady at 224,000 last week, meaning that the number of people applying for jobless benefits changed a bit. Uncertain trade policies shape 2025 economic outlook Economic growth was robust in the fourth quarter of 2024 but is expected to slow in the months ahead. Most economists are cautious about the future, pointing to shifting trade policies and business uncertainty. Even two of the most powerful investment banks in the world, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have already cut back their forecasts, citing the uncertain global trade environment as a potential drag on economic growth. In an age of surging tariffs, new trade deals, and the potential creation of additional policies, businesses are increasingly reluctant to invest and expand as they work through the unclear swamps of an uncertain market environment. These concerns have led to an update of the Federal Reserveʼs economic outlook and a recognition of the risks to growth. Some economists now expect G.D.P. to reduce in the first three months of 2025 as businesses and consumers dial back spending in the face of an uncertain economic outlook. A rise in imports in the early months of the year, partly propelled by companies stockpiling goods ahead of new tariffs, could also depress growth. If companies cut back on production or lower spending because of higher costs, that could slash more water on economic activity.

42501265,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144063,1743117638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Lightning-Fast Crypto Trading: Jupiter DEX Unleashes Signless Transactions on Solana,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jupiter-dex-signless-solana/,"Are you tired of slow crypto transactions and hefty fees slowing down your trading game? In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), every second counts, and every penny saved is a penny earned. For Solana enthusiasts and high-frequency traders, the wait for a game-changing solution is finally over! Jupiter, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, has just dropped a bombshell update that promises to redefine trading speed and efficiency. Get ready to experience the future of DeFi trading with Jupiter DEX ‘s revolutionary new feature: Quick Accounts. What are Solana Signless Transactions and Why Should You Care? Imagine executing trades on the Solana blockchain without the constant need to manually sign each transaction with your wallet. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, dream no more! Solana signless transactions are now a reality thanks to Jupiter’s innovative Quick Accounts. This groundbreaking feature leverages embedded wallets to enable a smoother, faster, and significantly cheaper trading experience. But what exactly are signless transactions, and why are they such a big deal? In traditional blockchain transactions, every action, whether it’s swapping tokens, providing liquidity, or interacting with a smart contract, requires a digital signature from your wallet. This process, while crucial for security, can introduce delays and add to transaction costs. Signless transactions, on the other hand, streamline this process by utilizing embedded wallets that handle transaction signing behind the scenes, offering a near-instantaneous trading experience. Think of it as autopilot for your crypto trades! Here’s a simple breakdown: Traditional Transactions: User initiates transaction -> Wallet prompts for signature -> User signs -> Transaction broadcasted -> Transaction processed. Signless Transactions (with Jupiter Quick Accounts): User initiates transaction -> Embedded wallet signs automatically -> Transaction broadcasted -> Transaction processed. Unpacking Jupiter’s Embedded Wallets and Quick Accounts At the heart of this innovation are embedded wallets . Jupiter’s Quick Accounts are essentially smart contract-based wallets that are seamlessly integrated into the Jupiter DEX platform. These wallets are designed to manage transaction signing automatically, eliminating the need for manual wallet interactions for every trade. This integration is not just about speed; it’s about creating a more user-friendly and efficient trading environment, especially crucial for those engaged in rapid-fire trading strategies. Let’s delve deeper into the key aspects of Jupiter Quick Accounts: Speed Boost: By automating the signing process, Quick Accounts drastically reduce transaction times. This is a game-changer for traders who need to react quickly to market fluctuations. Reduced Fees: Faster transactions often translate to lower gas fees on the Solana network, making trading more cost-effective, particularly for high-volume traders. Lower DeFi transaction fees mean more profit in your pocket. Enhanced User Experience: Say goodbye to constant wallet pop-ups and signature requests. Quick Accounts offer a streamlined, almost centralized exchange-like trading experience within the decentralized realm. Security Considerations: While signless transactions offer convenience, security remains paramount. Jupiter has implemented robust security measures for Quick Accounts, but users should always exercise caution and understand the security implications of using embedded wallets. Always do your own research (DYOR) and manage your risk accordingly. The Tremendous Benefits of Crypto Trading Speed for Solana Users Why is crypto trading speed so critical, especially on a blockchain like Solana, known for its high throughput? The answer lies in the nature of crypto markets – they are volatile, dynamic, and move at lightning speed. Faster transaction execution can mean the difference between a profitable trade and a missed opportunity. For Solana users, Jupiter’s Quick Accounts unlock a new level of trading agility. Consider these advantages: Benefit Description Impact on Traders Faster Order Execution Signless transactions minimize delays in processing trades. Capture fleeting market opportunities, execute trades at desired prices more consistently. Reduced Slippage Quicker trades mean less time for price to move against you before your order is filled. Minimize losses due to unfavorable price changes during transaction processing. Improved Arbitrage Opportunities Speed is paramount in arbitrage trading. Signless transactions provide the edge needed to capitalize on price differences across exchanges. Unlock more arbitrage opportunities and increase profitability from arbitrage strategies. Better Performance for Algorithmic Trading Algorithmic trading bots rely on speed and efficiency. Quick Accounts enhance the performance of automated trading strategies on Jupiter. Optimize algorithmic trading strategies for maximum efficiency and profitability. Addressing Potential Challenges and Security Aspects While the advantages are clear, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges. Any new technology comes with learning curves and considerations. For embedded wallets and signless transactions, users should be mindful of: Security Practices: Understanding the security framework of embedded wallets is crucial. Users need to trust the platform and ensure they are following best practices for account security. Smart Contract Risks: Quick Accounts rely on smart contracts. While audited, smart contracts are not immune to vulnerabilities. Users should be aware of smart contract risks associated with DeFi platforms. Custodial Aspects: While presented as non-custodial in the sense that you retain control over your funds within the smart contract, embedded wallets introduce a different custodial model compared to traditional self-custody. Understanding this nuance is key. Platform Dependency: Reliance on Jupiter’s infrastructure is inherent when using Quick Accounts. Users should consider the platform’s reliability and reputation. Jupiter has emphasized security in the development of Quick Accounts. However, as with any DeFi innovation, users are encouraged to exercise caution, educate themselves thoroughly, and only use services they fully understand and trust. Actionable Insights: Getting Started with Jupiter Quick Accounts Ready to dive into the world of signless transactions on Jupiter? Here’s a quick guide to get you started: Visit Jupiter DEX: Head over to the Jupiter DEX platform . Connect Your Wallet: Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to the platform. Explore Quick Accounts: Look for the Quick Accounts feature within the Jupiter interface (likely under account settings or trading preferences). Enable Quick Accounts: Follow the prompts to set up and enable Quick Accounts. This might involve creating a new embedded wallet or linking an existing one. Start Trading: Once enabled, you can start experiencing the speed and efficiency of signless transactions. Monitor and Manage: Keep an eye on your Quick Accounts and transactions. Familiarize yourself with the platform’s security features and best practices. Jupiter’s Quick Accounts represent a significant leap forward in making DeFi trading more accessible and efficient. By embracing Solana signless transactions and embedded wallets, Jupiter is not just enhancing its platform; it’s contributing to the evolution of the entire DeFi ecosystem. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of DeFi Trading Jupiter’s introduction of Quick Accounts is more than just an update; it’s a bold step towards the future of DeFi trading. By tackling the challenges of transaction speed and fees head-on, Jupiter is paving the way for a more seamless, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized trading experience. The era of lightning-fast crypto trading on Solana is here, and Jupiter DEX is leading the charge.

Bitcoin Faces Pressure After Massive Long Position Wipeout,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/are-the-bulls-still-in-control-bitcoin-faces-pressure-after-massive-long-position-wipeout/,"Bitcoin continues to show signs of price consolidation, with its value hovering just below the $87,000 mark. As of today, BTC is trading at approximately $86,990, reflecting a 0.8% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite the slight dip, the broader picture shows that Bitcoin has stabilized above $85,000 for several consecutive sessions, signaling a pause in the strong upward or downward momentum observed in previous weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $86K as On-Chain Data Points to ‘Bullish Shift’ Long Liquidation Indication For The Market While volatility appears subdued, market dynamics remain active behind the scenes. CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s latest market structure, highlighting a key development: the liquidation of $359.7 million worth of long positions. This event has drawn attention to potential shifts in sentiment and important technical levels that may act as support or resistance in the short term. According to Taha, a long liquidation occurs when traders holding leveraged long positions are forced to close their trades after the price drops below their margin thresholds. When this happens at scale, as seen recently, it reflects a sudden change in sentiment and often forces short-term sell-offs. However, Taha points out that such events can also set the stage for a potential market rebound, as many overleveraged positions are cleared, giving space for new demand to emerge. Liquidation event of $359.7M in long positions “If BTC holds above the short-term realized price, it suggests strength in demand. A breakdown below these levels might indicate a potential reversal or correction.” – By Amr Taha Full post ⤵️https://t.co/SW9e16kofW pic.twitter.com/0YR9rfreGa — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Bitcoin UTXO Metrics Paint a Mixed Picture Complementing this observation is Bitcoin’s realized price distribution by UTXO age bands. Taha notes that Bitcoin’s current market price remains above the realized price for UTXOs aged 1 day to 1 week, indicating that recent buyers are holding unrealized profits. Meanwhile, UTXOs in the 1-week to 1-month range have their realized price near $84,740—a level that could act as technical support if Bitcoin dips in the near term. This confluence of short-term holder profitability and support near $84K may serve as an important signal. If Bitcoin maintains its position above these realized price zones, it suggests continued strength from recent buyers. However, if the price begins to fall below these thresholds, it could point to increased selling pressure or a broader correction phase.

As key breakout levels loom, market watchers are buzzing with curiosity. Will these assets surge to new heights, or falter under pressure? Discover the exciting potential and hidden opportunities within the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency. Worldcoin: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Pressure The past month Worldcoin experienced a 7.39% decline paired with a 9.10% weekly rebound, indicating volatile price swings. Over the past six months, the coin has dropped sharply by 53.76%, reflecting a significant bearish trend amid persistent downward pressure. The price actions reveal a market that struggled to maintain momentum over a longer cycle while showing glimpses of recovery in the short run. These changes outline a history marked by rapid declines along with sporadic rallies that indicate the coin’s reactive nature in bearish market conditions. The coin currently trades between $0.78 and $1.62, with a key resistance level set at $2.14 and strong support around $0.46. Technical measures suggest balanced activity between bulls and bears, with no decisive trend direction. Traders could consider buying near support and taking profits as resistance nears, keeping a close eye on market fluctuations. GALA Price Trends and Key Trading Levels GALA showed a mild recovery over the past month, gaining approximately 5% with a monthly increase around 5.5%. However, it has experienced a six-month decline of nearly 21%, indicating ongoing downward pressure despite recent short-term strength. The price action has fluctuated, with various upswings from a low range. Overall, sentiment among traders appears cautious as they assess the market's direction. Current price is between $0.0129 and $0.0293, with resistance around $0.0392 and support at $0.0065. Bulls are currently testing the resistance levels while bears exert pressure, leading to a lack of a clear trend. Traders might consider entering positions near support and monitoring for a breakout above resistance, which could signal potential upward momentum. Conclusion WLD and GALA are nearing critical breakout points. Such levels suggest a potential for upward movement. If the breakout is confirmed, investors might see significant gains. Monitoring these levels closely will be essential to capitalize on the possible price surge. While the immediate future looks promising, only time will reveal if these cryptocurrencies can maintain their momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) platform Hyperliquid has just announced a significant expansion to its offerings. Get ready to dive into the world of ETH trading as deposits, withdrawals, and spot trading for Ether (ETH) are now officially live on Hyperliquid. This development marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the wider crypto community, opening up new avenues for traders and investors alike. Let’s explore what this exciting launch means for you. Why is ETH Trading on Hyperliquid a Game Changer? The introduction of ETH trading on Hyperliquid isn’t just another listing; it’s a strategic move that brings numerous benefits to users. Hyperliquid has quickly gained attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space for its innovative approach and robust infrastructure. Adding ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, to its trading roster significantly enhances the platform’s appeal and utility. But what exactly makes this launch so impactful? Expanded Trading Opportunities: With ETH trading now available, Hyperliquid users have access to a wider range of trading pairs and opportunities. Ethereum is a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, and its availability on Hyperliquid provides traders with more flexibility and portfolio diversification options. Enhanced Liquidity: Listing ETH typically attracts more users and trading volume, leading to increased liquidity on the platform. Higher liquidity translates to tighter spreads, faster order execution, and reduced slippage, all of which are crucial for efficient crypto spot trading . Platform Growth: The addition of ETH can be seen as a sign of Hyperliquid’s growth and maturity. It demonstrates the platform’s commitment to expanding its offerings and becoming a comprehensive hub for decentralized trading. Access to DeFi Ecosystem: Ethereum is the backbone of a vast DeFi ecosystem. By facilitating Ethereum trading , Hyperliquid is further integrating itself into this ecosystem, potentially unlocking future integrations and opportunities for its users. Navigating the World of Decentralized Exchange ETH Trading on Hyperliquid For those new to decentralized exchanges or Hyperliquid itself, understanding the basics is essential before diving into ETH trading . Decentralized exchanges differ significantly from centralized exchanges in their operational model and ethos. Here’s a quick rundown: Feature Decentralized Exchange (DEX) – Hyperliquid Centralized Exchange (CEX) Custody of Funds Users retain control of their private keys and funds. Users deposit funds, and the exchange controls custody. Transparency Transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, offering high transparency. Transactions are often less transparent, with order books and execution details sometimes opaque. Security Relies on smart contracts and blockchain security; reduces single point of failure risks. Vulnerable to centralized points of failure and hacking of exchange infrastructure. Regulation Operates with less regulatory oversight, though this landscape is evolving. Subject to stricter regulatory compliance and KYC/AML procedures. Accessibility Potentially more accessible globally, without stringent KYC in some cases. May have geographical restrictions and stricter onboarding processes. Hyperliquid, as a decentralized exchange , embodies these DEX principles, offering users a platform for crypto spot trading where they maintain control over their assets. The launch of ETH trading further enriches this ecosystem. Unlocking the Potential of Crypto Spot Trading with ETH on Hyperliquid Crypto spot trading refers to the immediate buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for instant delivery. Unlike futures or margin trading, spot trading involves direct ownership of the asset. With ETH trading now live on Hyperliquid, users can engage in spot trading with Ethereum, leveraging the platform’s decentralized nature and unique features. What are some key benefits of engaging in crypto spot trading of ETH on Hyperliquid? Direct Ownership: When you engage in crypto spot trading of ETH on Hyperliquid, you directly own the ETH you purchase. This ownership is recorded on the blockchain, giving you full control over your assets. Simplicity: Spot trading is generally simpler to understand compared to more complex trading instruments like derivatives. It’s a straightforward way to buy or sell ETH based on your market analysis and strategy. Decentralized Security: Trading ETH on a decentralized exchange like Hyperliquid enhances security by minimizing counterparty risk. Your funds are not held by a central entity, reducing the risk of exchange hacks or failures. Transparency and Control: DEXs like Hyperliquid offer greater transparency in trading operations. You can often verify transactions on the blockchain, and you retain control over your private keys, empowering you in your trading journey. Navigating Challenges in ETH Trading on a Decentralized Exchange While decentralized exchange ETH trading on platforms like Hyperliquid offers numerous advantages, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Complexity for Beginners: DEXs can sometimes have a steeper learning curve for users unfamiliar with concepts like wallet management, gas fees, and blockchain interactions. However, platforms are continually working on improving user experience. Gas Fees: Transactions on Ethereum and many DEXs involve gas fees, which can fluctuate and sometimes be high, especially during periods of network congestion. Understanding and managing gas fees is crucial for cost-effective ETH trading . Smart Contract Risks: While smart contracts enhance security, they are not immune to vulnerabilities. It’s essential to use reputable and audited DEX platforms like Hyperliquid, which prioritize security and smart contract integrity. Liquidity Fragmentation: While Hyperliquid aims to provide robust liquidity, liquidity can sometimes be fragmented across different DEXs compared to centralized exchanges. It’s important to monitor liquidity when engaging in larger trades. Actionable Insights for Getting Started with ETH Trading on Hyperliquid Ready to jump into ETH trading on Hyperliquid? Here are some actionable insights to get you started on the right foot: Set up your Wallet: Ensure you have a compatible Web3 wallet like MetaMask or WalletConnect. Connect your wallet to the Hyperliquid platform. Fund your Account: Deposit ETH or other supported cryptocurrencies into your Hyperliquid account through your connected wallet. Remember to factor in gas fees for transactions. Explore the Platform: Familiarize yourself with the Hyperliquid trading interface. Understand how to navigate the order book, charts, and trading tools. Start Small: If you’re new to DEX trading or Hyperliquid, begin with smaller trades to get comfortable with the platform and processes. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market trends, Hyperliquid platform updates, and security best practices in the DeFi space. Utilize Resources: Hyperliquid likely offers documentation, tutorials, or community support channels. Make use of these resources to enhance your understanding and trading experience.

Elise Stefanik’s nomination as US ambassador to the UN has greatly impacted President Donald Trump’s choice of Cabinet members. Her confirmation had been postponed because of concerns about the narrow House margins for Republicans. Trump confirmed the ruling in a post on Truth Social, saying that they had to keep all of the Republican seats in Congress. GOP scraps Stefanik’s UN nomination to preserve House majority Stefanik was nominated shortly after Trump was reelected in November to represent the United States at the global organization. Although her nomination advanced out of committee in late January, and she was regarded as one of the least controversial Cabinet choices, the House Republicans’ razor-thin majority kept her eventual confirmation in a state of purgatory for the past few months. Stefanik’s nomination appeared to make it to the Senate floor recently, especially since Florida had two U.S. House special elections in districts that Trump won easily in 2024. However, concerns about maintaining the Republican majority ultimately led to the decision to withdraw her from consideration. “We must be unified to accomplish our mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts. As one of my biggest allies, I have asked Elise to remain in Congress,” the president said. He, however, did not specify who he would propose to take her place. On the other hand, Stefanik’s office did not immediately answer a request for comment. Keeping Stefanik in the House would have provided Republicans, who control 218 seats, more flexibility in passing legislation in an increasingly divided Congress. The Democratic caucus holds 213 seats. The GOP also took notice after Democrats won an unexpected victory in a Pennsylvania state Senate special election, flipping a seat in a Republican-leaning district. Stefanik is the fourth Trump administration nominee who did not make it through the confirmation process. Former U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz was withdrawn from consideration for the position of attorney general, Chad Chronister was removed from consideration for the position of Drug Enforcement Administration, and Dr David Weldon, a former congressman from Florida, was removed from consideration for the position of CDR. Trump withdraws Chad Chronister’s DEA nomination amid conservative backlash Trump’s selection for DEA chief, Chad Chronister, also faced confirmation troubles. A couple of months ago, Trump abruptly resigned the sheriff from a Senate confirmation position and removed his name from the list of candidates for the job. Consequently, Chronister shared an X post stating that he had turned down the offer, calling it the honour of a lifetime. Without going into further detail, Chronister wrote, “Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I have concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.” Trump explained on his social media account, Truth Social, that Chronister resigned suddenly because he did not agree with what the sheriff had told his pastors and other supporters. Some conservatives criticized Chronister for his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic and for claiming that his office was not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Deep altcoin dips could spark a reevaluation of risk, prompting a realignment of strategies. Investors might soon favor assets with stable fundamentals and robust network support. The top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization lost a combined $659 billion between January and March 2025, according to a Thursday report by CryptoQuant . Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) took the hardest hits during the downturn, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) showed more stable performance. XRP, which saw a surge earlier in the cycle, failed to maintain its gains. CryptoQuant: BTC and BNB Withstand Market Pressure CryptoQuant’s analysis showed that BTC and BNB weathered the market drop better than their peers. Each asset declined by around 20% from its most recent all-time high, marking a milder correction compared to the rest of the top five. BNB’s stability is particularly notable, as it has maintained a consistently shallow drawdown range throughout the observed period. This resilience is partly driven by practical utility across the Binance ecosystem, all of which require users to actively hold BNB. ETH and SOL… pic.twitter.com/9d6CagU2jY — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Their relative strength stood in contrast to the sharp pullbacks seen in Ethereum and Solana, both of which saw more severe losses. XRP, despite a market cap rally following the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, also slipped behind in recent weeks. ETH/BTC Ratio Fell 72% Since September 2022, CryptoQuant Data Shows Another key metric highlighted in the report is Ethereum’s falling value relative to Bitcoin. Since September 2022, the ETH/BTC ratio has dropped by 72%, reaching its lowest level since January 2020. Historically, such dips have sometimes preceded a reversal, but for now, Ethereum remains under pressure against Bitcoin. Mixed Signals from XRP Performance XRP experienced a sharp rise in market capitalization following regulatory optimism in late 2024. Its valuation jumped from $30 billion in early November to $141 billion by March 2025. This growth was supported by increased activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), where active addresses spiked from 15,000 to 109,000. However, that momentum has since faded. As of now, daily active addresses have settled between 20,000 and 40,000, based on CryptoQuant’s latest data. The report paints a clear picture of how leading digital assets are moving in different directions. While Bitcoin and BNB have held their ground more effectively, ETH, SOL, and XRP have struggled to keep pace. CryptoQuant’s findings underscore the uneven impact of the current market correction and suggest that the next few months could be key in determining whether these trends deepen or reverse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What might this divergence mean for crypto’s long-term structure? The split may drive a reallocation of capital toward coins that deliver steady network metrics and lower volatility, potentially redefining market norms and investment strategies. How could these corrections influence risk management in crypto portfolios? Investors might adopt more disciplined approaches by diversifying holdings and emphasizing assets with proven fundamentals, leading to a strategic reassessment of exposure and risk tolerance. Which emerging trends could gain favor as portfolios are rebalanced? Expect growing interest in projects that blend strong network effects with scalable, low-cost solutions, attracting long-term capital and sparking renewed innovation in blockchain protocols.

The bloc’s decision comes after Washington slapped a 25 percent tariff on the car industry and hinted at further measures next week. One EU diplomat told FT, “The Americans think that they are the ones with escalation dominance [in the trade war], but we also have the ability to do that,” stressing that the ultimate goal is to de-escalate tensions and reach a comprehensive trade deal. Officials believe that by targeting services where the US shows vulnerability, they can force Washington to come to the negotiating table. Brussels had already responded by imposing extra duties on up to €26 billion of US goods following tariffs on steel and aluminum. However, European officials say the scale of the Trump administration’s actions has forced the EU to consider using even more powerful trade tools. The EU’s legal framework targets intellectual property and contracts Under its Enforcement Regulation, strengthened in 2021 after an earlier trade dispute, the EU has the power to suspend intellectual property rights and exclude companies from public procurement contracts. A potential fightback might involve restrictions on the intellectual property rights of major tech companies. This could include a ban on Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite network from winning government contracts. In fact, Italy is already rethinking its plans to acquire the system. “Services is where the US is vulnerable,” said a second diplomat. Moreover, Washington ran a €109 billion trade surplus with the EU in services in 2023, compared with a €157 billion deficit in goods. Economic risks and negotiation challenges loom ahead While some European diplomats are optimistic about reaching a deal quickly, they acknowledge that such an agreement would not automatically remove all the extra tariffs imposed by the US. “The view is that we have to respond. It is the only way to get a deal,” said a third EU diplomat, adding that previous attempts to talk had failed. Since the EU’s exports far outstrip its imports, the bloc would find it difficult to match the US tariffs on goods. Moreover, Brussels does not want to risk cutting off gas supplies from the United States, which are vital to the continent’s energy needs. “There are only so many goods imports from the US that the EU can target before that damages the economy too much,” explained David Henig from the European Centre for International Political Economy. “If you don’t want to target energy, there’s a limit to what can be done on goods. Whereas on services there is greater room for retaliation without so much harm to the economy.” Some experts argue that the EU might need to use its anti-coercion instrument, the “trade bazooka,” to inflict even more economic pain on the US. This tool could allow the European Commission to restrict activities by US banks, revoke patents, or prevent companies from receiving revenues from software updates or streaming. “I would advise the European Commission to use the ACI,” said Ignacio García Berrero, a former senior commission official who led negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a deal that was never finalized. Any retaliatory measures would be drafted by the European Commission but must gain the approval of a weighted majority of member states. EU countries are still negotiating the goods retaliation list that was drawn up in response to Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. For example, France has pressed for bourbon whiskey to be removed from the list to protect its own drinks industry. The commission has postponed measures covering jeans, motorcycles, and possibly soyabeans until April 12. These measures will be discussed with national leaders before a final decision is made. Diplomats and officials also noted that more tariffs on googs could be on the table in response to any US reciprocal tariffs expected from the White House next week . Brussels estimates these tariffs could be around 20 percent and might hit aircraft, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products.

It was a calculated attempt to put an end to the industry,” Marszalek said in a March 27 X post. ”The fact that we not only persevered but became stronger is a testament to our vision and the community supporting it. Onwards!” It comes seven months after the SEC issued a Wells notice to the crypto platform in August, signaling its intention to take legal action against the firm. We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com,” added Crypto.com’s chief legal officer Nick Lundgren in a March 27 statement, which accused the previous administration of abusing its authority to harm the crypto industry. Source: Kris Marszalek Crypto.com had filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October, two months after the Wells notice, accusing the Gary Gensler-led commission of overstepping its authority and taking a “misguided” approach to crypto regulation. SEC continues to roll back previous enforcement actions Crypto.com’s announcement follows a wave of other crypto investigations and lawsuits dropped by the SEC over the last five weeks, which affected the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap, OpenSea and more recently, Immutable. The SEC also dismissed its civil enforcement action against crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW with prejudice on March 27. Related: Ripple will drop cross-appeal in SEC case, get refund from lower court ruling The SEC has adopted a far friendlier approach since Mark Uyeda started leading the commission as acting chair on Jan. 20 after the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler.

It also canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets on Jan. 23.

Ethereum Supply Drops & ADA Awaits Breakout,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdags-path-to-1-gains-clarity-after-recent-ama-ethereum-supply-drops-ada-awaits-breakout/,"Ethereum supply on exchanges has fallen to a level not seen in nearly ten years, yet price action remains lackluster, sparking renewed discussions in the ongoing Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) also sits in a cautious zone, with its next movement depending on a critical technical breakout. In contrast to these slow-moving scenarios, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gathering strong traction. Its recent AMA revealed detailed plans for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) along with a rollout to 10 major exchanges. As a result, analysts now expect BDAG to potentially reach $1 by 2025—positioning it among the best crypto to buy right now. Ethereum Market Shows Mixed Signals as Exchange Supply Declines The ongoing Ethereum (ETH) market analysis points out that ETH holdings on centralised exchanges have reached the lowest point since 2015, hinting at a growing trend toward holding and staking. With just 8.97 million ETH remaining on exchanges, Santiment data indicates a 16.4% decrease over the past seven weeks. Still, ETH’s value has dropped nearly 47% from its peak last December. Technical signals remain weak, with Ethereum struggling to clear major resistance zones. Slower fee revenue, lower DeFi usage on the mainnet, and increasing competition from layer-2 platforms have all contributed to a blurry short-term picture for Ethereum. Cardano Price Prediction Depends on Crucial Breakout Zones Current Cardano (ADA) price prediction sees limited clarity as ADA trades near $0.72, falling 2% in the past day. A 25% dip in trading volume also signals decreased trader interest. Analysts note a symmetrical triangle forming, suggesting the next move could decide ADA’s near-term direction. From a technical viewpoint, the Cardano price prediction depends on a breakout. Moving past $0.74 could open the way to $0.83, while slipping under $0.70 could lead ADA toward $0.65. Liquidation zones at $0.71 and $0.73, as shown by on-chain metrics, reflect strong indecision among market players. BlockDAG Eyes $1 Mark as TGE Plans Go Viral in Recent AMA BlockDAG’s latest AMA revealed a full breakdown of what many are calling one of the most well-prepared launches in today’s crypto space. The team outlined specific steps for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE), setting the stage for its official market debut. Among the key updates, BDAG will be fully tradable shortly after TGE. Work is already underway to ensure listings on 10 well-known centralised exchanges, including top-tier platforms that could drive stronger volume and attention. This upfront strategy has boosted confidence. Since the announcement, presale activity has surged. BlockDAG has now collected more than $207 million, with over 18.9 billion BDAG coins sold across 27 separate presale rounds. These milestones point to growing belief from the market, as many are eager to grab BDAG before it becomes openly available. This demand continues to push BDAG into the spotlight as the best crypto to buy right now. Outlook for BDAG remains positive. The coin has jumped 2380% already—from $0.001 in early rounds to $0.0248 in the current batch. Forecasts now suggest BDAG could reach $1 in 2025, supported by a clear rollout plan, planned listings, and solid early performance. This places BlockDAG among the top breakout projects under watch before it fully enters the market. Final Take! Ethereum’s reduced exchange supply signals long-term confidence, but weak price action still clouds its outlook, as outlined in the latest Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Cardano continues to hover in a narrow range, with any breakout likely to shape the short-term Cardano (ADA) price prediction. On the other hand, BlockDAG appears to be entering a new phase of rapid development. With its Token Generation Event strategy clearly outlined and exchange listings in progress, BDAG is building strong momentum. Analysts predict it could hit $1 in 2025, and with its current presale price at $0.0248, BDAG is now widely seen as the best crypto to buy right now.

Lookonchain notes on the social media platform X that the whale spent $5 million worth of Circle’s stablecoin, USDC , to buy TRUMP right after President Donald Trump posted “I LOVE $TRUMP” on his social media platform Truth Social. The whale then sold the TRUMP stash an hour later, booking a $207,000 loss. However, the loss pales in comparison to gains the whale made earlier this year when it spent 1.09 million USDC to buy 5.97 million TRUMP and booked a $108 million profit, according to Lookonchain. The president launched the Official Trump memecoin in mid-January, days before he took office. The asset has generated controversy in and out of crypto circles, raising questions of corruption in an already heavily questioned administration. Even Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said in January that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued TRUMP could be a violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

33767162,[object Object],1743120039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Bet Grows Bigger: The Blockchain Group Snaps Up 580 BTC,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bet-grows-bigger-the-blockchain-group-snaps-up-580-btc/,"The Blockchain Group, a France-based blockchain solutions firm, recently announced its largest Bitcoin (BTC) purchase to date, acquiring 580 BTC. This marks the company’s third BTC acquisition since it began buying the digital asset in November 2024. The Blockchain Group Buys 580 Bitcoin In its most significant BTC acquisition so far, The Blockchain Group has purchased 580 BTC for approximately $50.64 million at an average price of $88,020 per coin. According to the announcement, the purchase was made through its Luxembourg-based subsidiary. Notably, the acquisition was financed through proceeds raised from a convertible bond issuance announced on March 6. The move aligns with the firm’s Bitcoin Treasury strategy. To recall, The Blockchain Group made its first BTC purchase in November 2024, acquiring 15 BTC at an average cost of $68,785 per coin. Its second purchase followed in December 2024, when it bought 25 BTC at an average price of roughly $97,692. Following its latest acquisition, the company’s total BTC holdings now stand at 620 BTC, with a total net asset value of slightly over $54 million at current market prices. According to data from Yahoo! Finance, The Blockchain Group’s stock (ALTBG.PA) closed today’s trading session at €0.4975 ($0.54), up 3.09% on the day. On a year-to-date basis, the company’s shares have surged by an impressive 65.78%, suggesting that its exposure to BTC has positively impacted its valuation. The Blockchain Group’s official website states that its pivot to Bitcoin is part of a broader strategy to optimize the use of its excess cash and financial instruments. Since its first BTC acquisition, the company’s stock has risen by 225%. Corporate BTC Adoption To Grow In 2025 Corporate adoption of Bitcoin is expected to pick up even further in 2025, driven not only by the digital asset’s intrinsic value but also by a favorable regulatory environment under pro-crypto US President Donald Trump’s administration. Earlier this week, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, Strategy, acquired an additional 6,911 coins, pushing its total holdings beyond 500,000 BTC. In the same vein, US-based financial services firm Fold Holdings announced the addition of 475 BTC to its corporate treasury earlier this month. As corporate adoption grows, several US states have also begun legislative processes to add BTC to their treasuries. For instance, Utah and Kentucky have recently made significant strides with their BTC reserve bills. Additionally, Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas recently revealed that close to 70% of his investment portfolio is allocated to Bitcoin and related assets. At press time, BTC trades at $86,838, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital currency|Strategy|the blockchain group,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-28 00:00:39

People are looking beyond flashy price charts. What they really want are the best crypto projects in 2025—ones with strong real-world use, powerful tech, and the chance for real growth. That’s why attention is turning to four key names: BlockDAG, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Each of these coins has its own strengths, and if current trends continue, they could see strong gains soon. BlockDAG: Is This the Next $1 Coin by 2025 with 3932% Growth? BlockDAG (BDAG) ranks high among the best crypto projects in 2025. It runs on a smart system called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which allows transactions to take place at the same time—no delays or traffic issues. This leads to faster processing and smooth performance, making it a great choice for developers building fast and reliable decentralised apps. In its presale, BlockDAG has brought in more than $207 million. A total of 18.9 billion BDAG coins have already been sold. At batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, and those who joined early have seen a return of 2,380%. Analysts say BDAG might reach $1 in 2025, which would be a 3,932% increase from where it is now. With the mainnet expected later this year and ten confirmed CEX listings in 2025, BlockDAG is seen as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 for early access to high returns. XRP: Designed for Fast, Large-Scale Transfers XRP continues to gain ground as a top name in digital payments. The United Nations has mentioned XRP in relation to a possible cashless global system. There is even speculation about Donald Trump possibly including it in a US crypto reserve. Maximilian Staudinger, a well-known analyst, suggested XRP could help unlock $1.5 trillion from Nostro accounts used for cross-border payments. What makes XRP one of the best crypto projects in 2025 is its speed and ease of use. Some believe it may become part of official global reserves, and the interest around this continues to rise. It hasn’t yet broken past $3, but the selling pressure is lower now, with an RSI of 34. In the past 24 hours, XRP moved up 12.4%, now priced at $2.53. It’s showing steady movement, and many are watching to see if it can finally cross that $3 line. Solana (SOL): Potential ETF Launch May Drive 2025 Growth Solana’s strong point is its role as a fast and cheaper option compared to Ethereum. Since its 2020 launch, it has reached a market cap of $65.6 billion. Talks are going on about the SEC allowing spot ETFs for Solana in 2025, which could draw in users from traditional finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum have ETF approvals already, so some believe Solana could be next. Its price has fallen around 50% since its $260 high in January, mostly due to broader market conditions. The RSI is now at 57 and is moving slowly upward, suggesting demand is cooling for now. Still, many see Solana as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 if ETF approval happens and market activity rises again. Cardano (ADA): Focused on Careful Growth and Clear Plans Cardano, with its $25.2 billion market value, is aiming to grow as a serious option alongside Ethereum and Solana. There’s talk that Trump might also include ADA in the US crypto reserve idea. Charles Hoskinson, who co-created Ethereum, started Cardano in 2014 to offer something more stable and well-planned. One reason many view ADA as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 is the team’s open way of working. Right now, ADA is staying around the $0.70 level with resistance at $1 and $1.10. These price levels show a slow but steady path. Its mix of clear growth, stability, and detailed progress has made ADA a strong option to follow. Best Crypto Projects in 2025– Final Remarks! Looking toward 2025, XRP is building a real use case in payments and may benefit from political moves. Solana is waiting for ETF chances, and Cardano keeps improving steadily with on-chain upgrades. However, BlockDAG stands out. With over 2,380% gains already and a price of $0.0248 in batch 27, many believe it could hit $1. A return of 3,932% would make it one of the best crypto projects in 2025 for those aiming for early growth with long-term value. It’s showing clear signs of being ready for the next big move.

The cloud provider sold 37.5 million shares at $40 each. It had initially planned to sell 49 million shares at $47 to $55 each, but a weaker-than-expected stock market posed difficulties for the company. The company initially sought to raise $4 billion at a $35 billion valuation, reporting $1.9 billion in revenue last year but still seeing a net loss of nearly $900 million. AI powerhouse Nvidia, an investor in CoreWeave, is anchoring the IPO with a $250 million order, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. CoreWeave is closely tied to bitcoin miner CoreScientific, which struck a multi-billion deal with the New Jersey-based firm to expand its artificial intelligence capabilities. Nvidia's own stock price is down 12% since the beginning of the year, The Information reported late Thursday, reflecting broader weakness in AI-focused firms.

President Donald Trump appears open to a deal that leaves some involvement for the Chinese company. Lawmakers such as Michigan Republican John Moolenaar have warned that any arrangement giving ByteDance continued control is a grave threat to US security and a violation of American law. At a TikTok Coalition event on Thursday, Moolenaar said, “Any deal that allows ByteDance to maintain control of TikTok is a grave threat to our security and a violation of US law. If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal – plain and simple.” Recent reports indicate that a prospective deal would allow ByteDance to retain a stake in TikTok. Under the proposal, data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle. The move is part of talks led by the White House, centered on a “qualified divestiture.” The law mandates that a foreign adversary must no longer control the app, defined as holding a stake of 20 percent or more, while leaving room for the president to set the terms. President Trump is eager to “save” the app and would go to extra lengths. He has not clearly stated whether he would support ByteDance having a partial role in TikTok. On Wednesday, he said he might lower tariffs on China to secure Beijing’s support and would consider extending the April 5 deadline if no agreement is reached. Trump talks about the TikTok deal at the Oval Office. Source: Bloomberg The law originally set the deadline as January 19 with a one-time 90-day extension for progress, and Trump had extended it on his first day in office after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The forced sale law, passed last year as part of a foreign aid package, was enacted amid concerns that TikTok’s Chinese ownership might allow Beijing to conduct influence operations against the United States. While the law mandates a divestiture, free speech advocates warn that a ban would restrict Americans’ access to foreign media. It would violate the First Amendment. The Supreme Court upheld the law in January, maintaining pressure on TikTok to separate from its Chinese owner. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts stated that the US intelligence community had “no information” that ByteDance manipulated TikTok content to favor the Chinese government. On Monday, Markey, along with Senators Cory Booker and Chris Van Hollen, sent a letter urging Trump to work with Congress on a legal basis for any extension. Earlier this year, they and Representative Ro Khanna of California introduced a bill to extend the original January 19 deadline by 270 days. Some Republicans want pure TikTok divestiture Florida Republican Representative Kat Cammack called for “an absolute pure divestiture” on Thursday. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, known as one of the strongest supporters, has yet to firmly take a stand on the need for complete divestiture, with reports indicating he is allowing the White House to handle the negotiations. When asked about President Trump’s recent remarks, Guo Jiakun, spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Beijing has stated its position on TikTok on multiple occasions. He added that China’s opposition to extra tariffs is “consistent and clear.” In January, China’s foreign ministry also expressed openness to a TikTok deal, noting that acquisitions should be “decided independently by companies” according to the law. Some reports have suggested that TikTok’s algorithm may be subject to export controls by China’s commerce ministry.

The company’s revised investment policy now permits a portion of its corporate treasury and future borrowings to be invested directly into Bitcoin and stablecoins. Despite declining net sales, GameStop holds significant liquidity, reporting cash reserves of $4.77 billion as of February. This strategic pivot aligns closely with previous Bitcoin adoption moves by firms such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, both of which have seen notable stock appreciation after similar announcements . An announcement regarding Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/gG8JRarIok — GameStop (@gamestop) March 25, 2025 GameStop’s Bitcoin investment further validates the cryptocurrency’s growing appeal among corporate treasuries, potentially attracting broader institutional participation and strengthening Bitcoin’s market position. MicroStrategy’s Growing Bitcoin Ambitions MicroStrategy, now operating as Strategy, could accumulate more than one million Bitcoin by 2033—equating to nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply—according to analysts at Bernstein. Currently, the firm owns approximately 506,137 Bitcoin, purchased at an average cost of $66,608.

Bernstein forecasts Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by 2025 and possibly $1 million by 2033, driven by supportive monetary policies and strong capital markets. Under bullish market conditions, Strategy’s holdings could reach 5.8% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Strategy’s continued Bitcoin accumulation underscores institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Nonetheless, short-term volatility persists, with Bitcoin recently trading around $86,982, down 1.33% in the past 24 hours. U.S. Government Accelerates Digital Payment Transition President Donald Trump mandated a complete transition to digital federal payments by September 30, 2025, aiming to eliminate paper-based transactions. The administration expects annual taxpayer savings of approximately $657 million through reduced fraud and administrative costs. #ACH $SHx #Stronghold #NACHA Executive Orders March 25, 2025 Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account – Effective September 30, 2025 Read this: (e) The Secretary of the Treasury shall support agencies’ transition to digital payment methods, including… pic.twitter.com/Fs5dyq5FAb — Cpt. X (@DebunkJelpi) March 27, 2025 The executive order emphasizes electronic fund transfer (EFT) methods, including digital wallets, direct deposits, and debit cards, explicitly ruling out the adoption of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Trump’s administration maintains a clear stance against government-controlled digital currencies. This move toward digital payments may indirectly support increased Bitcoin adoption, as users shift toward decentralized digital assets rather than centralized digital currencies. Bitcoin Price Technical Outlook Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is consolidating near $87,220 within a symmetrical triangle formation on the 2-hour chart. Price action maintains key support at $86,800, reinforced by the 50-period EMA. Immediate resistance at $88,800 limits upside momentum, and a confirmed breakout above this level could target $90,750 and $92,800. On the downside, critical support levels remain at $86,400 and $84,870, with a sustained move below these zones potentially opening the door to $83,200. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral at 51, signaling balanced market sentiment. Traders should monitor volume closely to confirm the next major directional move.

Analyst Says A Weekly Close Above This Level Would Trigger A Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-imminent/,"The crypto market is still trying to recover from its crash in early March, and sentiment is currently fluctuating. Although the Fear & Greed Index is still in the fear zone, the Bitcoin price is now slowly pushing back toward $90,000, which has been slowly changing the sentiment among altcoins. Rekt Capital, an influential analyst on X, reignited hope for an incoming altcoin season with a key technical signal. According to the post, a breakout in the altcoin market cap could soon take shape if one critical condition is met. The analyst shared a chart and commentary suggesting that the next major rally may already be in motion, provided that the altcoin market cap can secure a weekly close above a particular level. Weekly Close Above $250 Billion Could Be The Game Changer The altcoin market cap reached a multi-month low in the first week of March after the crash that saw many cryptocurrencies shell out weeks of price gains within a short period. This crash briefly pushed the altcoin market cap below $200 billion, although it eventually closed the week above this threshold. However, this market cap has steadily been inching upwards in the last two weeks since the crash. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Calls Start Of The Altcoin Season With A Caveat At the time of writing, the altcoin market cap has risen back to around $249 billion. Technical analysis from crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that a weekly close above the $250 billion mark would mark a significant technical shift for alts. This level, highlighted in blue on the chart below, will be an important resistance level for crypto investors waiting for the altcoin season. The analyst noted that a decisive close above it would likely precede a breakout rally toward the $315 billion level, marked in red. That move wouldn’t just signal short-term bullishness; it would also serve as confirmation that the bottom for altcoins has already been established. However, even if the altcoin market cap were to surge quickly towards $315, there would still be some work to do to return in order to the recent high of $451 billion set in December 2024. Shallow Correction Points To Stronger Momentum Ahead For Altcoin The nature of the current correction from this $451 billion altcoin market cap adds more weight to the possibility of an altcoin rally. According to the analyst, the ongoing correction has only reached a 55% drawdown from its local high, notably shallower than the previous major altcoin bear market retracements of 69% and 85%. Related Reading: Altcoins Season: Recent Crypto Dip Shows Decline May Be Over And Bulls Are Taking Charge The shallower decline in the current retracement is interpreted as a sign of growing market maturity among altcoins. This implies that the selling pressure may be waning and that bulls are preparing for a stronger push. It also means that the $425 billion altcoin market cap resistance is weakening as a point of rejection, which in turn increases the chances of a breakout at the next visit.

Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit, Lummis emphasized that Bitcoin’s scarcity , immutability, and storability make it a strong long-term asset for national stability. “If we hold for 20 years — according to the best available models — we could reduce our national debt by half,” she said, referring to the country’s eye-popping $36 trillion debt. Saylor and Lummis push for Bitcoin as America’s strategic reserve Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor , also sparked discussion at the summit, going so far as to say during his discussion with Lummis that Bitcoin is the “Manifest Destiny for the United States of America.” Lummis also argued for creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve, stressing that it should be treated similarly to current national reserves. “We have a strategic oil reserve, we have a strategic gold reserve, we have a strategic cheese reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold,” she said. Lummis also pointed out this classic way of the government converting mineral wealth into cash possessed by the government, which then invests it into diversified assets that still generate cash. She views Bitcoin as a next-generation answer to an ancestral monetary problem. “I’ve kind of been looking for the Bitcoin strategic reserve my whole life,” Lummis added, clarifying that she believes it’s Bitcoin that will shape the country’s economic destiny. Saylor’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic asset resonated beyond the summit. Within an hour of his statement being posted on X, Bitcoin saw a 0.11% increase, reaching $87,273.47. The asset’s market capitalization grew by 0.09% at press time. The market’s reaction indicated a big change in sentiment, with the Fear and Greed Index rising from a complacent 50 to a “Greed” status of 65. Witnessing this in such a short timeframe demonstrates Bitcoin’s impact not just beyond political discourse but also in terms of market dynamics. Saylor stands firm on $13 Million Bitcoin prediction, calls it the ultimate store of value Just recently, Saylor doubled down on his claim that Bitcoin’s price will go to $13 million over 20 years. While addressing the Digital Asset Summit, Saylor emphasized Bitcoin’s unique qualities as a scarce digital commodity, arguing that no other asset can compare. “I can stand here and I can tell you that I think the price of Bitcoin will go to $13 million over 20 years. I couldn’t say that about a security, right?” Saylor declared, highlighting Bitcoin’s legal status as a commodity rather than a security. According to Saylor, Bitcoin is the only asset immune to human corruption. He refers to its origin as a product of what he calls an “immaculate conception.” He noted that, unlike traditional commodities like gold or oil, which can be extracted in greater quantities when prices rise, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it the ultimate store of value. Bitcoin bears seize opportunity as bullish bets weaken ahead of $16.5B options expiry On March 28, bitcoin investors are preparing for the all-time high $16.5 billion monthly options expiry. Despite this, the real impact on the market would be low, with BTC dropping below $90,000 before blindsiding investors and invalidating many bullish positions. This transition offers Bitcoin bears a key chance to avoid a potential $3 billion loss, which may exert considerable pressure on the markets in the weeks ahead. The open interest in call (buy) options is $10.5 billion, while the open interest in put (sell) options is $6 billion. However, $7.6 billion worth of those calls are for prices of $92,000 or higher, requiring Bitcoin to rise 6.4% from its current value to become profitable before the March 28 expiry. This has greatly reduced the edge for bullish bets. Some analysts cite the ongoing global tariff war and the US government spending cuts that risk sending the economy into a recession as impacting Bitcoin’s price. Traders are concerned about slower growth—especially in the artificial intelligence space, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high on Feb. 19 only to dip 7%. The 40-day correlation has been above 70% since early March, but for the bulls, Bitcoin is still due for a decoupling from the stock market. This is driving optimism across the board, fueled by central banks expanding the monetary base and companies such as GameStop (GME), Rumble (RUM), Metaplanet (TYO:3350) and Semler Scientific (SMLR) adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

On the other hand, the upcoming ADA competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is attracting investors thanks to a 15,240% upside forecast. As the price of ADA ultimately depends on overall market conditions as well as adoption, the presale frenzy of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its well-structured tokenomics are leading expectations for gains in exponential growth. Currently in Phase 3 of its 11-stage presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $5,400,000 and over 7,200 holders. This phase comes in at $0.02 and is nearly full with over to 95% sold out, with Phase 4 trekking up to $0.025 in price, a 25% increase. A launch price of $0.06 will earn first movers a quick 200% profit as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is listed. And post-launch projections have greater upside potential, with some observers targeting a climb above $1. Cardano (ADA): Hopeful signs, but a long uphill battle ahead Analysts are split on the potential of Cardano (ADA) following its recent performance. Currently trading at $0.70, Cardano (ADA) would need to boom 1,300% to scale the heights of $10 — not everyone considers it a lofty aim. Advocates cite its strong fundamentals such as scalability and security as well as growing integrations with DeFi. But skeptics also believe Cardano (ADA) gradual development speed can prevent fast price appreciation around the project. In the meantime, Cardano (ADA) looks speculative with its upside, while its competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has a more evident growth path backed by solid use cases. While Cardano (ADA) is dependent on a general phase of market speculation, the lending model and corresponding buy-pressure mechanisms built into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generate demand through a snapshot process that leads to out-competition in terms of percentage profit gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Creates Excitement A similar initiative is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform. The token considers not only its short term goals but also its long-term stability. This fast-paced development of the presale reflects strong buyers confidence. With Phase 3 nears completion. Phase 4 will open with a 25% gain for all buyers at $0.02 with guaranteed 200% returns upon launch. MUTM tokenomics enable sustained growth past the first listing. Ongoing demand is created by the platform’s revenue-driven buybacks and staking rewards, reducing selling pressure. Analysts believe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may prop up to the round of $1 which will still give Phase 3 investors over 4,900% profits on investments. Mutuum Finance emphasizes on Security. Smart contract audit coming from one of the top Blockchain security experts in the industry CertiK. Once completed the results will be found on the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) official channels and will be published thereafter. Why Cardano (ADA) Can’t Compete with MUTM For Short-Term Gains Even though the long-term prospects of Cardano are undeniable, the road to $10 is nothing more than ‘a wishful thinking moment’ in the hands of the market gods. By contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a methodical, high-reward chance with clear milestones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale’s phased pricing model guarantees that early investors secure the bottom entry points, paving the way for maximum profit as the project moves forward. With the sale of Phase 3 almost complete, the opportunity to get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02 is rapidly running out of time. Now is the prime time to get involved with a 25% price increase for the next stage looming on the horizon and entry prices set to soar.
